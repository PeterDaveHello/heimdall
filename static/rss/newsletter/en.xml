<ul>
<li>Norway&#39;s significant drop in motor fuel sales is attributed to the high sales of electric vehicles (EVs), with over 90% of new vehicle purchases being electric.</li>
<li>The decrease in oil consumption illustrates a potential downfall for the oil industry as EV sales increase globally and could provide environmental benefits by dissuading oil companies from exploring new extraction techniques.</li>
<li>Proper oil pricing, as implemented in Norway, could encourage consumers towards more financially savvy and eco-friendly decisions, possibly leading the oil industry toward obsoleteness if the market continues to evolve organically.</li>

<ul>
<li>The key points discussed include the increase of electric vehicles (EVs) usage in Norway, leading to a decrease in motor fuel sales and gas station closures, potentially impacting the oil industry.</li>
<li>There were debates over affordable EVs, the availability and feasibility of EV charging stations, particularly in Manhattan and Brooklyn, achieving sustainable urban environments, and benefits of increasing housing density.</li>
<li>Topics such as the environmental effects of EVs, their recycling potential, comparison to combustion engines, and the role of subsidies and tax incentives in popularizing EVs in Norway are also discussed.</li>

<ul>
<li>Jabber.ru, an XMPP messaging service, fell victim to a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepted encrypted traffic for up to 6 months on hosting providers Hetzner and Linode in Germany.</li>
<li>Despite the protracted nature of the attack, no evidence of server breaches or spoofing attacks was found. However, rogue TLS certificates were exploited using Let&#39;s Encrypt to hijack connections.</li>
<li>The attack primarily affected connections to the XMPP service&#39;s STARTTLS port 5222. The interception was suspected to have been either lawfully done or as a result of an intrusion into the hosting providers&#39; networks.</li>
