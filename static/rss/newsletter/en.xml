<h2><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@danderson/111136144708450117">There&#39;s a mechanical watch feature called a “hack”</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The term &quot;hack&quot; as used in mechanical watches relates to a feature that halts the seconds hand when the time-setting function is in use.</li>
<li>This feature became prominent during WW2, allowing soldiers to synchronize their watches, and likely stemmed from &quot;hack watches,&quot; affordable versions synchronized with expensive ship chronometers for navigation.</li>
<li>Not all watch movements have this &quot;hack&quot; feature, which proves beneficial in maintaining time accuracy for short periods without relying on costly chronometers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37682912">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussions delve into various themes like the utility of the &quot;hack&quot; feature in mechanical watches and the precision and appeal of certain watch attributes.</li>
<li>Topics also include suggestions for watch restoration channels, the gratification of watching restoration videos, and origins of specific terms such as &quot;hack&quot; and &quot;hackneyed&quot; in relation to watch synchronization and its potential ties to Hackney Horse breed and place name &quot;Hackney&quot; in London.</li>
<li>There is also a comparison between the experience of using Mastodon, a decentralized social network, without a login and that of Twitter.</li>
