<h2><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/health/deaf-gene-therapy.html">Gene therapy enables 11-year-old boy to hear, opening doors for treatment of congenital deafness</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>An 11-year-old boy named Aissam Dam has become the first person in the United States to receive gene therapy for congenital deafness.</li>
<li>The gene therapy specifically targets a mutation in the otoferlin gene, which affects approximately 200,000 people globally.</li>
<li>Aissam&#39;s treatment was successful, granting him the ability to hear for the first time.</li>
<li>This study has the potential to pave the way for gene therapies for other forms of congenital deafness.</li>
<li>Researchers presented their data on this groundbreaking trial on February 3rd.</li>
<li>The therapy involves injecting new otoferlin genes into the delicate cochlea, which has proven to be a challenging process.</li>
<li>While cochlear implants have been the standard intervention for otoferlin deafness, they do not offer the same quality of sound as gene therapy.</li>
<li>The success of Aissam&#39;s treatment has allowed the study to expand to younger children.</li>
<li>If proven effective and safe, gene therapies for other genetic causes of deafness may gain increased interest.</li>
<li>However, finding suitable candidates for the therapy has been difficult due to skepticism within the Deaf community.</li>
