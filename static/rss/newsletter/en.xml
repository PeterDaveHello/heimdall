<li>Python packaging tools like distutils and setuptools have limitations, and Meson is used as a build tool. Building and packaging Fortran-based packages for Windows is particularly difficult.</li>
<li>A custom toolchain for SciPy on Windows was successfully built, and gratitude is expressed to the contributors.</li>
<li>Significant changes to LLVM setup should be approached cautiously due to the potential impact on other packages.</li>

<li>The findings could pave the way for understanding the body&#39;s reaction to the virus and mitigating chronic symptoms related to COVID-19. Future studies will delve into the duration and possible restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in long-COVID cases.</li>

<li>A study featuring Jonathan C. Schisler, PhD, of the UNC School of Medicine, elucidates how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the body&#39;s energy stores, leading to organ failure.</li>
<li>The research found that SARS-CoV-2 modifies mitochondria genetically, causing &quot;energy outages&quot; in vital organs by blocking specific genes that utilize oxygen to produce cellular energy, thereby preventing the replenishment of the body&#39;s energy reserves.</li>
<li>This discovery is crucial as it aids in understanding chronic COVID symptoms affecting the heart, immune system, and brain neurons. The ongoing focus of research includes the longevity of mitochondrial dysfunction in long-COVID cases and potential restoration methods.</li>

<ul>
<li>DC&#39;s attorney general sued 14 large landlord companies, alleging their use of a property management software, RealPage, led to collusion to keep rent prices elevated.</li>
<li>The software, using an algorithm, provides rental price suggestions. The lawsuit alleges these recommendations artificially inflated rents resulting in millions being overpaid by inhabitants relative to market rates.</li>
<li>The software is extensively used, with over 30% of multi-unit buildings and 60% of buildings with 50 or more units employing it. Both RealPage and the implicated companies have faced similar legal scrutiny in the past.</li>
