<h2><a href="https://theconversation.com/inert-ingredients-in-pesticides-may-be-more-toxic-to-bees-than-scientists-thought-218005">Inert Ingredients in Pesticides Could Pose Greater Threat to Bees</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Inert ingredients in pesticides, previously considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than thought, according to new research.</li>
<li>A study exposed honeybees to a fungicide containing both active and inert ingredients and found that the whole formulation impaired the bees&#39; memory, while active ingredients alone did not.</li>
<li>Inert ingredients have different functions and are regulated differently than active ingredients, making it hard to determine their toxicity. Comprehensive testing of pesticide formulations is needed to understand their impact on bee health. Changes to pesticide regulation could help protect bees by identifying inert ingredients on labels and requiring more testing on long-term effects.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cicadas-are-so-loud-fiber-optic-cables-can-hear-them/">Fiber optic cables &#39;hear&#39; loud cicadas, offer new insect monitoring method</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Scientists have found that fiber optic cables can pick up the sound of cicadas, leading to a potential new method for monitoring insect populations.</li>
<li>Using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), researchers can analyze the light bouncing back from a laser fired through the cables to detect disturbances caused by loud sounds or seismic activity.</li>
<li>This technique could allow entomologists to remotely monitor cicadas and collect data on their population sizes and locations, using the already abundant fiber optic cables. However, monitoring quieter insect species with DAS may be more challenging.</li>

<li>Fiber optic cables can be utilized as sensors to detect bends and gather information about them in applications like intrusion detection and vibration monitoring.</li>
<li>Optical time domain reflectometers (OTDRs) are commonly employed to measure reflections in fiber optic cables, but uncertain cable speed can affect the accuracy of these measurements.</li>
<li>Various factors, such as twist rates in the cables, can contribute to the uncertainty in cable speed and affect the accuracy of the sensing technology.</li>
