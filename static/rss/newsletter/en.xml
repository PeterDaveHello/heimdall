<h2><a href="https://theconversation.com/inert-ingredients-in-pesticides-may-be-more-toxic-to-bees-than-scientists-thought-218005">Inert Ingredients in Pesticides Could Pose Greater Threat to Bees</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Inert ingredients in pesticides, previously considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than thought, according to new research.</li>
<li>A study exposed honeybees to a fungicide containing both active and inert ingredients and found that the whole formulation impaired the bees&#39; memory, while active ingredients alone did not.</li>
<li>Inert ingredients have different functions and are regulated differently than active ingredients, making it hard to determine their toxicity. Comprehensive testing of pesticide formulations is needed to understand their impact on bee health.
