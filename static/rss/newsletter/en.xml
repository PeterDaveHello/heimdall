<h2><a href="https://pack.ac/note/pack">Pack: Next-gen container format for high-efficiency file compression</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Pack is a container format focused on efficiently packing files with high compression and modern hardware optimization, aiming for the best compression-to-time ratio.</li>
<li>It offers features like exploring and unpacking specific files or folders, emphasizing user privacy by not collecting personal data.</li>
<li>Pack is open-source, licensed under Apache 2.0, based on SQLite3 and Zstandard, with encryption, graphical interface, and platform support planned for the future.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39793805">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion introduces the new container format Pack, aiming to replace older formats such as tar and zip, emphasizing zstd compression, fast single file unpacking, and cross-compatibility.</li>
<li>Existing file formats like tar face limitations discussed for better data management, with SQLite proposed as a file and interchange format despite limitations and drawbacks noted by some users.</li>
<li>Overall, the conversation centers on enhancing complexity, compatibility, and performance of archive formats towards a more efficient and user-friendly format like Pack.</li>

<ul>
<li>Nearly 2,000 earthquakes were recorded off the coast of Vancouver Island in one day, hinting at the formation of new oceanic crust at the Endeavour site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge as the seafloor spreads apart.</li>
<li>The seismic activity is attributed to the stretching of the seafloor, enabling magma to ascend and generate fresh crust, offering valuable knowledge on ocean crust formation.</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring since 2011 allows researchers to closely study the phenomenon, shedding light on this natural process.</li>

<ul>
<li>Numerous small earthquakes were detected near hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the coast of Canada, part of a 20-year cycle with no immediate risk of a major event.</li>
<li>Debate surrounds the categorization of these earthquakes, as well as discussions on plate movement and tectonic associations.</li>
<li>Worries arise regarding ocean warming linked to diminished cloud cover caused by ship fuel emissions, impacting climate change and worldwide temperatures.</li>
