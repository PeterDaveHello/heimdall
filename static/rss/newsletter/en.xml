<ul>
<li>Former Eastern Municipal Water District worker, Gary Mund, is suing Syngenta, alleging that exposure to the herbicide paraquat caused his Parkinson&#39;s disease.</li>
<li>Paraquat is banned in 58 countries but still widely used in the US, raising concerns about its potential health risks.</li>
<li>Studies have indicated that paraquat can replicate the symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease in animals, although Syngenta disputes any causal connection. Advocacy groups like Earthjustice and the Michael J. Fox Foundation are calling for a ban on paraquat due to these potential risks.</li>
