<ul>
<li>Jabber.ru, an XMPP messaging service, fell victim to a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepted encrypted traffic for up to 6 months on hosting providers Hetzner and Linode in Germany.</li>
<li>Despite the protracted nature of the attack, no evidence of server breaches or spoofing attacks was found. However, rogue TLS certificates were exploited using Let&#39;s Encrypt to hijack connections.</li>
<li>The attack primarily affected connections to the XMPP service&#39;s STARTTLS port 5222. The interception was suspected to have been either lawfully done or as a result of an intrusion into the hosting providers&#39; networks.</li>
