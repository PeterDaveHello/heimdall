<li>The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) report shows a noticeable drop in entrepreneurship over the last 20 years, with 100,000 fewer entrepreneurs despite a growing population.</li>
<li>The BDC suggests the necessity of developing &quot;soft skills&quot; like marketing, finance, and leadership to tackle the challenges in initiating and operating a business.</li>
<li>Factors contributing to the decline include a decreasing demographic of potential founders, low unemployment with high wages, and several discouraging factors in the business milieu. Proposals for reversing the downwards trend include scholarships for entrepreneurship and engagement of older, experienced entrepreneurs.</li>

<li>Jabber.ru, an XMPP messaging service, fell victim to a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepted encrypted traffic for up to 6 months on hosting providers Hetzner and Linode in Germany.</li>
<li>Despite the protracted nature of the attack, no evidence of server breaches or spoofing attacks was found. However, rogue TLS certificates were exploited using Let&#39;s Encrypt to hijack connections.</li>
<li>The attack primarily affected connections to the XMPP service&#39;s STARTTLS port 5222. The interception was suspected to have been either lawfully done or as a result of an intrusion into the hosting providers&#39; networks.</li>

<li>It&#39;s speculated that Meta&#39;s AI system could have mistakenly linked Reuven&#39;s Python and Pandas courses with live animals, leading to the ban.</li>
<li>Despite appealing the decision, the ban&#39;s revocation appears improbable due to Meta&#39;s data retention policy. Reuven now intends to advertise his courses on other platforms and critiques Meta&#39;s dependence on AI for decisions without human oversight.</li>
