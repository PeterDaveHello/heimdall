<ul>
<li>A 60-year-old German man is likely the seventh person effectively cured of HIV following a stem cell transplant, which also treated his aggressive leukemia.</li>
<li>The patient, referred to as the &quot;next Berlin patient,&quot; stopped taking anti-retroviral drugs in late 2018 and remains HIV and cancer-free nearly six years later.</li>
<li>Researchers are cautiously optimistic, noting that this case suggests not all CCR5 gene mutations are necessary for successful HIV treatment, offering hope for broader HIV cure strategies.</li>

<li>A 60-year-old German man is likely the seventh person effectively cured of HIV, though the procedure is drastic and usually reserved for severe leukemia cases.</li>
<li>There is a suggestion to evolve this into an autologous stem cell transplant to avoid complications like graft-versus-host disease.</li>
