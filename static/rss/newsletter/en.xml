<ul>
<li>Traditional tools like sudo and doas use setuid binaries and privilege escalation, which have limitations in restricted user namespaces and require the entire user session to retain capabilities.</li>
<li>An alternative approach using s6-sudod splits the program into a privileged server and an unprivileged client, aiming to run commands as root without privilege escalation.</li>
<li>The author experimented with using local SSH for root command execution, configuring a dedicated SSH key, binding sshd to a Unix domain socket, and using ProxyUseFdpass to handle socket file descriptors, enhancing security and supporting various authentication methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40763117">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Using SSH as a sudo replacement introduces complexity by requiring root binaries to communicate via UNIX sockets and asymmetric cryptography.</li>
<li>Restricting sudo access to the wheel group and ensuring only authorized users can read or execute it can provide similar security with less complexity.</li>
<li>Tools like etckeeper, Ansible, and Chezmoi can help manage and track configuration changes effectively, offering alternatives to traditional sudo usage.</li>

<li>Django SQLite Production Config has a significant issue with SQLite in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode, where the WAL file can grow excessively under high load, potentially causing system failure.</li>
<li>A workaround involves running a separate thread to monitor the WAL size and slow down reads and writes if it exceeds 8 MB, but this suggests SQLite in WAL mode may not be suitable for production environments.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL is recommended for most small to medium projects due to its better handling of high-volume transactions and fewer limitations compared to SQLite.</li>
