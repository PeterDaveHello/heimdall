<li>The PDS has undergone refactoring to implement a single-tenant SQLite datastore, where each user possesses a unique SQLite file for storing repository and private account data.</li>
<li>The ActorStore has been incorporated for user data interaction, replacing previous services, and utilizes various classes to perform read and write operations.</li>
<li>The architecture now includes three separate SQLite databases for managing service state, with mandatory &#39;transactions&#39; for store changes. The PDS will be distributed with Litestream enabling concurrent reads and streaming replication.</li>
