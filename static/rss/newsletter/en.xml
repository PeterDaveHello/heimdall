<h2><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16093">Large Language Models Lack Deep Insights or a Theory of Mind</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Vision-based large language models show proficiency in processing and interpreting visual data.</li>
<li>However, they still lag behind human capabilities in intuitive physics, causal reasoning, and intuitive psychology.</li>
<li>These models have a basic understanding of physical laws and causal relationships but lack deeper insights and fail in tasks requiring an intuitive theory of mind.</li>
<li>The study highlights the importance of integrating more robust mechanisms for understanding causality, physical dynamics, and social cognition into language models.</li>
