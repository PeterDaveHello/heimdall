<li>Scott Aaronson&#39;s blog post clarifies common misconceptions in theoretical computer science, particularly the difference between computability and complexity.</li>
<li>He uses examples, such as a function determining God&#39;s existence, to illustrate that computability pertains to functions, not individual questions, and addresses misunderstandings about the P vs. NP problem.</li>
<li>Aaronson explains that computability concerns the existence of a program to map inputs to outputs, not the difficulty of creating that program, and discusses the Busy Beaver function to highlight uncomputable versus computable values.</li>

<li>Theoretical computer science often deals with concepts involving infinity, making them unintuitive, such as the Kolmogorov complexity and the halting problem.</li>
<li>The P=NP problem remains a philosophical debate, with some comparing its complexity to the continuum hypothesis (CH).</li>
<li>The distinction between computability and provability is emphasized, showing that a function can be computable even if its exact implementation is currently undetermined.</li>

<h2><a href="https://conduition.io/coding/ticketmaster/">Reverse Engineering Ticketmaster&#39;s Rotating Barcodes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>TicketMaster&#39;s SafeTix system uses rotating barcodes displayed in a mobile app, complicating the ticketing process and preventing easy printing or screenshots.</li>
<li>Issues arise when there&#39;s no internet connection at the venue, making it difficult to load the barcode, and the system aims to reduce ticket resale and gather user data.</li>
<li>Reverse engineering reveals that the barcodes use PDF417 format with a bearer token and two TOTPs, which can be extracted using Chrome DevTools, allowing offline saving of tickets up to 20 hours before the event.</li>

<ul>
<li>The post discusses the reverse engineering of Ticketmaster&#39;s rotating barcodes, highlighting the potential for scam-free third-party ticket resale if Ticketmaster and AXS documented their QR code cryptography and exposed apps/APIs for verification.</li>
<li>The conversation critiques Ticketmaster&#39;s monopoly on ticket resale, suggesting that their reluctance to support third-party verification benefits their control over the market.</li>
<li>The debate extends to ethical considerations for developers and companies, with some arguing that societal structures and government failures contribute to monopolistic practices, rather than the developers themselves.</li>

<ul>
<li>Boeing will plead guilty to a conspiracy fraud charge related to the 737 Max crashes, agreeing to pay a $243.6 million fine and install a third-party compliance monitor.</li>
<li>The deal, which avoids a trial, requires federal judge approval and could impact Boeing&#39;s ability to sell to the U.S. government.</li>
<li>Boeing must also invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs and have its board meet with crash victims&#39; families.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/what-are-italian-herbs">Why Italy Fell Out of Love with Cilantro</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Coriander, once a staple in ancient Roman cuisine, has nearly disappeared from modern Italian cooking, especially its leaves.</li>
<li>The decline began post-Rome, influenced by Germanic tribes and the preference for exotic spices like cinnamon and cardamom.</li>
<li>Despite its historical presence, coriander is now viewed as a foreign ingredient in Italy, unlike other herbs such as basil.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40895441">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Italy&#39;s dislike for cilantro dates back to 1544 when botanist Pietro Andrea Mattioli described its leaves as smelling like bed bugs.</li>
<li>The aversion may be genetically influenced, as some people perceive cilantro as tasting like soap due to a specific gene.</li>
<li>The decline in cilantro&#39;s popularity in Italy is also linked to changing culinary trends and migration patterns, illustrating the complex interplay between genetics, culture, and personal preference in shaping food tastes.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.firezone.dev/blog/sans-io">Sans-IO: The secret to effective Rust for network services</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Firezone uses Rust and a sans-IO design for its core connectivity library, connlib, to manage network connections and WireGuard tunnels, offering fast tests, deep customization, and high assurance.</li>
<li>The sans-IO design separates policy from implementation using abstractions like <code>Transmit</code>, allowing pure state machines to handle network protocols without direct IO, making the code more flexible and easier to test.</li>
<li>While sans-IO requires custom event loops and state machines, it provides significant benefits such as easy composition, flexible APIs, and improved error handling, despite not being widely adopted in the Rust community yet.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40872020">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The post discusses the concept of Sans-IO in Rust, which separates input/output (IO) operations from the main logic, making code more testable and composable.</li>
<li>This approach is particularly beneficial for packet-oriented use cases like QUIC, WebRTC, and IP, where state management can become complex.</li>
<li>The discussion highlights that while this method isn&#39;t new, it offers significant advantages in Rust by simplifying testing and avoiding the pitfalls of traditional async/await patterns.</li>
