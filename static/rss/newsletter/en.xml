<ul>
<li>Django SQLite Production Config has a significant issue with SQLite in WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode, where the WAL file can grow excessively under high load, potentially causing system failure.</li>
<li>A workaround involves running a separate thread to monitor the WAL size and slow down reads and writes if it exceeds 8 MB, but this suggests SQLite in WAL mode may not be suitable for production environments.</li>
<li>PostgreSQL is recommended for most small to medium projects due to its better handling of high-volume transactions and fewer limitations compared to SQLite.</li>

<h2><a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20240607042157">OpenSSH Adds New Features to Penalize Repeated Failed Authentication Attempts</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>On June 6, 2024, Damien Miller introduced two new configuration options for OpenBSD&#39;s sshd(8): PerSourcePenalties and PerSourcePenaltyExemptList.</li>
<li>These options aim to penalize undesirable client behaviors, such as repeated failed authentication attempts or actions causing sshd crashes, by temporarily blocking offending IP addresses.</li>
<li>PerSourcePenalties will be enabled by default in the upcoming OpenBSD 7.6 release, and administrators are advised to configure these settings carefully to avoid blocking legitimate traffic, especially when handling connections from behind NATs or proxies.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40610621">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The debate focuses on new OpenSSH options designed to penalize undesirable behavior, with concerns about their fairness and effectiveness, especially with IPv6.</li>
<li>There is a consensus that SSH keys are more secure and convenient than passwords, with discussions on SSH certificates, key management, and alternatives like PKCS#11 and VPNs for enhanced security.</li>
<li>The conversation also touches on OpenBSD&#39;s philosophy of minimizing code complexity for security, contrasting with OpenSSH&#39;s configurability, and the potential impact of removing password authentication.</li>

<ul>
<li>CPU Energy Meter is a Linux tool designed to monitor Intel CPU power consumption using the RAPL feature, available from the Sandy Bridge generation onwards.</li>
<li>Developed by LMU Munich, it tracks power usage across various domains (CPU package, core, uncore, memory, and platform) with negligible overhead and is licensed under BSD-3-Clause.</li>
<li>Installation is simple via a PPA for Debian/Ubuntu or from a .deb package on GitHub, and it can run without root access by setting appropriate permissions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40604596">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion highlights tools and methods for measuring energy consumption of Intel and AMD CPUs, including &quot;CPU Energy Meter,&quot; Intel&#39;s RAPL interface, <code>perf</code>, <code>turbostat</code>, and AMD&#39;s uProf.</li>
<li>AMD&#39;s energy measurement feature was removed from the Linux Kernel (version 5.13) due to security concerns, with alternatives like Astron&#39;s Power Measurement Toolkit recommended.</li>
<li>The conversation also addresses the accuracy of Intel&#39;s energy measurements, challenges in whole-system power measurement, and issues with CPU throttling due to the PROCHOT condition, offering mitigation suggestions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Marc Brooker, an AWS engineer, discusses the complexities of multi-threaded programming in a blog post, using a birthday paradox simulation as a case study.</li>
<li>He found that multi-threading made the simulation slower due to context switches and L1 cache misses, identified using Linux&#39;s perf tool.</li>
<li>Switching to a reentrant random number generator (<code>random_r</code>) improved performance, illustrating that multi-threaded programs can sometimes be less efficient than single-threaded ones.</li>

<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40603625">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The discussion highlights the inefficiencies and complexities of using threads in programming, especially with global shared states like <code>random()</code>, and the limitations of standard libraries like libc in multi-threaded environments.</li>
<li>Participants suggest custom libc replacements, better abstractions to manage side effects, and explore the benefits and challenges of functional programming and OS-level security measures.</li>
<li>Emphasis is placed on the importance of deterministic behavior in multi-threaded random number generators (RNGs), the use of thread-local states, and the debate over global versus independent pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs).</li>
