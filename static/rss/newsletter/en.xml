<ul>
<li>Employees who log off at the end of the workday are 20% more productive than those who continue working after hours, according to a survey conducted by Slack&#39;s Workforce Index.</li>
<li>Taking breaks during the workday is crucial for productivity and well-being, yet half of desk workers rarely or never take breaks.</li>
<li>The study suggests that around four hours of focused work time is ideal, and spending more than two hours in meetings is considered excessive. Additionally, the late afternoon (3-6pm) is the least productive time for work.</li>

<ul>
<li>Ratatui is a lightweight library in Rust for creating terminal user interfaces (TUIs) and is a fork of the tui-rs crate for ongoing development.</li>
<li>It uses immediate rendering with intermediate buffers and requires terminal initialization and restoration.</li>
<li>Ratatui supports multiple backends, such as Crossterm, Termion, and Termwiz, and offers features for UI drawing, event handling, layout creation, text styling, and various built-in widgets. It has an active community with a Discord server and a GitHub workflow for contributions.</li>

<h2><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9330/">Improving Internet Performance: Introducing L4S Architecture for Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>RFC 9330 introduces the L4S architecture, which aims to enhance internet applications by reducing queuing delay and enabling low latency and scalable throughput.</li>
<li>The L4S architecture proposes new congestion control mechanisms that work alongside existing controls and use a modified version of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).</li>
<li>The goal is to provide a high-quality internet service with improved performance for interactive applications, such as gaming, streaming, and video conferencing.</li>
<li>The architecture can be incrementally deployed and is compatible with different network types.</li>
<li>The text includes discussions on deployment considerations, traffic policing, and security considerations.</li>
<li>It emphasizes the importance of accurate ECN feedback and scalability in congestion control algorithms.</li>
<li>The document provides references to additional resources on congestion control, network protocols, and differentiated services.</li>

<h2><a href="https://theconversation.com/inert-ingredients-in-pesticides-may-be-more-toxic-to-bees-than-scientists-thought-218005">Inert Ingredients in Pesticides Could Pose Greater Threat to Bees</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Inert ingredients in pesticides, previously considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than thought, according to new research.</li>
<li>A study exposed honeybees to a fungicide containing both active and inert ingredients and found that the whole formulation impaired the bees&#39; memory, while active ingredients alone did not.</li>
<li>Inert ingredients have different functions and are regulated differently than active ingredients, making it hard to determine their toxicity. Comprehensive testing of pesticide formulations is needed to understand their impact on bee health. Changes to pesticide regulation could help protect bees by identifying inert ingredients on labels and requiring more testing on long-term effects.</li>
