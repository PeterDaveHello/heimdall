<li>A team of researchers, including Jonathan C. Schisler, have discovered the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the body&#39;s energy storage, potentially leading to organ failure.</li>
<li>The study reveals that the virus alters the mitochondria at a genetic level, inhibiting specific genes that utilize oxygen to create cellular energy, causing what they describe as &quot;energy outages&quot; which can lead to cell death and inflammation.</li>
<li>The findings could pave the way for understanding the body&#39;s reaction to the virus and mitigating chronic symptoms related to COVID-19. Future studies will delve into the duration and possible restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in long-COVID cases.</li>

<li>A study featuring Jonathan C. Schisler, PhD, of the UNC School of Medicine, elucidates how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts the body&#39;s energy stores, leading to organ failure.</li>
<li>The research found that SARS-CoV-2 modifies mitochondria genetically, causing &quot;energy outages&quot; in vital organs by blocking specific genes that utilize oxygen to produce cellular energy, thereby preventing the replenishment of the body&#39;s energy reserves.</li>
<li>This discovery is crucial as it aids in understanding chronic COVID symptoms affecting the heart, immune system, and brain neurons. The ongoing focus of research includes the longevity of mitochondrial dysfunction in long-COVID cases and potential restoration methods.</li>

<ul>
<li>The UK government&#39;s Online Safety Act is now law, intending to safeguard individuals, notably children, on the internet.</li>
<li>Critics, however, argue that the act is inefficient in counteracting misinformation, infringes on privacy, and hands over extensive control to private companies. It may even compromise encryption by necessitating a scan of users&#39; messages.</li>
<li>The act&#39;s similarity to the Investigatory Powers Act has led some companies to contemplate exiting the UK. Meanwhile, the EU commissioner&#39;s threats against Elon Musk and his company are perceived as hollow by critics.</li>

<ul>
<li>The UK&#39;s Online Safety Act has prompted debates revolving around privacy, data protection, freedom of information, and effectiveness of age verification methods.</li>
<li>Critics assert that the legislation could result in communication charges based on false information and uneven legal defence; some even contemplate blocking UK visitors to their websites as a form of protest.</li>
<li>The law initiated broader discussions about dealing with online misinformation and its repercussions on freedom of expression; a periphery debate also emerged involving urban planning, public transportation, and authoritarianism.</li>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/discussions/6826">The Windows installer of ImageMagick will no longer be signed</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The Windows installer of ImageMagick will not be signed anymore due to the expiration of their code signing certificate, which they can&#39;t export and use in GitHub actions anymore.</li>
<li>The team is currently contemplating a cloud solution, with Digicert as the only option at present, charging $629 for a single year.</li>
<li>While they&#39;re inviting sponsorships for obtaining a code signing certificate, some users have suggested alternatives like SignPath and Azure KeyVault.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38055816">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The dialogue centers around the struggles open-source projects face in acquiring and renewing code signing certificates for their software, with criticisms on its high costs and inefficiencies.</li>
<li>Discussions on financial sustainability, the requirement for improved funding and security systems, and alternative solutions like Azure Key Vault, a cloud service for securely storing and accessing cryptographic keys, are also prevalent.</li>
<li>Emphasis is laid on the significance of identity verification, trust in code, and concerns around proprietary software and self-signed certificates. The worth and weaknesses of ImageMagick, an open-source software suite for image editing, are also noted.</li>
