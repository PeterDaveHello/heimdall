<li>Interval arithmetic addresses measurement inaccuracies by representing values as ranges, providing bounds for the correct number rather than a single imprecise floating point value.</li>
<li>While interval arithmetic can offer more accurate results, it can also lead to overly large boundaries, making it less practical, as noted by William Kahan, the creator of the IEEE-754 standard.</li>
<li>John Gustafson&#39;s universal numbers are a recent development in this field, though it&#39;s uncertain if his posit version incorporates intervals; his rivalry with Kahan adds an interesting dynamic to the discussion.</li>

<ul>
<li>Interval arithmetic is used in a graphing calculator to handle formulas without solving for y, by rearranging equations and calculating result intervals for x and y ranges.</li>
<li>The method involves recursively dividing ranges and performing binary searches to find tiny intervals with solutions, which are then drawn as points on the graph.</li>
<li>This approach is highlighted for its application in various fields, including index analysis in databases like ClickHouse, and its potential for rigorous numerical computations.</li>

<ul>
<li>Traditional tools like sudo and doas use setuid binaries and privilege escalation, which have limitations in restricted user namespaces and require the entire user session to retain capabilities.</li>
<li>An alternative approach using s6-sudod splits the program into a privileged server and an unprivileged client, aiming to run commands as root without privilege escalation.</li>
<li>The author experimented with using local SSH for root command execution, configuring a dedicated SSH key, binding sshd to a Unix domain socket, and using ProxyUseFdpass to handle socket file descriptors, enhancing security and supporting various authentication methods.</li>

<h2><a href="https://quic.video/blog/never-use-datagrams/">Never* Use Datagrams</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>When building internet applications, TCP is preferred for reliable delivery, while UDP is used for timeliness, especially in live video protocols.</li>
<li>Using UDP directly is risky due to the need for implementing features like retransmissions and congestion control; instead, developers should use a QUIC library.</li>
<li>QUIC and Media over QUIC (MoQ) support datagrams, but developers are advised to focus on using QUIC streams to avoid pitfalls associated with datagrams.</li>

<h2><a href="https://borischerny.com/javascript,/typescript/2024/06/19/ES-Modules-Are-A-Mess.html">NPM and NodeJS should do more to make ES Modules easy to use</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Boris Cherny&#39;s blog highlights the difficulties of using ES Modules in NodeJS and NPM, especially for those returning from other languages like Python and Hack.</li>
<li>Despite ES Modules being introduced to improve code load times, their adoption is low, with only 9-27% of projects using them and less than 6% of files declaring them via specific extensions.</li>
<li>Cherny proposes simplifying the ecosystem by eliminating .mjs and .cjs extensions, making type=module the default in package.json, upgrading libraries to ES Modules, and eventually phasing out require and module.exports in NodeJS.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40737508">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>NPM and NodeJS are encouraged to simplify the usage of ES Modules to ease adoption without requiring extensive refactoring.</li>
<li>Node.js 22 supports ES modules with the <code>--experimental-require-module</code> flag, but the transition remains challenging for many projects.</li>
<li>Users propose solutions like <code>importSync()</code> to bridge the gap between CommonJS and ES modules, sparking ongoing debates on the best approach to modernize the ecosystem.</li>

<ul>
<li>Research by Yuxiang Yang and colleagues reveals vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks, specifically in router NAT (Network Address Translation) handling, allowing off-path TCP hijacking.</li>
<li>The study, accepted by NDSS 2024, tested 67 routers from 30 manufacturers, finding 52 vulnerable, and identified 75 out of 93 real-world Wi-Fi networks as susceptible.</li>
<li>Mitigation strategies include random port allocation, reverse path validation, and TCP window checking, with some manufacturers already releasing patches in response to the findings.</li>

<li>A whitepaper on CVE-2022-32296 reveals an off-path TCP hijacking vulnerability in NAT-enabled Wi-Fi networks, which was fixed in Linux 5.17.9.</li>
<li>Mitigations include enabling rp_filter, using HTTPS in Firefox, random NAT port allocation, reverse path validation, and TCP window checking.</li>
<li>The discussion emphasizes the vulnerability&#39;s impact on routers, the role of NAT, and the importance of encryption methods like IPSec or TLS, with some suggesting a migration to IPv6 to avoid many-to-one NAT issues.</li>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/niedev/RTranslator">I made an open source and local translation app</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A developer created a simultaneous translation app for Android, initially using Google&#39;s API due to the lack of free, high-quality solutions.</li>
<li>After university, the developer updated the app to use OpenAI&#39;s Whisper for speech recognition and Meta&#39;s NLLB for translation, both running locally, making it free and open-source.</li>
<li>The app is currently in beta, and the developer is seeking user feedback.</li>
