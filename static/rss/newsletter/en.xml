<ul>
<li>Researchers from the University of Chicago&#39;s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering have created an &#39;inverse vaccine&#39; to potentially cure autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes.</li>
<li>Contrary to traditional vaccines that train the immune system to identify and combat viruses or bacteria, this new vaccine eliminates the immune system&#39;s recognition of a specific molecule, avoiding autoimmune reactions.</li>
<li>The &#39;inverse vaccine&#39; uses the liver&#39;s process to flag molecules from deteriorating cells with &#39;do not attack&#39; labels. Preliminary lab tests show the vaccine effectively reversed multiple sclerosis-related autoimmune reactions, and safety trials have already commenced.</li>
