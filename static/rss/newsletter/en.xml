<li>The US once commissioned paintings of every known fruit, similar to John James Audubon&#39;s bird paintings, both of which are valuable collector&#39;s items today.</li>
<li>There is ongoing debate about historical figures like Audubon, notably their links to contentious issues such as slavery, and whether honors and monuments tied to them should be preserved or dismantled.</li>
<li>The digitization of historic works, despite being costly, is considered beneficial as it enables preservation, wider access, and potential for profit via sale of high-resolution access.</li>

<ul>
<li>DC&#39;s attorney general sued 14 large landlord companies, alleging their use of a property management software, RealPage, led to collusion to keep rent prices elevated.</li>
<li>The software, using an algorithm, provides rental price suggestions. The lawsuit alleges these recommendations artificially inflated rents resulting in millions being overpaid by inhabitants relative to market rates.</li>
<li>The software is extensively used, with over 30% of multi-unit buildings and 60% of buildings with 50 or more units employing it. Both RealPage and the implicated companies have faced similar legal scrutiny in the past.</li>

<li>New features include auto-fill for German HTML fields, an improved connection workflow to self-hosted servers, SQLite DB support for self-hosted deployments, Apple Watch support, and integrations with DuckDuckGo and Fastmail.</li>
<li>Bitwarden has also introduced a Provider Portal for Managed Service Providers (MSPs), extended its FIDO support, and will no longer support Windows versions 8.1 or older, and Windows Server 2012 or older from the 2023.5.0 release.</li>

<li>Password management service, Bitwarden, has recently rolled out support for passkeys, inciting varying opinions from users.</li>
<li>Key concerns surround the lack of user control over security as Bitwarden does not currently support the import and export of stored passkeys, alongside arguments about the definition of passwords and the lack of standardization for WebAuthn credentials.</li>
<li>Critics question the security of hoarding multiple passkeys for the same account within a single Bitwarden vault and debate over the comparison with other password managers in terms of user interface, functionality, and safety features.</li>

<h2><a href="https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2023/11/01/cpp23-garbage-collection">C++23: Removing garbage collection support</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>C++23 intends to entirely eliminate support for garbage collection, a feature that has been mostly unimplemented and not supported.</li>
<li>This decision is seen as a positive measure to declutter the language, and will result in the removal of specific names like declare_reachable, undeclare_reachable, etc. from the std:: library.</li>
<li>Despite these changes, existing garbage collectors, mainly those for machines programmed in C++ and operating other languages, will not be impacted as they did not rely on this standard.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38097984">Reactions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The upcoming C++23 standard may no longer support garbage collection, causing differing opinions about the requirement of automatic memory management in the developer community.</li>
<li>The debate extended to the complexity of C++, its unforeseen coding behaviours, and potential consequences of eliminating excessive features, with language barriers making it difficult for non-English speaking participants.</li>
<li>Comparisons were made between C++ and Rust, suggesting Rust could serve as an alternative for tasks typically performed by C++, amplifying the importance of comprehending diverse system functions.</li>

<h2><a href="https://authory.com/blog/how-ai-detectors-are-destroying-livelihoods">The false positive rate of AI detectors and its effect on freelance writers</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Freelance writer Michael Berben&#39;s articles were incorrectly marked as AI-generated by an AI detector, which led to the cancellation of his contract and income loss.</li>
<li>Berben&#39;s case underscores the inaccuracy of AI detectors and their tendency to generate false positives.</li>
<li>Despite presenting proof of original work, the client did not rescind their decision due to concerns about Google penalties for AI-generated content, bringing into question AI detectors&#39; advertised precision and the challenges creators face in defending against such claims.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Growing use of AI in content generation has sparked discussions about its impact, focusing on distinguishing AI-generated and human-authored text. False positives of AI detection tools could potentially affect freelance writers&#39; work.</li>
<li>Companies like OpenAI and Google suspectively keep their detection methods a secret, fueling a potential tech &#39;arms race&#39;. This secrecy also leads to debates on AI&#39;s role in education and redefining job roles.</li>
<li>Suggested solutions include the utilization of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) as certificates authenticating human-authored content. However, concerns persist around over-automation of creative professions, potential misuse of AI detectors, and defamation claims against writers.</li>

<li>The AI-driven chat application Dot, has captured attention due to its claim of self-programming and deep understanding of users, although there are privacy and data hacking concerns.</li>
<li>The potential release of a new app, Mei, which could heavily use cloud services has also been discussed, despite privacy worries it shares with Dot. Mei is designed to be a personal AI memory assistant.</li>
<li>A significant announcement is the partnership of Dot with Salesforce. There is also concern about Dot and Mei possibly being outshone by larger corporations like Apple.</li>
