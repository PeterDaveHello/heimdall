        <title>Postgres Language Server</title>
        <link>https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp</link>
        <description
      >This language server is designed for PostgreSQL and adds features like auto-complete and go-to-definition to code editors. It uses the actual PostgreSQL parser via libg_query, providing developers with more confidence and the ability to keep up with the rapid development of PostgreSQL. It is in early development but is open for contributions from the community, with credit given to pganalyze and psteinroe for their work on libpg_query and the language server.</description>

        <title>Replace peer review with “peer replication” (2021)</title>
        <link>https://blog.everydayscientist.com/replace-peer-review-with-peer-replication/</link>
        <description
      >The author criticizes the current peer review process in scientific publishing as flawed and proposes a new approach called &quot;peer replication.&quot; The proposed system would involve sending preprints to other labs for replication before acceptance and publication. The author suggests that this approach would encourage replication and enhance scientific integrity but acknowledges challenges such as increased time and judgment calls when replications fail. They suggest starting with a trial conducted by an organization like Review Commons.</description>

        <title>Electron band structure in germanium, my ass (2000)</title>
        <link>https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~kovar/hall.html</link>
        <description
      >The author criticizes the existing understanding of electron band structure in germanium and challenges the expected exponential relationship between resistivity and temperature. The experimental results obtained by the author do not align with the predicted behavior, leading to frustration and questioning the pursuit of physics. The difficulties encountered during the experiment contribute to the author&apos;s conclusion that their decision to study physics was a mistake.</description>

        <description
      >Google is currently facing an antitrust trial where the government argues that it holds a monopoly on general search and search advertising with a market share of 90-95&#37;. The outcome of this trial could have significant implications for competition in the tech industry. Google claims that its monopoly is legal as consumers prefer its search engine, but critics argue that the quality of its search engine has declined. The trial is expected to last for two months and Google is also facing other antitrust cases related to its app store monopoly and monopolization of online advertising software. The article highlights the relevance of past actions by YouTube and the influence of AT&amp;T in the rise of new providers and start-ups.</description>
