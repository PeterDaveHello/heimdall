            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Adding a specific phrase at the top of the response to ChatGPT 3.5 consistently triggers an error message.</li>
<li>This error does not occur with GPT-4 or when using the GPT-3.5 API.</li>
<li>The error is likely caused by the tokenization process used in OpenAI&#39;s GPT models.</li>
<li>The specific phrase is a misspelled option name found in XML configuration files for Katalon Studio software.</li>
<li>The dataset used to train GPT-3.5 may have excluded XML files, leading the model to be unaware of the misspelled token and producing invalid responses.</li>
<li>This discovery raises concerns about potential data poisoning and undermining the summarization capabilities of GPT-3.5.</li>

<li>Google has updated its disclaimer for Incognito mode to make it clear that user data is still collected, despite claims of privacy.</li>
<li>The updated disclaimer states that while others using the same device won&#39;t see the user&#39;s activity, data will still be collected by the websites visited and the services used, including Google itself.</li>
<li>This confirms suspicions that Google tracks user activities even when they are in Incognito mode, so users are advised to be cautious when using it.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A recent study conducted at Apache Lake in Arizona has discovered that buffalofish, a type of freshwater fish, can live for over 100 years and have strong immune systems and stress responses as they age.</li>
<li>Previously, it was believed that buffalofish only lived until their mid-20s.</li>
<li>The findings suggest that further research on buffalofish longevity could provide insights into extending the lifespan of vertebrates, including humans. Additionally, the study highlights the need for conservation efforts as buffalofish populations are declining and there are currently no regulations on their harvest.</li>

<li>Fujitsu has acknowledged that software bugs in its Horizon system, used by the UK Post Office, were present from the start, resulting in the wrongful prosecution of over 900 postal workers.</li>
<li>The bugs were deliberately concealed from the wrongly accused individuals&#39; lawyers, and witness statements were altered by the Post Office to give the appearance that the system was functioning correctly.</li>
<li>Approximately 93 convictions have been overturned, and there are still pending compensation settlements. The scandal may prompt changes in the system that permits private corporations to prosecute individuals. Fujitsu has apologized and committed to assisting in compensating the victims, while the UK government plans to introduce a new law to swiftly exonerate and provide compensation for those falsely convicted.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Timothy Barker is seeking to clear his name after being falsely charged with orchestrating a complex e-commerce scam known as &quot;triangulation fraud.&quot;</li>
<li>Triangulation fraud involves a consumer purchasing an item online, the seller using stolen payment card data to purchase the same item from an online retailer, and the only party left to dispute the transaction is the owner of the stolen card.</li>
<li>Barker claims to have purchased items for his community using his own payment card from a seller on Amazon, but later received accusations from an Ontario woman of hacking her Walmart account.</li>
<li>Barker was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, lost his job, and now has a criminal record that is affecting his employment prospects.</li>
<li>Barker believes both he and the Ontario woman are victims of triangulation fraud, with someone hacking her account and adding Barker&#39;s name and address as a recipient.</li>
<li>Despite providing evidence, Barker&#39;s charges were stayed, leaving him unable to clear his name.</li>

<li>AlphaFold, a protein-structure prediction tool, has identified hundreds of thousands of potential psychedelic molecules that could be used in the development of new antidepressants.</li>
<li>Recent studies have shown that AlphaFold predictions are valuable for drug discovery, but relying solely on predicted structures has limitations, and more detailed experimental models are often required.</li>
<li>Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind, is utilizing AlphaFold in their drug discovery efforts and has secured deals with pharmaceutical companies, indicating the potential of tools like AlphaFold to greatly assist in the search for new drugs.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Apple has revised its U.S. iOS App Store policies, permitting developers to guide users to non-App Store purchasing options for digital goods.</li>
<li>Apple will continue to receive a commission ranging from 12 to 27 percent on purchases made through these alternative channels.</li>
<li>Developers must request a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement and follow specific guidelines.</li>
<li>The modifications arise from Apple&#39;s legal dispute with Epic Games and the court&#39;s ruling to allow developers to inform customers about in-app purchase alternatives.</li>
<li>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney has voiced disappointment with Apple&#39;s amendments and intends to challenge them legally.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The number 6174, known as Kaprekar&#39;s constant, is named after mathematician D.R. Kaprekar.</li>
<li>It follows a specific rule where any four-digit number with at least two different digits is arranged in descending and ascending order, the smaller number is subtracted from the bigger number, and the process is repeated.</li>
<li>This routine always reaches the fixed point of 6174 in a maximum of 7 iterations, except for repdigits like 1111. The number 6174 also has other mathematical properties, such as being a 7-smooth number and a sum of the first three powers of 18.</li>

<li>The wealth of the world&#39;s top five billionaires has more than doubled since 2020, while the poorest 60% of the global population have lost money.</li>
<li>The report by Oxfam highlights the widening wealth gap and predicts the possible emergence of a trillionaire in the next decade.</li>
<li>The combined wealth of the top five billionaires has increased by $464 billion, while the total wealth of the poorest 4.77 billion people has declined by 0.2%.</li>
<li>Oxfam proposes a wealth tax of 1% to 2% on wealth above £10 million as a solution to address the wealth imbalance, which could raise £22 billion per year for the UK.</li>

<li>The author faces challenges in reverse engineering the Wi-Fi stack for the ESP32 microcontroller due to the high volume of Wi-Fi packets in the surrounding air.</li>
<li>Traditional methods, such as using a paint tin, ferrite chokes, and a turned-off microwave as a Faraday cage, prove ineffective in blocking outside packets.</li>
<li>The author discovers a research paper outlining an affordable Faraday cage made from conductive fabric and commonly available materials.</li>
<li>To reduce costs, the author plans to build the Faraday cage using wood cabinets and a lead-acid battery.</li>
<li>The constructed Faraday cage successfully blocks RF signals, allowing for more accurate analysis of the Wi-Fi stack.</li>
<li>The summary includes information on signal attenuation, a bill of materials, and detailed instructions for building the Faraday cage.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Alexander Barvinok, a mathematics professor, resigned from the American Mathematical Society (AMS) over their failure to oppose the requirement for job applicants to submit diversity statements.</li>
<li>Barvinok sees coerced statements, regardless of their content, as a form of compelled speech and believes it corrupts everyone involved.</li>
<li>Barvinok&#39;s opposition to diversity statements is influenced by his experiences growing up in the Soviet Union, emphasizing the importance of academics speaking out against campus orthodoxy and protecting academic freedom.</li>
</ul>
