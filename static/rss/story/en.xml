<li>Recent large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly used in academic writing, despite limitations such as producing inaccurate information and reinforcing biases.</li>
<li>Analysis of 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024 reveals that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs, with some sub-corpora reaching up to 30%.</li>
<li>The impact of LLM-based writing assistants on scientific literature is unprecedented, surpassing major events like the Covid pandemic in terms of influence.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Allan McDonald, who passed away at 83, was a pivotal figure in the Challenger space shuttle disaster, known for refusing to approve the launch due to safety concerns.</li>
<li>After the disaster, McDonald exposed NASA&#39;s cover-up, revealing that engineers had opposed the launch due to freezing temperatures affecting the O-rings, leading to his temporary demotion.</li>
<li>McDonald later led the redesign of the booster rockets, co-authored a definitive account of the disaster, and became an advocate for ethical decision-making in engineering.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>MeshAnything introduces a novel method for generating Artist-Created Meshes (AMs) from 3D representations using autoregressive transformers, enhancing 3D asset production efficiency and precision.</li>
<li>The approach significantly reduces the number of mesh faces, improving storage, rendering, and simulation efficiencies while maintaining high-quality geometric features.</li>
<li>The architecture employs a VQ-VAE and a shape-conditioned decoder-only transformer, demonstrating superior topology and fewer faces compared to traditional methods, making it a significant advancement in the 3D industry.</li>

<li>Generative AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5) were tested for their utility in circuit board design, showing strengths in data extraction and code writing but weaknesses in nuanced design tasks.</li>
<li>Claude 3 Opus excelled in explaining basic concepts, while Gemini 1.5 was most effective in parsing datasheets and creating accurate pin tables and footprints.</li>
<li>All models struggled with specific part recommendations and detailed circuit design tasks, indicating that LLMs are better suited to assist human experts rather than act as standalone designers.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The plastics industry is advocating for pyrolysis, a method that uses heat to break down plastic into molecular components, as a solution to plastic waste.</li>
<li>Despite claims, pyrolysis is inefficient, producing minimal recycled plastic and mostly non-recyclable chemicals and fuels.</li>
<li>The industry employs complex accounting to exaggerate the recycled content of products, potentially misleading consumers about the effectiveness of chemical recycling.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Boris Cherny&#39;s blog highlights the difficulties of using ES Modules in NodeJS and NPM, especially for those returning from other languages like Python and Hack.</li>
<li>Despite ES Modules being introduced to improve code load times, their adoption is low, with only 9-27% of projects using them and less than 6% of files declaring them via specific extensions.</li>
<li>Cherny proposes simplifying the ecosystem by eliminating .mjs and .cjs extensions, making type=module the default in package.json, upgrading libraries to ES Modules, and eventually phasing out require and module.exports in NodeJS.</li>

<li>Two popular dithering techniques used to simulate grayscale on this display are Floyd-Steinberg and Atkinson dithering, both of which have JavaScript implementations for modern use.</li>
<li>Floyd-Steinberg dithering distributes quantization errors to neighboring pixels, while Atkinson dithering, developed by Bill Atkinson, spreads error in a broader pattern, preserving 3/4ths of the error for richer contrast.</li>

<li>In the late 2000s and early 2010s, there was significant enthusiasm for building distributed systems using message queues like Amazon SQS, RabbitMQ, and ZeroMQ.</li>
<li>The current decline in discussion about message queues may be due to Redis addressing many use cases, improved databases handling high scale, and the realization that message queue-based architectures may not always meet expectations.</li>

<li>Researchers from Arizona State University suggest that humans began rapidly accumulating technological knowledge through social learning around 600,000 years ago, marking the origin of cumulative culture.</li>
<li>The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed stone tool manufacturing techniques over 3.3 million years, noting a significant increase in complexity around 600,000 years ago.</li>
<li>This period, likely in the Middle Pleistocene epoch, also saw advancements like controlled use of fire and construction of wooden structures, indicating cumulative culture predates the divergence of Neanderthals and modern humans.</li>

<li>3D programming involves various techniques for 3D rotations, including rotation matrices, Euler angles, and quaternions, each with its own advantages and limitations.</li>
<li>Euler angles can cause issues like gimbal lock and inconsistent angular velocity, making them less suitable for interpolation in applications like robotics.</li>
<li>Quaternions and axis/angle rotations are highlighted as more effective for composing and interpolating rotations, with quaternions offering a robust method for 3D point rotations and easy computation of the exponential map.</li>

<li>SYZYGY is an open standard designed for high-performance peripheral connectivity, offering cost-effective and compact connectors and cables.</li>
<li>It bridges the gap between low-speed Digilent PMOD devices and high-performance VITA 57.1 FMC peripherals, making it ideal for prototypes, system integration, testing, and evaluation systems.</li>
<li>SYZYGY provides two types of connectors: a 40-pin standard peripheral connector and a 60-pin transceiver peripheral connector, both supporting fixed and programmable voltages and single-ended signals.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Spaced repetition for teaching two-year olds how to read]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A father, known as CoffeePie, used Anki, a spaced repetition tool, to teach his children to read years earlier than average, starting at ages 2 and 1 year 9 months.</li>
<li>By age 5, his daughter was reading in English, Hebrew, and Spanish at a level comparable to a fifth or eighth grader, while his son knew multiplication tables and advanced math concepts.</li>
<li>The father observed that while Anki was effective for early reading and math, it had limitations as his children&#39;s skills advanced, necessitating more complex problem-solving tools.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author is working on optimizing a local LLM (Large Language Model) voice assistant for smart home control, focusing on reducing latency during the &quot;prefill&quot; phase of inference.</li>
<li>They implemented a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) method to split large prompts into smaller sections, which helps in reducing context length and improving speed.</li>
<li>The author created a RAG API, added features like weather forecasts and calendar events, and updated their system to use this new API, aiming to make the voice assistant more efficient and responsive.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Django SQLite Production Config]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The default SQLite configuration in Django is not suitable for production due to its low-concurrency optimization, which contrasts with Django&#39;s needs.</li>
<li>For Django versions 5.0, 4.2, or older, enabling WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) journal mode can improve concurrency by preventing write requests from blocking reads.</li>
<li>Django 5.1, expected in August 2024, will allow these SQLite optimizations to be configured directly in settings.py, simplifying the process for developers.</li>
</ul>
