<li>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has endorsed the application of sound waves, a technique known as histotripsy, to destruct liver tumors in human bodies.</li>
<li>Developed by the University of Michigan and implemented by HistoSonics, this innovation employs ultrasound waves to generate microbubbles in tumors, leading to their fragmentation and elimination by the immune system.</li>
<li>Histotripsy not only provides a noninvasive alternative to traditional cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but also shows potential benefits for the immune system and future integration with immunotherapy or drug delivery.</li>

<li>In the metric time system, there is no distinction between AM and PM, with a day simply consisting of 10 hours.</li>
<li>The concept behind metric time is likened to monetary thinking, where each metric hour is equivalent to a 100-dollar bill and each metric minute akin to a 1-dollar bill, totaling to 1,000 minutes and 100,000 seconds per day.</li>

<li>Google is setting passkeys as the default sign-in method for personal Google Accounts with a goal to enhance security and streamline the login process.</li>
<li>Passkeys, which use biometric data or a pin, are considered quicker and safer than traditional passwords. Google has shared that the feedback for passkeys have been largely positive.</li>
<li>Despite the shift towards passkeys, Google would still offer the option for users to use passwords for account access.</li>

<li>The author emphasizes the significance of using tried-and-true technology for its robust documentation, familiarity, and established ecosystems.</li>
<li>Innovative tech should only be opted for if it dramatically boosts the chance of problem-solving. This idea forms a part of the author&#39;s tech selection framework, which includes understanding issues, validating solutions, refining complexity, evaluating designs, and exposing ideas to critics.</li>
<li>However, the author advises remaining clear of cutting-edge technologies to reserve capacity for innovations. This framework&#39;s approach is primarily for work projects, as personal projects are prioritized based on personal enjoyment and learning potential.</li>

<li>The assertion that medieval staircases were primarily clockwise for defense purposes is a myth with no supporting evidence from medieval sources.</li>
<li>This misconception could have stemmed from a theory introduced by Sir Theodore Andrea Cook in the 19th century, but it doesn&#39;t align with an understanding of medieval combat and the practicality of fighting on spiral staircases.</li>
<li>The direction of these staircases was probably influenced by factors like architectural functionality, customs, and space availability, rather than strategic considerations.</li>

<li>A recent study by Google DeepMind and the University of Illinois challenged the current understanding of self-correction in large language models (LLMs), revealing they often struggle to refine their answers without external feedback.</li>
<li>The study suggests self-correction in LLMs is more effective when they can utilize external sources like human feedback or a knowledge base; without such, their performance significantly drops.</li>
<li>The research also stresses the significance of well-designed initial prompts for LLMs and the cautious application of self-correction to enhance their accuracy and reliability, especially in tasks like altering the LLM&#39;s stylistic output or ensuring safer responses.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Changes to the Unified log in macOS have resulted in a compressed binary format for log files, making user access and comprehension challenging, primarily through the Console app.</li>
<li>The updated log has both coverage and privacy censorship limitations, with quick purges of entries and obfuscation of sensitive data, hindering effective utilization and analysis of log files by users.</li>
<li>After upgrading to the Monterey operating system, some Mac users are experiencing slower performance and increased device temperatures, leading them to contemplate reverting to preceding operating systems.</li>

<li>HP Inc. is confronting a class-action lawsuit, alleging that the company deactivates scanning and faxing features on its printers when ink levels deplete.</li>
<li>The lawsuit accuses HP of deliberately concealing this information from consumers to boost sales from expensive ink cartridges.</li>
<li>A federal judge has allowed the lawsuit to move forward, dismissing HP&#39;s plea to discard the case. This represents a recurring issue, with another group suing Canon Inc. in 2021 for similar practices.</li>

<li>Ron Patrick has constructed a road-legal, jet-powered Volkswagen Beetle, a personal project that contains both a gasoline engine for normal driving and a jet engine for an adrenaline rush.</li>
<li>Although the car looks like a standard Beetle and is registered in California, engine modifications could prevent it from passing new car smog checks. It uses a repurposed helicopter turboshaft engine for its jet power.</li>
<li>Despite its unconventional design, it has been well-received at car shows and has attracted significant attention. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is reviewing whether the dual-engine vehicle poses a security risk.</li>
