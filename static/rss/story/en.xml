      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The decline of vultures in the Indian subcontinent is jeopardizing Zoroastrian burial customs, notably for the Parsi community that relies on vultures for body disposal at towers of silence.</li>
<li>Vulture population decrease is mainly attributed to poisoning from diclofenac given to cattle, prompting initiatives like banning the drug and captive vulture breeding as solutions.</li>
<li>Efforts such as prohibiting diclofenac usage and reintroducing captive-bred vultures into the wild aim to avert the extinction of vulture species.</li>
