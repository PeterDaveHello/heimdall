      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Internet Archive (IA) has been forced to remove 500,000 books after losing a lawsuit to book publishers, significantly impacting readers who depend on IA for access to rare books.</li>
<li>IA is appealing the decision, arguing that its controlled digital lending should be considered fair use under copyright law, emphasizing the role of libraries in providing access to knowledge.</li>
<li>An open letter with nearly 19,000 signatures highlights the negative impact on education and underserved communities, with IA supporters urging publishers to restore access to the removed books.</li>

<li>After his father&#39;s death, the author took over a chemical manufacturing company in Nasik, India, while also managing his own company, CB Insights, leading to Atlas&#39;s acquisition on June 1, 2018.</li>
<li>The author navigated the complexities of running a vastly different business, focusing on growth through cold-calling and emailing prospects, resulting in Atlas&#39;s best revenue year and eventual acquisition by a family-held chemical company.</li>
<li>Key lessons included the importance of clear goals, simplicity in negotiations, and the potential for growth in India&#39;s challenging regulatory environment, especially with increased female workforce participation.</li>

<li>Using the <code>sqrtps</code> intrinsic in C/C++ with clang&#39;s <code>-ffast-math</code> flag can lead to precision issues as it replaces <code>sqrtps</code> with <code>rsqrtps</code>.</li>
<li>Inline assembly can enforce the use of <code>sqrtps</code>, but it doesn&#39;t support constant folding when the function is inlined.</li>
<li>To ensure both constant folding and correct behavior, use <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to check if the vector is constant and apply <code>_mm_sqrt_ps</code> accordingly.</li>

<li>Spotify&#39;s payment model benefits major labels (Universal, Warner, Sony) with significant ownership stakes and monthly minimum payments, often not shared with artists, resulting in low artist earnings despite high label profits.</li>
<li>Creative workers are concerned that AI will eliminate jobs, with lawsuits from companies like the New York Times and Getty Images against AI training potentially harming fair use. The real solution is seen in labor rights and organizing rather than increased copyright.</li>

<li>Allen Cekorich, a physics graduate, started his career in 1975 at MDH Industries, working on measuring sulfur content in coal using Californium 252 and initially using Fortran for simulations.</li>
<li>He later adopted the Forth programming language, despite initial confusion, and used it to develop a sulfur meter prototype, facing resistance from colleagues who viewed Forth as unconventional.</li>
<li>Despite Forth&#39;s power and efficiency, its niche status and the industry&#39;s preference for mainstream languages limited its adoption, leading Cekorich to eventually stop programming.</li>

<li>Boris Cherny&#39;s blog highlights the difficulties of using ES Modules in NodeJS and NPM, especially for those returning from other languages like Python and Hack.</li>
<li>Despite ES Modules being introduced to improve code load times, their adoption is low, with only 9-27% of projects using them and less than 6% of files declaring them via specific extensions.</li>
<li>Cherny proposes simplifying the ecosystem by eliminating .mjs and .cjs extensions, making type=module the default in package.json, upgrading libraries to ES Modules, and eventually phasing out require and module.exports in NodeJS.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In the late 2000s and early 2010s, there was significant enthusiasm for building distributed systems using message queues like Amazon SQS, RabbitMQ, and ZeroMQ.</li>
<li>The current decline in discussion about message queues may be due to Redis addressing many use cases, improved databases handling high scale, and the realization that message queue-based architectures may not always meet expectations.</li>
<li>Despite the reduced hype, message queues remain widely used, though the technology has matured and become less exciting to write about.</li>

<li>The Fern Hollow Bridge in Pittsburgh collapsed on January 28, 2022, after being in &#39;poor condition&#39; for over a decade, despite numerous inspections and repair recommendations.</li>
<li>The NTSB report from February 2024 highlighted systemic flaws in bridge inspection and maintenance, including poor drainage leading to severe rusting and underestimated load ratings.</li>
<li>The collapse was triggered by a corroded tie plate, and the NTSB&#39;s investigation revealed a lack of follow-up on repair recommendations and poor communication between inspection teams and bridge owners.</li>

<li>The post addresses the challenge of obtaining structured output, such as JSON, from Large Language Models (LLMs), which typically return responses in natural language.</li>
<li>It provides a detailed comparison of various frameworks designed to convert LLM outputs into structured formats, evaluating them based on criteria like language support, JSON handling, prompt control, and supported model providers.</li>
<li>The frameworks compared include BAML, Instructor, TypeChat, Marvin, Outlines, Guidance, LMQL, JSONformer, Firebase Genkit, SGLang, and lm-format-enforcer, each with unique features and capabilities for handling structured data extraction.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Raspberry Pi 5, released in fall 2023, offers improved performance but is still limited by SD card storage and higher costs compared to previous models.</li>
<li>Second-hand 1L mini PCs from brands like Dell, Lenovo, and HP outperform the Pi 5 in terms of processing power, RAM capacity, and storage options (SATA and NVME SSDs).</li>
<li>While the Raspberry Pi 5 is energy-efficient, second-hand mini PCs are better suited for home server applications due to their superior performance and built-in SSD/NVME support.</li>

<li>3D programming involves various techniques for 3D rotations, including rotation matrices, Euler angles, and quaternions, each with its own advantages and limitations.</li>
<li>Euler angles can cause issues like gimbal lock and inconsistent angular velocity, making them less suitable for interpolation in applications like robotics.</li>
<li>Quaternions and axis/angle rotations are highlighted as more effective for composing and interpolating rotations, with quaternions offering a robust method for 3D point rotations and easy computation of the exponential map.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Ikea addressed high employee turnover by raising wages, offering flexible work schedules, and subsidizing childcare, significantly reducing voluntary turnover rates globally.</li>
<li>CEO Jon Abrahamsson Ring implemented strategies to improve frontline employee conditions and streamline operations with technology, leading to a drop in the global quit rate from 22.4% in August 2022 to 17.5% in April 2023.</li>
<li>Despite improvements, Ikea continues to face challenges, including mental health support, managing a global workforce, and accusations of suppressing union efforts, particularly in the US.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Anna’s Archive, Library Genesis, and Sci-Hub have created a unified torrent list to preserve a vast amount of human knowledge, totaling 521.1TB, with 60% already copied in at least four locations.</li>
<li>Users are encouraged to seed torrents, especially those with low seeders, to help reach 100% preservation. Large contributors (50TB or more) can contact the team for updates on deprecated torrents.</li>
<li>The list is divided into three parts: managed by Anna’s Archive, managed by others like Library Genesis and Sci-Hub, and miscellaneous torrents. Some torrents may be temporarily embargoed.</li>
