<li>Optimised Attention reduces parameters by 25% and requires one fewer matrix multiplication per head, while Efficient Attention halves the parameters and reduces matrix multiplications by two per head, doubling the speed.</li>
<li>Super Attention significantly outperforms standard attention in vision and natural language processing tasks, evaluated on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR100, IMDB Movie Reviews, and Amazon Reviews.</li>

<li>Jonathan Ireland&#39;s article argues that the term &quot;nonprofit&quot; can be misleading, often hiding misconduct and corruption within these organizations.</li>
<li>He provides examples such as San Francisco&#39;s TODCO and Seattle&#39;s nonprofits, highlighting issues like increased executive pay, lobbying efforts, and hiring practices that lead to reoffending.</li>
<li>Ireland criticizes the inefficiency and high costs of outsourcing government services to nonprofits, suggesting that urban issues like homelessness and public health risks are exacerbated by a lack of effective government intervention and oversight.</li>

<li>The essay highlights the challenges of software estimation, noting that traditional project management often incorrectly assumes tasks follow a normal distribution.</li>
<li>In reality, software development tasks often follow a log-normal distribution, where significant deviations are common due to the unpredictable nature of just-in-time learning.</li>

<li>The paper &quot;Grokked Transformers are Implicit Reasoners&quot; explores whether transformers can implicitly reason over parametric knowledge, focusing on composition and comparison reasoning types.</li>
<li>Findings indicate that transformers can learn implicit reasoning through extensive training beyond overfitting, known as grokking, but their generalization ability varies: they struggle with composition but succeed with comparison in out-of-distribution examples.</li>
<li>The study suggests improvements in data and training setups, potential architectural enhancements like cross-layer knowledge sharing, and shows that fully grokked transformers outperform models like GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro in complex reasoning tasks.</li>

<li>Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley, former OpenAI board members, argue that private AI companies cannot be trusted to self-govern due to profit pressures.</li>
<li>OpenAI&#39;s innovative self-governance model, which combined a non-profit mission with a for-profit subsidiary, failed to align profit incentives with the public good.</li>
<li>They emphasize the necessity of government regulation to ensure AI development benefits humanity, considering AI&#39;s significant potential for both positive and negative impacts.</li>

<li>Summing floating-point numbers naively can lead to significant rounding errors, especially with large arrays; methods like pairwise summation and Kahan summation improve accuracy but vary in speed.</li>
<li>Rust&#39;s compiler limitations in reordering floating-point additions hinder autovectorization, but intrinsics like <code>std::intrinsics::fadd_fast</code> and <code>fadd_algebraic</code> enable efficient summation with AVX2 instructions.</li>
<li>Benchmarking on an AMD Threadripper 2950x shows that autovectorized methods using <code>fadd_algebraic</code> are both fast and accurate, with Pareto-optimal implementations being <code>naive_autovec</code>, <code>block_kahan_autovec</code>, and <code>crate_accurate_inplace</code>.</li>

<li>Google&#39;s recent search algorithm updates have significantly impacted independent publishers, favoring larger lifestyle magazines and user-generated platforms like Reddit.</li>
<li>The introduction of AI-generated answers aims to reduce low-quality content but has led to drastic drops in traffic and revenue for smaller sites, forcing some to downsize.</li>
<li>Google faces multiple antitrust lawsuits, including one from the US Department of Justice, accusing it of maintaining an illegal monopoly in the search engine industry.</li>

<li>The &quot;right to roam&quot; movement in England seeks to reclaim public access to both private and public lands, as currently only 8% of the land is accessible to citizens.</li>
<li>Activist Jon Moses highlights the history of land ownership in England and the need to reestablish the &quot;freedom to roam&quot; to reconnect people with nature and repair landscapes.</li>
<li>The movement organizes events like group walks on private land to demonstrate the benefits of public access and addresses the historical suppression of common rights.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A scandal has surfaced at the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) 2024, involving Krish Pai, a 17-year-old winner in the environmental engineering division.</li>
<li>Pai is accused of cheating by using falsified images and plagiarized data in his project on microorganisms that biodegrade plastic, with an anonymous dossier providing detailed evidence.</li>
<li>The incident underscores significant oversight failures by ISEF, and there are calls for revoking Pai&#39;s award to maintain fairness, with anticipated mainstream media coverage.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In 2015, Derek Sivers introduced the concept of a /now page on his website to share his current activities, inspired by the absence of such information on a friend&#39;s site.</li>
<li>The idea gained traction, leading Sivers to establish nownownow.com, a directory featuring over 2300 /now pages globally.</li>
<li>Sivers encourages others to create their own /now pages and provides instructions for various platforms, offering to add them to the directory upon request.</li>
