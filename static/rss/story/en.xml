<li>Amazon has laid off over 27,000 employees, mostly in the retail sector, to reduce operational expenses.</li>
<li>Many employees, especially those in higher positions, want to leave due to compensation concerns.</li>
<li>The value of spending on Amazon&#39;s AWS is decreasing as customers cut costs, and the company is lagging behind in AI.</li>
<li>Amazon is giving away high-margin services for free and may shift to a more centralized organizational structure in the coming year.</li>
<li>Predictions suggest there may be a major AWS outage in 2024 due to the silent layoffs of employees.</li>
<li>Employees who have been laid off are not receiving severance packages, and the company is trying to retain headcount without officially announcing layoffs.</li>
<li>This practice may continue in 2024 as companies prioritize short-term profits.</li>

<li>The author proposes using indents instead of a parent-child structure to display tree-like lists in a user interface (UI).</li>
<li>They argue that the visual appearance of the tree is often more important than the actual relationship between items.</li>
<li>The author provides examples and pseudocode to help implement this technique, but also advises that it may not be suitable for all scenarios and suggests alternative methods for situations requiring a true tree structure.</li>

<li>DRµGS is a repository that introduces a method called Deep Random Micro-Glitch Sampling (DRµGS) to inject noise into transformer layers during inference, increasing output variety while maintaining coherence.</li>
<li>The repository currently supports LLaMA and mistral models, providing implementations and experimental data for four types of DRµGs: Q, K, V, and A.</li>
<li>Potential negative side effects of DRµGS are addressed with a &quot;cold_shower&quot; function included in the repository.</li>
<li>Visualizations are available to showcase the effects of injecting noise at different layers of the model.</li>
<li>Contributions and experimentation with DRµGS are encouraged.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The append-only b+tree is a data structure commonly used for efficient storage and retrieval of data.</li>
<li>It is made up of branch and leaf pages, with the leaf pages containing the actual data and keys.</li>
<li>Rather than supporting leaf chaining for sequential access, each update involves appending a new page to the file and updating the parent pages, ensuring a consistent snapshot of the database without the need for a transaction log. This approach is more efficient for writing consecutive pages to disk, but may waste disk space.</li>

<li>National Grid has announced the completion of Viking Link, the world&#39;s longest land and subsea interconnector, stretching 475 miles between the UK and Denmark.</li>
<li>The £1.7 billion project has the capacity to power up to 2.5 million homes and is expected to save UK consumers over £500 million in the first ten years through cheaper imported power from Denmark.</li>
<li>Viking Link is also estimated to reduce carbon emissions by 600,000 tonnes in its first year of operation, while increasing security of supply and decreasing prices for consumers.</li>

<li>In the early 20th century, goitres and related medical conditions were highly prevalent in Switzerland, causing swelling of the neck and significant health and economic impacts for families.</li>
<li>The cause of goitres was found to be iodine deficiency, and the solution was the introduction of iodised salt, although it faced initial opposition.</li>
<li>The implementation of iodised salt in Switzerland resulted in a significant reduction in goitre rates, but the achievements of those involved have been overshadowed by the opposition of Dr. Eugen Bircher.</li>

<li>However, they encounter limitations with the compiler and executable file size when scaling up.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers presented their findings on &quot;Operation Triangulation,&quot; an attack chain targeting iOS versions up to iOS 16.2.</li>
<li>The attack utilized zero-day vulnerabilities, including a remote code execution vulnerability in Apple&#39;s ADJUST TrueType font instruction and a JavaScript exploit to gain control of the device and run spyware.</li>
<li>The attackers bypassed hardware-based memory protection using an unknown hardware feature on Apple-designed SoCs, exploiting unknown MMIO blocks related to the GPU coprocessor and specific registers to control hardware features and interrupts.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In the 1980s, a roach-control product called Combat successfully reduced the cockroach population, especially in government buildings.</li>
<li>Researchers have created a new bait product that is effective against cockroaches resistant to traditional insecticides.</li>
<li>The decline in cockroaches during that time coincided with the end of the Cold War, symbolizing concerns about nuclear war. Now, cockroaches are making a comeback due to their resistance to baits.</li>

<li>Moderna and Merck have collaborated to develop an mRNA-based cancer vaccine called mRNA-4157.</li>
<li>The vaccine has shown promising results in preventing melanoma recurrence or death when combined with Merck&#39;s Keytruda treatment.</li>
<li>In a phase 2b study, the combination therapy reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 49% after three years compared to Keytruda alone.</li>
<li>These positive findings have led to the launch of a phase 3 trial for the combination therapy.</li>
<li>The vaccine may potentially be available for accelerated approval in some countries by 2025.</li>
<li>Moderna and Merck are also exploring the use of the vaccine in other types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer.</li>

<li>A report from Human Rights Watch alleges that Meta (formerly Facebook) has engaged in &quot;systemic and global&quot; censorship of pro-Palestinian content during the Israel-Gaza war.</li>
<li>The report identifies six patterns of censorship, including content removal and account suspensions.</li>
<li>Meta denies the allegations, claiming that it makes mistakes but does not purposely suppress specific voices.</li>
<li>This is the second time this month that Meta has been accused of silencing pro-Palestinian content.</li>

<li>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has signed a bill requiring limited liability companies (LLCs) to disclose their &quot;beneficial owners.&quot;</li>
<li>However, she has prevented public access to the database containing this information, raising concerns about transparency.</li>
<li>Hochul also vetoed a bill that aimed to ban noncompete agreements and another that would have required New York City to install recycling bins in certain areas.</li>
<li>On the positive side, she approved a bill that will move many county- and town-level elections to even-numbered years.</li>
<li>Critics argue that these changes could potentially benefit Democrats and have a negative impact on local communities.</li>
<li>Five pieces of legislation are still pending approval or rejection by the end of the year, adding to the ongoing changes in New York&#39;s legal landscape.</li>

<li>Two recent court cases in Germany have focused on the battle for user control over technology, specifically in relation to adblockers.</li>
<li>Axel Springer SE, a major publishing company, sued Eyeo GmbH, the creator of Adblock Plus, for blocking their advertisements.</li>
<li>The court ruled in favor of Eyeo, affirming that users have the right to decide whether or not to use adblockers and that it does not violate copyright laws. However, Axel Springer was allowed to exclude users with adblockers from accessing their content and potentially implement a paid model.</li>
<li>These cases establish important legal precedents regarding user freedom and the right to make individual choices while using the internet.</li>

<li>FDA regulations contained a loophole that allowed ineffective OTC decongestant drugs to be approved and sold to consumers.</li>
<li>It took more than ten years for the FDA to agree with the findings of two pharmacists who conducted research and petitioned for the removal of products containing oral phenylephrine from shelves.</li>
<li>This case highlights the necessity of reevaluating the regulatory process for pre-1962 approved OTC drugs and allocating additional funding for independent research on these products. Consumers are also encouraged to consult with pharmacists and advocate for modern scientific reviews of older OTC products.</li>
