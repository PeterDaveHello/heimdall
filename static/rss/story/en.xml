            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-6387) in OpenSSH&#39;s server on glibc-based Linux systems allows remote code execution (RCE) due to a signal handler race condition.</li>
<li>The issue, a regression of CVE-2006-5051, affects OpenSSH versions 3.4p1, 4.2p1, and 9.2p1, and involves exploiting the SIGALRM handler to cause heap corruption and execute arbitrary code.</li>
<li>Mitigation includes applying patches that move async-signal-unsafe code out of the SIGALRM handler or setting <code>LoginGraceTime</code> to 0, though the latter may cause denial of service.</li>
</ul>

<li>The Supreme Court extended the delay in Donald Trump&#39;s criminal case regarding the 2020 election, reducing the likelihood of a trial before the November election.</li>
<li>In a 6-3 ruling, the court&#39;s conservative majority granted former presidents broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, complicating the prosecution&#39;s case and requiring further analysis at the trial court level.</li>
<li>The decision underscores the court&#39;s significant influence on the upcoming election, with Chief Justice John Roberts emphasizing immunity for official acts and Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissenting, arguing it undermines the principle that no one is above the law.</li>

<li>During the Civil War, the Union faced a significant coffee shortage, crucial for soldiers&#39; morale and energy, with imports dropping by 40% by 1862.</li>
<li>Liberia, under President Stephen Allen Benson, began exporting coffee to the Union, starting with a 6,000-pound shipment in August 1862, helping to fill the gap caused by the Union&#39;s blockade of Southern ports.</li>
<li>The partnership between Liberian coffee farmers and Northern abolitionists, along with advice from Philadelphia merchant Edward Morris, boosted coffee production, making Liberian coffee vital to the Union&#39;s war effort and contributing to their success.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Rodney Brooks, a renowned MIT robotics pioneer, believes that generative AI is often overhyped and cannot match human capabilities.</li>
<li>Brooks argues that AI should focus on specific, solvable problems rather than attempting to replicate human abilities, citing inefficiencies in using generative AI for tasks like warehouse robotics.</li>
<li>He also notes that technological growth is not always exponential, using the iPod&#39;s storage capacity as an example, and suggests that while Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist with tasks like eldercare, they are not a universal solution for all AI challenges.</li>

<li>Scientists have uncovered new details about the brain&#39;s waste-removal system, which is essential for maintaining brain health and preventing disorders.</li>
<li>Research published in Nature reveals that slow electrical waves during sleep help push waste-laden fluid from deep within the brain to its surface, where it is absorbed into the bloodstream and removed by the liver and kidneys.</li>
<li>This glymphatic system is crucial for clearing amyloid, a substance linked to Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and impaired waste removal may contribute to various brain disorders like Alzheimer&#39;s, Parkinson&#39;s, headaches, and depression.</li>

<li>Interval arithmetic addresses measurement inaccuracies by representing values as ranges, providing bounds for the correct number rather than a single imprecise floating point value.</li>
<li>While interval arithmetic can offer more accurate results, it can also lead to overly large boundaries, making it less practical, as noted by William Kahan, the creator of the IEEE-754 standard.</li>
<li>John Gustafson&#39;s universal numbers are a recent development in this field, though it&#39;s uncertain if his posit version incorporates intervals; his rivalry with Kahan adds an interesting dynamic to the discussion.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Internet Archive (IA) has been forced to remove 500,000 books after losing a lawsuit to book publishers, significantly impacting readers who depend on IA for access to rare books.</li>
<li>IA is appealing the decision, arguing that its controlled digital lending should be considered fair use under copyright law, emphasizing the role of libraries in providing access to knowledge.</li>
<li>An open letter with nearly 19,000 signatures highlights the negative impact on education and underserved communities, with IA supporters urging publishers to restore access to the removed books.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Using the <code>sqrtps</code> intrinsic in C/C++ with clang&#39;s <code>-ffast-math</code> flag can lead to precision issues as it replaces <code>sqrtps</code> with <code>rsqrtps</code>.</li>
<li>Inline assembly can enforce the use of <code>sqrtps</code>, but it doesn&#39;t support constant folding when the function is inlined.</li>
<li>To ensure both constant folding and correct behavior, use <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to check if the vector is constant and apply <code>_mm_sqrt_ps</code> accordingly.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Spotify&#39;s payment model benefits major labels (Universal, Warner, Sony) with significant ownership stakes and monthly minimum payments, often not shared with artists, resulting in low artist earnings despite high label profits.</li>
<li>Creative workers are concerned that AI will eliminate jobs, with lawsuits from companies like the New York Times and Getty Images against AI training potentially harming fair use. The real solution is seen in labor rights and organizing rather than increased copyright.</li>
<li>Upcoming appearances include the Locus Awards (virtual and in Oakland), HOPE XV in Queens, NY, and keynotes in Chicago for Exile in Bookville and the American Association of Law Libraries.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Allen Cekorich, a physics graduate, started his career in 1975 at MDH Industries, working on measuring sulfur content in coal using Californium 252 and initially using Fortran for simulations.</li>
<li>He later adopted the Forth programming language, despite initial confusion, and used it to develop a sulfur meter prototype, facing resistance from colleagues who viewed Forth as unconventional.</li>
<li>Despite Forth&#39;s power and efficiency, its niche status and the industry&#39;s preference for mainstream languages limited its adoption, leading Cekorich to eventually stop programming.</li>
