<li>MK-1 has introduced their first product, MKML, an inference runtime that aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of AI models.</li>
<li>MKML enables a 2x reduction in large language model (LLM) inference costs on GPUs with just a few lines of Python code.</li>
<li>It integrates seamlessly with popular ecosystems like Hugging Face and PyTorch and addresses the issue of large memory requirements by compressing the model size by approximately 60%. This optimization not only saves on GPU memory but also enhances inference speed.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The FCC has imposed a record-breaking fine of $300 million on a robocaller for engaging in a scam scheme since 2018.</li>
<li>The robocaller used different names and pretended to be a company selling auto warranties to collect personal information.</li>
<li>While the FCC&#39;s efforts, including partnerships with state law enforcement, have significantly reduced auto warranty calls by 99%, it is unclear if and when the fine will be paid due to the FCC&#39;s limited authority in collecting fines effectively.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Civil asset forfeiture is a controversial practice in which law enforcement can seize cash and property from individuals without charging them with a crime.</li>
<li>This practice was originally meant to target organized crime but is now frequently used against regular citizens.</li>
<li>Between 2000 and 2019, authorities in the US seized around $69 billion from people, most of whom were not charged with any wrongdoing.</li>
<li>In 2019, federal authorities took more cash and property from individuals than burglars did.</li>
<li>Individuals face the burden of proof to reclaim their seized assets, which often leads to expensive legal battles.</li>
<li>Some lawmakers advocate for reform, but many in law enforcement and their elected representatives oppose changes to the practice.</li>

<li>Companies with high ESG scores pollute just as much as low-rated companies, according to research by Scientific Beta.</li>
<li>There is no correlation between ESG scores and carbon intensity, even when only considering the environmental component of the metric.</li>
<li>This challenges the belief that ESG investments create low-carbon portfolios.</li>
<li>Including social or governance ratings alongside carbon intensity leads to less green portfolios compared to those based on market capitalization.</li>
<li>The effectiveness of ESG as a mass-market product is questioned, and investors should carefully prioritize sustainability when making investment decisions.</li>

<li>Ice core scientists from the University of Copenhagen have successfully drilled through an ice stream in Northeast Greenland, reaching the bedrock beneath.</li>
<li>This is the first time a deep ice core has been drilled through an ice stream, providing valuable information on Earth&#39;s climate changes from the past 120,000 years.</li>
<li>Mud samples retrieved from beneath the ice will be analyzed to understand climate patterns and project rising sea levels.</li>
<li>The ice core will be studied in laboratories worldwide to document climate changes over the last 120,000 years.</li>
<li>This breakthrough improves understanding of ice stream behavior and its impact on rising sea levels.</li>
<li>The project involved 12 participating nations and received financial support from Denmark.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Voyager 2 probe is currently unable to communicate with NASA due to a misaligned antenna.</li>
<li>This antenna misalignment has been ongoing for over a week, preventing the spacecraft from receiving commands or transmitting data.</li>
<li>NASA believes that this situation is temporary and will not impact Voyager 2&#39;s trajectory or its mission in space.</li>
<li>Voyager 2 is currently around 32 billion kilometers away from Earth and is moving further away at a rate of 15km per second.</li>
<li>Voyager 1, however, remains in contact with Earth and is unaffected by this glitch.</li>
<li>Engineers are working to fix the antenna alignment issue and extend Voyager 2&#39;s working life.</li>
<li>If successful, a similar adjustment may be made to Voyager 1.</li>

<li>Despite the growing acceptance of marijuana, addiction to the drug exists and is often met with skepticism.</li>
<li>While some argue that marijuana can be used without negative consequences, it is recognized to be addictive like alcohol or prescription drugs.</li>
<li>Estimates vary, but there are individuals struggling with cannabis use disorder who require assistance.</li>
<li>Concerns are arising about the impact of increased marijuana use and potency, particularly on the developing brains of teenagers.</li>
<li>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration states that millions of individuals in the US had a cannabis use disorder in 2021.</li>
<li>Medical marijuana users may be misdiagnosed, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic criteria.</li>
<li>Currently, behavioral therapy is the primary treatment for marijuana addiction, as there is no medication available.</li>
<li>Quitting marijuana use can result in withdrawal symptoms.</li>
<li>The article also mentions the increasing acceptance of marijuana use and provides additional resources on the topic.</li>

<li>Room temperature superconductivity has been discovered in copper-substituted lead phosphate apatite.</li>
<li>The study uses density functional theory calculations to identify correlated isolated flat bands at the Fermi level.</li>
<li>These flat bands are attributed to a structural distortion induced by copper ions and a chiral charge density wave from lead lone pairs.</li>
<li>A minimal two-band model can explain a significant portion of the low-energy physics in this system.</li>
<li>The implications of the findings on potential superconductivity in copper-doped apatite are discussed.</li>
