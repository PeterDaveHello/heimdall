      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>At the 2024 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory Management, and BPF Summit, Wedson Almeida Filho and Kent Overstreet discussed using Rust for Linux filesystems, highlighting its potential benefits.</li>
<li>Almeida&#39;s RFC patch set from December 2023 introduced Rust abstractions for filesystems, aiming to leverage Rust&#39;s type system to catch errors at compile time and automate resource cleanup, enhancing productivity and reducing memory-related vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Concerns were raised about the disconnect between C and Rust APIs, with suggestions to align function names for familiarity, and the challenges of maintaining synchronization between evolving C code and Rust bindings were acknowledged.</li>

<li>Silicon Valley investors and CEOs, once seen as innovators, are now being criticized as monopolists and are defending themselves against these claims.</li>
<li>Paul Graham&#39;s essay, &quot;How People Get Rich Now,&quot; argues that modern wealth is more merit-based compared to the past but overlooks the growing wealth gap and its implications.</li>
<li>Despite the ease of starting a business today, the benefits are limited to a minority, and wealth inequality remains a significant issue, not just a radical left concept.</li>

<li>strlcpy(3), an OpenBSD function, is often considered safer than strcpy(3) and strncpy(3), but it is inefficient and not safe if the source string isn&#39;t null-terminated.</li>
<li>Ulrich Drepper rejected strlcpy for glibc due to its inefficiency, as it processes the entire source string even when only a portion is needed.</li>
<li>Alternatives like memccpy(3), strdup(3), and a combination of strlen(3) and memcpy(3) are recommended for better efficiency and portability.</li>

<li>A developer has demonstrated using Amazon S3 as a container registry by exposing an S3 bucket through HTTP and uploading container image files to specific paths, allowing for <code>docker pull</code> operations.</li>
<li>The main advantage of using S3 over traditional container registries like DockerHub or Amazon ECR is significantly faster upload speeds due to parallel chunked uploads.</li>
<li>This experimental approach lacks features like automated security scans and access controls but could lead to hosting public container images in Cloudflare’s R2 with free egress.</li>

<li>CHARM (Coupled Histone tail for Autoinhibition Release of Methyltransferase) is a new gene-silencing tool developed by the Broad Institute and Whitehead Institute, showing potential for treating prion diseases and other neurodegenerative conditions.</li>
<li>This tool uses epigenetic editing to silence disease-causing genes, including the prion protein gene, without altering the underlying DNA, potentially offering a one-time treatment.</li>
<li>The research team, led by Sonia Vallabh and Jonathan Weissman, has made significant progress, creating a compact, effective, and low-toxicity gene silencer, and is now refining CHARM for clinical trials.</li>

<li>The post discusses using value speculation to enhance CPU performance by leveraging the branch predictor to guess values and reduce data dependencies in tight loops.</li>
<li>By speculating the next node&#39;s address in a linked list summation function, the technique aims to bypass L1 cache read delays, resulting in significant performance improvements.</li>
<li>Despite compilers often optimizing away this trick, using inline assembly ensures the speculation remains, leading to a 50-200% increase in function speed when data fits within CPU caches.</li>

<li>A global internet sweep by ICPEN found that 75.7% of 642 websites and mobile apps used at least one dark pattern, with 66.8% using two or more.</li>
<li>Dark patterns are deceptive online practices that manipulate consumer choices, such as auto-renewal traps and interface interference.</li>
<li>The sweep, conducted by 27 consumer protection authorities from 26 countries, highlights the intersection of consumer protection and privacy, with detailed reports available online.</li>

<li>A global study by Sapien Labs indicates that children who receive smartphones at a younger age tend to have poorer mental health as adults, with a stronger effect observed in girls.</li>
<li>The research, involving nearly a million participants, shows a consistent pattern across different regions and languages, linking early smartphone use to worse mental health in young adulthood.</li>
<li>The study suggests that increased exposure to social media and phone addiction may contribute to these mental health issues, urging parents, educators, and policymakers to reconsider the appropriate age for children to receive smartphones.</li>

<li>Scott Aaronson&#39;s blog post clarifies common misconceptions in theoretical computer science, particularly the difference between computability and complexity.</li>
<li>He uses examples, such as a function determining God&#39;s existence, to illustrate that computability pertains to functions, not individual questions, and addresses misunderstandings about the P vs. NP problem.</li>
<li>Aaronson explains that computability concerns the existence of a program to map inputs to outputs, not the difficulty of creating that program, and discusses the Busy Beaver function to highlight uncomputable versus computable values.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>&quot;Anxious Generation&quot; by Jonathan Haidt attributes rising mental illness rates among youth to social media and helicopter parenting, distinguishing social media&#39;s harmful effects from general internet use.</li>
<li>Haidt criticizes overprotective parenting and modern safety measures for limiting children&#39;s independence and resilience, proposing a &quot;Ladder from Childhood to Adulthood&quot; with age-appropriate responsibilities and delayed social media use until age 16.</li>
<li>The book also addresses the negative impact of not exposing children to diverse viewpoints, contributing to a lack of free speech in academia, and advocates for societal changes to counter these trends.</li>
