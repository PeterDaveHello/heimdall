            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SSH3 is a revised version of the SSH protocol that uses HTTP mechanisms to offer a faster and more secure shell experience.</li>
<li>It employs QUIC+TLS1.3 for secure channel establishment and HTTP Authorization for user authentication.</li>
<li>SSH3 provides faster session establishment, improved authentication methods (OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect), robustness to port scanning attacks, UDP port forwarding, and features of the modern QUIC protocol.</li>
<li>It allows for hiding the SSH server and supports X.509 certificates for authentication.</li>
<li>SSH3 is currently experimental and can be installed by downloading the binaries or compiling the code from source.</li>
<li>An SSH3 server needs to be deployed to use SSH3, and the SSH3 client supports various authentication methods.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The nutritional value of crops like wheat and rice has decreased over the past sixty years due to factors like the Green Revolution, climate change, and the use of hybrid crops.</li>
<li>These factors have resulted in larger crops with lower mineral content, leading to &quot;micronutrient malnutrition&quot; in many people, especially in low-income countries.</li>
<li>To compensate for the decrease in nutritional value, it is recommended to follow dietary guidelines and consume a higher proportion of fruits and vegetables. However, as COâ‚‚ levels rise, even greater amounts of these foods may be necessary to obtain adequate minerals.</li>

<li>Lego has chosen the design for a Lego Polaroid camera created by mechanical engineering graduate student Marc Corfmat as an official set after it received 10,000 votes on the Lego Ideas platform.</li>
<li>The development process involved rigorous quality control and testing, with challenges faced in creating a functioning shutter button and selecting the material for the photo.</li>
<li>The final design closely resembles the original Polaroid OneStep model, but some requested features, such as a camera strap and warranty stickers, were not included. Marc, although not directly involved in the design process, is thrilled to see his idea become a reality and will receive 10 free copies of the Lego set.</li>

<li>The article discusses an alternative approach to compiling WebAssembly code by transpiling it into C source code.</li>
<li>This approach allows for improved debugging, easy integration with existing C code, and the ability to compile and run WebAssembly on new platforms.</li>
<li>The transpiled C code can be compiled with a regular C compiler, resulting in faster and smaller executables compared to traditional WebAssembly runtimes.</li>
<li>However, there are limitations, such as the lack of just-in-time compilation and the manual setup of memory guard pages.</li>
<li>The approach is suitable for improving code safety and running WebAssembly on unsupported platforms, but traditional runtimes offer more features and flexibility.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>AST-grep is a command-line tool that enables code structural search, linting, and rewriting by leveraging abstract syntax trees (AST).</li>
<li>It functions similar to grep, but instead of matching text, it matches AST nodes.</li>
<li>Users can write code-like patterns to match code with the same syntactical structure.</li>
<li>AST-grep provides advanced code manipulation, intuitive pattern matching, and a jQuery-like API for AST traversal.</li>
<li>It can be installed through package managers or built from source.</li>
<li>The tool aims to simplify AST programming and is particularly useful for open source library authors, tech leads, and security researchers.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A Linux malware named Krasue has secretly infected Thai telecommunications companies for two years undetected.</li>
<li>Krasue is a remote access trojan that allows attackers to control targeted networks remotely.</li>
<li>Krasue uses various rootkits to hide its activities, disguises &quot;alive pings&quot; as RTSP messages, and contains a rootkit that intercepts the kill() syscall to survive shutdown attempts. Possible installation vectors include vulnerability exploitation, credential theft, or trojanized software updates.</li>

<li>Employees who log off at the end of the workday are 20% more productive than those who continue working after hours, according to a survey conducted by Slack&#39;s Workforce Index.</li>
<li>Taking breaks during the workday is crucial for productivity and well-being, yet half of desk workers rarely or never take breaks.</li>
<li>The study suggests that around four hours of focused work time is ideal, and spending more than two hours in meetings is considered excessive. Additionally, the late afternoon (3-6pm) is the least productive time for work.</li>

<li>RFC 9330 introduces the L4S architecture, which aims to enhance internet applications by reducing queuing delay and enabling low latency and scalable throughput.</li>
<li>The L4S architecture proposes new congestion control mechanisms that work alongside existing controls and use a modified version of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN).</li>
<li>The goal is to provide a high-quality internet service with improved performance for interactive applications, such as gaming, streaming, and video conferencing.</li>
<li>The architecture can be incrementally deployed and is compatible with different network types.</li>
<li>The text includes discussions on deployment considerations, traffic policing, and security considerations.</li>
<li>It emphasizes the importance of accurate ECN feedback and scalability in congestion control algorithms.</li>
<li>The document provides references to additional resources on congestion control, network protocols, and differentiated services.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Inert ingredients in pesticides, previously considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than thought, according to new research.</li>
<li>A study exposed honeybees to a fungicide containing both active and inert ingredients and found that the whole formulation impaired the bees&#39; memory, while active ingredients alone did not.</li>
<li>Inert ingredients have different functions and are regulated differently than active ingredients, making it hard to determine their toxicity. Comprehensive testing of pesticide formulations is needed to understand their impact on bee health. Changes to pesticide regulation could help protect bees by identifying inert ingredients on labels and requiring more testing on long-term effects.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>This blog post delves into Spotify&#39;s initial approach to shuffling songs in a playlist, and the problem they encountered with consecutive songs by the same artist.</li>
<li>Spotify modified their shuffling algorithm to evenly distribute artists throughout the playlist by implementing dithering algorithms.</li>
<li>The author explores a method for selecting colors using the HSV space and applies the Fibonacci hashing algorithm to evenly distribute colors.</li>
<li>The post discusses an algorithm for shuffling songs based on artists and compares it with the Fisher-Yates shuffle.</li>
<li>Fiedler&#39;s algorithm, the history of hashing, and the use of hash functions to reduce stored item information are also covered.</li>
<li>The post concludes by suggesting the conversion of a number into binary format and dividing it by a prime number to determine an address.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>After the removal of CEO Sam Altman, OpenAI employees considered accepting a blanket offer from Microsoft, but most were not genuinely interested in working for Microsoft and saw it as a last resort.</li>
<li>Many employees felt pressured to sign an open letter demanding Altman&#39;s reinstatement and the resignation of the OpenAI board, driven by a clash of cultures, lack of respect for Microsoft&#39;s talent bar, and disbelief in compensation promises.</li>
<li>Money was also a motivating factor, as millions of dollars in equity were at risk if OpenAI were to collapse. However, Altman has been reinstated, and the planned tender offer for equity is proceeding, valuing OpenAI at over $80 billion. Microsoft employees were upset with the promise to match salaries for OpenAI employees, considering Microsoft&#39;s previous layoffs and salary cuts.</li>
</ul>
