            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A study from the University of Antwerp reveals that 90% of eco-friendly paper straws contain harmful &quot;forever chemicals&quot; called PFAS.</li>
<li>PFAS have been linked to various health issues such as high cholesterol, reduced immune response, thyroid disease, and increased cancer risk.</li>
<li>The study found PFAS in 69% of the 39 tested straw brands, with paper straws having the highest presence of these chemicals. The water-resistant coating on paper straws likely contributes to the use of PFAS.</li>
<li>This challenges the assumption that paper straws are automatically healthier and more sustainable than plastic alternatives, calling for further research to determine if PFAS leach out of paper straws during typical use.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Companies like Meta and Microsoft prohibit web scraping on their own properties while freely scraping data from other companies&#39; properties, creating a hypocritical stance.</li>
<li>Web scraping involves acquiring data from the internet, but the legal question of who can access and use that data is complex.</li>
<li>Social media companies aggressively pursue web scraping litigation to protect user-generated content, using legal theories like trespass to chattels or breach of contract, even without property rights in the data.</li>
<li>The author criticizes the legal regime that allows companies to create their own intellectual property rights through online terms of use agreements.</li>
<li>The lack of legal requirement for intellectual honesty or consistency in the breach-of-contract-as-property legal regime is highlighted.</li>
<li>The author blames the courts for enabling this hypocrisy and calls for a solution to prevent private companies from inventing intellectual property rights through online contracts.</li>
<li>The legal state of web scraping is seen as unstable and likely to face challenges in the future, specifically in generative AI cases.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>OpenAI has introduced a new feature called fine-tuning for their GPT-3.5 Turbo model, allowing developers to customize it for specific use cases.</li>
<li>Early tests have shown that a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 Turbo can outperform the base GPT-4 model in certain tasks, indicating improved performance.</li>
<li>Fine-tuning offers benefits such as increased steerability, reliable output formatting, and the ability to customize the tone. The updated model also supports handling 4k tokens and offers cost savings through prompt size reduction.</li>
<li>OpenAI has released pricing details for fine-tuning and announced the availability of updated GPT-3 models.</li>
<li>OpenAI has implemented moderation systems to ensure the safe deployment of fine-tuned models and plans to launch a fine-tuning user interface soon.</li>

<li>The US government sought an agreement with TikTok that would have granted them significant control and access to the app&#39;s operations, according to a leaked draft agreement obtained by Forbes.</li>
<li>The agreement would have given US agencies extensive powers, such as the ability to examine TikTok&#39;s records and servers, veto executive appointments, and demand changes to the app&#39;s terms of service.</li>
<li>The government&#39;s demands drew criticism as they resembled surveillance tactics commonly associated with China. TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) declined to comment on the draft agreement.</li>

<li>A recent survey by Pew Research Center shows that 57% of Americans now support expanding nuclear power in the United States, up from 43% in 2020.</li>
<li>However, solar power (82%) and wind power (75%) remain more favored by Americans compared to nuclear power.</li>
<li>Support for nuclear power has increased among both Democrats and Republicans, with men and Republicans being more likely to support it and believe the government should encourage its production. The United States currently has 93 nuclear power reactors, mainly located in the South, but the number has declined since its peak in 1990, potentially due to concerns over accidents and international tensions.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Amsterdam has implemented &quot;noise cameras&quot; to address the issue of noisy vehicles in the city.</li>
<li>Electric road signs have been placed to alert drivers if their vehicles are too loud, and these signs will later be replaced by noise cameras that will automatically issue fines to offending drivers.</li>
<li>Noise signs will be tested in two locations initially, with plans to install more sound meters and signs throughout the month. This initiative aims to minimize noise disturbances in the city. Rotterdam is also partnering with Amsterdam on a similar experiment.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists are studying the distinct smell of old books and using the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released to determine their age, condition, and history.</li>
<li>The smell of old books is caused by the breakdown of paper and other organic compounds, releasing specific compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol.</li>
<li>VOC analysis can help librarians and historians identify preservation needs and match orphaned books with their original libraries.</li>
