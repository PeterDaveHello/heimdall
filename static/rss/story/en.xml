            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Nearly 2,000 earthquakes were recorded off the coast of Vancouver Island in one day, hinting at the formation of new oceanic crust at the Endeavour site on the Juan de Fuca Ridge as the seafloor spreads apart.</li>
<li>The seismic activity is attributed to the stretching of the seafloor, enabling magma to ascend and generate fresh crust, offering valuable knowledge on ocean crust formation.</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring since 2011 allows researchers to closely study the phenomenon, shedding light on this natural process.</li>

<li>The paper explores how OpenVPN is susceptible to VPN fingerprinting, allowing for the blocking of VPN connections based on the developed framework&#39;s accurate identification of OpenVPN connections.</li>
<li>Over 85% of OpenVPN flows can be distinguished with few false positives, including those using &quot;obfuscated&quot; VPN setups, emphasizing the need for short-term defenses and transparency from VPN providers regarding their obfuscation methods.</li>
<li>Presented at the USENIX Security Symposium 2022, this research sheds light on the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in VPN technologies to enhance user privacy and security.</li>
