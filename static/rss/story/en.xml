            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The rapidly expanding private-equity industry, now valued at $12 trillion, is sparking concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential systemic risks, due to an increase in taking publicly traded companies private.</li>
<li>The practice of taking companies private by these firms exempts the companies from mandatory public disclosures, leading to less scrutiny and potential for abuse such as workforce layoffs, regulatory evasions, and company bankruptcies, while ensuring high payouts for the firms’ partners.</li>
<li>While government regulations have been proposed to demand more information from private-equity funds, additional actions are needed to address the intrinsic issues plaguing the industry, to prevent potential financial crises triggered by unmanageable debt and defaults.</li>

<li>The UK government&#39;s Online Safety Act is now law, intending to safeguard individuals, notably children, on the internet.</li>
<li>Critics, however, argue that the act is inefficient in counteracting misinformation, infringes on privacy, and hands over extensive control to private companies. It may even compromise encryption by necessitating a scan of users&#39; messages.</li>
<li>The act&#39;s similarity to the Investigatory Powers Act has led some companies to contemplate exiting the UK. Meanwhile, the EU commissioner&#39;s threats against Elon Musk and his company are perceived as hollow by critics.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers from the University of California, Davis, and Cornell University have discovered that crushed volcanic rock added to farmland can absorb carbon dioxide, even in arid climates.</li>
<li>The method is called rock weathering, which traps carbon in soil. This process is hastened by crushing the rock into fine dust.</li>
<li>During an intense drought in California, a field study revealed that areas with crushed rock stored 0.15 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare, suggesting enhanced rock weathering as a productive instrument for carbon capture and mitigation.</li>

<li>COVID-19 is potentially harmful to the cardiovascular system, leading to conditions like heart attacks, myocarditis, and elevated troponin levels; the risk of complications increases when pre-existing cardiac risk factors exist.</li>
<li>The virus can indirectly damage the heart by causing inflammation and blood clotting, which can lead to strokes and organ failure. Additionally, long-term symptoms might include microvascular damage and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).</li>
<li>Current treatments focus on exercise and endurance training for long COVID and POTS-like syndromes. Researchers are looking at anticoagulants and anticytokines for cardiovascular issues, but with caution due to potential risks. Vaccines provide hope, yet ongoing vigilance is vital given the virus&#39;s unpredictability.</li>

<li>The line between corporate and governmental surveillance is fading with governments purchasing personal data from data brokers; this data is originally sourced from the targeted advertising industry.</li>
<li>This practice allows government bodies to access information on billions of devices without requiring a warrant; smartphone app developers often sell user data, even to the government, which makes people more susceptible to surveillance and targeting.</li>

<li>It is argued that the Keju system monopolized the time and energy of candidates, promoted pro-autocracy values, and suppressed creativity. The article surmises that the success of Chinese autocracy could be partially due to the usage of Confucian texts in the Keju system.</li>

<li>Norway&#39;s significant drop in motor fuel sales is attributed to the high sales of electric vehicles (EVs), with over 90% of new vehicle purchases being electric.</li>
<li>The decrease in oil consumption illustrates a potential downfall for the oil industry as EV sales increase globally and could provide environmental benefits by dissuading oil companies from exploring new extraction techniques.</li>
<li>Proper oil pricing, as implemented in Norway, could encourage consumers towards more financially savvy and eco-friendly decisions, possibly leading the oil industry toward obsoleteness if the market continues to evolve organically.</li>

<li>In a lawsuit filed by Ulku Rowe, a female executive, Google has been found guilty of sexual discrimination, having favored less-experienced male colleagues with higher pay and denied her promotions for voicing complaints.</li>
<li>The jury awarded Rowe $1.1 million in damages, heralding the verdict as a validation of mistreatment allegations against Google, signaling that discrimination and retaliation in the workplace will not be tolerated.</li>
<li>This lawsuit comes after a mass protest in 2018 when over 20,000 Google employees walked out demanding changes in the wake of sexual assault allegations against an executive.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Jabber.ru, an XMPP messaging service, fell victim to a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepted encrypted traffic for up to 6 months on hosting providers Hetzner and Linode in Germany.</li>
<li>Despite the protracted nature of the attack, no evidence of server breaches or spoofing attacks was found. However, rogue TLS certificates were exploited using Let&#39;s Encrypt to hijack connections.</li>
<li>The attack primarily affected connections to the XMPP service&#39;s STARTTLS port 5222. The interception was suspected to have been either lawfully done or as a result of an intrusion into the hosting providers&#39; networks.</li>
</ul>

<li>A recent investigation reveals that tech industry and security service-affiliated organizations fund a campaign supporting the EU&#39;s proposed &quot;Chat Control&quot; regulation which is aimed to combat child sexual abuse.</li>
<li>This regulation pushes for mandatory scanning and disclosure of suspicious private messages and photos by service providers. Patrick Breyer, an EU Parliament lawmaker, criticizes EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson&#39;s involvement.</li>
<li>Advocates regard the campaign as a push for indiscriminate screening of private messages and photos, which they view as a threat to digital privacy and encryption. At present, such a law does not exist in the US.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Python steering council is considering making the global interpreter lock (GIL), a mechanism that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once, optional in future releases of Python.</li>
<li>Discussions are ongoing regarding compatibility with extensions, proposing API changes, and potential names for the non-GIL version, with &quot;free-threading&quot; and &quot;nogil&quot; as suggestions. They are also considering introducing a new Application Binary Interface (ABI) termed as &#39;abi4.</li>
<li>Final approval of the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) related to these changes is pending. The steering council is in the process of defining their acceptance criteria while discussing the potential impact on migration and perception.</li>

<li>US nonprofit hospitals are facing scrutiny for favoring executive compensation over providing charity care for low-income patients.</li>
<li>According to a report from the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, many nonprofit hospitals spend less than 2% of their revenue on charity care, while hospital CEOs receive multi-million-dollar salaries.</li>
<li>The report accuses the hospitals of price gouging and violating their nonprofit mandates. The American Hospital Association, however, protests that the report overlooks the community benefits hospitals offer.</li>
