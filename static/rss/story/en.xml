            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Eight people who have worked with Nobel laureate Katalin Karikó allege that the University of Pennsylvania consistently mishandled her and ignored her landmark studies on mRNA technology.</li>
<li>Despite Karikó&#39;s essential contributions to science, including her role in developing COVID-19 vaccines, she faced skepticism, funding obstacles, and refusal of acknowledgement from Penn&#39;s administration, resulting in her departure to BioNTech in Germany.</li>
<li>Karikó&#39;s experiences underscore the necessity for reform in how academic funding is distributed and recognition of talented scientists is provided.</li>

<li>Researchers from the University of California, Davis, and Cornell University have discovered that crushed volcanic rock added to farmland can absorb carbon dioxide, even in arid climates.</li>
<li>The method is called rock weathering, which traps carbon in soil. This process is hastened by crushing the rock into fine dust.</li>
<li>During an intense drought in California, a field study revealed that areas with crushed rock stored 0.15 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare, suggesting enhanced rock weathering as a productive instrument for carbon capture and mitigation.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>COVID-19 is potentially harmful to the cardiovascular system, leading to conditions like heart attacks, myocarditis, and elevated troponin levels; the risk of complications increases when pre-existing cardiac risk factors exist.</li>
<li>The virus can indirectly damage the heart by causing inflammation and blood clotting, which can lead to strokes and organ failure. Additionally, long-term symptoms might include microvascular damage and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).</li>
<li>Current treatments focus on exercise and endurance training for long COVID and POTS-like syndromes. Researchers are looking at anticoagulants and anticytokines for cardiovascular issues, but with caution due to potential risks. Vaccines provide hope, yet ongoing vigilance is vital given the virus&#39;s unpredictability.</li>

<li>The article critically discusses the utilization of custom parameters, notably elliptic curves, in cryptography, suggesting that these user-generated parameters may not provide substantial benefits and could pose security risks.</li>
<li>The author recommends using reliable standard parameters instead of custom ones, arguing that generating and validating these adds unnecessary complexity and could introduce potential vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>It also explores the problems faced during parameter negotiation in protocols and the benefits of using fixed parameter sets, with the final conclusion supporting the usage of fixed parameter sets in modern cryptography.</li>

<li>BioNTech has reported positive results from the phase 1/2 trials for its CAR-T cell therapy candidate, BNT211, at the ESMO Congress 2023. The therapy uses an autologous, or patient-derived, CAR-T cell (Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell) that targets the specific tumor antigen, Claudin-6 (CLDN6).</li>
<li>BNT211 is combined with a CLDN6-encoding CAR-T cell amplifying RNA vaccine called CARVac to boost the persistence of CAR-T cells, essentially enhancing the therapy&#39;s effectiveness in combating CLDN6-positive advanced solid tumors.</li>
<li>The data demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 59% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 95% in patients receiving the therapy, showing promising anti-tumor activity.</li>

<li>The Great Male Renunciation was a historical shift in Western men&#39;s fashion during the late 18th century from vibrant colors and ornate designs to simplicity and usefulness.</li>
<li>This change, first identified by John Flügel in 1930, was notably influenced by the Enlightenment ideals, the French Revolution, and societal perception of men as rational and women as emotional.</li>
<li>The movement set dark-colored clothing, pantaloons, and suits as the standard for male dressing, abandoning high heels and tight breeches, persisting until the counterculture movement in the 1960s.</li>

<li>The line between corporate and governmental surveillance is fading with governments purchasing personal data from data brokers; this data is originally sourced from the targeted advertising industry.</li>
<li>This practice allows government bodies to access information on billions of devices without requiring a warrant; smartphone app developers often sell user data, even to the government, which makes people more susceptible to surveillance and targeting.</li>
<li>Measures are underway to close the data broker loophole and enact comprehensive consumer data privacy laws that will ensure the privacy of individuals is protected.</li>

<li>The Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) report shows a noticeable drop in entrepreneurship over the last 20 years, with 100,000 fewer entrepreneurs despite a growing population.</li>
<li>The BDC suggests the necessity of developing &quot;soft skills&quot; like marketing, finance, and leadership to tackle the challenges in initiating and operating a business.</li>
<li>Factors contributing to the decline include a decreasing demographic of potential founders, low unemployment with high wages, and several discouraging factors in the business milieu. Proposals for reversing the downwards trend include scholarships for entrepreneurship and engagement of older, experienced entrepreneurs.</li>

<li>The article focuses on the historical impact of the Keju, China&#39;s civil service exam, suggesting that it promoted authority deference and collectivism; its abolition in 1905 led to regional rebellions and the collapse of the Qing dynasty.</li>
<li>The author compares the Keju system to civil service exams in the West and suggests that China&#39;s autocracy under President Xi Jinping is stronger than Russia&#39;s under Vladimir Putin.</li>
<li>It is argued that the Keju system monopolized the time and energy of candidates, promoted pro-autocracy values, and suppressed creativity. The article surmises that the success of Chinese autocracy could be partially due to the usage of Confucian texts in the Keju system.</li>

<li>Norway&#39;s significant drop in motor fuel sales is attributed to the high sales of electric vehicles (EVs), with over 90% of new vehicle purchases being electric.</li>
<li>The decrease in oil consumption illustrates a potential downfall for the oil industry as EV sales increase globally and could provide environmental benefits by dissuading oil companies from exploring new extraction techniques.</li>
<li>Proper oil pricing, as implemented in Norway, could encourage consumers towards more financially savvy and eco-friendly decisions, possibly leading the oil industry toward obsoleteness if the market continues to evolve organically.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Okta, a provider of business identity tools, has had a security breach in its customer support unit, granting hackers access for approximately two weeks until contained.</li>
<li>The breach allowed the attackers to view files uploaded by certain customers, potentially revealing sensitive data such as cookies and session tokens.</li>
<li>Despite the incident affecting a small number of customers, Okta advises all clients to cleanse credentials and tokens within files prior to sharing them and speculates that a familiar threat actor likely targeted them.</li>

<li>The Python steering council is considering making the global interpreter lock (GIL), a mechanism that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes at once, optional in future releases of Python.</li>
<li>Discussions are ongoing regarding compatibility with extensions, proposing API changes, and potential names for the non-GIL version, with &quot;free-threading&quot; and &quot;nogil&quot; as suggestions. They are also considering introducing a new Application Binary Interface (ABI) termed as &#39;abi4.</li>
<li>Final approval of the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) related to these changes is pending. The steering council is in the process of defining their acceptance criteria while discussing the potential impact on migration and perception.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Reuven, a Python and Pandas instructor, has been permanently banned from advertising on the Meta platform, previously known as Facebook.</li>
<li>It&#39;s speculated that Meta&#39;s AI system could have mistakenly linked Reuven&#39;s Python and Pandas courses with live animals, leading to the ban.</li>
<li>Despite appealing the decision, the ban&#39;s revocation appears improbable due to Meta&#39;s data retention policy. Reuven now intends to advertise his courses on other platforms and critiques Meta&#39;s dependence on AI for decisions without human oversight.</li>
