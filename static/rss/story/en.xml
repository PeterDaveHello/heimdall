      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Nvidia updated its licensing terms to prohibit using translation layers for running CUDA-based software on non-Nvidia hardware, a response to ZLUDA and Chinese GPU makers&#39; efforts.</li>
<li>The move intends to safeguard Nvidia&#39;s leadership in accelerated computing, especially in AI applications, allowing legal recompilation of CUDA programs but encouraging porting tools from competitors like AMD and Intel.</li>
<li>This adjustment may prompt a change in Nvidia&#39;s stronghold in the GPGPU sector as rivals enhance hardware while software developers explore alternative platforms.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A Stockholm University study revealed that rainwater globally is unfit for drinking due to high levels of persistent toxic chemicals called PFAS, found throughout the environment.</li>
<li>PFAS, known as &quot;forever chemicals,&quot; do not break down easily and have surpassed safe drinking water limits in rainwater, posing health risks upon consumption.</li>
<li>Despite a decline in human PFAS levels over two decades, stricter guidelines are in place due to better understanding of their harmful effects, highlighting the necessity to accept PFAS contamination as an inescapable environmental issue.</li>
