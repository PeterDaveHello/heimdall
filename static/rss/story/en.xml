<li>AlphaFold, a protein-structure prediction tool, has identified hundreds of thousands of potential psychedelic molecules that could be used in the development of new antidepressants.</li>
<li>Recent studies have shown that AlphaFold predictions are valuable for drug discovery, but relying solely on predicted structures has limitations, and more detailed experimental models are often required.</li>
<li>Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off of DeepMind, is utilizing AlphaFold in their drug discovery efforts and has secured deals with pharmaceutical companies, indicating the potential of tools like AlphaFold to greatly assist in the search for new drugs.</li>

<li>Apple developed iCloud using technologies like Cassandra and FoundationDB for storing billions of databases and enhancing user functionalities through asynchronous processing and a stateless architecture.</li>
<li>The article highlights the importance of building abstractions and understanding user needs in infrastructure design.</li>
<li>Apple faced scalability issues with Cassandra and turned to FoundationDB, which provides powerful abstractions through the FoundationDB Record Layer for applications. CloudKit, Apple&#39;s cloud service, utilizes a stateless architecture and record store abstraction for easy scalability.</li>
<li>FoundationDB helps address challenges such as personalized full-text search and high-concurrency zones, while the Record Layer improves latency and manages transaction conflicts.</li>

<li>The number 6174, known as Kaprekar&#39;s constant, is named after mathematician D.R. Kaprekar.</li>
<li>It follows a specific rule where any four-digit number with at least two different digits is arranged in descending and ascending order, the smaller number is subtracted from the bigger number, and the process is repeated.</li>
<li>This routine always reaches the fixed point of 6174 in a maximum of 7 iterations, except for repdigits like 1111. The number 6174 also has other mathematical properties, such as being a 7-smooth number and a sum of the first three powers of 18.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>FSRS is a modern spaced repetition algorithm that enhances memory retention and review scheduling compared to Anki&#39;s default algorithm.</li>
<li>It calculates optimal review intervals based on the likelihood of successfully recalling a card, using the &quot;Three Component Model of Memory&quot; and analyzing a user&#39;s review history.</li>
<li>FSRS allows users to select their preferred retention level, requires fewer reviews than Anki&#39;s default algorithm, and works effectively with delayed reviews. It also offers additional features through the FSRS4Anki Helper add-on.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author faces challenges in reverse engineering the Wi-Fi stack for the ESP32 microcontroller due to the high volume of Wi-Fi packets in the surrounding air.</li>
<li>Traditional methods, such as using a paint tin, ferrite chokes, and a turned-off microwave as a Faraday cage, prove ineffective in blocking outside packets.</li>
<li>The author discovers a research paper outlining an affordable Faraday cage made from conductive fabric and commonly available materials.</li>
<li>To reduce costs, the author plans to build the Faraday cage using wood cabinets and a lead-acid battery.</li>
<li>The constructed Faraday cage successfully blocks RF signals, allowing for more accurate analysis of the Wi-Fi stack.</li>
<li>The summary includes information on signal attenuation, a bill of materials, and detailed instructions for building the Faraday cage.</li>
