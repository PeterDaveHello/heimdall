            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Dunning-Kruger effect, which suggests that unskilled individuals overestimate their competence, is being reevaluated as a statistical artifact caused by autocorrelation.</li>
<li>Replication studies have found no evidence of the effect, questioning its existence as a psychological phenomenon.</li>
<li>Criticisms of the original study highlight statistical errors and biases, emphasizing the need for better scientific analysis and awareness of flaws in the Dunning-Kruger effect.</li>

<li>Senator Ron Wyden has expressed concerns about the Hemisphere Project, a secret surveillance program that allows US law enforcement agencies to search trillions of phone records without warrants.</li>
<li>The program involves AT&amp;T providing access to phone records dating back to 1987 and four billion call records added daily, with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy paying for this access.</li>
<li>Wyden has called for more information about the program and has questioned its legality, as it is designated as &quot;Law Enforcement Sensitive&quot; and not subject to a federal Privacy Impact Assessment.</li>

<li>The global campaign to eradicate polio is almost successful, but there are concerns about the virus lingering in labs and individuals after eradication.</li>
<li>Polio eradication efforts have been challenging due to the ability of the virus to infect people silently and the risk of the virus reemerging during the withdrawal of oral polio vaccine (OPV).</li>
<li>To prevent the reemergence of polio post-eradication, high population immunity, strong surveillance, better lab biosecurity, and development of alternative vaccines without the live virus are crucial.</li>

<li>In the U.S., the commission on home sales is normally between 5% to 6%, which is higher than in many other countries, suggesting higher costs for homebuyers and sellers.</li>
<li>This discrepancy in commissions may be due to a variety of factors such as market dynamics, regulations, and the role of agents in the home buying process.</li>

<li>Sweden&#39;s government is reversing its previous stance to phase out nuclear power by planning to build two new reactors by 2035 and a total of 10 by 2045 to meet the growing demand for clean power.</li>
<li>The government is offering loan guarantees and cost-sharing to encourage private sector investment in these nuclear projects, with state-owned companies such as Vattenfall, Fortum, and Uniper expressing interest.</li>
<li>This decision is driven by the government&#39;s projection that electricity demand will double by 2045 as the country transitions to a fossil-free society.</li>
