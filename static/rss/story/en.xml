            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article discusses the security risks associated with the reverse shell feature in Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Code.</li>
<li>It advises utilizing domain blocking and whitelisting technology to minimize these risks, though noting that Applocker&#39;s rule might not be applicable, making hash conditions a possible necessity.</li>
<li>It emphasizes that Visual Studio Code currently doesn&#39;t have inbuilt controls for this feature and advocates for enhanced security measures.</li>

<li>A study from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln revealed microwaving plastic containers releases microplastics and nanoplastics into food, potentially disrupting endocrine systems and posing health risks.</li>
<li>The &quot;microwave-safe&quot; label on plastic containers only indicates the plastic&#39;s heat resistance, not its safety. Such containers could still release harmful particles, including bisphenols and phthalates.</li>
<li>Types one and six plastics pose higher health risks when microwaved, while types two and five are considered safer. Experts recommend the use of glass containers over plastics for microwaving food.</li>

<li>The European Commission has imposed a $400 million fine on Intel for obstructing AMD&#39;s market entry by making payments to PC manufacturers from 2002 to 2007.</li>
<li>It was determined that Intel bribed PC manufacturers to delay or restrict products using AMD processors, negatively impacting competition in the x86 CPU market.</li>
<li>While Intel was fined $1.13 billion in 2009 for abuse of dominance, it still faces potential additional fines as the Commission has appealed the dismissal of the rebate component of the case.</li>

<li>Ticketmaster&#39;s &quot;Verified Fan&quot; system, initially designed to curtail scalping, is being manipulated by scalpers to their advantage.</li>
<li>Scalpers use multiple accounts, specialized internet browsers, and bulk-purchased phone numbers to boost their odds of obtaining tickets for popular concerts.</li>
<li>They can sell tickets even before they are officially on sale and substitute better tickets for the previously sold ones, indicating the system favors professional ticket buyers rather than average fans.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has initiated a rule-making process focused on eliminating medical bills from credit reports to assist families recovering from medical crises, hinder debt collectors from enforcing payment for possibly non-owed bills, and increase credit score data accuracy.</li>
<li>According to CFPB&#39;s investigation, medical billing data has lower predictability concerning repayment against conventional credit obligations and is frequently riddled with errors. Proposed rules would ban companies from including medical debt in credit reports and creditors from using this information for their underwriting decisions.</li>
<li>Furthermore, CFPB aims to thwart debt collectors from exploiting the credit reporting system to push consumers into paying dubious debts. The bureau is also assessing several other proposals related to data brokers and continues to communicate with the public regarding high-cost specialty financial products linked to medical billing practices.</li>

<li>Delta Air Lines has modified its SkyMiles program making it more challenging for customers to earn status and benefits, reflecting broader issues within the American air-travel industry.</li>
<li>Deregulation of airlines in 1978 led to creation of loyalty programs and sale of airline points, partnering with banks and credit card companies, which became a significant revenue source. This shift towards spending focus, rather than mileage, can be disadvantageous to consumers without points-earning cards.</li>
<li>The article suggests that the promised benefits of airline deregulation have not materialized and that revisiting regulations could help improve the financialization of airlines and consumer air travel experience.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A new study indicates that the effects of lead poisoning on global health are more severe than previously believed, possibly causing over five million deaths annually and a significant decrease in child IQ.</li>
<li>According to the study, 5.5 million deaths in 2019 were due to heart disease caused by lead exposure, six times higher than old estimates. It also led to an aggregate loss of 765 million IQ points among children under five globally in 2019.</li>
<li>This research is the first to appraise the influence of lead exposure on heart disease mortality and IQ loss in children across developed and under-developed nations, yet it is subject to uncertainties and needs further validation.</li>

<li>NASA&#39;s James Webb Space Telescope has found carbon on the surface of Jupiter&#39;s moon, Europa, suggesting a potentially habitable environment in its subsurface ocean.</li>
<li>The presence of carbon, a crucial element for life, was unconfirmed until this discovery; it&#39;s assumed to originate from Europa&#39;s ocean beneath the icy crust.</li>
<li>NASA plans to launch the Europa Clipper spacecraft in 2024 for further exploration, even though the Webb telescope did not observe evidence of water vapor plumes on Europa&#39;s surface.</li>

<li>The issue at hand is the unnecessary inclusion of polyfills in npm packages, resulting in larger than required node_modules folders.</li>
<li>Numerous packages, including &quot;eslint-plugin-react&quot;, are importing and directly calling polyfill functions, an inefficient practice as these jobs are already widely supported in JavaScript.</li>
<li>The post suggests the JavaScript ecosystem needs a reevaluation of dependency use to improve efficiency and decrease wasted disk space. By eliminating unnecessary polyfills, the dependency count in projects can significantly drop.</li>

<li>The &quot;Think Family Education&quot; (TFE) app, utilized by over 100 schools in Bristol, to monitor students and their family backgrounds, has spurred concerns.</li>
<li>Critics argue that the app, providing access to family contacts with police and welfare services, could potentially enhance discrimination against students from minority ethnic or working-class backgrounds.</li>
<li>While Bristol city council and Avon and Somerset police uphold that the app is for child protection, not criminalization, critics counter that it may inadvertently profile minority children as involved in criminal activities.</li>

<li>The implemented algorithm calculates the NCD between test and training samples and predicts labels based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors, achieving approximately 78% accuracy.</li>
<li>The post also references a previous experiment with a similar but less successful approach, and presents a less obscured version of their algorithm for better understanding.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The UK Parliament has passed the Online Safety Bill (OSB), which according to them will make the UK the safest place to be online. However, critics argue that this could lead to increased internet censorship for British users.</li>
<li>The bill allows the government to demand tech companies scan all user&#39;s messages and files, potentially compromising end-to-end encryption. Experts argue that this can threaten privacy and security universally.</li>
<li>The OSB grants the government the authority to censor content and implement age-gating systems, potentially restricting access to anonymous and private speech, posing potential threats to rights and security.</li>

<li>British freelancer journalist, Matt Broomfield, was detained by counter-terrorism police at Luton airport under schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which allows for questioning without arrest at airports.</li>
<li>Broomfield was held for five hours, his electronic devices were seized, and he was questioned about his reporting, specifically about the Kurdish issue, and his opinions of the British state.</li>
<li>The National Union of Journalists has intervened, writing to the counter-terrorism police to demand a justification for the detainment and the return of his belongings, as the powers provided by schedule 7 are criticized as overused and potentially tantamount to harassment.</li>

<li>The Linux kernel is shortening its long-term support (LTS) period from six years to two years, caused by limited usage, support issues and challenges posed to unpaid maintainers.</li>
<li>The shift could affect Android devices that generally have longer development cycles and require support for older kernels.</li>
<li>Google has improved its Android kernel development process with the Generic Kernel Image (GKI) and plans to shift to mainline Linux, which could mitigate this change&#39;s impacts. The LTS modification could potentially influence the support timeline for embedded and Android devices down the line.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Go 1.22, the next release of the Go programming language, will modify the scoping of &#39;for&#39; loops to prevent a common programming error where the loop variable assumes an undesired value. This change aims to manage references to loop variables outliving their iteration.</li>
<li>The revised semantics of &#39;for&#39; loops will be applicable only to packages within modules that declare Go 1.22 or later, ensuring backward compatibility as older code will operate as before.</li>
<li>A preview of the scoping change is included in Go 1.21 and can be activated with the GOEXPERIMENT=loopvar environment variable. Some code and tests may require modifications to align with the new loop semantics.</li>

<li>Unix shells are losing their efficacy as access control mechanisms in modern Unix environments due to the focus of many services solely on Unix logins for authentication, disregarding the login&#39;s shell.</li>
<li>Authentication services often fail to recognize the login&#39;s shell, creating challenges in restricting certain logins from accessing particular services.</li>
<li>Viable solutions include scrambling the login&#39;s password or completely excluding the login from authentication data sources.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Carrefour, a French supermarket chain, has introduced labels warning shoppers of &quot;shrinkflation,&quot; a situation where manufacturers reduce pack sizes rather than raising prices.</li>
<li>It has implemented this strategy to pressure major suppliers like Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Unilever before contract negotiations. Carrefour identified 26 products to exhibit this practice, with plans for similar labeling if the suppliers don&#39;t agree to price cuts.</li>
<li>Carrefour&#39;s CEO, Alexandre Bompard, critiqued these companies for not assisting in lowering prices, considering the drop in raw material costs.</li>

<li>Researchers from the University of Chicago&#39;s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering have created an &#39;inverse vaccine&#39; to potentially cure autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes.</li>
<li>Contrary to traditional vaccines that train the immune system to identify and combat viruses or bacteria, this new vaccine eliminates the immune system&#39;s recognition of a specific molecule, avoiding autoimmune reactions.</li>
<li>The &#39;inverse vaccine&#39; uses the liver&#39;s process to flag molecules from deteriorating cells with &#39;do not attack&#39; labels. Preliminary lab tests show the vaccine effectively reversed multiple sclerosis-related autoimmune reactions, and safety trials have already commenced.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>California has passed an extensive right-to-repair bill, obliging vendors to supply parts, tools, repair guides, and essential software for consumer electronics and appliances.</li>
<li>The bill surpasses other state laws, demanding vendors offer such items for products sold from July 1, 2021, for a duration determined by the product&#39;s cost. The legislation includes enforcement provisions and mandates repair vendors to disclose the usage of &quot;non-authorized&quot; parts.</li>
<li>Apple supported this bill, underlining its products’ increased repairability and durability. This legislation, along with similar laws in other states and Europe, may motivate manufacturers to provide globally repairable and sustainable products.</li>
