            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>This article examines the transformation of text-based IDEs throughout three decades and compares them to contemporary IDEs.</li>
<li>The author shares their firsthand encounters with older IDEs such as SideKick Plus and Turbo Pascal, emphasizing their characteristics and user-friendliness.</li>
<li>Despite the decline in popularity of text-based user interfaces (TUIs) in software development due to graphical operating systems, TUI IDEs are making a resurgence with the introduction of the Language Server Protocol (LSP).</li>
<li>While some enhancements have been implemented in modern IDEs, the fundamental functionality has largely stayed the same.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The FDA has issued a warning letter to Amazon for distributing products that violate federal regulations.</li>
<li>The products contain undisclosed pharmaceutical ingredients, including sildenafil and tadalafil, which can have dangerous side effects.</li>
<li>The FDA considers these products to be unapproved drugs, as they do not meet the definition of dietary supplements, and has requested a written response from Amazon addressing the violations. Additionally, specific products stored in Amazon&#39;s fulfillment centers, such as WeFun Capsules, have been recalled due to the presence of undisclosed drug ingredients.</li>

<li>The Times argues that these AI models compete directly with its content, leading to a loss of revenue and damaging its relationship with readers.</li>
<li>The publication is seeking billions of dollars in damages and wants the court to prohibit OpenAI and Microsoft from using its content in their AI models.

<li>In the early 20th century, goitres and related medical conditions were highly prevalent in Switzerland, causing swelling of the neck and significant health and economic impacts for families.</li>
<li>The cause of goitres was found to be iodine deficiency, and the solution was the introduction of iodised salt, although it faced initial opposition.</li>
<li>The implementation of iodised salt in Switzerland resulted in a significant reduction in goitre rates, but the achievements of those involved have been overshadowed by the opposition of Dr. Eugen Bircher.</li>

<li>The attackers exploited an undisclosed hardware feature to gain unprecedented access and installed spyware that transmitted sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers.</li>
<li>Apple has since patched the four critical zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by the campaign, but the secret hardware function used to bypass memory protections was also found in Apple&#39;s M1 and M2 CPUs, raising concerns about the security of other Apple devices.-</li>

<li>They use a Python program to generate a C program that can handle this problem for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers.</li>
<li>However, they encounter limitations with the compiler and executable file size when scaling up.</li>
<li>To overcome these limitations, they manually write x86-64 assembly code and create a function to check if a 32-bit number is even or odd.</li>
<li>The program is shown to be performant and capable of handling a wide range of numbers.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Apple is still providing security updates for older devices like the iPhone 6S, but they only address certain security issues.</li>
<li>A vulnerability in Google Chrome&#39;s Blink rendering engine that can expose system files is also present in Chrome for iOS.</li>
<li>Exploiting this vulnerability on the latest version of iOS allows attackers to steal internal system files, including contact information, call and SMS history, browsing history, and cookies.</li>
<li>Apple&#39;s response implies they may only patch vulnerabilities in older iOS versions if they are actively being exploited.</li>
<li>This raises concerns about the effectiveness of iOS security updates for older devices.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Moderna and Merck have collaborated to develop an mRNA-based cancer vaccine called mRNA-4157.</li>
<li>The vaccine has shown promising results in preventing melanoma recurrence or death when combined with Merck&#39;s Keytruda treatment.</li>
<li>In a phase 2b study, the combination therapy reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 49% after three years compared to Keytruda alone.</li>
<li>These positive findings have led to the launch of a phase 3 trial for the combination therapy.</li>
<li>The vaccine may potentially be available for accelerated approval in some countries by 2025.</li>
<li>Moderna and Merck are also exploring the use of the vaccine in other types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung cancer.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has signed a bill requiring limited liability companies (LLCs) to disclose their &quot;beneficial owners.&quot;</li>
<li>However, she has prevented public access to the database containing this information, raising concerns about transparency.</li>
<li>Hochul also vetoed a bill that aimed to ban noncompete agreements and another that would have required New York City to install recycling bins in certain areas.</li>
<li>On the positive side, she approved a bill that will move many county- and town-level elections to even-numbered years.</li>
<li>Critics argue that these changes could potentially benefit Democrats and have a negative impact on local communities.</li>
<li>Five pieces of legislation are still pending approval or rejection by the end of the year, adding to the ongoing changes in New York&#39;s legal landscape.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article examines various techniques and strategies for optimizing the speed and efficiency of autoregressive language model (LLM) inference.</li>
<li>Topics covered include hardware utilization, compilers, batching, model weight reduction, quantization, KV caching, multi-query attention, speculative decoding, and improving structured data generation.</li>
<li>The goal of these optimizations is to improve the overall performance and reliability of LLM inference, with potential for non-Transformer models to rival Transformers in the future.</li>

<li>Two recent court cases in Germany have focused on the battle for user control over technology, specifically in relation to adblockers.</li>
<li>Axel Springer SE, a major publishing company, sued Eyeo GmbH, the creator of Adblock Plus, for blocking their advertisements.</li>
<li>The court ruled in favor of Eyeo, affirming that users have the right to decide whether or not to use adblockers and that it does not violate copyright laws. However, Axel Springer was allowed to exclude users with adblockers from accessing their content and potentially implement a paid model.</li>
<li>These cases establish important legal precedents regarding user freedom and the right to make individual choices while using the internet.</li>

<li>FDA regulations contained a loophole that allowed ineffective OTC decongestant drugs to be approved and sold to consumers.</li>
<li>It took more than ten years for the FDA to agree with the findings of two pharmacists who conducted research and petitioned for the removal of products containing oral phenylephrine from shelves.</li>
<li>This case highlights the necessity of reevaluating the regulatory process for pre-1962 approved OTC drugs and allocating additional funding for independent research on these products. Consumers are also encouraged to consult with pharmacists and advocate for modern scientific reviews of older OTC products.</li>

<li>While Google claims this enhances privacy, browsing habits are still tracked for targeted ads.

<li>High levels of ENPP1 are associated with resistance to immunotherapy and an increased risk of metastasis.</li>
<li>This discovery could lead to the development of better immunotherapies and help predict patient responses to current treatments. Additionally, targeting ENPP1 may enhance the effectiveness of existing therapies. ENPP1 may also be relevant in other &quot;cold&quot; tumors like lung and pancreatic cancer.</li>

<li>Former Eastern Municipal Water District worker, Gary Mund, is suing Syngenta, alleging that exposure to the herbicide paraquat caused his Parkinson&#39;s disease.</li>
<li>Paraquat is banned in 58 countries but still widely used in the US, raising concerns about its potential health risks.</li>
<li>Studies have indicated that paraquat can replicate the symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease in animals, although Syngenta disputes any causal connection. Advocacy groups like Earthjustice and the Michael J. Fox Foundation are calling for a ban on paraquat due to these potential risks.</li>
