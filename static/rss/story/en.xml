            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>SB 1047, a bill in California, poses risks to open-source AI and tech industry by establishing a Frontier Model Division staffed by Effective Altruism activists with policing powers, potentially leading to the imprisonment of model developers.</li>
<li>The bill is swiftly progressing through the state Senate and has global repercussions due to California&#39;s high concentration of cloud and AI companies, requiring prompt action such as submitting opposition letters, contributing to an analysis document, and raising awareness on social media.</li>
<li>Urgent collective efforts are crucial to halt the bill&#39;s passage, emphasizing the need for immediate engagement and involving others in the advocacy against SB 1047.</li>
</ul>
