<li>The Etak Navigator, launched in 1985, was the first practical vehicle navigation system using augmented dead reckoning and a moving map display, setting the foundation for modern navigation technology.</li>
<li>Despite lacking turn-by-turn directions, it introduced address search and real-time map display features, influencing future mapping systems.</li>
<li>Etak&#39;s innovative approach led to the creation of the symbol depicting vehicle location in navigation apps today, inspired by Atari&#39;s spaceship symbol, and its acquisition by News Corporation later contributed to TomTom&#39;s development.</li>
