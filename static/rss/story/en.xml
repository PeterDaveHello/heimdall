<li>The paper delves into the fractal properties of the boundary separating stable and divergent training in neural networks, likening it to fractals such as the Mandelbrot set.</li>
<li>It experimentally shows that this boundary exhibits fractal characteristics across various setups, emphasizing how neural network training is highly sensitive to minor hyperparameter adjustments.</li>
<li>The findings indicate potential insights into the trainability of neural networks, shedding light on the implications of this fractal nature in training processes.</li>

<li>Apple has admitted to deliberately disabling progressive web apps (PWAs) on iPhones in the EU, citing compliance with the new Digital Markets Act regulation as the reason.</li>
<li>The complexity of the regulation&#39;s requirement to allow multiple browser engines led to the elimination of PWA functionality on iOS 17.4 beta, downgrading PWAs to mere website shortcuts.</li>
<li>This move has caused significant problems for users, including data loss and non-functioning notifications, making it impractical for Apple to continue supporting PWAs in the EU.</li>

<li>Physicists are continuing to investigate the intricate nature of protons, as they have been found to exhibit various forms depending on observation.</li>
<li>Recent research has revealed that protons contain charm quarks that are actually heavier than the proton itself, challenging the traditional understanding of proton composition.</li>
<li>The conventional quark model, which posits that protons are composed of three quarks, is considered to be an oversimplification in light of these findings.</li>
<li>Machine learning analysis has demonstrated that protons can exist in multiple states, including a rare state featuring five quarks.</li>
<li>Understanding the composition of protons is crucial for experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider and for studying cosmic rays.</li>
<li>Future experiments aim to delve deeper into the structure of protons, providing more comprehensive information in this field.</li>

<li>A built-in workaround in macOS allows users to adjust whitespace settings in the menu bar to display more application icons and prevent them from being hidden under the notch on new MacBook Pro models.</li>
<li>By using Terminal.app and executing specific commands, users can modify the padding and spacing in the menu bar. A value of 6 proved effective in accommodating more icons.</li>
<li>It&#39;s important to note that continuously adding more apps to the menu bar will still cause the same issue, and users can revert back to the original settings if desired.</li>

<li>Amazon Prime Video has quietly removed support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos from its ad-supported tier, leaving subscribers unaware of the change.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author discovers a connection between fractals and neural network training, revealing that the boundary between successful and unsuccessful training exhibits a fractal structure.</li>
<li>Adjusting hyperparameters, like the learning rate, has an impact on the training process, with the best-performing hyperparameters typically found near the convergence-divergence boundary.</li>
<li>Fractal patterns emerge when zooming in on specific training configurations, due to the repeated iteration of functions and the occurrence of bifurcation boundaries. Neural network-generated fractals differ from those produced by low order polynomials in that they appear more organic and lack obvious symmetries.</li>
