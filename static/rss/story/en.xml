<li>The author recounts their experience of using a commitment contract to write a novel and shares their iteration process called the plan, do, learn loop.</li>
<li>Key concepts of effective planning and execution are explained using the acronyms AIM (Plan) and FIRE (Do).</li>
<li>The importance of improvisation, resourcefulness, and focus in achieving successful outcomes is emphasized, along with the use of extra-mental resources and objective scoring to measure performance. The author also discusses their personal scoring system and the value of critiquing and adjusting one&#39;s performance.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Python 3.13 might introduce a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler to enhance code performance.</li>
<li>The JIT compiler compiles code into machine code on demand, removing the need for a bytecode interpreter loop.</li>
<li>The new JIT compiler, a copy-and-patch JIT approach, converts high-level bytecodes into lower-level instructions in an Intermediate Language (IL) to optimize code execution.</li>
<li>Initial benchmarks indicate a 2-9% performance improvement, although the impact on benchmarks may not be substantial.</li>
<li>This JIT compiler lays the foundation for future significant optimizations in Python.</li>

<li>United Airlines has discovered loose bolts and other parts on the plug doors of its Boeing 737 Max 9 jets during inspections following a rapid depressurization incident on an Alaska Airlines plane of the same model.</li>
<li>At least five United aircraft have been found to have these loose parts, raising concerns about the assembly and quality checks of the aircraft structure by Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems.</li>
<li>Alaska Airlines has also confirmed issues with its plug doors, and the specific locations of the loose parts vary among the affected aircraft. The FAA must approve inspection processes before inspections can commence.</li>

<li>The article explores the role of the cerebellum in controlling movement and its significance in motor skills.</li>
<li>It highlights the unique features of the cerebellum, such as Purkinje cells, and how they contribute to enhancing cognition.</li>
<li>The study challenges traditional notions of learning by demonstrating that learning can occur within individual cells in the cerebellum.</li>
<li>Dysmetria, difficulty in accurately estimating distance and speed, is a common symptom of cerebellar damage.</li>
<li>Patients with cerebellar damage also struggle with tasks requiring attention switching.</li>
<li>The cerebellum is involved in anticipation, prediction, and generating a predictive model of the world.</li>
<li>It plays a crucial role in generating quick predictions for action and is connected to various parts of the cerebrum involved in cognitive processes.</li>
<li>Damage to the cerebellum can result in clumsy and disproportionate actions.</li>
<li>The concept of embodied cognition, where cognitive functions are closely linked to sensorimotor functions, is supported.</li>
<li>The article concludes by mentioning the perspectives of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform theories in relation to embodied cognition.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Failure to Act: Consequences and Accountability in Scientific Misconduct]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A chemistry lab in CNRS-Université Sorbonne Paris Nord has been found to have multiple scientific articles with manipulated and recycled data.</li>
<li>Instead of retracting the articles, CNRS requested corrections and imposed a one-month exclusion from duties on the responsible scientist.</li>
<li>The authors argue for prompt investigation of research misconduct, transparent reporting of results, immediate retractions of articles with serious errors, and the return of research funding used for fraudulent research. They emphasize the negative consequences of failing to address misconduct effectively, such as hindering scientific progress, eroding public trust, and enabling dishonest scientists to compete with honest ones. Institutions protecting researchers involved in misconduct are criticized.</li>

<li>The CultriX/MistralTrix-v1 model is a transformer model designed for text generation and trained on the English language.</li>
<li>It has been fine-tuned using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and performs better than the original model on different benchmarks.</li>
<li>The model, with a size of 8.99B parameters, was trained on a single Colab GPU in a short time and is available for download on Google Colab and GitHub. However, it&#39;s important to note that the model is still in the experimental stage and the creator acknowledges being a novice in this field.</li>

<li>Global Fishing Watch has conducted research using AI and satellite imagery to create the first global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure, revealing previously unknown industrial activity in the ocean.</li>
<li>The study discovered that 75% of the world&#39;s industrial fishing vessels are not visible to the public.</li>
<li>&quot;Dark fleets&quot; were identified operating in marine protected areas, and there is a high concentration of vessels in Asian waters compared to Europe.</li>
<li>The research indicates a decline in fishing activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while offshore energy development, particularly wind turbines, increased.</li>
<li>This technology has the potential to contribute to addressing climate change and improve marine management and transparency efforts.</li>

<li>The platform&#39;s unique approach to game creation and its use of generative AI sets it apart from other game engines, and it operates on a business model similar to Roblox, allowing developers to charge users and taking a cut of the revenue.

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Passing structs larger than 16 bytes on AMD64 can significantly slow down code execution.</li>
<li>Changing arrays to be passed as three separate pointer parameters instead of one struct parameter improved the performance of the Neat language by a factor of two.</li>
<li>This improvement is due to the fact that structs larger than 16 bytes are passed by pointer in the SystemV AMD64 ABI specification, resulting in extra stack rearrangement for function calls. By passing arrays as separate pointer parameters, the values are already in SSE registers and do not need to be loaded from the stack, resulting in faster execution.</li>
