      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Carrefour, a French supermarket chain, has introduced labels warning shoppers of &quot;shrinkflation,&quot; a situation where manufacturers reduce pack sizes rather than raising prices.</li>
<li>It has implemented this strategy to pressure major suppliers like Nestlé, PepsiCo, and Unilever before contract negotiations. Carrefour identified 26 products to exhibit this practice, with plans for similar labeling if the suppliers don&#39;t agree to price cuts.</li>
<li>Carrefour&#39;s CEO, Alexandre Bompard, critiqued these companies for not assisting in lowering prices, considering the drop in raw material costs.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers from the University of Chicago&#39;s Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering have created an &#39;inverse vaccine&#39; to potentially cure autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes.</li>
<li>Contrary to traditional vaccines that train the immune system to identify and combat viruses or bacteria, this new vaccine eliminates the immune system&#39;s recognition of a specific molecule, avoiding autoimmune reactions.</li>
<li>The &#39;inverse vaccine&#39; uses the liver&#39;s process to flag molecules from deteriorating cells with &#39;do not attack&#39; labels. Preliminary lab tests show the vaccine effectively reversed multiple sclerosis-related autoimmune reactions, and safety trials have already commenced.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Unity, a game development platform, quietly removed a GitHub repository that kept track of changes to its terms of service (ToS) and a clause allowing developers to utilize older versions of the game engine.</li>
<li>The repository&#39;s deletion makes the webpage no longer accessible, with the last availability being July 16, 2022.</li>
<li>Key changes in Unity&#39;s ToS have included the removal of a clause (in April 2023) permitting developers to use software versions of the current year as per the terms at the time of the update; this compels users to comply with all Unity&#39;s service changes, such as the recent pricing plan update charging developers for each game installation.</li>

<li>Retool, a platform for creating internal tools, faced a spear phishing attack that led to unauthorized access to 27 cloud customer accounts, revealing the vulnerability of the system to social engineering attacks.</li>
<li>The attack took place when an employee succumbed to an SMS-based phishing attack and provided multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes, which subsequently compromised company&#39;s VPN and internal admin systems.</li>
<li>Retool recommends improving security, such as avoiding the storage of MFA codes in the cloud, promoting employee training and the use of hardware security keys for MFA, and adopting defense-in-depth strategies. The company is now collaborating with law enforcement and a forensics firm to probe the incident.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Unity Technologies is introducing a change in pricing and packaging of their Unity software commencing from January 1, 2024. The updates include a new Unity Runtime Fee based on game installations, applicable only to games hitting certain revenue and install benchmarks.</li>
<li>Unity will enhance their subscription plans with extra features such as cloud-based asset storage, Unity DevOps tools, and AI at runtime without increasing the cost. It also appears Unity Personal will remain available to all users irrespective of their revenue generation.</li>
<li>By November, new tools and services are to be added to Unity&#39;s subscription plans without a surge in seat pricing. Unity Plus will be phased out for new subscribers, current ones, however, will have the chance to upgrade to Unity Pro.</li>

<li>Sweden is moving away from digital-centric education toward traditional teaching methods, like paper books and handwriting, due to concerns about screen time and falling reading skills.</li>
<li>Though UNESCO advocates for the right blend of technology in education, it stresses the vital role of in-person, teacher-led learning.</li>
<li>The shift in Sweden&#39;s approach might also be politically and ideologically motivated, contrasting other countries like Germany, which is lagging in digitalization efforts in education.</li>

<li>Mastodon.energy is a server tailored to professionals and academia, focused on discussions about energy transition initiatives including policy, infrastructure, technology, journalism, and science.</li>
<li>The platform&#39;s recent discussions revolve around the preventative detention of climate activists in Bavaria, Germany, who may protest at the car industry exposition IAA in Munich.</li>
<li>The detention, which can last up to 60 days, has been criticized by members on the server who have drawn parallels with similar cases in other countries, viewing it as an attempt to criminalize climate activism.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The new research presented at the American Heart Association&#39;s Hypertension Scientific Sessions 2023 links high blood pressure while lying down to an increased risk of heart-related conditions and premature death.</li>
<li>The study, which incorporated data from over 11,000 adults, found that individuals with high blood pressure, either when seated or lying down, faced the highest risks. However, even those who had high pressure only when lying were at comparable risk levels.</li>
<li>The type of blood pressure medication taken did not impact the level of risk. Therefore, researchers suggest blood pressure should be measured while lying flat on the back for a more accurate assessment of cardiovascular disease risk.</li>

<li>NASA&#39;s James Webb Space Telescope has detected methane and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18 b, reinforcing the possibility that this planet may harbor a water ocean beneath its hydrogen-rich atmosphere.</li>
<li>These findings suggest that K2-18 b could potentially host life, aligning with the current theories proposing the planet as a Hycean exoplanet, a type considered favorable for extraterrestrial life.</li>
<li>In addition to methane and carbon dioxide, the telescope&#39;s observations hint at dimethyl sulfide, a molecule generally produced by life, further asserting the potential for life on K2-18 b.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author clarifies the purpose of Async Rust, a programming language focusing on modern concurrency, differentiating between parallelism and concurrency and outlining the limitations of code-splitting.</li>
<li>Mutex-based concurrency is deemed detrimental due to risks of race conditions and deadlocks; thus, use of channels - or queues - for inter-thread communication is advised. However, for high-level concurrency problems, threads might not suffice, prompting Rust&#39;s &quot;async/await&quot; model.</li>
<li>Despite these advantages, Async Rust presents challenges, such as ensuring compiler safety of objects and ubiquitous use of Arc (Atomic Reference Count). The suitability of Rust&#39;s massively concurrent userspace software application remains questionable.</li>
</ul>

<li>A new study by the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and various universities reveals that air pollution hinders bees&#39; ability to find flowers as ozone degrades the scent of flowers.</li>
<li>The study found a reduction of up to 90% in honeybees&#39; odor recognition ability, indicating potential adverse effects on wildflower abundance and crop yields, as bees play a crucial role in pollination vital for food security.</li>
<li>The research also indicates that ozone may affect other odor-influenced behaviors of insects, such as mate attraction, enforcing the need for action on air pollution to safeguard food production and biodiversity.</li>

<li>Microsoft has shared the results of its investigation into the Storm-0558 actor who used a consumer key to breach OWA and Outlook.com.</li>
<li>Findings reveal that a crash dump in April 2021 contained the signing key, later shifted to the debugging environment within the corporate network. Hereafter, a Microsoft engineer&#39;s corporate account was compromised by the actor to gain this key.</li>
<li>Microsoft also discovered a library error that let the mail system accept enterprise email requests signed with the consumer key, which the company has since rectified.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists have discovered a new species of rove beetle that mimics the physical appearance of termites to trick them into providing food.</li>
<li>The beetle resembles termites&#39; body segments and features closely, enabling it to evade detection within termite nests.</li>
<li>Instead of consuming termite eggs or larvae, the beetle likely mimics their behavior, &quot;begging&quot; for food and thus securing itself a constant source of sustenance.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein advocates for socialism as a resolution to societal crises, emphasizing the importance of a supranational organization to mitigate potential conflict.</li>
<li>He denotes a marked distinction between the social behavior of humans and animals, arguing that our present economic system promotes self-interest and disparity.</li>
<li>Einstein suggests that socialism, combined with an education structure centered on social objectives, could address societal issues, although he does recognize its inherent challenges and emphasizes the significance of free and open discussion on these matters.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author points out a shift in business software models, transitioning from owning software to subscribing under the Software as a Service (SaaS) model.</li>
<li>They contend that while SaaS has been financially rewarding for software vendors, this trend appears to be subsiding with the enhancement of self-hosting technology and organizations&#39; desire for greater control.</li>
<li>The author introduces &quot;ONCE&quot;, a forthcoming series of software tools that can be owned indefinitely with a single payment, signifying a potential post-SaaS era and planned to be unveiled in late 2023.</li>
