            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Perfectionism and procrastination are often linked because perfectionists have a fear of making mistakes and being criticized, causing them to delay tasks.</li>
<li>However, not all perfectionists procrastinate, as some are motivated to submit work on time in order to meet high standards.</li>
<li>The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination depends on factors like the type of perfectionism and self-efficacy. Anxiety, fear of failure, and depression can also contribute to procrastination, which may be associated with perfectionism.</li>
<li>To address perfectionistic procrastination, individuals can set realistic goals, focus on themselves, address their fears, consider the negative impact of perfectionism, and develop self-efficacy and self-compassion.</li>
<li>Various anti-procrastination techniques, such as breaking tasks into smaller steps and scheduling work according to productivity cycles, can also be effective in overcoming procrastination.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Chris Siebenmann challenges the reliability of email addresses as permanent identifiers for user accounts.</li>
<li>Email addresses can change within organizations and can be reused or reassigned, making them unreliable for long-term identification.</li>
<li>Siebenmann recommends using internal IDs that are unique and meaningless for account identification, even if email addresses are used for account recovery purposes.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Bun is a new JavaScript runtime that is known for its speed and is built on JavaScriptCore, unlike Node and Deno which are built on V8.</li>
<li>JavaScriptCore has a niche optimization feature called Tail Call Optimization (TCO), which allows for recursion without exceeding the call stack.</li>
<li>While TCO can be implemented in Bun by rewriting functions and moving state to arguments, the TCO solution in Bun is slower than the original for loop solution. However, using mutation can achieve similar performance in a recursive solution.</li>
<li>TCO enables programmers to express complex and efficient programs without relying on imperative loops.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>DRµGS is a repository that introduces a method called Deep Random Micro-Glitch Sampling (DRµGS) to inject noise into transformer layers during inference, increasing output variety while maintaining coherence.</li>
<li>The repository currently supports LLaMA and mistral models, providing implementations and experimental data for four types of DRµGs: Q, K, V, and A.</li>
<li>Potential negative side effects of DRµGS are addressed with a &quot;cold_shower&quot; function included in the repository.</li>
<li>Visualizations are available to showcase the effects of injecting noise at different layers of the model.</li>
<li>Contributions and experimentation with DRµGS are encouraged.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The append-only b+tree is a data structure commonly used for efficient storage and retrieval of data.</li>
<li>It is made up of branch and leaf pages, with the leaf pages containing the actual data and keys.</li>
<li>Rather than supporting leaf chaining for sequential access, each update involves appending a new page to the file and updating the parent pages, ensuring a consistent snapshot of the database without the need for a transaction log. This approach is more efficient for writing consecutive pages to disk, but may waste disk space.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In the early 20th century, goitres and related medical conditions were highly prevalent in Switzerland, causing swelling of the neck and significant health and economic impacts for families.</li>
<li>The cause of goitres was found to be iodine deficiency, and the solution was the introduction of iodised salt, although it faced initial opposition.</li>
<li>The implementation of iodised salt in Switzerland resulted in a significant reduction in goitre rates, but the achievements of those involved have been overshadowed by the opposition of Dr. Eugen Bircher.</li>

<li>The &quot;Triangulation&quot; campaign targeted and compromised numerous iPhones, including those owned by employees of Kaspersky, a security firm based in Moscow, over a period of four years.</li>
<li>The attackers exploited an undisclosed hardware feature to gain unprecedented access and installed spyware that transmitted sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers.</li>
<li>Apple has since patched the four critical zero-day vulnerabilities exploited by the campaign, but the secret hardware function used to bypass memory protections was also found in Apple&#39;s M1 and M2 CPUs, raising concerns about the security of other Apple devices.-</li>

<li>The author explores the problem of determining whether a number is odd or even using a large number of if statements.</li>
<li>They use a Python program to generate a C program that can handle this problem for 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit integers.</li>
<li>However, they encounter limitations with the compiler and executable file size when scaling up.</li>
<li>To overcome these limitations, they manually write x86-64 assembly code and create a function to check if a 32-bit number is even or odd.</li>
<li>The program is shown to be performant and capable of handling a wide range of numbers.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Starting from January 29th, Amazon Prime Video will introduce limited advertisements, unless customers opt for an ad-free experience by paying an extra $2.99 per month.</li>
<li>The purpose of this move is to enable Amazon to invest in content and better compete with other streaming services.</li>
<li>While the monthly cost of Amazon Prime will remain the same, the ad-free streaming option will increase the total cost to just under $18, aligning with the approaches of other streaming services like Disney Plus and Netflix, which include ads on their cheaper plans.</li>
