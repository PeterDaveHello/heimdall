            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>According to Larry Wall, the original author of Perl, there are three main virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris.</li>
<li>Laziness encourages the creation of efficient and useful programs and documentation.</li>
<li>Impatience drives the creation of programs that anticipate and meet user needs.</li>
<li>Hubris motivates programmers to create and maintain programs that are highly regarded by others.</li>

<li>The Canadian government is considering banning the Flipper Zero, a handheld hacking device popular on TikTok, due to concerns about car theft.</li>
<li>Experts argue that the device is being unfairly targeted and that there is no evidence of its significant role in car theft.</li>
<li>Banning the device could impede the work of security researchers and would not necessarily deter determined car thieves from accessing other tools.</li>
<li>The company behind Flipper Zero asserts that the device cannot hijack modern cars with rolling codes and has implemented safeguards against malicious use.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Physicists are continuing to investigate the intricate nature of protons, as they have been found to exhibit various forms depending on observation.</li>
<li>Recent research has revealed that protons contain charm quarks that are actually heavier than the proton itself, challenging the traditional understanding of proton composition.</li>
<li>The conventional quark model, which posits that protons are composed of three quarks, is considered to be an oversimplification in light of these findings.</li>
<li>Machine learning analysis has demonstrated that protons can exist in multiple states, including a rare state featuring five quarks.</li>
<li>Understanding the composition of protons is crucial for experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider and for studying cosmic rays.</li>
<li>Future experiments aim to delve deeper into the structure of protons, providing more comprehensive information in this field.</li>

<li>Cloudflare has emerged victorious in a trial against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks.</li>
<li>The jury concluded that Cloudflare did not infringe on the asserted patent and declared Sable&#39;s patent claims invalid.</li>
<li>The win can be attributed to the efforts of Cloudflare&#39;s legal team, external counsel, and participants in the Project Jengo initiative, which rewards individuals for providing evidence that invalidates patent trolls&#39; claims.</li>
<li>Cloudflare&#39;s success in invalidating parts of three Sable patents has limited their ability to file lawsuits against other companies.</li>
<li>The case underscores the high costs and risks associated with patent litigation and sends a warning to patent trolls that Cloudflare will not be easily intimidated.</li>

<li>AMD has financially supported the development of an open-source drop-in CUDA implementation called ZLUDA, which enables NVIDIA CUDA applications to run on AMD Radeon GPUs without modifying the source code.</li>
<li>Originally developed for Intel graphics, ZLUDA has been adapted for use on AMD GPUs, but it is not completely fail-safe and lacks full support for NVIDIA OptiX.</li>
<li>The open-source release of ZLUDA allows the identification of the actual Radeon graphics card string, rather than the generic &quot;Graphics Device&quot; label.</li>

<li>The author discovers a connection between fractals and neural network training, revealing that the boundary between successful and unsuccessful training exhibits a fractal structure.</li>
<li>Adjusting hyperparameters, like the learning rate, has an impact on the training process, with the best-performing hyperparameters typically found near the convergence-divergence boundary.</li>
<li>Fractal patterns emerge when zooming in on specific training configurations, due to the repeated iteration of functions and the occurrence of bifurcation boundaries. Neural network-generated fractals differ from those produced by low order polynomials in that they appear more organic and lack obvious symmetries.</li>
