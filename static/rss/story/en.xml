      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Jonathan Ireland&#39;s article argues that the term &quot;nonprofit&quot; can be misleading, often hiding misconduct and corruption within these organizations.</li>
<li>He provides examples such as San Francisco&#39;s TODCO and Seattle&#39;s nonprofits, highlighting issues like increased executive pay, lobbying efforts, and hiring practices that lead to reoffending.</li>
<li>Ireland criticizes the inefficiency and high costs of outsourcing government services to nonprofits, suggesting that urban issues like homelessness and public health risks are exacerbated by a lack of effective government intervention and oversight.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The essay highlights the challenges of software estimation, noting that traditional project management often incorrectly assumes tasks follow a normal distribution.</li>
<li>In reality, software development tasks often follow a log-normal distribution, where significant deviations are common due to the unpredictable nature of just-in-time learning.</li>
<li>The essay emphasizes the importance of relevant experience and specific tooling knowledge in hiring, as learning new tools can vary widely in time and cost, making accurate timeline estimation difficult.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The paper &quot;Grokked Transformers are Implicit Reasoners&quot; explores whether transformers can implicitly reason over parametric knowledge, focusing on composition and comparison reasoning types.</li>
<li>Findings indicate that transformers can learn implicit reasoning through extensive training beyond overfitting, known as grokking, but their generalization ability varies: they struggle with composition but succeed with comparison in out-of-distribution examples.</li>
<li>The study suggests improvements in data and training setups, potential architectural enhancements like cross-layer knowledge sharing, and shows that fully grokked transformers outperform models like GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro in complex reasoning tasks.</li>

<li>Leaked Google Search API documents, verified by ex-Google employees, reveal the use of click-centric user signals, separate subdomain considerations, and a sandbox for new websites, contradicting Google&#39;s public statements.</li>
<li>The documents detail a system called &quot;NavBoost,&quot; which uses clickstream data from Google Toolbar and Chrome to improve search results, and discuss penalties for exact-match domains, geo-fencing click data, and whitelists during significant events.</li>
<li>The leak, likely from accidental public exposure on GitHub, includes over 2,500 pages of internal documentation, highlighting extensive data collection practices and suggesting Google favors big brands over smaller sites in its rankings.</li>

<li>Exclusive photos show significant damage to the Svalbard fiber optic cable, likely caused by an external force such as an anchor or trawl, exposing the cable&#39;s copper layer to seawater and causing a ground fault.</li>
<li>Despite initial police suspicions of human activity, the investigation was dropped due to lack of evidence, though underwater drone footage suggested trawler activity.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A massive structure called the &quot;Big Ring&quot; has been discovered 9.2 billion light-years away, challenging existing cosmological theories.</li>
<li>The &quot;Big Ring&quot; spans 1.3 billion light-years and does not align with known formation mechanisms, defying the Cosmological Principle of even matter distribution.</li>
<li>This discovery, presented at the 243rd American Astronomical Society meeting, follows the 2022 discovery of the &quot;Giant Arc,&quot; another structure that questions current understanding of the universe.</li>

<li>Summing floating-point numbers naively can lead to significant rounding errors, especially with large arrays; methods like pairwise summation and Kahan summation improve accuracy but vary in speed.</li>
<li>Rust&#39;s compiler limitations in reordering floating-point additions hinder autovectorization, but intrinsics like <code>std::intrinsics::fadd_fast</code> and <code>fadd_algebraic</code> enable efficient summation with AVX2 instructions.</li>
<li>Benchmarking on an AMD Threadripper 2950x shows that autovectorized methods using <code>fadd_algebraic</code> are both fast and accurate, with Pareto-optimal implementations being <code>naive_autovec</code>, <code>block_kahan_autovec</code>, and <code>crate_accurate_inplace</code>.</li>

<li>Breck Yunits introduces a method to store tabular knowledge in a single plain text file using spaces and newlines, offering advantages over binary formats.</li>
<li>The system, called ScrollSets, is human-readable, editable with git, and compatible with traditional software and AI, and powers the open-source website PLDB.io.</li>
<li>Key features include measures, concepts, measurements, and comments, with enhancements like splitting data into multiple files, using a parser language called Grammar, and adding attributes such as sortIndex and types.</li>

<li>The article critiques NASA&#39;s Artemis program for its complexity, high costs, and inefficiency compared to the Apollo missions, despite technological advancements.</li>
<li>Key criticisms include the high costs and outdated technology of the Space Launch System (SLS), design challenges with the Orion spacecraft, and the added complexity and risk of using Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO).</li>
<li>The ambitious timeline of returning humans to the moon by 2026 is deemed unrealistic, with potential delays and escalating costs, risking perpetual postponement of the manned lunar landing.</li>

<li>Kris Hansen, a chemist at 3M, discovered in 1997 that PFOS, a harmful chemical, was present in human blood, but her research was halted by superiors who assured her of its safety.</li>
<li>Decades later, the EPA mandates the removal of PFAS chemicals from drinking water, revealing that 3M knew about PFOS&#39;s toxicity since the 1970s but continued production.</li>
<li>Despite a $12.5 billion settlement to address PFAS contamination, the full cost and responsibility remain unresolved, with Hansen now volunteering in environmental conservation.</li>
