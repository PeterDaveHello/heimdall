            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author developed a Unix-like operating system named Bunnix for x86_64 targets in 27 days, supporting legacy and EFI boot but lacking USB support, requiring a PS/2 keyboard.</li>
<li>Bunnix&#39;s kernel, written in Hare and C, includes drivers for PCI and AHCI, supports ext4 and memfs filesystems, and features third-party software like Vim and Doom.</li>
<li>Despite being functional but buggy, Bunnix served as a learning experience for the author, who plans to apply these insights to their previous project, Helios, and sees potential for community-driven improvements.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Computershare, a global stock-market share registry operator, is abandoning VMware due to significant price hikes following Broadcom&#39;s acquisition of VMware.</li>
<li>The cost for VMware hypervisor increased by 10 to 15 times, prompting Computershare to switch to Nutanix AHV, with a migration of 24,000 VMs expected to be completed within a year.</li>
<li>This move underscores potential issues for Broadcom, as other large customers might also seek alternatives due to its high-revenue, high-margin pricing strategies.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The llama.cpp repository on GitHub boasts 58.3k stars and 8.3k forks.</li>
<li>Contributor jart is enhancing the silu and softmax functions for the CPU, incorporating AVX512 and AVX2 instructions for exponential value calculations, showing improved performance in benchmarks with less than 1 ULP error.</li>
<li>The author highlights the use of vpermi2pd for Float64/double lookup tables and notes that hardware like Zen4 or icelake-client/tigerlake might not see as much benefit, with the constraint that the table must fit into two registers.</li>

<li>Datomic is a general-purpose database utilizing EAV triples and logical timestamps, offering Datomic Pro and Datomic Cloud with distinct architectures.</li>
<li>The database ensures read-write separation for performance and guarantees ACID transactions, though concurrent transactions may lead to unexpected outcomes.</li>
<li>Users need to handle transaction functions and entity specs cautiously to avoid anomalies, despite Datomic&#39;s straightforward concurrency design and transactional correctness.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Oregon State University researchers have discovered the most rapid natural increase in carbon dioxide levels in the last 50,000 years by studying ancient Antarctic ice.</li>
<li>The current rate of atmospheric CO2 rise is ten times quicker than any other historical period, primarily due to human activities, as per the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</li>
<li>This research offers valuable insights into historical climate change events and the potential ramifications of today&#39;s climate change, emphasizing the unparalleled levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.</li>
