<li>The topic revolves around the copyright legality of unlicensed fonts on the web, where US law disallows copyright of individual glyphs but permits for copyrighting the font file.</li>
<li>Trademarked fonts are protected under the law, while non-trademarked glyphs are not susceptible to copyright.</li>
<li>The author considers using public, non-creative, non-trademarked fonts to recreate licensed ones, recognizing the complexity of such an endeavor, and ends by asserting the significance of supporting font creators by purchasing fonts legally.</li>

<li>Metric time is a system dividing the day into 10 hours, each hour comprising 100 minutes, and each minute containing 100 seconds, thereby simplifying mental math and dealing with different time zones.</li>
<li>In the metric time system, there is no distinction between AM and PM, with a day simply consisting of 10 hours.</li>
<li>The concept behind metric time is likened to monetary thinking, where each metric hour is equivalent to a 100-dollar bill and each metric minute akin to a 1-dollar bill, totaling to 1,000 minutes and 100,000 seconds per day.</li>

<li>The author emphasizes the significance of using tried-and-true technology for its robust documentation, familiarity, and established ecosystems.</li>
<li>Innovative tech should only be opted for if it dramatically boosts the chance of problem-solving. This idea forms a part of the author&#39;s tech selection framework, which includes understanding issues, validating solutions, refining complexity, evaluating designs, and exposing ideas to critics.</li>
<li>However, the author advises remaining clear of cutting-edge technologies to reserve capacity for innovations. This framework&#39;s approach is primarily for work projects, as personal projects are prioritized based on personal enjoyment and learning potential.</li>

<li>The assertion that medieval staircases were primarily clockwise for defense purposes is a myth with no supporting evidence from medieval sources.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The initiative seeks to halt the European Commission&#39;s implementation of &quot;chat control,&quot; aimed at curbing child abuse and grooming, arguing it violates fundamental rights and privacy.</li>
<li>The initiative claims chat control generates false results, strains authorities which might hinder investigation achievements, infringes on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and damages encryption infrastructure.</li>
<li>They propose other means for child protection, encourage reaching out to local MEPs to express disagreement, provide AI-generated email templates for effective communication, and promote signing a petition to apply more pressure on lawmakers.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A recent study by Google DeepMind and the University of Illinois challenged the current understanding of self-correction in large language models (LLMs), revealing they often struggle to refine their answers without external feedback.</li>
<li>The study suggests self-correction in LLMs is more effective when they can utilize external sources like human feedback or a knowledge base; without such, their performance significantly drops.</li>
<li>The research also stresses the significance of well-designed initial prompts for LLMs and the cautious application of self-correction to enhance their accuracy and reliability, especially in tasks like altering the LLM&#39;s stylistic output or ensuring safer responses.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Epic Games has announced a switch to a subscription-based pricing model for Unreal Engine, their graphics engine, directed at industries beyond gaming, affecting use for VFX or animation.</li>
<li>Unlike the previous royalty model which only applied to projects earning over $1 million in revenue, this new model could potentially impact independent filmmakers and non-professional users.</li>
<li>While pricing details are yet to be shared, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney assured that the new rates won&#39;t be exorbitant or unusually cheap; student and educator access to Unreal Engine will continue to be free.</li>

<li>The &quot;streaming-llm&quot; project aims to implement Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications without sacrificing efficiency or performance, overcoming memory consumption and limitations in handling longer texts.</li>
<li>This project introduces the concept of attention sinks and the StreamingLLM framework, which allows LLMs to manage infinite-length inputs without the need for fine-tuning. This method outperforms other techniques in speed and stability, but it is not ideal for summarizing extensive texts.</li>
<li>The project plans on releasing code, data, and evaluation instruments in the future and encourages citation of their paper for those keen on using the StreamingLLM framework.</li>
