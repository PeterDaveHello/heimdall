            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A recent study from Monash University has found a connection between a lack of deep sleep, known as slow-wave sleep, and an increased risk of dementia in older adults.</li>
<li>The research shows that even a 1% annual decline in deep sleep for people above the age of 60 results in a 27% higher risk of dementia.</li>
<li>The study, which monitored 346 participants aged 60 and above for dementia onset for 17 years, suggests that improving or maintaining slow-wave sleep could be a possible preventative measure for dementia.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Rob Pike, a renowned programmer, outlines five notable rules for software development that emphasize simplicity and discourage premature optimization.</li>
<li>The rules incorporate using straightforward algorithms and data structures to reduce bugs and ease implementation, focusing on data structures due to their crucial role in programming.</li>
<li>Pike also urges not to predict where a program will expend most of its time, thus avoiding early optimization, and underscores the necessity of measuring before opting for speed tuning.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Asahi Linux, aiming to adapt Linux for Apple Silicon Macs, has identified bugs in Apple&#39;s MacOS which may cause certain MacBook Pro models to become unbootable.</li>
<li>The bugs relate to the way newer MacOS versions manage refresh rates, prominently impacting MacBook Pro models with ProMotion displays (14&quot; and 16&quot; versions); when merged in the upgrade and boot sequence, it can result in a black screen necessitating a Device Firmware Update (DFU) recovery.</li>
<li>Asahi Linux clarified that data is not endangered and the issue is restricted to particular MacOS versions (Sonoma 14.0+ and Ventura 13.6+); their installer has been updated to prevent installation if the refresh rate is non-ProMotion.</li>
</ul>

<li>Yann LeCun, recognized as an AI pioneer from Meta, criticizes AI leaders such as OpenAI&#39;s Sam Altman, Google DeepMind&#39;s Demis Hassabis, and Anthropic&#39;s Dario Amodei for allegedly creating a climate of fear about AI.</li>
<li>LeCun suggests that these leaders use fear tactics to centralize AI control within a few companies, an approach he perceives as a real risk; He promotes open-source development to prevent AI from solely being developed by private, profit-driven entities.</li>
<li>He argues for addressing realistic concerns like worker exploitation and data theft rather than focusing on speculative threats of AI, which he attributes to a few companies&#39; control over AI.</li>

<li>The European Data Protection Board has expanded a Norwegian ban on behavior-based marketing on Facebook and Instagram across the entire EU/EEA. This decision addresses illegal tracking, surveillance, and profiling on these platforms.</li>
<li>Despite past prohibitions, Meta (formerly Facebook) has continued to handle user data illegitimately. Therefore, the board has forwarded this decision to the Irish data protection authority to enforce the ban on Meta’s European headquarters in Ireland.</li>
<li>While Meta plans to secure user consent for data usage for behavior-based marketing in the future, it hasn&#39;t implemented any specific changes yet. The board also expressed skepticism towards Meta&#39;s suggested solution of charging users who refuse to consent.</li>

<li>A federal jury has convicted the National Association of Realtors and several major residential brokerages of conspiring to keep commission rates artificially high, leading to an estimated $1.8 billion in damages.</li>
<li>The case stands to potentially instigate changes in long-standing industry rules, which have preserved high commission rates even amidst rising home prices, bolstering profits for real estate agents.</li>
<li>This lawsuit is the first of two antitrust cases alleging that illegal industry practices have hindered consumers from lowering their costs, despite advancements in online property search technology.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>OpenRW, an open-source project, intends to re-implement the engine of the classic video game GTA III to make it compatible with contemporary systems. The ultimate goal is to reach &quot;Version 1.0,&quot; implementing original gameplay and compatibility with all game data formats, and modern gamepad support.</li>
<li>Once developed, OpenRW might allow for player modifications, gameplay changes, and enable multiplayer features but a copy of GTA III with game data installed will be needed to play.</li>
<li>OpenRW is currently under development, with contributions being open to anyone via GitHub. Initiated by tsjost and danhedron in 2013, it is not endorsed by Rockstar Games.</li>

<li>Herman&#39;s Bear Blog has created a unique analytics system that tracks user engagement while maintaining strict privacy standards and without the use of client-side Javascript.</li>
<li>This new method uses CSS instead of server logs or conventional analytics tools, which can often be blocked by ad-blockers. It tracks user engagement when the cursor hovers over the page, triggering a URL for the post viewed.</li>
<li>The system ensures user privacy by hashing the IP address with the date for a unique &#39;read&#39; count of a page, without storing any identifying information. They only temporarily store IP addresses.</li>

<li>A growing trend of private equity firms buying public companies and converting them into private entities is causing concern as it makes a significant portion of the market less transparent to investors, regulators, and the media.</li>
<li>This shift towards private equity has been driven by deregulation, leading to potentially harmful outcomes such as layoffs, reduced service quality, and bankruptcies while primarily benefiting firms&#39; partners.</li>
<li>The government has proposed amendments to increase disclosure requirements for private equity advisers, but more robust measures may be necessary to handle potential systemic risks and verify claims of higher returns.</li>

<li>The rapidly expanding private-equity industry, now valued at $12 trillion, is sparking concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential systemic risks, due to an increase in taking publicly traded companies private.</li>
<li>The practice of taking companies private by these firms exempts the companies from mandatory public disclosures, leading to less scrutiny and potential for abuse such as workforce layoffs, regulatory evasions, and company bankruptcies, while ensuring high payouts for the firms’ partners.</li>
<li>While government regulations have been proposed to demand more information from private-equity funds, additional actions are needed to address the intrinsic issues plaguing the industry, to prevent potential financial crises triggered by unmanageable debt and defaults.</li>

<li>The summary highlights how manufacturers, especially Samsung, deactivate customer-owned devices, essentially locking users out of their data unless they buy a new product.</li>
<li>Many consumers in Mexico who can&#39;t afford to purchase from official stores acquired these devices via gray markets, and the Mexican government has intervened, claiming these actions infringe upon consumer rights.</li>
<li>Massive disapproval is directed towards Samsung, particularly for disabling devices and withholding users&#39; data.</li>

<li>The UK government&#39;s Online Safety Act is now law, intending to safeguard individuals, notably children, on the internet.</li>
<li>Critics, however, argue that the act is inefficient in counteracting misinformation, infringes on privacy, and hands over extensive control to private companies. It may even compromise encryption by necessitating a scan of users&#39; messages.</li>
<li>The act&#39;s similarity to the Investigatory Powers Act has led some companies to contemplate exiting the UK. Meanwhile, the EU commissioner&#39;s threats against Elon Musk and his company are perceived as hollow by critics.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers from the University of California, Davis, and Cornell University have discovered that crushed volcanic rock added to farmland can absorb carbon dioxide, even in arid climates.</li>
<li>The method is called rock weathering, which traps carbon in soil. This process is hastened by crushing the rock into fine dust.</li>
<li>During an intense drought in California, a field study revealed that areas with crushed rock stored 0.15 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare, suggesting enhanced rock weathering as a productive instrument for carbon capture and mitigation.</li>

<li>COVID-19 is potentially harmful to the cardiovascular system, leading to conditions like heart attacks, myocarditis, and elevated troponin levels; the risk of complications increases when pre-existing cardiac risk factors exist.</li>
<li>The virus can indirectly damage the heart by causing inflammation and blood clotting, which can lead to strokes and organ failure. Additionally, long-term symptoms might include microvascular damage and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS).</li>
<li>Current treatments focus on exercise and endurance training for long COVID and POTS-like syndromes. Researchers are looking at anticoagulants and anticytokines for cardiovascular issues, but with caution due to potential risks. Vaccines provide hope, yet ongoing vigilance is vital given the virus&#39;s unpredictability.</li>

<li>Dr. Janice Duffy of Adelaide concluded her 12-year legal fight against Google, having won two defamation lawsuits against the tech giant.</li>
<li>The case centered on Google&#39;s publishing of defamatory content from a website to its search engine page, even after Duffy&#39;s requests for the content&#39;s removal.</li>
<li>Though the settlement details are confidential, this case emphasizes the emotional and financial strain of such proceedings and may lead to more responsibility for search engine companies to monitor their content more vigilantly.</li>
