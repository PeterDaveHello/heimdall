<li>Jeff Johnson has initiated a boycott against Apple&#39;s Feedback Assistant, urging developers to file new feedbacks about existing issues, but refuse to respond to current ones until improvements are made.</li>
<li>Significant issues highlighted include Apple&#39;s lack of response, random closing of feedbacks, ignoring developer bug reports, demanding detailed sysdiagnose reports, neglecting smaller methods for diagnosing bugs, lack of search function for bugs, and a mandate to file all feedbacks via macOS or iOS.</li>
<li>The boycott, compared to a labor strike, emphasizes the unrecognized and unpaid contribution of developers in testing and refining Apple&#39;s software and products. It does not criticize individual Apple engineers but challenges the company&#39;s leadership.</li>

<li>They suggest cautious use of rebase in shared branches and emphasizes on maintaining neat commit discipline.</li>

<li>A significant number of grizzly bears have perished since the 1980s along a railway line close to Glacier National Park, Montana, primarily caused by intoxication from fermented grain spillage from the railcars.</li>
<li>The blend of spilled grain and moisture initiates fermentation, attracting the bears, with already three reported deaths in 2021 due to train hits.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Herb Sutter from Microsoft proposes making the programming language, C++, 10 times simpler and 50 times safer through a plan similar to TypeScript approach.</li>
<li>This approach stands for seamless compatibility with current C++ code, libraries, and tools, along with full standards evolution support with ISO C++.</li>
<li>Sutter&#39;s experimental syntax, Cpp2, is an attempt to be 100% pure C++, integrating increased generality, improved defaults, lesser ceremony, and fewer vulnerabilities, deviating from the previously followed &quot;Dart plan.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<li>A team of researchers, including Jonathan C. Schisler, have discovered the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the body&#39;s energy storage, potentially leading to organ failure.</li>
<li>The study reveals that the virus alters the mitochondria at a genetic level, inhibiting specific genes that utilize oxygen to create cellular energy, causing what they describe as &quot;energy outages&quot; which can lead to cell death and inflammation.</li>
<li>The findings could pave the way for understanding the body&#39;s reaction to the virus and mitigating chronic symptoms related to COVID-19. Future studies will delve into the duration and possible restoration of mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in long-COVID cases.</li>

<li>Scientists at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) have made the first observation of a satellite virus constantly attaching to a helper bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacterial cells.</li>
<li>In tests conducted on 50 helper satellites, it was found that 80% had a satellite bound at the neck.</li>
<li>The UMBC team discovered a unique satellite devoid of any integration gene, suggesting it ensures survival inside the host by attaching to a helper, rather than integrating into the host cell&#39;s DNA.</li>

<li>A California jury has awarded Mike Dennis $332 million in a lawsuit against Monsanto, now a division of Bayer, alleging his rare form of non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma resulted from using Monsanto&#39;s Roundup weedkiller.</li>
<li>The active ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate, is at the heart of the lawsuit. A portion ($7 million) of Dennis&#39;s awarded total covers compensatory damages, while the bulk ($325 million) is for punitive damages.</li>
<li>Bayer, dealing with thousands of similar Roundup-related claims, plans to appeal the verdict. This follows Bayer&#39;s 2020 commitment of up to $10.9 billion set aside for settling approximately 125,000 claims.</li>

<li>Julia Evans is simplifying complex Git terminology, emphasizing that a thorough understanding of these terms is vital for effective use of Git, an open-source system for tracking changes in software.</li>
<li>She deep-dives into Git&#39;s complex terms like &quot;HEAD and heads,&quot; &quot;ours and theirs during merging or rebasing,&quot; &quot;detached HEAD state,&quot; &quot;ahead of &#39;origin/main&#39; by 1 commit,&quot; among others, elucidating the differences between them.</li>
<li>The article highlights the need for additional clarity in Git&#39;s terminology due to its multifaceted nature and complexity, shedding light on concepts such as &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;revert&quot;, &quot;restore&quot;, the term &quot;track&quot; across different contexts, and the distinctions among &quot;merge&quot;, &quot;rebase&quot; and &quot;cherry-pick&quot;.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Yann LeCun, recognized as an AI pioneer from Meta, criticizes AI leaders such as OpenAI&#39;s Sam Altman, Google DeepMind&#39;s Demis Hassabis, and Anthropic&#39;s Dario Amodei for allegedly creating a climate of fear about AI.</li>
<li>LeCun suggests that these leaders use fear tactics to centralize AI control within a few companies, an approach he perceives as a real risk; He promotes open-source development to prevent AI from solely being developed by private, profit-driven entities.</li>
<li>He argues for addressing realistic concerns like worker exploitation and data theft rather than focusing on speculative threats of AI, which he attributes to a few companies&#39; control over AI.</li>

<li>Despite past prohibitions, Meta (formerly Facebook) has continued to handle user data illegitimately. Therefore, the board has forwarded this decision to the Irish data protection authority to enforce the ban on Meta’s European headquarters in Ireland.</li>
<li>While Meta plans to secure user consent for data usage for behavior-based marketing in the future, it hasn&#39;t implemented any specific changes yet. The board also expressed skepticism towards Meta&#39;s suggested solution of charging users who refuse to consent.</li>

<li>A growing trend of private equity firms buying public companies and converting them into private entities is causing concern as it makes a significant portion of the market less transparent to investors, regulators, and the media.</li>
<li>This shift towards private equity has been driven by deregulation, leading to potentially harmful outcomes such as layoffs, reduced service quality, and bankruptcies while primarily benefiting firms&#39; partners.</li>
<li>The government has proposed amendments to increase disclosure requirements for private equity advisers, but more robust measures may be necessary to handle potential systemic risks and verify claims of higher returns.</li>

<li>The rapidly expanding private-equity industry, now valued at $12 trillion, is sparking concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential systemic risks, due to an increase in taking publicly traded companies private.</li>
<li>The practice of taking companies private by these firms exempts the companies from mandatory public disclosures, leading to less scrutiny and potential for abuse such as workforce layoffs, regulatory evasions, and company bankruptcies, while ensuring high payouts for the firms’ partners.</li>
<li>While government regulations have been proposed to demand more information from private-equity funds, additional actions are needed to address the intrinsic issues plaguing the industry, to prevent potential financial crises triggered by unmanageable debt and defaults.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The UK government&#39;s Online Safety Act is now law, intending to safeguard individuals, notably children, on the internet.</li>
<li>Critics, however, argue that the act is inefficient in counteracting misinformation, infringes on privacy, and hands over extensive control to private companies. It may even compromise encryption by necessitating a scan of users&#39; messages.</li>
<li>The act&#39;s similarity to the Investigatory Powers Act has led some companies to contemplate exiting the UK. Meanwhile, the EU commissioner&#39;s threats against Elon Musk and his company are perceived as hollow by critics.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Windows installer of ImageMagick will not be signed anymore due to the expiration of their code signing certificate, which they can&#39;t export and use in GitHub actions anymore.</li>
<li>The team is currently contemplating a cloud solution, with Digicert as the only option at present, charging $629 for a single year.</li>
<li>While they&#39;re inviting sponsorships for obtaining a code signing certificate, some users have suggested alternatives like SignPath and Azure KeyVault.</li>
