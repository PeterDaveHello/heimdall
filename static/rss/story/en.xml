<li>Microsoft has shared the results of its investigation into the Storm-0558 actor who used a consumer key to breach OWA and Outlook.com.</li>
<li>Findings reveal that a crash dump in April 2021 contained the signing key, later shifted to the debugging environment within the corporate network. Hereafter, a Microsoft engineer&#39;s corporate account was compromised by the actor to gain this key.</li>
<li>Microsoft also discovered a library error that let the mail system accept enterprise email requests signed with the consumer key, which the company has since rectified.</li>

<li>Scientists have discovered a new species of rove beetle that mimics the physical appearance of termites to trick them into providing food.</li>
<li>The beetle resembles termites&#39; body segments and features closely, enabling it to evade detection within termite nests.</li>
<li>Instead of consuming termite eggs or larvae, the beetle likely mimics their behavior, &quot;begging&quot; for food and thus securing itself a constant source of sustenance.</li>

<li>Leading tax preparation companies such as Intuit, owner of TurboTax, and H&amp;R Block, are under scrutiny for lobbying against a free, government-run tax filing system.</li>
<li>These companies have collectively spent over $90 million on lobbying since 2003 to prevent the IRS from developing its own tax prep software.</li>
<li>As of December 2019, an addendum to the Free File Alliance&#39;s memorandum of understanding removed that obstruction, enabling the IRS to set plans for a free tax filing service in 2024. Investigations into the tax prep industry&#39;s lobbying efforts have been called for by several Congressional Democrats.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The paper suggests a strategy to enhance long-term memory in open-domain dialogue systems through the recursive creation of summaries or memory using large language models (LLMs).</li>
<li>This method encourages the LLMs to retain and recall smaller dialogue contexts and subsequently create new memory utilizing previous memory and subsequent contexts.</li>
<li>The experiments demonstrate more consistent responses in long-context conversations generated by the method. The authors plan to release the code and scripts at a later date.</li>

<li>A recent genetic study proposes that human ancestors nearly faced extinction around 900,000 years ago when the breeding population decreased to just 1,280 and took another 117,000 years to expand.</li>
<li>Up to two-thirds of genetic diversity was lost during this population bottleneck, which may have critically influenced the evolution of modern humans.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Professor Jaime Ross from the University of Rhode Island carried out a study indicating that microplastics can penetrate all systems of the body, even the brain, leading to changes in behavior in mammals.</li>
<li>The research, with mice as test subjects, discovered that exposure to microplastics resulted in both changes in behavior and alternation in immune markers in the liver and brain tissues.</li>
<li>The study illustrates an urgent need for more investigations on health implications linked with microplastic exposure, specifically in mammals.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), crucial for the routing of network traffic on the internet, is found to have significant flaws in its error handling, potentially causing network disruptions and internet outages.</li>
<li>The author, a professional BGP vulnerability tester, has discovered these issues in multiple vendors&#39; BGP systems and expressed dissatisfaction with their security responses.</li>
<li>The author advocates for the need for vendors to be more accountable for resolving security issues, such as offering bug bounties, and criticizes the ineffectiveness of reporting security flaws directly to vendors, suggesting customer notification as an alternative.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Fomos is an experimental operating system (OS) constructed using Rust, aiming to streamline the relationship between an application and the OS. In Fomos, an app is treated as merely a function and liaises with the OS via a Context structure.</li>
<li>Fomos OS encompasses attributes like sandboxing, instrumentation, debugging, and the transparent restarting of applications. To deal with older versions of apps, the OS constructs new functions within the Context.</li>
<li>Challenges still linger, including security and the scheduling modalities. Future plans encompass extending functionalities like permanent storage, GPU support, network connectivity, and an abstract structure for application communication.</li>
</ul>
