            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists from Northwestern Medicine and Brigham and Women’s Hospital have identified a molecular defect in systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) involving insufficient activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).</li>
<li>Reactivating AHR in lupus patients&#39; blood samples converted harmful T peripheral helper cells into Th22 cells, which may aid in wound healing and offer new treatment avenues.</li>
<li>The findings, published in Nature, suggest potential new treatments for lupus without the side effects of current therapies, supported by NIH grants and other organizations.</li>

<li>Large language models with vision capabilities (VLMs) like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro excel in many image-text tasks but struggle with simple visual tasks that are easy for humans.</li>
<li>These tasks include identifying overlapping circles, intersecting lines, circled letters, counting shapes in logos, nested squares, grid rows and columns, and following paths in subway maps.</li>
<li>The limitations in basic visual tasks suggest that the vision capabilities of current VLMs are still underdeveloped, highlighting areas for future improvement.</li>

<li>Scott Aaronson&#39;s blog post clarifies common misconceptions in theoretical computer science, particularly the difference between computability and complexity.</li>
<li>He uses examples, such as a function determining God&#39;s existence, to illustrate that computability pertains to functions, not individual questions, and addresses misunderstandings about the P vs. NP problem.</li>
<li>Aaronson explains that computability concerns the existence of a program to map inputs to outputs, not the difficulty of creating that program, and discusses the Busy Beaver function to highlight uncomputable versus computable values.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A report by Feedback and various West African and Norwegian organizations highlights that nearly 2 million metric tons of wild fish are harvested annually to produce fish oil for Norwegian farmed salmon feed.</li>
<li>This practice is negatively impacting livelihoods and causing malnutrition in West African countries such as The Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania, with the potential to triple the demand for wild-caught fish by 2050.</li>
<li>Major feed producers like Mowi, Skretting, Cargill, and Biomar are sourcing fish oil from northwest Africa, leading to significant declines in local fish stocks and incomes, prompting calls for sustainability measures.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>TicketMaster&#39;s SafeTix system uses rotating barcodes displayed in a mobile app, complicating the ticketing process and preventing easy printing or screenshots.</li>
<li>Issues arise when there&#39;s no internet connection at the venue, making it difficult to load the barcode, and the system aims to reduce ticket resale and gather user data.</li>
<li>Reverse engineering reveals that the barcodes use PDF417 format with a bearer token and two TOTPs, which can be extracted using Chrome DevTools, allowing offline saving of tickets up to 20 hours before the event.</li>

<li>In C++, if constructors are not provided, the compiler may generate default ones, potentially leading to uninitialized objects.</li>
<li>Default-initialization does nothing for non-class and non-array types, while value-initialization zero-initializes non-class types and then default-initializes.</li>
<li>Relying on compiler-generated constructors can result in undefined behavior; it&#39;s recommended to write custom constructors to avoid these issues.</li>

<li>An attempt to optimize an AArch64 assembly inner loop by eliminating a jump resulted in a 4x slowdown due to mismatched <code>bl</code> (branch with link) and <code>ret</code> (return) pairs, which confused the branch predictor.</li>
<li>Replacing <code>ret</code> with <code>br x30</code> (branch to register) resolved the performance issue, and further optimizations, including inlining and using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, achieved significant speedups.</li>
<li>The final optimized SIMD version ran in 94 ns, approximately 8.8 times faster than the original code, highlighting the importance of avoiding asymmetric branching and leveraging SIMD for performance gains.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The 2015 Microsoft research titled &quot;Code Reviews Do Not Find Bugs&quot; claims that only about 15% of code review comments indicate possible defects, but this statistic is misleading.</li>
<li>Previous research indicates that code reviews and pair programming can find an additional 60% of defects with only a 15% increase in time investment, especially effective on small code chunks.</li>
<li>The Microsoft paper&#39;s thesis is contradicted by evidence showing code reviews&#39; effectiveness in defect detection and learning the codebase, with the real issue being the median review turnaround time of 24 hours.</li>

<li>Switzerland has enacted the &quot;Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfilment of Governmental Tasks&quot; (EMBAG), mandating open source software (OSS) in public sector bodies.</li>
<li>The law, led by Professor Dr. Matthias Stürmer, aims to reduce vendor lock-in, lower taxpayer costs, and enhance services through increased competition and innovation.</li>
<li>EMBAG promotes transparency and efficiency by requiring public bodies to disclose software source code, unless restricted by third-party rights or security concerns, and allows them to offer additional IT services at cost-covering remuneration.</li>

<li>Venezuela has become the first Andean country to lose all its glaciers, with the Humboldt Glacier in the Sierra Nevada now too small to be classified as a glacier.</li>
<li>The International Climate and Cryosphere Initiative (ICCI) confirmed this status, noting that Venezuela had six glaciers in the Sierra Nevada, but only the Humboldt Glacier remained by 2011.</li>
<li>Scientists attribute the glacier&#39;s disappearance to climate change and rising global temperatures, with a 2023 study predicting that 83% of the world&#39;s glaciers could disappear by 2100 if temperatures continue to rise.</li>
