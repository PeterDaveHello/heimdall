<li>The Wendelstein 7-X nuclear fusion experiment in Germany has achieved a significant milestone by generating a power plasma with a gigajoule energy turnover for eight minutes.</li>
<li>This surpasses the targeted energy turnover of 1 gigajoule and sets a new record for discharge time.</li>
<li>The experiment aims to increase the energy turnover to 18 gigajoules and maintain plasma stability for half an hour, with the goal of developing a climate-friendly and sustainable power plant using magnetic fields to confine hydrogen plasma in a vacuum chamber.</li>

<li>80% of bosses regret their initial decisions on return-to-office plans, realizing they should have considered employee preferences instead of relying solely on executive opinions.</li>
<li>Companies like Disney, Starbucks, and BlackRock are requiring more in-person work, while Zoom reversed its policy to allow employees to choose between hybrid, in-person, or remote work.</li>
<li>Companies involving employees in decision-making have had greater success in returning to the office, while those with strict policies without employee input are experiencing turnover issues. Companies like Ernst &amp; Young have seen positive responses from employees after implementing reimbursements for commuting and childcare costs. It may take another year or two for companies to establish a content office routine for both employees and bosses.</li>

<li>The Seattle City Council has approved a new law to safeguard gig workers from sudden deactivation on platforms like Instacart and DoorDash, marking the first such legislation in the United States.</li>
<li>The ordinance implements more stringent guidelines for deactivation and mandates that companies give a 14-day notice prior to termination.</li>
<li>This development is a part of larger initiatives in Seattle aimed at protecting gig workers who are not part of a labor union, including recent laws that increased the minimum wage and granted sick time and benefits to app-based workers. The law is anticipated to be signed by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell.</li>

<li>Jeremy Vaught, who spent 16 years building his Twitter username &quot;@music,&quot; had his username changed to &quot;@Musicfan&quot; without his followers being properly transferred.</li>
<li>This incident has sparked criticism of billionaire-owned platforms and prompted discussions about switching to alternative platforms like Mastodon.</li>
<li>Some users speculate that Vaught may have accepted a settlement or non-disparagement clause. However, he still considers Twitter his preferred social media platform.</li>

<li>A Korean team has made claims of discovering a room temperature superconductor named LK-99, which has received significant attention.</li>
<li>However, attempts to replicate the results have been unsuccessful thus far, casting doubt on the validity of the claims.</li>
<li>Multiple replication efforts have not observed any signs of superconductivity in LK-99, leading scientists to remain skeptical of its existence as a superconductor at ambient conditions.</li>
