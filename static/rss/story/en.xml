      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Singing to babies is an important factor in helping them learn language, according to a study from the University of Cambridge.</li>
<li>The research indicates that infants initially understand language through rhythm and tone, rather than individual sounds.</li>
<li>The study challenges the belief that processing phonetic information is the primary aspect of language learning and suggests that dyslexia and developmental language disorder may be linked to rhythm perception.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists have found that fiber optic cables can pick up the sound of cicadas, leading to a potential new method for monitoring insect populations.</li>
<li>Using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), researchers can analyze the light bouncing back from a laser fired through the cables to detect disturbances caused by loud sounds or seismic activity.</li>
<li>This technique could allow entomologists to remotely monitor cicadas and collect data on their population sizes and locations, using the already abundant fiber optic cables. However, monitoring quieter insect species with DAS may be more challenging.</li>

<li>The rate of paid work-from-home days has remained consistently high at around 28%, compared to the pre-pandemic level of 7%.</li>
<li>The shift towards remote work is driven by worker preferences for no commute, flexible schedules, and a better work-life balance, while companies enjoy reduced costs and improved worker retention. The prevalence of remote work is expected to grow further due to technological advancements and the preferences of younger CEOs.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Microsoft&#39;s partnership with OpenAI was at risk when OpenAI&#39;s CEO, Ilya Sutskever, was unexpectedly fired by the company&#39;s board without Microsoft&#39;s knowledge or input.</li>
<li>The firing of the CEO created tensions between OpenAI and Microsoft and raised concerns about the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence and the speed and safety of AI technology development.</li>
<li>Microsoft explored various options to stabilize the situation, including supporting the interim CEO or reinstating the fired CEO, but ultimately the CEO was reinstated due to employee unrest and threats of revolt.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Mozilla&#39;s innovation group and Justine Tunney have created llamafile, a new method for running Large Language Models (LLMs) on your own computer.</li>
<li>A llamafile is a multi-GB file that contains both the model weights for an LLM and the required code to run the model.</li>
<li>Users can execute the llamafile using Cosmopolitan Libc, which compiles a single binary that works on multiple operating systems and hardware architectures.</li>
<li>By running the llamafile executable, users can start a web server and interact with the model in their browser, enabling local usage of LLMs without an internet connection.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The authors propose a method for generating multi-view optical illusions using pretrained diffusion models.</li>
<li>The method supports various transformations such as rotations, flips, color inversions, skews, jigsaw rearrangements, and random permutations.</li>
<li>The method involves aligning and averaging noise estimates from different views or transformations of an image to take a diffusion step.</li>
<li>The authors discuss the conditions that views must meet for the method to work, including linearity and statistical consistency.</li>
<li>Use of orthogonal transformations, particularly permutation matrices, can generate interpretable and visually meaningful optical illusions.</li>
<li>The paper provides examples and references related works in the field.</li>

<li>The avocado industry aims to delay ripening, while home cooks usually want to speed up the process.</li>
<li>Ripening can be accelerated by storing avocados in a brown paper bag with a banana, which produces ethylene gas.</li>
<li>Microwaving avocados is not recommended as it cooks rather than ripens them, and ripe avocados can be stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.</li>
<li>To prevent browning, plastic wrap is not very effective, but submerging avocado pieces in water or using plastic wrap directly on mashed avocado can help delay oxidation.</li>

<li>The author discovered a new feedback loop technique using DALLE-3 and GPT4-Vision, inspired by Translation Party.</li>
<li>By generating an image with DALLE-3 based on a text prompt, converting it back to a text prompt with GPT4-Vision, and repeating the process, fascinating and unexpected outcomes can be achieved.</li>
<li>To try this technique, users must have their own OpenAI API key, and the author provides some favorite examples of this process.</li>

<li>Scientists at the University of Chicago have discovered that a fatty acid called trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) found in beef, lamb, and dairy products can enhance the ability of immune cells to fight tumors.</li>
<li>Higher levels of TVA in the blood were associated with improved response to immunotherapy in cancer patients.</li>
<li>This research suggests that TVA could be used as a nutritional supplement to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatments, and there may be other nutrients from plants that activate immune cells in a similar way.</li>

<li>The author embarked on a project to create their own font for their comic, resulting in two iterations based on digital handwriting and a scanned image.</li>
<li>They learned about various components of a typeface, emphasizing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and basic punctuation.</li>
<li>Tools such as Gimp and FontForge were utilized to clean up imperfections in the letters, create the font, and adjust character spacing using kerning. The font was tested and exporting issues eventually resolved, with the final choice being a True Type Font (TTF) for web publishing.</li>

<li>A recent study conducted with hunter-gatherer societies suggests that infants and toddlers benefit from high levels of personal attention and care from multiple caregivers.</li>
<li>Hunter-gatherer infants receive approximately nine hours per day of attentive care and physical contact from up to 15 different caregivers.</li>
<li>The study argues that Western countries should prioritize affordable high-quality childcare support that goes beyond mere supervision and emphasizes the well-being of both mothers and children. Additionally, involving older children and adolescents in caregiving can be beneficial.</li>
<li>The research proposes that stable sets of core caregivers within larger networks play a crucial role in children&#39;s emotional and cognitive development.</li>
<li>The authors emphasize the importance of collaboration among society, policymakers, employers, and healthcare services in providing the necessary support and care for mothers and children to thrive.</li>
