            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>FSRS is a modern spaced repetition algorithm that enhances memory retention and review scheduling compared to Anki&#39;s default algorithm.</li>
<li>It calculates optimal review intervals based on the likelihood of successfully recalling a card, using the &quot;Three Component Model of Memory&quot; and analyzing a user&#39;s review history.</li>
<li>FSRS allows users to select their preferred retention level, requires fewer reviews than Anki&#39;s default algorithm, and works effectively with delayed reviews. It also offers additional features through the FSRS4Anki Helper add-on.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author faces challenges in reverse engineering the Wi-Fi stack for the ESP32 microcontroller due to the high volume of Wi-Fi packets in the surrounding air.</li>
<li>Traditional methods, such as using a paint tin, ferrite chokes, and a turned-off microwave as a Faraday cage, prove ineffective in blocking outside packets.</li>
<li>The author discovers a research paper outlining an affordable Faraday cage made from conductive fabric and commonly available materials.</li>
<li>To reduce costs, the author plans to build the Faraday cage using wood cabinets and a lead-acid battery.</li>
<li>The constructed Faraday cage successfully blocks RF signals, allowing for more accurate analysis of the Wi-Fi stack.</li>
<li>The summary includes information on signal attenuation, a bill of materials, and detailed instructions for building the Faraday cage.</li>

<li>Python 3.13 might introduce a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler to enhance code performance.</li>
<li>The JIT compiler compiles code into machine code on demand, removing the need for a bytecode interpreter loop.</li>
<li>The new JIT compiler, a copy-and-patch JIT approach, converts high-level bytecodes into lower-level instructions in an Intermediate Language (IL) to optimize code execution.</li>
<li>Initial benchmarks indicate a 2-9% performance improvement, although the impact on benchmarks may not be substantial.</li>
<li>This JIT compiler lays the foundation for future significant optimizations in Python.</li>

<li>Palantir argues that the campaign was an &quot;exploratory project&quot; and did not necessitate consultation with the NHS, while the Good Law Project criticizes Palantir&#39;s actions and advocates for safeguarding the national interest.</li>

<li>The article explores the role of the cerebellum in controlling movement and its significance in motor skills.</li>
<li>It highlights the unique features of the cerebellum, such as Purkinje cells, and how they contribute to enhancing cognition.</li>
<li>The study challenges traditional notions of learning by demonstrating that learning can occur within individual cells in the cerebellum.</li>
<li>Dysmetria, difficulty in accurately estimating distance and speed, is a common symptom of cerebellar damage.</li>
<li>Patients with cerebellar damage also struggle with tasks requiring attention switching.</li>
<li>The cerebellum is involved in anticipation, prediction, and generating a predictive model of the world.</li>
<li>It plays a crucial role in generating quick predictions for action and is connected to various parts of the cerebrum involved in cognitive processes.</li>
<li>Damage to the cerebellum can result in clumsy and disproportionate actions.</li>
<li>The concept of embodied cognition, where cognitive functions are closely linked to sensorimotor functions, is supported.</li>
<li>The article concludes by mentioning the perspectives of dysmetria of thought and the universal cerebellar transform theories in relation to embodied cognition.</li>

<li>The authors argue for prompt investigation of research misconduct, transparent reporting of results, immediate retractions of articles with serious errors, and the return of research funding used for fraudulent research. They emphasize the negative consequences of failing to address misconduct effectively, such as hindering scientific progress, eroding public trust, and enabling dishonest scientists to compete with honest ones.

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The IRS is testing a free tax-filing system that enables residents of 12 states to directly submit federal tax returns online without any charge.</li>
<li>This pilot program is designed for low- and moderate-income taxpayers with uncomplicated returns, aiming to simplify the filing procedure.</li>
<li>Commercial tax-preparation companies are opposing this initiative, while Congress members from both parties have different opinions on its support. The IRS will release a public report on the trial before making a decision about expanding the direct filing system to a larger number of taxpayers.</li>
