<li>Jellyfin has a budget of over $24,000, covering 40 months of expenses, and is asking users to redirect donations to the authors of the Clients they use.</li>
<li>This request aligns with Jellyfin&#39;s &quot;no paid development&quot; policy, as donations are voluntary, and the project will reassess if funds drop to 12 months of runway.</li>
<li>Community members are responding positively, with plans to support Client authors and inquiries about specific client support like WebOS.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Pin type and the concept of pinning are essential but often misunderstood components of Rust&#39;s async ecosystem.</li>
<li>Pin was introduced to support self-referential types in async Rust, ensuring objects don&#39;t move once they contain self-references, unlike Mojo, which inherently handles object identity.</li>
<li>Despite its necessity, Pin introduces significant complexity for users due to its lack of syntactic sugar and support, leading to issues like reborrowing, pinned projections, and interactions with the Drop trait.</li>

<li>A major outage on July 19th caused by a kernel driver update led to global Windows system crashes, highlighting the need for safer update mechanisms.</li>
<li>eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), already used in Linux, is a secure kernel execution environment that can prevent such crashes and will soon be supported by Windows.</li>
<li>eBPF programs are safety-checked and sandboxed, offering benefits like enhanced security and lower resource usage, with adoption by companies like Cisco, Google, and Meta for security and observability.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The post emphasizes the principle &quot;Parse, don’t validate,&quot; advocating for parsing data to preserve information in the type system rather than discarding it through validation.</li>
<li>It explains how type-driven design in languages like Haskell can turn partial functions into total functions by strengthening argument types, using <code>NonEmpty</code> lists as an example.</li>
<li>Practical advice includes using precise data structures, refactoring to push proof burdens upward, and avoiding denormalized data representations to improve program reliability and safety.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author has been exploring and discussing the foundations of ChatGPT and other Generative AIs, aiming to provide realistic perspectives against the prevailing hype.</li>
<li>A key insight is that ChatGPT does not truly summarize content but merely shortens it, often missing essential details and proposals, as evidenced by a comparison with a human-generated summary of a 50-page paper.</li>
<li>This limitation arises because summarizing requires understanding, which ChatGPT lacks, leading to skepticism about the reliability of LLMs (Large Language Models) for practical business applications.</li>

<li>A US court ruled that Booking.com violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act by accessing Ryanair&#39;s website without permission, supporting Ryanair&#39;s stance against unauthorized screen scraping.</li>
<li>The Delaware District Court jury found Booking.com guilty of unauthorized access with intent to defraud and dismissed Booking.com&#39;s counterclaims of defamation and unfair competition.</li>
<li>Ryanair CEO Michael O&#39;Leary hopes the ruling will reduce illegal screen scraping and overcharging, while Booking.com plans to appeal, arguing that fare comparison benefits consumer choice.</li>

<li>The Macintosh file system featured two forks: a data fork and a resource fork, with the latter storing structured data like icons, dialogs, and code chunks.</li>
<li>Apple’s ResEdit, a resource editor last updated in 1994, allowed users to customize system files, dialogs, and keyboard layouts, but posed security risks as malware often exploited resource forks.</li>
<li>With Mac OS X, resource forks transitioned to extended attributes, and app resources are now organized into bundles, with modern apps being locked down by signatures, preventing the extensive customizations once possible with ResEdit.</li>

<li>A 60-year-old German man is likely the seventh person effectively cured of HIV following a stem cell transplant, which also treated his aggressive leukemia.</li>
<li>The patient, referred to as the &quot;next Berlin patient,&quot; stopped taking anti-retroviral drugs in late 2018 and remains HIV and cancer-free nearly six years later.</li>

<li>Research from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute highlights that loss of oxygen in lakes and oceans poses a significant threat to ecosystems, society, and the planet.</li>
<li>Aquatic deoxygenation, linked to climate change, land use, and pollution, has led to a rapid decline in dissolved oxygen, with lakes and reservoirs losing 5.5% and 18.6% of their oxygen since 1980, and oceans losing around 2% since 1960.</li>
<li>This deoxygenation impacts species&#39; physiology, food webs, and ecosystem services, creating &quot;dead zones&quot; and harmful algal blooms, necessitating urgent action to address global warming and runoff.</li>

<li>GitHub is starting to feel outdated, with key features like the blame view experiencing issues due to a frontend rewrite in React.</li>
<li>The rewrite caused problems with the browser&#39;s search function, which can be temporarily fixed by disabling JavaScript to reveal a server-side rendered page.</li>
<li>Other features such as GitHub’s status page, Actions, and merge button have also degraded, and Microsoft&#39;s focus on AI over core features suggests these issues may persist.</li>
