<li>Beekeeper Steven Brown from Springbank Honey in North Canterbury was devastated after being instructed to burn over 10,000 beehives and equipment due to American Foulbrood disease.</li>
<li>Brown suggested reconsidering the pest management strategy to include alternatives like vaccination, estimating a loss of $2 million.</li>
<li>The management agency defended the decision to burn, citing it as the most effective method, as beekeepers in New Zealand must adhere to regulations and destroy infected hives within seven days.</li>
