            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Llamafile is a framework designed for AI developers to distribute and execute lightweight language models (LLMs) using a single file.</li>
<li>It is compatible with different CPU architectures and operating systems, allowing for the inclusion of model weights within the llamafile.</li>
<li>The article provides instructions and tips for utilizing llamafile on various operating systems, including support for GPUs, and also addresses the creation of a larger executable format called llamafile and challenges related to GPU support and static linking. However, there is a known issue with a file size limit on 64-bit Windows.</li>

<li>Scientists at the University of Chicago have discovered that a fatty acid called trans-vaccenic acid (TVA) found in beef, lamb, and dairy products can enhance the ability of immune cells to fight tumors.</li>
<li>Higher levels of TVA in the blood were associated with improved response to immunotherapy in cancer patients.</li>

<li>A recent study conducted with hunter-gatherer societies suggests that infants and toddlers benefit from high levels of personal attention and care from multiple caregivers.</li>
<li>Hunter-gatherer infants receive approximately nine hours per day of attentive care and physical contact from up to 15 different caregivers.</li>
<li>The study argues that Western countries should prioritize affordable high-quality childcare support that goes beyond mere supervision and emphasizes the well-being of both mothers and children. Additionally, involving older children and adolescents in caregiving can be beneficial.</li>
<li>The research proposes that stable sets of core caregivers within larger networks play a crucial role in children&#39;s emotional and cognitive development.</li>
<li>The authors emphasize the importance of collaboration among society, policymakers, employers, and healthcare services in providing the necessary support and care for mothers and children to thrive.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers at ETH Zurich have created an autonomous excavator called HEAP that can build a six-meter-high dry-stone wall using large stones and demolition debris.</li>
<li>The excavator utilizes sensors and machine vision to scan and pick up stones, assess their weight and position, and accurately place them in the desired location.</li>
<li>This development reduces the reliance on manual labor in dry stone wall construction and makes efficient use of locally available materials.</li>

<li>Google plans to transition from Manifest V2 to Manifest V3, the latest version of its Chrome extension specification, despite criticism for limiting ad blockers</li>
<li>Manifest V3 introduces new limitations on filtering rulesets, which reduces the capabilities of ad blockers and privacy-protective tracker blockers</li>
<li>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has criticized Manifest V3 as deceitful and threatening, while Firefox plans to adopt it for cross-browser compatibility, potentially making Firefox a better choice for users requiring full extension capabilities.</li>

<li>The author reflects on their 18 years at Google and praises the company&#39;s early culture and values.</li>
<li>Over time, Google&#39;s culture eroded, transparency decreased, and decision-making began prioritizing the company&#39;s interests over those of users.</li>
<li>The lack of visionary leadership from current CEO Sundar Pichai is seen as a contributing factor to these issues.</li>
<li>The author believes that Google needs a shake-up in leadership to steer the company back towards its original mission and values.</li>
<li>It is still possible for Google to heal and achieve great things, but time is running out to reverse the deterioration of the company&#39;s culture.</li>

<li>YouTube is allegedly deliberately slowing down video loading times on browsers like Firefox and Microsoft Edge as a form of punishment against users who employ ad-blockers.</li>
<li>Speculation suggests that this is accomplished through a code snippet that introduces a five-second delay before video playback, potentially ensuring that ad-blocker users still view ads prior to watching content.</li>
<li>Multiple browsers are believed to be affected by this slowdown, even if ad-blocker extensions are disabled. YouTube has acknowledged that these delays are part of their anti-ad-blocker efforts and encourages users to either disable their ad-blockers or opt for YouTube Premium to access an ad-free experience.</li>
