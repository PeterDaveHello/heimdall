<li>YouTube is allegedly deliberately slowing down video loading times on browsers like Firefox and Microsoft Edge as a form of punishment against users who employ ad-blockers.</li>
<li>Speculation suggests that this is accomplished through a code snippet that introduces a five-second delay before video playback, potentially ensuring that ad-blocker users still view ads prior to watching content.</li>
<li>Multiple browsers are believed to be affected by this slowdown, even if ad-blocker extensions are disabled. YouTube has acknowledged that these delays are part of their anti-ad-blocker efforts and encourages users to either disable their ad-blockers or opt for YouTube Premium to access an ad-free experience.</li>

<li>Researchers have made advancements in solving the issue of private information retrieval in cryptography, enabling users to access data from a public database without disclosing what they accessed.</li>
<li>Previous solutions involved scanning the entire database for every search, but recent research has demonstrated the possibility of preprocessing the database and securely accessing information without revealing specifics.</li>
<li>Although the practical application of this solution remains challenging, researchers are optimistic that further developments will refine the approach and realize private lookups from massive databases.</li>

<li>Goldman Sachs Research predicts a 40% decrease in battery prices for electric vehicles (EVs) by 2025, making them more competitive with traditional cars.</li>
<li>The decline in prices will be due to falling costs of EV raw materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt.</li>
<li>Lower battery prices may lead to cost parity between EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles, driving consumer adoption of EVs and reducing reliance on government support.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Realtime support for the Linux kernel is being developed but faces a major obstacle with the current synchronous printk() function causing delays.</li>
<li>Developers are actively working on making printk() output asynchronous to resolve this issue.</li>
<li>Once the printk() problem is addressed, the remaining realtime preemption code can be integrated into the Linux kernel to complete the project before late 2024.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Sweden&#39;s government is reversing its previous stance to phase out nuclear power by planning to build two new reactors by 2035 and a total of 10 by 2045 to meet the growing demand for clean power.</li>
<li>The government is offering loan guarantees and cost-sharing to encourage private sector investment in these nuclear projects, with state-owned companies such as Vattenfall, Fortum, and Uniper expressing interest.</li>
<li>This decision is driven by the government&#39;s projection that electricity demand will double by 2045 as the country transitions to a fossil-free society.</li>

<li>The company saved over $230,000 annually by transitioning its infrastructure from AWS to a bare-metal solution.</li>
<li>The move was motivated by the company&#39;s need for independence from the public cloud, as their service involves notifying customers when the public cloud experiences downtime.</li>
<li>They utilized Kubernetes, Helm, NFS, and MetalLB to manage applications, storage, and load balancing on their own servers for more control over resources and to eliminate issues experienced in shared hosting environments.</li>

<li>Vehicles with taller and more vertical front ends have been found to pose a higher risk to pedestrians, according to research by the IIHS.</li>
<li>Vehicles with hood heights above 40 inches are around 45% more likely to cause fatalities in pedestrian crashes compared to those with hood heights of 30 inches or less and a sloping profile.</li>
<li>Vehicles with hood heights between 30 and 40 inches and a blunt front end also increase the risk to pedestrians. The study emphasizes the importance of designing vehicles with lower front ends and angled grilles to mitigate the danger to pedestrians.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A shipper has paid almost $4 million in an auction held by the Panama Canal Authority for priority passage through the congested canal.</li>
<li>The Panama Canal has been experiencing a backlog of ships due to a severe drought, leading to restrictions implemented by the managing authority.</li>
<li>The exorbitant price for priority access is causing other ships to be priced out and unable to secure passage through the canal.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>BLAKE3 is presented as an advantageous alternative to SHA256 for cryptographic purposes.</li>
<li>It is explained that BLAKE3 was developed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and others, while SHA256 was designed by the NSA.</li>
<li>BLAKE3 is stated to be based on strong algorithms like ChaCha20 and Salsa20, in contrast to SHA256, which is based on the weak SHA1.</li>
<li>The post argues that NIST/NSA&#39;s lack of confidence in SHA256 is evident and highlights BLAKE3&#39;s resistance to known attacks compared to SHA256.</li>
<li>BLAKE3 is described as offering built-in security features, being more efficient in terms of time and energy, and performing well on platforms with SHA256 acceleration circuits.</li>
<li>It is mentioned that BLAKE3 takes advantage of new tech improvements and demonstrates high parallelizability.</li>
<li>The design and implementation of BLAKE3 involves both cryptographers and software engineers, making it highly efficient and secure.</li>
