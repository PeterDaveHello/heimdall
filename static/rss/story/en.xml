<li>Bézier curves are fundamental in vector graphics, defined using control points in the Bernstein basis.</li>
<li>Quadratic Bézier curves use three control points, and their arc length can be computed exactly, but the parametrization lacks a closed form solution, assuming Schanuel&#39;s conjecture.</li>
<li>Cubic Bézier curves use four control points, and their arc length must be computed numerically as it lacks a closed form.</li>

<li>A study published in Environmental Sciences &amp; Technology found that house sparrows can accurately predict lead levels in children, particularly in the Australian mining towns of Broken Hill and Mount Isa.</li>
<li>Sparrows could serve as a cost-effective tool for identifying lead contamination hotspots, offering a practical alternative to direct human testing, which is often costly and complex.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Puerto Rico has filed a $1 billion lawsuit against major fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, and ConocoPhillips, for allegedly misleading the public about climate change and delaying the transition to clean energy.</li>
<li>The lawsuit, filed in San Juan, claims these companies violated trade laws by promoting fossil fuels without adequate warnings about their dangers, seeking damages to defend against climate disasters like Hurricane Maria.</li>
<li>This legal action is part of a broader trend of similar lawsuits against the fossil fuel industry, highlighting growing accountability efforts for climate-related impacts.</li>

<li>The theory posits that the brain&#39;s structure, particularly the neocortex&#39;s columns and minicolumns, allows for efficient problem-solving and parallel processing, which could be applied to AI and machine learning (ML).</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A developer has demonstrated using Amazon S3 as a container registry by exposing an S3 bucket through HTTP and uploading container image files to specific paths, allowing for <code>docker pull</code> operations.</li>
<li>The main advantage of using S3 over traditional container registries like DockerHub or Amazon ECR is significantly faster upload speeds due to parallel chunked uploads.</li>
<li>This experimental approach lacks features like automated security scans and access controls but could lead to hosting public container images in Cloudflare’s R2 with free egress.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>CHARM (Coupled Histone tail for Autoinhibition Release of Methyltransferase) is a new gene-silencing tool developed by the Broad Institute and Whitehead Institute, showing potential for treating prion diseases and other neurodegenerative conditions.</li>
<li>This tool uses epigenetic editing to silence disease-causing genes, including the prion protein gene, without altering the underlying DNA, potentially offering a one-time treatment.</li>
<li>The research team, led by Sonia Vallabh and Jonathan Weissman, has made significant progress, creating a compact, effective, and low-toxicity gene silencer, and is now refining CHARM for clinical trials.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The post discusses using value speculation to enhance CPU performance by leveraging the branch predictor to guess values and reduce data dependencies in tight loops.</li>
<li>By speculating the next node&#39;s address in a linked list summation function, the technique aims to bypass L1 cache read delays, resulting in significant performance improvements.</li>
<li>Despite compilers often optimizing away this trick, using inline assembly ensures the speculation remains, leading to a 50-200% increase in function speed when data fits within CPU caches.</li>

<li>A global internet sweep by ICPEN found that 75.7% of 642 websites and mobile apps used at least one dark pattern, with 66.8% using two or more.</li>
<li>Dark patterns are deceptive online practices that manipulate consumer choices, such as auto-renewal traps and interface interference.</li>
<li>The sweep, conducted by 27 consumer protection authorities from 26 countries, highlights the intersection of consumer protection and privacy, with detailed reports available online.</li>

<li>A global study by Sapien Labs indicates that children who receive smartphones at a younger age tend to have poorer mental health as adults, with a stronger effect observed in girls.</li>
<li>The research, involving nearly a million participants, shows a consistent pattern across different regions and languages, linking early smartphone use to worse mental health in young adulthood.</li>
<li>The study suggests that increased exposure to social media and phone addiction may contribute to these mental health issues, urging parents, educators, and policymakers to reconsider the appropriate age for children to receive smartphones.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scott Aaronson&#39;s blog post clarifies common misconceptions in theoretical computer science, particularly the difference between computability and complexity.</li>
<li>He uses examples, such as a function determining God&#39;s existence, to illustrate that computability pertains to functions, not individual questions, and addresses misunderstandings about the P vs. NP problem.</li>
<li>Aaronson explains that computability concerns the existence of a program to map inputs to outputs, not the difficulty of creating that program, and discusses the Busy Beaver function to highlight uncomputable versus computable values.</li>

<li>A report by Feedback and various West African and Norwegian organizations highlights that nearly 2 million metric tons of wild fish are harvested annually to produce fish oil for Norwegian farmed salmon feed.</li>
<li>This practice is negatively impacting livelihoods and causing malnutrition in West African countries such as The Gambia, Senegal, and Mauritania, with the potential to triple the demand for wild-caught fish by 2050.</li>
<li>Major feed producers like Mowi, Skretting, Cargill, and Biomar are sourcing fish oil from northwest Africa, leading to significant declines in local fish stocks and incomes, prompting calls for sustainability measures.</li>
