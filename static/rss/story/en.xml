<li>Archaeologists found evidence that early Europeans consumed seaweed and other aquatic plants, as per an analysis of fossilized dental plaque.</li>
<li>A study published in Nature Communications analyzed samples from 74 early humans across 28 European sites and found traces of seaweed and aquatic plants in 26 samples.</li>
<li>These findings challenge the assumption that the advent of farming reduced the consumption of these aquatic foods and present an argument for their nutritional benefits and environmental sustainability.</li>

<li>A study by Duke University researchers connects glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, to significant levels of chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka&#39;s rural communities.</li>
<li>The study suggests that glyphosate can form complexes with certain trace metals in hard water, enabling it to remain for extended periods. Moreover, higher levels of harmful fluoride and vanadium were found in the communities&#39; drinking water.</li>
<li>These findings indicate a potential serious health risk from glyphosate and accentuate the need for close scrutiny on the potential implications of other contaminants.</li>

<li>The European Commission&#39;s proposed regulation to combat child sexual abuse could be susceptible to function creep, in which the client-side scanning system may detect non-CSAM (child sexual abuse material) content.</li>
<li>There&#39;re potential risks that entities with access could adulterate the CSAM database with non-relevant data, affecting communication and raising privacy issues.</li>
<li>Success of this proposed system hinges on the abuse centers&#39; capacity to spot and manage false positives and malicious entries; hence, the design and handling of reports in the client-side scanning system are critical.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article tracks the transformation of road usage norms, primarily influenced by auto groups and manufacturers in the 1920s to deflect responsibility for accidents from drivers to pedestrians.</li>
<li>As the automobile prevalence increased, leading to a rise in pedestrian fatalities, industry groups advocated effectively for laws confining pedestrians to crosswalks and deploying strategies to ridicule jaywalkers.</li>
<li>The term &quot;jaywalking&quot; was created to label those disobeying these new laws as ignorant and hazardous to public safety, showing how the auto industry successfully shifted the streets&#39; perception as zones for vehicles and not pedestrians.</li>

<li>The Dutch parliament held a hearing on the EU&#39;s &quot;Chatcontrol&quot; proposal which pertains to client-side scanning; a debated technology that scans private messages, potentially leading to unwarranted investigations.</li>
<li>Despite parliamentary opposition through two motions, the Dutch government has decided to disregard them, thus maintaining the pursuit for said technology.</li>
<li>Concerns raised at the hearing were about not only the intrusion into private conversations but also the unproven effectiveness of the technology, with an additional warning against possible cooperation with China in this field.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A vulnerability has been found in the HTTP/2 protocol that could be used to launch a denial-of-service attack on NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, and related products, affecting the NGINX HTTP/2 module.</li>
<li>The vulnerability lets an attacker rapidly cancel numerous HTTP/2 streams, thereby overloading the server without triggering its configured threshold.</li>
<li>NGINX has issued a patch to tackle this vulnerability, improving system stability by imposing a limit on the number of new streams within one event loop. They advise users to update to the newest packages and tweak configuration files for added protection. Limiting connections and requests from single clients is also advised. Cloudflare, Amazon, and Google assisted in mitigating this vulnerability.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Michael Liebreich, a recognized analyst, suggests that the oil sector promotes hydrogen fuel-cell cars to delay the electrification of cars, arguing they are inefficient and costly compared to electric solutions.</li>
<li>Liebreich has developed the &quot;Hydrogen Ladder,&quot; positioning cars and domestic heating at the bottom as uncompetitive use-cases for hydrogen, asserting that companies might be promoting hydrogen to slow down the shift to electrification.</li>
<li>He opposes the need for hydrogen cars, stating that electric vehicles already excel in efficiency, performance, and convenience, and disagrees with the application of hydrogen for domestic heating due to inefficiencies and safety concerns.</li>

<li>The author emphasizes the significance of using tried-and-true technology for its robust documentation, familiarity, and established ecosystems.</li>
<li>Innovative tech should only be opted for if it dramatically boosts the chance of problem-solving. This idea forms a part of the author&#39;s tech selection framework, which includes understanding issues, validating solutions, refining complexity, evaluating designs, and exposing ideas to critics.</li>
<li>However, the author advises remaining clear of cutting-edge technologies to reserve capacity for innovations. This framework&#39;s approach is primarily for work projects, as personal projects are prioritized based on personal enjoyment and learning potential.</li>
