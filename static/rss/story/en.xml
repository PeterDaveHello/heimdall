      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The EU Commission&#39;s &quot;Chat Control&quot; proposal aims to implement mass surveillance, potentially compromising citizens&#39; privacy and data security.</li>
<li>If passed, it would require service providers to scan messages for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), but critics argue it is ineffective against criminals and harmful to democracy.</li>
<li>Threema, a secure communication service, opposes the proposal and may leave the EU to avoid compliance, highlighting the potential misuse and opposition from privacy advocates.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers from Arizona State University suggest that humans began rapidly accumulating technological knowledge through social learning around 600,000 years ago, marking the origin of cumulative culture.</li>
<li>The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed stone tool manufacturing techniques over 3.3 million years, noting a significant increase in complexity around 600,000 years ago.</li>
<li>This period, likely in the Middle Pleistocene epoch, also saw advancements like controlled use of fire and construction of wooden structures, indicating cumulative culture predates the divergence of Neanderthals and modern humans.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>3D programming involves various techniques for 3D rotations, including rotation matrices, Euler angles, and quaternions, each with its own advantages and limitations.</li>
<li>Euler angles can cause issues like gimbal lock and inconsistent angular velocity, making them less suitable for interpolation in applications like robotics.</li>
<li>Quaternions and axis/angle rotations are highlighted as more effective for composing and interpolating rotations, with quaternions offering a robust method for 3D point rotations and easy computation of the exponential map.</li>

<li>Tesla is offering a free trial of their Full Self-Driving (FSD) system, but users report it still makes significant errors, requiring driver intervention.</li>
<li>In multiple tests, FSD made mistakes such as incorrect lane changes, nervous corrections, and even running a red light, leading to concerns about its reliability.</li>
<li>The author concludes that while FSD shows potential, it currently lacks practical value and prefers the more reliable autopilot features like adaptive cruise control and lane centering.</li>

<li>In 1969, high school student Jim Storer created the first Lunar Landing game, which involved piloting a moon lander and managing fuel burn every 10 simulated seconds.</li>
<li>A bug in the game, unnoticed for 55 years, involved a missing &quot;divide by two&quot; that caused incorrect landing detection; fixing this improves landing accuracy.</li>
<li>The game used advanced numerical methods for its time, such as the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation and Taylor series expansion, making it a notable achievement in early game design.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article introduces &quot;abliteration,&quot; a technique to uncensor Llama models without retraining by removing their refusal mechanism.</li>
<li>Abliteration identifies and removes the &quot;refusal direction&quot; in the model&#39;s residual stream, allowing it to respond to all prompts.</li>
<li>The technique was applied to the Daredevil-8B model, resulting in the NeuralDaredevil-8B, an uncensored LLM with top performance in the 8B category, though it required further training to recover performance drops.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>In 2017, T-Mobile promised no price increases for users sticking to the same plan, but recently announced price hikes of up to $5 per line on older plans, surprising many customers.</li>
<li>T-Mobile&#39;s &quot;Un-contract&quot; promise included a clause that the company would pay the final month&#39;s bill if customers canceled due to a price increase, but this information is now harder to find.</li>
<li>T-Mobile is defending itself against an FCC complaint, stating that customers with the &quot;Price Lock&quot; guarantee (April 2022 - January 2024) are not affected by the recent price hikes, provided they stay on the qualifying plan.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article highlights Chris, a software engineer, who revisited Gleam, a type-safe language on the BEAM, after the release of Gleam V1 in March 2024 and was impressed by its static typing.</li>
<li>Key features of Gleam include tagged unions, pattern matching, and a robust type system, with a compiler and CLI that simplify development, contrasting with JavaScript&#39;s complexity.</li>
<li>Gleam&#39;s integration with the BEAM ecosystem and OTP for building fault-tolerant software, along with its ability to transpile to JavaScript, makes it appealing to JavaScript developers; the article also introduces Lustre, a Gleam web framework.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article by Philip Ball discusses the concept of emergence, where large-scale patterns arise from numerous microscopic interactions, and the challenge of developing a unified scientific theory for it.</li>
<li>Researchers, including Fernando Rosas, have proposed a new framework using computational mechanics to identify criteria for emergent structures, suggesting that complex systems self-organize into hierarchical levels independent of lower-level details.</li>
<li>The study introduces the concept of informational closure, indicating that macro-level predictability and control are not enhanced by detailed microstate information, and explores its implications for understanding the universe&#39;s structure, causation, and the debate on free will.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Ruxandra Teslo&#39;s Substack post critiques the backlash against Katalin Karikó, co-inventor of mRNA technology, for her criticisms of academia&#39;s political and social dynamics.</li>
<li>Teslo argues that academia undervalues intellectually creative &quot;Weird Nerds&quot; like Karikó, who often lack the interpersonal and political skills needed for academic success, suggesting the internet as a better environment for these individuals.</li>
<li>The post calls for a reevaluation of how human capital is valued in scientific and cultural fields, emphasizing the need for explicit pro-Weird Nerd norms to harness their potential and address academia&#39;s current crisis, including declining public trust.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Dagen H, or &quot;Högertrafikomläggningen,&quot; was the day Sweden switched from left-side to right-side driving on September 3, 1967, to reduce head-on collisions.</li>
<li>The transition required extensive public education, new road markings, and the replacement of 350,000 traffic signs, with non-essential traffic banned during the switch.</li>
<li>Although the change initially reduced accidents, rates returned to normal within two years; trams were largely replaced by buses, with only a few tram lines surviving.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Glenn Fiedler&#39;s blog post on Más Bandwidth highlights the significance of a robust matchmaker for multiplayer games and introduces a matchmaking simulator based on real player data.</li>
<li>The simulator tests the matchmaker&#39;s efficiency in finding low-latency matches, aiming for ≤50ms latency, expanding to ≤100ms if necessary, and ultimately allowing any match if no ideal server is found.</li>
<li>The post underscores the importance of accurate latency estimation and suggests using latency maps and network accelerators, with the simulator showing promising results of matches found in an average of two seconds and 30-40ms RTT (Round-Trip Time).</li>
