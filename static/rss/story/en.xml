            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Cloudflare has emerged victorious in a trial against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks.</li>
<li>The jury concluded that Cloudflare did not infringe on the asserted patent and declared Sable&#39;s patent claims invalid.</li>
<li>The win can be attributed to the efforts of Cloudflare&#39;s legal team, external counsel, and participants in the Project Jengo initiative, which rewards individuals for providing evidence that invalidates patent trolls&#39; claims.</li>
<li>Cloudflare&#39;s success in invalidating parts of three Sable patents has limited their ability to file lawsuits against other companies.</li>
<li>The case underscores the high costs and risks associated with patent litigation and sends a warning to patent trolls that Cloudflare will not be easily intimidated.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>AMD has financially supported the development of an open-source drop-in CUDA implementation called ZLUDA, which enables NVIDIA CUDA applications to run on AMD Radeon GPUs without modifying the source code.</li>
<li>Originally developed for Intel graphics, ZLUDA has been adapted for use on AMD GPUs, but it is not completely fail-safe and lacks full support for NVIDIA OptiX.</li>
<li>The open-source release of ZLUDA allows the identification of the actual Radeon graphics card string, rather than the generic &quot;Graphics Device&quot; label.</li>

<li>A built-in workaround in macOS allows users to adjust whitespace settings in the menu bar to display more application icons and prevent them from being hidden under the notch on new MacBook Pro models.</li>
<li>By using Terminal.app and executing specific commands, users can modify the padding and spacing in the menu bar. A value of 6 proved effective in accommodating more icons.</li>
<li>It&#39;s important to note that continuously adding more apps to the menu bar will still cause the same issue, and users can revert back to the original settings if desired.</li>

<li>Amazon Prime Video has quietly removed support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos from its ad-supported tier, leaving subscribers unaware of the change.</li>
<li>Users opting for the ad-supported tier are now restricted to HDR10+ and Dolby Digital 5.1, potentially to reduce licensing fees paid to Dolby Laboratories and promote HDR10+ as a no-cost alternative.</li>
<li>This is not the first time Amazon has made changes to its Dolby features, further frustrating customers who are feeling the shift towards streaming services resemble traditional cable TV. Amazon has not given a reason for the removal.</li>

<li>Planck used statistical mechanics to calculate the entropy of atomic oscillators, highlighting the need for presenting the true historical development of quantum physics.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author discovers a connection between fractals and neural network training, revealing that the boundary between successful and unsuccessful training exhibits a fractal structure.</li>
<li>Adjusting hyperparameters, like the learning rate, has an impact on the training process, with the best-performing hyperparameters typically found near the convergence-divergence boundary.</li>
<li>Fractal patterns emerge when zooming in on specific training configurations, due to the repeated iteration of functions and the occurrence of bifurcation boundaries. Neural network-generated fractals differ from those produced by low order polynomials in that they appear more organic and lack obvious symmetries.</li>

<li>The Supervisory Committee of the Intelligence and Security Services (CTIVD) in the Netherlands found that police intelligence services illegally monitored entire community groups on three occasions.</li>
<li>The investigations violated Dutch law due to the invasion of privacy involved, and the intelligence services did not properly justify the need for such broad investigations.</li>
<li>The communities targeted were not specified, but they may be based on factors like ethnicity, religious belief, or occupational group. Calls for improved supervision of the intelligence and security services have been made by members of parliament.</li>

<li>The &quot;doorway effect&quot; is a psychological phenomenon where memory loss occurs when moving between locations or passing through doorways.</li>
<li>It is caused by the brain creating separate memory models for different environments.</li>

<li>The author shares their experience of building a search engine from scratch using Python to address the issue of small websites being hard to find on search engines.</li>
<li>The search engine consists of components like the crawler, inverted index, ranker, and interface.</li>
<li>The author improved the speed of the crawler by using asynchronous code with the asyncio library.</li>
<li>They implemented the BM25 ranking algorithm in their search engine and provide examples in their search engine class.</li>
<li>A small FastAPI app was built to interface with the search engine, although some advanced features are missing.</li>
<li>Future plans include adding semantic search capabilities and encouraging others to add an RSS feed to their blogs.</li>
<li>Through this project, the author gained a better understanding of Solr and the benefits of asynchronous code.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Analyzing a Small Language Model's Token Prediction Beyond Self-Attention]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author trained a language model using a transformer and found that each transformer block has different associations between prompts and training data classes, resulting in diverse predictions.</li>
<li>The model was trained on the TinyShakespeare dataset based on Andrej Karpathy&#39;s work on generating Shakespearean text.</li>
<li>The author proposed a method for estimating the output of the transformer model and provided instructions and code for implementation.</li>
<li>They analyzed the role of the feed-forward network, examined frequency distributions of tokens, and compared model predictions to training data.</li>
<li>The author discussed the significance of LayerNorm in a transformer model and the impact of scaling and direction of input vectors on output norms.</li>
<li>They explored the effectiveness of using only feed-forward network outputs for approximation and suggested further research on including self-attention outputs.</li>
<li>SVD was used to achieve a linear approximation of token subspaces in the transformer model.</li>
<li>Understanding the transformer architecture was deemed a valuable learning experience by the author.</li>

<li>The article delves into the book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid&quot; by Douglas Hofstadter and its profound impact on the author&#39;s life.</li>
<li>The book explores various thought-provoking concepts such as epistemic limits, self-reference, and isomorphism, using the characters of Kurt Gödel, M.C. Escher, and Johann Sebastian Bach as symbolic representations.</li>
<li>The author emphasizes how the book has shaped their thinking, particularly in terms of approaching problems from a bottom-up perspective, understanding complex systems, and recognizing the limits of knowledge.</li>

<li>The RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) is a last-resort defense weapon designed to counter incoming anti-ship missiles.</li>
<li>RAM was developed as a more versatile and effective alternative to the Phalanx system, which had limitations in range and debris damage.</li>
<li>RAM utilizes a unique rolling flight mechanism and combines radar and infrared seekers for precise guidance. It has been integrated into naval systems worldwide and is expected to be deployed more extensively in response to the growing threat of anti-ship missiles.</li>

<li>Rye is a Python packaging and project management solution that automates tasks like downloading Python, managing dependencies, and publishing.</li>
<li>It aims to provide a convenient user experience by wrapping established tools and reducing cognitive load for developers.</li>
<li>While it is not a revolutionary solution, Rye has received positive feedback and offers a promising start, inspired by the developer experience in the Rust ecosystem. However, it is currently a one-person project and does not address all the challenges in the Python ecosystem. The author hopes to gather more contributors and promote standardization ideas within the community.</li>
