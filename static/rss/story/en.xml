            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence have proposed different bills to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).</li>
<li>The Judiciary Committee&#39;s bill, H.R. 6570, addresses concerns about warrantless backdoor searches and the purchase of Americans&#39; data without a warrant. It suggests renewing the authority for three more years.</li>
<li>The Intelligence Committee&#39;s bill, H.R. 6611, renews mass surveillance authority for eight years, allows collection of U.S. persons&#39; communications without a warrant, and expands surveillance to vet asylum seekers and a broader range of online providers. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) urges supporting the Judiciary Committee&#39;s bill over the Intelligence Committee&#39;s bill.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article discusses an alternative approach to compiling WebAssembly code by transpiling it into C source code.</li>
<li>This approach allows for improved debugging, easy integration with existing C code, and the ability to compile and run WebAssembly on new platforms.</li>
<li>The transpiled C code can be compiled with a regular C compiler, resulting in faster and smaller executables compared to traditional WebAssembly runtimes.</li>
<li>However, there are limitations, such as the lack of just-in-time compilation and the manual setup of memory guard pages.</li>
<li>The approach is suitable for improving code safety and running WebAssembly on unsupported platforms, but traditional runtimes offer more features and flexibility.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Inert ingredients in pesticides, previously considered non-toxic, may be more harmful to bees than thought, according to new research.</li>
<li>A study exposed honeybees to a fungicide containing both active and inert ingredients and found that the whole formulation impaired the bees&#39; memory, while active ingredients alone did not.</li>
<li>Inert ingredients have different functions and are regulated differently than active ingredients, making it hard to determine their toxicity. Comprehensive testing of pesticide formulations is needed to understand their impact on bee health. Changes to pesticide regulation could help protect bees by identifying inert ingredients on labels and requiring more testing on long-term effects.</li>

<li>This blog post delves into Spotify&#39;s initial approach to shuffling songs in a playlist, and the problem they encountered with consecutive songs by the same artist.</li>
<li>Spotify modified their shuffling algorithm to evenly distribute artists throughout the playlist by implementing dithering algorithms.</li>
<li>The author explores a method for selecting colors using the HSV space and applies the Fibonacci hashing algorithm to evenly distribute colors.</li>
<li>The post discusses an algorithm for shuffling songs based on artists and compares it with the Fisher-Yates shuffle.</li>
<li>Fiedler&#39;s algorithm, the history of hashing, and the use of hash functions to reduce stored item information are also covered.</li>
<li>The post concludes by suggesting the conversion of a number into binary format and dividing it by a prime number to determine an address.</li>

<li>Many employees felt pressured to sign an open letter demanding Altman&#39;s reinstatement and the resignation of the OpenAI board, driven by a clash of cultures, lack of respect for Microsoft&#39;s talent bar, and disbelief in compensation promises.</li>
<li>Money was also a motivating factor, as millions of dollars in equity were at risk if OpenAI were to collapse. However, Altman has been reinstated, and the planned tender offer for equity is proceeding, valuing OpenAI at over $80 billion. Microsoft employees were upset with the promise to match salaries for OpenAI employees, considering Microsoft&#39;s previous layoffs and salary cuts.</li>

<li>Sony&#39;s recent content removals and account bans on PlayStation showcase the vulnerabilities of digital ownership.</li>
<li>Users lost access to purchased Discovery content due to licensing arrangements, and some experienced unexpected bans from their PlayStation Network accounts, resulting in the loss of digitally purchased games.</li>
<li>Sony has restored account access for affected users, but no explanation or assurance against future bans has been provided. These incidents emphasize the fragility of digital ownership, leading users to consider purchasing physical copies of games and media.</li>

<li>Genetic testing company 23andMe is changing its Terms of Service (TOS) to include binding arbitration for dispute resolution instead of focusing on strengthening its security measures.</li>
<li>This update means that users would have to bring their cases to a neutral third-party arbitrator, whose decision would be final and legally binding.</li>
<li>Users have a 30-day period to opt out of these new terms, but the change has drawn criticism as it reduces users&#39; rights and protections in the event of a security breach.</li>

<li>Mozilla Firefox browser may face a decline in support from U.S. government websites due to its low market share.</li>
<li>The U.S. Web Design System only supports browsers with over 2% usage, and currently, Firefox has a 2.2% share.</li>
<li>The rise of Chrome and Safari on mobile devices is contributing to the decline of Firefox&#39;s usage.</li>
<li>If Firefox falls below the 2% threshold, it may no longer be supported by government websites, potentially leading to a domino effect with corporations discontinuing support as well.</li>

<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing surveillance and spying, allowing for the tracking of activities and the understanding of conversations at an unprecedented scale.</li>
<li>AI-powered systems can now summarize meetings and organize millions of conversations, enabling mass spying where all data is saved, searchable, and comprehensible in large quantities.</li>
<li>Mass spying can reveal intricate details about individuals, including their relationships, alliances, and conversations, and is fueled by ubiquitous microphones like Siri and Alexa.</li>
<li>Governments, corporations, and tech monopolies are already engaging in mass surveillance, and mass spying will worsen personalized advertising and erode privacy.</li>
<li>Limiting mass spying would require robust data privacy regulations, although little has been done thus far to address mass surveillance.</li>
