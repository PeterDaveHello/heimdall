            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Apple has admitted to deliberately disabling progressive web apps (PWAs) on iPhones in the EU, citing compliance with the new Digital Markets Act regulation as the reason.</li>
<li>The complexity of the regulation&#39;s requirement to allow multiple browser engines led to the elimination of PWA functionality on iOS 17.4 beta, downgrading PWAs to mere website shortcuts.</li>
<li>This move has caused significant problems for users, including data loss and non-functioning notifications, making it impractical for Apple to continue supporting PWAs in the EU.</li>

<li>Physicists are continuing to investigate the intricate nature of protons, as they have been found to exhibit various forms depending on observation.</li>
<li>Recent research has revealed that protons contain charm quarks that are actually heavier than the proton itself, challenging the traditional understanding of proton composition.</li>
<li>The conventional quark model, which posits that protons are composed of three quarks, is considered to be an oversimplification in light of these findings.</li>
<li>Machine learning analysis has demonstrated that protons can exist in multiple states, including a rare state featuring five quarks.</li>
<li>Understanding the composition of protons is crucial for experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider and for studying cosmic rays.</li>
<li>Future experiments aim to delve deeper into the structure of protons, providing more comprehensive information in this field.</li>

<li>The win can be attributed to the efforts of Cloudflare&#39;s legal team, external counsel, and participants in the Project Jengo initiative, which rewards individuals for providing evidence that invalidates patent trolls&#39; claims.</li>
<li>Cloudflare&#39;s success in invalidating parts of three Sable patents has limited their ability to file lawsuits against other companies.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A built-in workaround in macOS allows users to adjust whitespace settings in the menu bar to display more application icons and prevent them from being hidden under the notch on new MacBook Pro models.</li>
<li>By using Terminal.app and executing specific commands, users can modify the padding and spacing in the menu bar. A value of 6 proved effective in accommodating more icons.</li>
<li>It&#39;s important to note that continuously adding more apps to the menu bar will still cause the same issue, and users can revert back to the original settings if desired.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Amazon Prime Video has quietly removed support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos from its ad-supported tier, leaving subscribers unaware of the change.</li>
<li>Users opting for the ad-supported tier are now restricted to HDR10+ and Dolby Digital 5.1, potentially to reduce licensing fees paid to Dolby Laboratories and promote HDR10+ as a no-cost alternative.</li>
<li>This is not the first time Amazon has made changes to its Dolby features, further frustrating customers who are feeling the shift towards streaming services resemble traditional cable TV. Amazon has not given a reason for the removal.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>This paper debunks a popular myth in quantum physics about Max Planck&#39;s motivation for introducing quantum physics.</li>
<li>The authors argue that the commonly told story of the ultraviolet catastrophe is incorrect and that Planck was actually focused on deriving the law for blackbody radiation.</li>
<li>Planck used statistical mechanics to calculate the entropy of atomic oscillators, highlighting the need for presenting the true historical development of quantum physics.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author discovers a connection between fractals and neural network training, revealing that the boundary between successful and unsuccessful training exhibits a fractal structure.</li>
<li>Adjusting hyperparameters, like the learning rate, has an impact on the training process, with the best-performing hyperparameters typically found near the convergence-divergence boundary.</li>
<li>Fractal patterns emerge when zooming in on specific training configurations, due to the repeated iteration of functions and the occurrence of bifurcation boundaries. Neural network-generated fractals differ from those produced by low order polynomials in that they appear more organic and lack obvious symmetries.</li>

<li>A broker in Queens, New York listed a below-market-rate one-bedroom apartment for $1,100 a month, but with a $15,000 broker fee, making it challenging for tenants to rent due to upfront cash requirements.</li>
<li>Excessive broker fees in New York City&#39;s real estate market are causing difficulties for tenants who want to relocate.</li>
<li>A new City Council bill has been proposed that would shift the responsibility of paying the broker fee from the tenant to the party that hired the broker, but critics argue that this could lead to higher rents.</li>

<li>Lawmakers recommend implementing restrictions on US investments in entities sanctioned or flagged by the government and imposing outbound investment restrictions related to China&#39;s critical technologies, military capabilities, and human rights violations.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Recent research has revealed that the appendix, previously considered a useless organ, actually plays important roles in supporting the immune system and housing beneficial gut bacteria.</li>
<li>Appendicitis, the inflammation of the appendix, is more prevalent in regions with low-fiber diets and may be influenced by the hygiene hypothesis.</li>
<li>Efforts are underway to develop alternative treatments for appendicitis to avoid surgical removal, as studies have shown potential health benefits in keeping the appendix. This highlights the significance of studying small anatomical details and continuously uncovering variations and functions within the human body.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A team of web developers at YouTube devised a plan to encourage users of Internet Explorer 6 (IE6) to upgrade to a modern browser due to the numerous issues it caused.</li>
<li>They implemented a small banner on YouTube that urged IE6 users to upgrade, resulting in a 50% decline in the IE6 user base on the platform within one month.</li>
<li>Other Google properties also adopted similar banners, leading to a significant decrease in global IE6 traffic. The team, however, decided to refrain from executing such a plan in the future.</li>
