<li>Eric Ghost, a prominent figure in the 1960s counterculture, distributed LSD disguised as film stock, associating it with modern media tech and highlighting its transformative effects.</li>
<li>Ghost revolutionized LSD distribution by introducing the first mass-produced blotter paper infused with LSD drops, framing the drug as a scientific product inspired by modern research and pharmaceutical companies.</li>
<li>The concept of &quot;set and setting&quot; influencing psychedelic experiences was pivotal in postwar psychedelic culture, and Ghost&#39;s narrative delves into LSD&#39;s clinical uses, controversies, like its controversial application as a &quot;cure&quot; for homosexuality, detailed in Erik Davis&#39;s book &quot;Blotter: The Untold Story of an Acid Medium.&quot;</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Rotary Phone Project recreates a MoMA exhibit by using vintage rotary phones connected to Asterisk and Grandstream devices for an interactive experience.</li>
<li>It involves setting up Asterisk on a server, connecting the rotary phone, playing audio files, and configuring Twilio for phone calls.</li>
<li>The project offers features such as checking MTA train statuses, accepting input, and sharing jokes, bringing joy to the author&#39;s son while presenting challenges like debugging SIP connections.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Ken Shirriff&#39;s blog provides an in-depth analysis of the Intel 8088 microprocessor, particularly focusing on its prefetch circuitry and performance implications.</li>
<li>The blog compares the 8086 and 8088, elaborates on the decision-making process favoring the 8088 for the IBM PC, and explains the roles of the Bus Interface Unit and Execution Unit.</li>
<li>Topics include prefetch queue synchronization, instruction decoder, processor design elements like flip-flops and control lines, and the importance of caches in memory operations. The blog also touches on electronics, programming, and space exploration since 2008.</li>
</ul>
