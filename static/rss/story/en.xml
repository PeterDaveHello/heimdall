<li>Benchmarking results reveal that GPT-4 Turbo, a code editing model, solves slightly fewer tasks compared to its predecessor GPT-4, potentially due to unclear instructions.</li>
<li>GPT-4 appears to have memorized the training tasks more effectively, while GPT-4 Turbo seems to have lost some of this memorization capability.</li>
<li>Additional benchmarks conducted without showing the models the instructions demonstrate that GPT-4 has a higher level of exercises memorized than GPT-4 Turbo.</li>
<li>The article highlights the importance of developing better benchmarks and improving the evaluation process to accurately assess the performance of different models in the future.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The European Commission has been criticized for withholding a list of companies consulted about detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) without undermining encryption, leading to accusations of &quot;maladministration&quot; by the European Ombudsman.</li>
<li>Concerns about transparency and the influence of lobbyists in drafting the CSAM regulation have been raised due to the Commission&#39;s refusal to disclose the list.</li>
<li>Experts have expressed differing opinions on whether detecting CSAM in encrypted content is currently feasible, with some warning against potential mass surveillance and violations of EU communication monitoring laws.</li>

<li>Satellite data reveals that oil and gas production in Texas emits double the amount of methane compared to New Mexico due to stricter regulations in the latter state.</li>
<li>Texas has been releasing higher rates of methane per unit of production since 2019, potentially making it a &quot;super-emitter&quot; site that environmentalists are calling for tougher regulations on.</li>
<li>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is finalizing new federal rules to reduce methane emissions, expected to be announced later this month. Governments are urged to take swift action to cut methane emissions, as it would have a significant impact on slowing down climate change.</li>

<li>Patrick McKenzie criticizes banks for their operational inefficiencies due to a disorganized structure and ineffective communication between subsystems, leading to problems like account closures and credit card fraud.</li>
<li>He points out how the tiered customer service system, intended to save banks&#39; time and resources, often exacerbate customer frustration and inefficiencies. Additionally, he calls out certain legal obligations, like non-disclosed Suspicious Activity Reports, that can lead to abrupt account shutdowns and add confusion for customers.</li>
<li>McKenzie suggests technological improvements could enhance banking operations and customer service, but acknowledges the time needed for its system-wide adoption. He also asks for a reassessment of some regulations generating unnecessary harm to customers.</li>

<li>Jeff Johnson has initiated a boycott against Apple&#39;s Feedback Assistant, urging developers to file new feedbacks about existing issues, but refuse to respond to current ones until improvements are made.</li>
<li>Significant issues highlighted include Apple&#39;s lack of response, random closing of feedbacks, ignoring developer bug reports, demanding detailed sysdiagnose reports, neglecting smaller methods for diagnosing bugs, lack of search function for bugs, and a mandate to file all feedbacks via macOS or iOS.</li>
<li>The boycott, compared to a labor strike, emphasizes the unrecognized and unpaid contribution of developers in testing and refining Apple&#39;s software and products. It does not criticize individual Apple engineers but challenges the company&#39;s leadership.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Mozilla has disclosed plans to shift the development of Firefox from Mercurial to Git, prompted by the struggles in managing both tools.</li>
<li>Although the repository will be moved to GitHub, Mozilla will continue its current contribution process and will not accept Pull Requests at this time.</li>
<li>The transition will be achieved in two stages: the first involves changes primarily affecting developers, and the second will transfer the back-end infrastructure from Mercurial to Git. The initiation of the process will follow a planning period of at least six months.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A significant number of grizzly bears have perished since the 1980s along a railway line close to Glacier National Park, Montana, primarily caused by intoxication from fermented grain spillage from the railcars.</li>
<li>The blend of spilled grain and moisture initiates fermentation, attracting the bears, with already three reported deaths in 2021 due to train hits.</li>
<li>Although mitigations like reducing grain quantity in railcars and setting noise triggers in known &quot;kill zones&quot; are proposed, limited action has been taken to resolve this issue so far.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Scientists at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) have made the first observation of a satellite virus constantly attaching to a helper bacteriophage—a virus that infects bacterial cells.</li>
<li>In tests conducted on 50 helper satellites, it was found that 80% had a satellite bound at the neck.</li>
<li>The UMBC team discovered a unique satellite devoid of any integration gene, suggesting it ensures survival inside the host by attaching to a helper, rather than integrating into the host cell&#39;s DNA.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A California jury has awarded Mike Dennis $332 million in a lawsuit against Monsanto, now a division of Bayer, alleging his rare form of non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphoma resulted from using Monsanto&#39;s Roundup weedkiller.</li>
<li>The active ingredient in Roundup, glyphosate, is at the heart of the lawsuit. A portion ($7 million) of Dennis&#39;s awarded total covers compensatory damages, while the bulk ($325 million) is for punitive damages.</li>
<li>Bayer, dealing with thousands of similar Roundup-related claims, plans to appeal the verdict. This follows Bayer&#39;s 2020 commitment of up to $10.9 billion set aside for settling approximately 125,000 claims.</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Light can make water evaporate without heat]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>MIT researchers have found that light can cause water to evaporate without heat, a process more effective than heat-induced evaporation. This happens at the intersection of water and air, often seen in natural phenomena like fog and cloud formation.</li>
<li>This process, known as the photomolecular effect, can play a significant role in solar-powered desalination of water and various industrial processes.</li>
<li>The research team is steering efforts to use the new-found process in addressing real-world problems such as improving solar desalination systems and examining climate change impacts.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Northwestern University neurobiologists discovered that a single sleepless night can briefly alleviate depression due to increased dopamine release and enhanced synaptic plasticity in the brain.</li>
<li>These findings can contribute valuable insights to understanding mood transitions, effective quick-acting antidepressants, and new possibilities for antidepressant medications.</li>
<li>Despite these benefits, the researchers urge against purposely inducing sleep deprivation as a solution since chronic sleep deprivation can have universally harmful effects.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Google has stopped development on the controversial Web Environment Integrity API, initially aimed at curbing online fraud, due to criticisms of it being too similar to digital rights management (DRM) for websites, potentially threatening online freedom and dictating browser preference.</li>
<li>Now, Google plans to employ a more constrained variant of this technology exclusively for Android WebViews, a version of Chrome designed to be integrated within Android applications.</li>
<li>This shift in focus emerged after significant critical feedback from the tech community; Google&#39;s Android team confirmed no plans to implement this functionality beyond Android WebViews and integrated media.</li>

<li>Ben Stein, co-founder of QuitCarbon, addresses the issue of prompt injection in Language Learning Models (LLMs) discovered during his use of an AI text adventure game, stating that such intrusion can be used by malicious actors to ask damaging or inappropriate petitions.</li>
<li>Stein found that by asking the LLM to sanitize inputs before processing them, it was possible to effectively identify and counter manipulation attempts. The model demonstrated reliable performance in detecting inappropriate requests.</li>
<li>Despite promising initial results, Stein admits more testing is required and argues that future solutions might require built-in defenses in applications or measures at the edge, similar to web application firewalls.</li>

<li>A recent study from Monash University has found a connection between a lack of deep sleep, known as slow-wave sleep, and an increased risk of dementia in older adults.</li>
<li>The research shows that even a 1% annual decline in deep sleep for people above the age of 60 results in a 27% higher risk of dementia.</li>
<li>The study, which monitored 346 participants aged 60 and above for dementia onset for 17 years, suggests that improving or maintaining slow-wave sleep could be a possible preventative measure for dementia.</li>
