<li>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and 17 states have launched an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of monopolization and unfair competition primarily because of its Prime membership program.</li>
<li>The allegations put forth in the lawsuit include the high fees charged to third-party sellers leading to increased consumer prices, discouraging sellers from offering cheaper prices on other platforms, and deteriorating the user experience.</li>
<li>If the suit is successful, it could result in lower prices, heightened competition, and possible remedies like putting an end to anti-discounting measures or splitting up Amazon. The complaint also brings up the secretive nature of antitrust courts and Amazon’s document destruction.</li>

<li>Google announces extended support for its Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, promising seven years of OS and security updates until 2030.</li>
<li>This extended support, a leap from Google&#39;s previous policy, surpasses its Android competition and is made possible due to Google&#39;s use of its own Tensor processor.</li>
<li>Despite similar long-term support offered by Apple and even longer by Fairphone, skepticism exists due to Google&#39;s inconsistent history of supporting other services and initiatives.</li>

<li>The &quot;streaming-llm&quot; project aims to implement Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications without sacrificing efficiency or performance, overcoming memory consumption and limitations in handling longer texts.</li>
<li>This project introduces the concept of attention sinks and the StreamingLLM framework, which allows LLMs to manage infinite-length inputs without the need for fine-tuning. This method outperforms other techniques in speed and stability, but it is not ideal for summarizing extensive texts.</li>
<li>The project plans on releasing code, data, and evaluation instruments in the future and encourages citation of their paper for those keen on using the StreamingLLM framework.</li>

<li>NASA&#39;s Fermi Satellite discovered that the abundance of antimatter particles from the center of the Milky Way is likely due to pulsars, not dark matter as previously theorized.</li>
<li>Pulsars, which generate matter-antimatter pairs through their relativistic jets and swiftly moving material, challenge the former belief about dark matter being the source of antimatter.</li>
<li>The study utilized the most up-to-date, high-resolution, high-energy cosmic map produced by the Fermi Satellite, indicating the need for further investigations to comprehend the elusive nature of dark matter.</li>

<li>Designer Luke Talbot has developed MyPowerbank, a portable phone charger meant for homeless people. It can be attached to rental bikes and powered by pedaling backwards.</li>

<li>Economists have expressed concern over a potential population drop due to a forecasted decrease in global population.</li>
<li>Despite these warnings, most demographers suggest that the global population will stabilize instead of significantly reducing. This is due to the trend towards smaller family units and the increase in women&#39;s reproductive choices.</li>
<li>This expected stabilization of the population is considered beneficial for the future of humanity.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Engineers from MIT and China have developed a solar-powered desalination system capable of converting seawater into potable water.</li>
<li>The system capitalizes on natural sunlight to heat the seawater, which, upon evaporation, leaves behind salt while the water vapor is collected as pure drinking water.</li>
<li>This method showcases higher water-production and salt-rejection rates, and researchers estimate that it can yield up to 6 liters of drinkable water per hour if scaled up. These features make the system potentially more affordable than tap water over time.</li>

<li>This system exhibits a high water-production rate, long lifespan without the need for part replacements, making it ideal for off-grid coastal communities; it produces sufficient drinking water for a small family.</li>
<li>The unique design of the system takes inspiration from the ocean&#39;s convection circulation to prevent salt accumulation and system blockage, and it is estimated to be more cost-effective than standard tap water production in the United States.</li>

<li>Ariel Miculas, a software engineer at Cisco, had a discouraging experience where he felt he was denied acknowledgement for his first contribution to the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>He had developed a patch to fix a bug affecting debugging capabilities in the project, but the PowerPC maintainer, instead of accepting his patch, created his own fix.</li>
<li>The maintainer only credited Ariel for reporting the issue, not for his work in creating the patch, leading Ariel to feel undervalued and disheartened.</li>

<li>Mutton, meat from mature sheep, is not readily available in the US and typically found only in specialty butcher stores or ethnic markets.</li>
<li>The consumption of mutton has declined since the 20th century due to the replacement of wool by synthetic fibers in sheep farming, and its longer required cooking times.</li>
<li>Despite having a unique, strong flavor that some people enjoy, mutton is broadly perceived negatively in contemporary American society.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Researchers have uncovered a new cross-origin attack, dubbed &#39;GPU.zip&#39;, that reveals usernames, passwords, and other sensitive visual data displayed by websites using GPUs from major suppliers.</li>
<li>The attack enables malicious websites to read and reconstruct pixels from a different domain in order to view the content of the targeted site, thereby bypassing the same-origin policy, a fundamental security principle that segregates content from different website domains.</li>
<li>GPU.zip leverages data compression used by internal and discrete GPUs to exploit a side channel and steal pixels. The vulnerability has been demonstrated on GPUs made by Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Arm, and Nvidia.</li>
