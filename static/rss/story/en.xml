            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Federal Reserve has set a 2% target inflation rate influenced by New Zealand&#39;s central bank in 1989 to stabilize prices and boost economic growth.</li>
<li>Higher inflation targets are preferred to deter deflation and stimulate spending in economic downturns, impacting the Fed&#39;s credibility and triggering inflation cycles if changed.</li>
<li>Establishing the right inflation target is vital for sustaining a robust and thriving economy.</li>
</ul>
