<li>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) and other Open Source communities have been involved in discussions with European regulators regarding the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and Product Liability Directive (PLD) in 2023.</li>
<li>Initial concerns were raised about the potential impact of the CRA on Open Source development, but after extensive engagement, the final text has addressed most of the risks for individual developers and Open Source foundations.</li>
<li>There are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as clarifying responsibilities under the CRA and PLD, and OSI recommends that the European Commission seek expert advice from the Open Source communities.</li>
<li>There is a call for future legislative engagement that includes the Fourth Sector and a series of workshops will be organized at FOSDEM 2024 for further discussion.</li>

<li>Large-scale cryptocurrency operations in the US are estimated to consume over 2% of the country&#39;s electricity, prompting the government to monitor the energy implications of bitcoin mining.</li>
<li>Bitcoin mining contributes to the use of fossil fuels as miners set up near underutilized power plants, leading to increased electricity generation.</li>
<li>Some mining operations have joined demand-response programs to offset potential energy shortages, and the US Energy Information Agency will be conducting monthly analyses to assess the impact on the electric grid.</li>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author investigates the maximum size limit for PDF documents and finds that Adobe Acrobat sets a limit of 381 kilometers by 381 kilometers.</li>
<li>The author explores the internal structure of PDFs and learns how to manually edit them to create larger PDFs by changing the page size and user unit.</li>
<li>However, it is noted that the user unit value is not widely used and may not have practical implications for most PDF documents. The author creates a PDF claiming to be larger than the entire universe, but it may not have any real-world significance.</li>

<li>Macaroons are a type of security token system that uses HMAC-signed bearer tokens with claims called caveats to restrict authorization.</li>
<li>The ordering of caveats is not important, and all caveats must pass for a request to be successful.</li>
<li>Macaroons address the vulnerabilities of simple bearer tokens by allowing for user-editable and JIT-generated tokens.</li>
<li>They can be implemented in permission systems for public cloud platforms and used for first and third-party caveats.</li>
<li>Code implementation for creating and verifying tokens with third-party caveats is also discussed.</li>
<li>Macaroons are used in platforms like Fly.io and in token-based authentication systems for worker servers.</li>
<li>Overall, Macaroons offer enhanced security, flexibility, and the ability to stack different identity providers.</li>

<li>RavenDB, a distributed document database, has raised concerns about its support for ACID transactions and its consistency in meeting those guarantees.</li>
<li>Testing has revealed safety errors, including lost updates, fractured reads, and consistency model violations, raising questions about the behavior of transactions and sessions in RavenDB.</li>
<li>Users are advised to reassess their transactions, conduct tests, and ensure that application invariants are maintained. RavenDB should provide clearer information on their safety properties and remove false claims from their marketing materials. Further research is needed to clarify the boundaries of transactions and sessions, as well as concerns about fault tolerance, secondary indices, and cross-shard transactions. Network partitions may impact RavenDB&#39;s performance.</li>

<li>MIT researchers have developed liquid metal printing (LMP), a technique that enables rapid production of large-scale aluminum parts, including furniture.</li>
<li>LMP involves depositing molten aluminum onto a bed of small glass beads, resulting in quick hardening into a 3D structure. It is at least 10 times faster than other metal additive manufacturing processes.</li>
<li>LMP prioritizes speed and scale over resolution. The technique has potential applications in architecture, construction, industrial design, rapid prototyping with recycled metal, and can be combined with other high-resolution processes and materials to create functional furniture.</li>

      ><![CDATA[HPV Vaccine Study Finds Zero Cases of Cervical Cancer in Fully Vaccinated Women Under 14]]></title>
            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>A recent study conducted in Scotland has shown that women born between 1988-1996 and fully vaccinated against HPV at ages 12-13 had zero cases of cervical cancer.</li>
<li>This is the first national study to track a group of women over a long period and find no instances of cervical cancer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine.</li>
<li>The study highlights the importance of timely vaccination and suggests that even receiving the vaccine between ages 14-22 still significantly reduces the risk of cervical cancer. However, it&#39;s important to note that other HPV strains not covered by the vaccine can still cause cervical cancer. Continued screening for early detection is crucial.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Zeb Figura from CodeWeavers has suggested a Windows NT synchronization primitive driver to enhance the performance of running Windows apps and games on Linux using Wine/Proton.</li>
<li>The proposed driver would directly implement the NT synchronization primitives in the Linux kernel, eliminating the need for RPC and boosting performance.</li>
<li>Initial tests have shown promising performance improvements in various games, although the specific gains may vary depending on the hardware and software setup.</li>
<li>If the driver is approved and implemented, it could significantly enhance gaming performance on Linux, including on the upcoming Steam Deck with Wine and Proton.</li>
</ul>

      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article explores two types of Merkle Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs): Merkle-DAG CRDTs and Merkle Search Tree CRDTs.</li>
<li>Merkle-DAG CRDTs use a directed acyclic graph to store concurrent updates and minimize syncing bandwidth between replicas.</li>
<li>Merkle Search Tree CRDTs maintain an ordered set of keys in a self-balancing and unique tree structure. The article also discusses the similarities between Merkle CRDTs and Git and the potential for implementing composable CRDTs.</li>

<li>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has partnered with 110 NGOs to voice their concerns about the UN Cybercrime Treaty draft.</li>
<li>They believe that the current version of the treaty lacks sufficient protection for human rights and has transformed into a tool for surveillance.</li>
<li>The EFF is calling on states to reject the treaty unless significant changes are made and will be present at the concluding session from January 29 to February 10.</li>
