            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Hackers have uncovered Unsaflok, a method capable of unlocking any of the 3 million Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks found in hotels worldwide rapidly.</li>
<li>Dormakaba, the company behind Saflok, is in the slow process of updating and replacing the vulnerable locks, with only 36% addressed since becoming aware of the problem in 2022.</li>
<li>Researchers advise hotel guests to remain vigilant and assess if their keycard is still at risk by utilizing the NFC Taginfo app due to the persisting dangers associated with these insecure locks.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>GoFetch is a side-channel attack targeting Apple CPUs with data memory-dependent prefetchers, enabling attackers to retrieve secret keys from constant-time cryptographic implementations.</li>
<li>The vulnerability impacts Apple M1, M2, and M3 processors, along with Intel&#39;s 13th Gen Raptor Lake microarchitecture, through exploiting the DMP feature for cache-timing analysis.</li>
<li>Users can safeguard their systems by applying the latest updates, deactivating DMP on susceptible CPUs, and integrating input blinding in cryptographic protocols to mitigate the risks posed by the GoFetch attack.</li>
