<li>The spiciness of jalapeño peppers has declined due to selective breeding and industrial processing, with the introduction of milder TAM II jalapeño gaining popularity in processing.</li>
<li>Most jalapeños are now used in salsas and sauces due to their lack of spiciness, although some chefs and experts still prefer spicier varieties like Mitla and Early jalapeños.</li>
<li>The shift towards milder peppers is driven by the industry&#39;s need for consistency, but consumers can advocate for spicier types by requesting specific breeds from suppliers and grocers.</li>
