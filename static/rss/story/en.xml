            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The author developed a nerdy video game where players assume the role of an operating system and must manage CPU cores, processes, memory pages, and swap space to avoid frustrating the user.</li>
<li>The game includes various elements such as processes, CPUs, I/O events, and different difficulty levels.</li>
<li>While the game is designed for playability rather than realism, it can also serve as an educational tool for computer science students to learn about operating system principles.</li>
<li>The game has been compiled to WebAssembly, allowing it to be played in web browsers.</li>
<li>It is available for play on itch.io, and the source code is open source on GitHub.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>80% of bosses regret their initial decisions on return-to-office plans, realizing they should have considered employee preferences instead of relying solely on executive opinions.</li>
<li>Companies like Disney, Starbucks, and BlackRock are requiring more in-person work, while Zoom reversed its policy to allow employees to choose between hybrid, in-person, or remote work.</li>
<li>Companies involving employees in decision-making have had greater success in returning to the office, while those with strict policies without employee input are experiencing turnover issues. Companies like Ernst &amp; Young have seen positive responses from employees after implementing reimbursements for commuting and childcare costs. It may take another year or two for companies to establish a content office routine for both employees and bosses.</li>
</ul>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The article discusses the performance of AMD GPUs, specifically the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, for LLM (Large Language Model) inference.</li>
<li>The study shows that the 7900 XTX performs at 80% of the speed of NVIDIA&#39;s GeForce RTX 4090 and 94% of the speed of the RTX 3090 Ti for Llama2-7B/13B models.</li>
<li>The use of machine learning compilation (MLC) and the ROCm stack optimizes performance on AMD GPUs, with potential support for Vulkan and WebGPU. The study emphasizes the need for further development and optimization of MLC solutions for AMD GPUs and other platforms.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>The Seattle City Council has approved a new law to safeguard gig workers from sudden deactivation on platforms like Instacart and DoorDash, marking the first such legislation in the United States.</li>
<li>The ordinance implements more stringent guidelines for deactivation and mandates that companies give a 14-day notice prior to termination.</li>
<li>This development is a part of larger initiatives in Seattle aimed at protecting gig workers who are not part of a labor union, including recent laws that increased the minimum wage and granted sick time and benefits to app-based workers. The law is anticipated to be signed by Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell.</li>

            <description
      ><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Downfall Attacks is a security vulnerability found in Intel Core processors from the 6th to 11th generation, allowing unauthorized users to access and steal data from other users sharing the same computer.</li>
<li>The vulnerability has been present for at least nine years and can be exploited to steal sensitive information such as passwords and encryption keys.</li>
<li>Intel is releasing a microcode update to address the issue, but it may result in performance overhead. The vulnerability also affects Intel SGX, and detecting these attacks is challenging. Vendors and designers of other processors should also take precautions to prevent similar vulnerabilities.</li>
