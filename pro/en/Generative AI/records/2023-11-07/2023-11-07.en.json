You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. Nov 7, 2023,08:30am EST Manny Rivelo is the CEO of Forcepoint. GETTY By now, you have likely come across ChatGPT and Bard, two widely-used generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools that have garnered considerable attention across businesses of every size all around the globe. These AI virtual assistants, with their impressive language comprehension and predictive capabilities, can generate fresh content, code or calculations in an instant. The possibilities of GenAI to transform how we work and learn are endless, but so are the associated risks. Risks Associated With GenAI Anyone with a little chutzpah, patience and ingenuity can trick AI chatbots into doing unethical or malicious things, like writing malware, as an engineer at my company did earlier this year. It’s also possible to expose your company’s trade secrets in a chat without appropriate data security monitoring and countermeasures. Because of these and other risks, it's important to handle AI tools with care, just like any new process or application that your company evaluates. Remember the initial concerns surrounding the iPhone, Dropbox or cloud when they first appeared in our offices? The idea of moving one application, let alone the entire technology infrastructure, to the public cloud caused many sleepless nights.

The pandemic and rapid mobility of corporate information have made the cloud an operational necessity, basically a fundamental requirement for doing business. The same pattern is emerging with GenAI. How To Know If Your Company Is Ready For GenAI Banning GenAI would be a mistake because it’s here to stay. AI will become a foundational component of your business. We have seen how AI can drive leaps in productivity. For some, the rapid adoption of innovations like AI will feel natural and seamless. For others, it may be a rough and tumble journey across potholes and steep curves with unexpected obstacles. As a society and industry, we are better off learning how to embrace the technology safely and move AI chatbots quickly from the shadows into daily operations under corporate security control. We need strategies to minimize risks while optimizing benefits. So, how can you determine if your company is ready to embrace GenAI? Here are five signs to consider: 1. Innovation is ingrained in your company’s DNA. Not every business is comfortable being pioneers, but if your company is open to taking calculated risks and learning quickly, you're on the right track. If you're already investing in cloud or digitization, you're even better positioned to integrate GenAI tools into your operations. Many SaaS apps already use some form of advanced automation, AI or machine learning. 2. You have well-defined business objectives for harnessing GenAI. Just like any other technology, investment in AI requires some thoughtful planning. What are your goals for incorporating generative AI workflows? Are you limiting usage to a select group of principal users, such as marketers, engineers or doctors? Consider the cost in terms of people, budget and other resources. Understanding why you’re allowing employee access to AI apps is just as important as controlling the access in the first place. 3. You’re adopting a zero-trust security approach. With employees constantly shifting between devices, networks and clouds, having a data-first strategy for zero-trust security is crucial. This approach prevents sensitive data from being uploaded in chat prompts and ensures designated employees are using approved AI sites and apps. By combining data-loss prevention security with web and cloud app security, you can embrace generative AI without fear. 4. Corporate policies and training are updated for AI. Alongside security, having clearly defined company policies and providing employee training can help govern AI usage. Some security solutions offer in-line coaching to remind employees of the rules or re-direct them to use approved AI applications or websites. Your employees can be your best defense against sensitive data leakage if they receive proper training and guidance. 5. You’re learning from the GenAI community. Some AI users are early adopters while others are fast followers or observe from the sideline. Engaging with the broader AI community, including alliance groups and consortiums, can provide valuable best practices for AI initiatives, establish governance standards and guide responsible interoperability based on open-source or commercial generative AI offerings. By learning from and partnering with other organizations, you tap into a collective knowledge that can help you move forward prudently and efficiently. Conclusion Recognizing the signs that your company is ready for generative AI is a pivotal step toward safely embracing the transformative power of this emerging technology. The potential rewards, from streamlining operations to fostering innovation, are immense and well-documented. However, it's equally important to acknowledge the inherent risks, particularly to your data and intellectual property. As we integrate advanced AI systems into our businesses, we must remain vigilant in safeguarding our data while using chats and prompts responsibly and ethically. The journey of AI adoption is not without its challenges, but with the right preparation and a proactive approach to data security and risk management, companies can harness the power of generative AI to drive growth and success. The future of business is intertwined with this latest evolution of AI. When implemented correctly, it presents a future ripe with opportunity.

    "originBody": "Technology Exclusive: Meta bars political advertisers from using generative AI ads tools By Katie Paul November 7, 20235:45 AM UTCUpdated 9 hours ago NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta (META.O) is barring political campaigns and advertisers in other regulated industries from using its new generative AI advertising products, a company spokesperson said on Monday, denying access to tools that lawmakers have warned could turbo-charge the spread of election misinformation. Meta publicly disclosed the decision in updates posted to its help center on Monday night, following publication of this story. Its advertising standards prohibit ads with content that have been debunked by the company's fact-checking partners but do not have any rules specifically on AI. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"As we continue to test new Generative AI ads creation tools in Ads Manager, advertisers running campaigns that qualify as ads for Housing, Employment or Credit or Social Issues, Elections, or Politics, or related to Health, Pharmaceuticals or Financial Services aren't currently permitted to use these Generative AI features,\" the company said in a note appended to several pages explaining how the tools work. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"We believe this approach will allow us to better understand potential risks and build the right safeguards for the use of Generative AI in ads that relate to potentially sensitive topics in regulated industries,\" it said. The policy update comes a month after Meta - the world's second-biggest platform for digital ads - announced it was starting to expand advertisers' access to AI-powered advertising tools that can instantly create backgrounds, image adjustments and variations of ad copy in response to simple text prompts. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The tools were initially made available only to a small group of advertisers starting in the spring. They are on track to roll out to all advertisers globally by next year, the company said at the time. Meta and other tech companies have raced to launch generative AI ad products and virtual assistants in recent months in response to the frenzy over the debut last year of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, which can provide human-like written responses to questions and other prompts. The companies have released little information so far about the safety guard rails they plan to impose on those systems, making Meta's decision on political ads one of the industry's most significant AI policy choices to come to light to date. Meta AI logo is seen in this illustration taken September 28, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, the biggest digital advertising company, announced the launch of similar image-customizing generative AI ads tools last week. It plans to keep politics out of its products by blocking a list of \"political keywords\" from being used as prompts, a Google spokesperson told Reuters. Google has also planned a mid-November policy update to require that election-related ads must include a disclosure if they contain \"synthetic content that inauthentically depicts real or realistic-looking people or events.\" TikTok and Snapchat owner Snap (SNAP.N) both bar political ads, while X, previously known as Twitter, has not rolled out any generative AI advertising tools. Meta's top policy executive, Nick Clegg, said last month that the use of generative AI in political advertising was \"clearly an area where we need to update our rules.\" He warned ahead of a recent AI safety summit in the UK that governments and tech companies alike should prepare for the technology to be used to interfere in upcoming elections in 2024, calling for special focus on election-related content \"that moves from one platform to the other.\" Earlier, Clegg told Reuters that Meta was blocking its user-facing Meta AI virtual assistant from creating photo-realistic images of public figures. Meta committed this summer to developing a system to \"watermark\" content generated by AI. Meta narrowly bans misleading AI-generated video in all content, including organic non-paid posts, with an exception for parody or satire. The company's independent Oversight Board said last month it would examine the wisdom of that approach, taking up a case involving a doctored video of U.S. President Joe Biden that Meta said it had left up because it was not AI-generated.

Partners Purdue University provides funding as a member of The Conversation US. View all partners Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Print The dawn of artificial intelligence systems that can be used by almost anyone, like ChatGPT, has revolutionized business and alarmed policymakers and the public. Advanced technologies can feel like unstoppable forces shaping society. But a key insight from scholars of philosophy and of the history of technology is that people can, in fact, exert a lot of control over how and where we use these tools. To us, as political scientists, this new technology offers some interesting opportunities to improve democratic processes, such as through increasing civic knowledge and facilitating communication with elected representatives — if key challenges are met. And we’ve begun to research how this might happen. Increasing civic knowledge Politics can feel impossibly complicated, with emotion-laden negative marketing campaigns and political winds that seem to change almost daily. Many cities, states and countries provide little to no information to the public about policy issues, political candidates or policy referendums. So even when citizens have the ability to exercise their democratic freedoms, they may not feel well enough informed to do so. Generative AI could help. Building on platforms like isidewith.com, politicalcompass.org and theadvocates.org, AI could help people answer questions about their core beliefs or policy positions, and then help them determine which political candidates, parties or choices best match their views. Existing websites like Ballotpedia, Vote Smart and Vote411 have made tremendous advances in providing critical information like sample ballots, polling place locations and candidate positions to voters. But these websites can be difficult to navigate. AI technologies may be able to provide enhanced services, and at local, state, regional, national and international levels. These systems may eventually be able to use automation to provide continuously updated information on candidates and policy issues. AI chatbots could also interactively help people think through complex issues, learn new skills and determine their policy stances, while also providing relevant news stories and facts. However, at the moment, generative AI systems aren’t really ready to answer democracy-related questions reliably or without bias. Large language models generate text based on statistical frequencies of words in their training data, with little regard for whether the statements are fact or fiction. For example, AI systems could hallucinate by fabricating nonexistent politicians or by generating inaccurate candidate positions. These systems also appear to generate output with political biases. And the rules protecting the privacy of users and compensating individuals or organizations whose data are used by these systems are not yet clear, either. Before generative AI is ready to enhance democracy, then, there’s a lot to understand and address. Facilitating constituent communication One area for inquiry: Could generative AI help constituents communicate with their elected representatives? Contacting a politician can be intimidating, and many Americans may not even know where to start. Survey research reveals that fewer than half of Americans can name the three branches of government. Knowing the names of their own representatives, much less getting in contact with them, is even less common. For example, in 2018, only 23% of survey respondents in a poll by the Pew Research Center indicated that they had contacted an elected official in the past year, even at a time with significant developments in national politics. To encourage greater outreach to representatives, generative AI could help citizens not only identify their elected officials, but even draft detailed letters or emails to them. We examined this idea in a recent study we conducted as part of our work at the Governance and Responsible AI Lab at Purdue University. We ran a survey of American adults in June 2023 and found that 99% of respondents had at least heard of generative AI systems like ChatGPT, and 68% had tried them out personally. However, 50% also reported that they have never contacted any of their elected political representatives. As part of the survey, we showed some survey respondents an example of a message written by ChatGPT to a state legislator about an education funding bill. Other respondents, the control group, saw the same example email, but with no indication it was written by AI. Survey respondents who heard about this possible use of AI said they were significantly more likely than those in the control group to support the use of AI for communication with politicians, both by individuals and by advocacy groups. Because of their support for using this new technology, we had expected they would be inclined to reach out to politicians more frequently and see AI as making that process easier. But we found that not to be true. Nevertheless, we have identified an opportunity. For example, public-interest groups could use AI to improve mass advocacy campaigns by helping citizens more easily personalize emails to politicians. If they can ensure the AI-generated messages are factual and valid reflections of citizens’ views, many more people who might not historically have contacted their politicians might consider doing so. There are risks, though, including that politicians might be skeptical of communications they think are written by AI. In-person constituent events, like this one in 2021 with U.S. Rep. Katie Porter of California, help elected officials and the people they serve connect. Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Maintaining authenticity and the human touch One of the most significant drawbacks to using generative AI for political communication is that it might make the receivers of messages suspicious that they are not actually in conversation with a real human. To test this possibility, we included a warning for some of the people taking our surveys that the use of mass AI-generated messages could lead politicians to doubt whether the messages were authentically created by humans. We found that these people, compared to those in the control group, felt that legislators would indeed be less likely to pay attention to emails, and that emails would be less effective at shaping policymakers’ opinions or decisions. Strikingly, however, these people still supported the use of generative AI in political communication. One possible explanation for this finding is something called the “trust paradox” of AI: Sometimes, even when people find AI untrustworthy, they still support its use. They may do so out of a belief that future versions of the technology will be better, or because they lack effective alternatives. So far, our early research into the implications of generative AI for political communication suggests a few key lessons. First, even with ostensibly easy-to-use AI tools, politics is still out of reach for many of those who have historically lacked opportunities to share their thoughts with politicians. We even found that survey respondents with higher baseline trust in government or who had had prior contact with government were less likely to support AI use in this context, perhaps to preserve their heightened existing influence in government. Therefore, greater availability of AI tools might not mean more equal access to politicians, unless these tools are carefully designed. Second, given the importance of human contact and authenticity, a critical challenge is making use of AI’s opportunities while also preserving the human touch in politics. While generative AI could enhance aspects of politics, we shouldn’t be too quick to automate away the relationships that underpin our social fabric.

    "originBody": "News Releases•4 min read IBM and VMware Help Enterprises Adopt Generative AI with watsonx On-Premises November 7, 2023 Share \"IBM and VMware Help Enterprises Adopt Generative AI with watsonx On-Premises\" on Twitter Share \"IBM and VMware Help Enterprises Adopt Generative AI with watsonx On-Premises\" on Facebook Share \"IBM and VMware Help Enterprises Adopt Generative AI with watsonx On-Premises\" on LinkedIn By Chris Wolf, Vice President, VMware AI Labs & Tarun Chopra, Vice President, Product Management, Data & AI, IBM IBM and VMware are working together to bring IBM watsonx to on premises environments on VMware Private AI and Red Hat OpenShift, to help enable fast, transparent generative AI capabilities. In 2023, we’ve seen AI adoption become mainstream as enterprises seek to drive transformative innovations. Generative AI, in particular, has captured the imagination of organizations as a means to generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Generative AI use cases and tasks are far-ranging – from code generation to contact centers resolution experience, IT operations automation, information retrieval and content creation. At the heart of all AI use cases is data—more importantly, access to and processing of the required data to net the best results from AI models. Enterprises need to be able to bring compute capacity and AI models to where enterprise data is created, processed, and consumed—in support of AI use cases—including both traditional AI/ML workloads and generative AI. Enterprises also need access to a full technology stack that allows for traditional enterprise-grade requirements, such as the use of confidential computing and the ability to train, tune, and deploy AI models all in one place that can run across cloud environments. This is the promise of Private AI, an architectural approach that aims to balance the business gains from AI with the privacy and compliance needs of the organization. It focuses on the platform and infrastructure architecture built in support of AI, which can be deployed in public clouds, virtual private clouds, data centers, and edge sites. VMware Private AI with IBM Bring Flexibility to Generative AI IBM and VMware provide enterprise customers the flexibility to enable generative AI use cases where your mission-critical operations reside. That’s why IBM and VMware are pairing VMware Cloud Foundation, Red Hat OpenShift and the IBM watsonx AI and data platform. This combination will enable enterprises to access IBM watsonx in private, on-premises Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environments as well as hybrid cloud with watsonx SaaS offerings on IBM Cloud. Mutual clients will be able to utilize IBM watsonx AI capabilities, data management, and in the near future, its governance capabilities across public clouds, virtual private clouds, data centers, and edge sites, helping to enable transparent and explainable AI models. VMware Private AI is available across hybrid multi-cloud deployment. By using Red Hat OpenShift, clients can now bring watsonx on prem for VMware deployed workloads. Mutual clients will be able to access the full spectrum of the watsonx platform, which offers products to help clients accelerate and scale AI. Clients can optionally use IBM Cloud Satellite to automate and simplify deployment and day two operations of their VMware Private AI with OpenShift environments. Partnership Committed to Delivering the Value of Multi-cloud This collaboration was born out of the IBM and VMware Joint Innovation Lab, a co-innovation engine with a dedicated team of engineers who have a mission to build upon the strengths of both companies and solve client problems by bringing new offerings to market. The lab, announced in 2018, has since completed numerous hybrid cloud and AI-focused projects to date. VMware and IBM plan to develop a validated reference architecture to allow for mutual clients to leverage hybrid cloud and on-prem environments subject to regulation for the training and fine-tuning of ML models – including Large Language Models (LLMs) for generative AI use cases. For example, moving data from a bank or financial institution in one country to a hyperscaler could be prohibited due to regulatory restrictions or the data is too large, and attempting to transfer it from one location to another would be impossible. IBM Consulting Provides Clients with Expertise in VMware specific solutions and Generative AI Earlier this year, IBM Consulting established a Center of Excellence for generative AI and now has more than 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise who are engaging with a global set of clients to drive productivity in IT operations and core business processes like HR or marketing, to elevate their customer experiences and create new business models. This, combined with IBM Consulting's extensive VMware-specific expertise and service capabilities will help accelerate our clients’ business transformations with enterprise-grade AI on the VMware Private AI reference architecture. Additionally, for clients looking to modernize and transform their workloads, IBM Consulting plans to integrate IBM watsonx and VMware Private AI services into its proprietary IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerator to help accelerate the cloud transformation process. Once released, this integration will help with reverse engineering, code generation and code conversion while helping to manage the day two operations and beyond for seamless Hybrid Cloud management services from IBM Consulting. Enabling Clients’ Generative AI Future The strategic partnership between IBM and VMware aims to enable mutual clients to embrace hybrid cloud through flexible consumption models and modernize their mission-critical workloads. Clients can also benefit from having IBM Consulting as a strategic partner on this journey. By having the choice of when, where, and how to integrate generative AI technologies with VMware Cloud Foundation, enterprises will be empowered to quickly train and deploy custom AI capabilities across their enterprise while retaining control over their data. They also gain a powerful guide to leveraging the best innovations from VMware’s software offerings in a unified stack to deliver a consistent environment integrated with the data and AI capabilities brought by IBM Cloud partner technology.

    "originBody": "Microsoft Game Dev Articles Xbox and Inworld AI partner to empower game creators with the potential of Generative AI Xbox and Inworld AI partner to empower game creators with the potential of Generative AI Partnering with Inworld is an important step in our journey to empower game developers. November 06, 2023 Haiyan Zhang General Manager of Gaming AI, Xbox I remember when Ms. Pac-Man was chased by her ghostly enemies, Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. Though that was not the first AI in games, and it was a simple rule-based form of AI, those ghosts showed the world the endless fun that could be born of a reactive algorithm. Since those early days in the arcade, game creators have incorporated game AI to build living worlds, dynamic stories, and complex characters. Procedurally generated worlds further advanced gaming by introducing endless variability and replayability. Most recently, as game creators have begun experimenting with AI Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT (the AI that powers ChatGPT and Bing Chat), we see a world of opportunities to accelerate game developer creativity, reduce complexity, and enhance player experiences. At Xbox, we believe that with better tools, creators can make even more extraordinary games. Today, we are announcing a multi-year partnership with Inworld AI, an M12-portfolio company, to build AI game dialogue & narrative tools at scale. This partnership will bring together: Inworld’s expertise in working with generative AI models for character development, Microsoft’s cutting-edge cloud-based AI solutions including Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft Research’s technical insights into the future of play, and Team Xbox’s strengths in revolutionizing accessible and responsible creator tools for all developers. Together, we aim to deliver an accessible, responsibly designed multi-platform AI toolset to assist and empower creators in dialogue, story & quest design. The toolset will include: An AI design copilot that assists and empowers game designers to explore more creative ideas, turning prompts into detailed scripts, dialogue trees, quests and more. An AI character runtime engine that can be integrated into the game client, enabling entirely new narratives with dynamically-generated stories, quests, and dialogue for players to experience. As with all creators tools we make at Xbox, our goal is to deliver state-of-the-art AI tools for game developers of any size, anywhere in the world and on every platform where players want to play. We want to help make it easier for developers to realize their visions, try new things, push the boundaries of gaming today and experiment to improve gameplay, player connection and more. We will collaborate and innovate with game creators inside Xbox studios as well as third-party studios as we develop the tools that meet their needs and inspire new possibilities for future games. Our approach to AI is based on three principles: meaningful innovation, empowering people and organizations, and responsibility. We are committed to creating responsible AI by design, building on Microsoft’s AI principles and Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard. And we continue our ongoing commitment to bring intentional, inclusive practices and thinking to everything we do at Xbox. Partnering with Inworld is an important step in our journey to empower game developers. We look forward to sharing more as we empower game creation with AI. Related Pages",
