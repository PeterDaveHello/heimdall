In what has been a groundbreaking innovation in the 21st century, blockchain has changed the way we store and transfer information. However, the complexity and use of blockchain technology still burdens existing participants and persons who wish to interact with the blockchain ecosystem. In this article, we examine the fundamentals of a blockchain, how it works and the different layers that enable it to function. What is a Blockchain? Basically, blockchain is a distributed ledger that stores transaction records. It is a transparent and efficient tool for record-keeping where information can be verified and confirmed by anyone, at any point in time. This means anyone can access and view the transactions on a blockchain provided it's a public blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. In addition, the blockchain is a decentralized, secure and immutable structure with no central authority, no single point of failure or origin to hack and no ability to make changes to transactions. It is decentralized and secure because a selected or random group of people (who fulfill the criteria for verifying and confirming transactions) validate transactions on the blockchain network. More so, blockchains operate through a network of computers working together to validate and record transactions in a series of blocks that form a chain. While blockchain technology has been popularised by the rise in cryptocurrency use, it is important to understand the layers responsible for its functionality and performance. Layers in a Blockchain There are five layers that enable the blockchain to operate successfully. First and foremost is the underlying infrastructure layer - layer zero, which is responsible for protocols and standards that govern the blockchain network. The network layer - layer one, involves the physical network of computers and nodes that communicate with each other to form the blockchain network. In addition, the second layer - the consensus layer ensures all nodes in the network agree on the validity of each transaction. More so, the data layer describes the third layer, which stores all transaction data in a secure and immutable manner. The fourth layer is the application layer which includes the smart contracts, decentralized application (dApps), and other software that run on top of the blockchain network. Finally, the fifth layer - the user layer - includes the end-users who interact with the blockchain network through wallets, browsers, and other applications. Understanding the blockchain layers fundamentally allows participants to understand the working mechanism of different blockchain networks. Explaining Blockchain Layers Layer 0 By default, layer zero is the blockchain. The real components that make-up the blockchain are the internet, hardware, and several other connections. Layer zero blockchain is the first stage of blockchain that ensures various networks to function, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and many more. It also provides blockchain networks with a facility for cross-chain interoperability communication from top to different layers. It is the underlying infrastructure for blockchain. Layer 1 Layer 1 blockchain is a development from layer 0. In this layer, the blockchain network functions on a basic level. Scaling is limited here, and any changes or issues in a new protocol on layer 0 will affect layer 1. Examples of layer one blockchains are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Solana, Fantom, and many more. Layer 2 Layer 2 tends to changes in layer zero. In specific blockchains, layer 2 is the scaling solution. It integrates with a third network to remove the limitation of layer 1. It is the most well-known approach to solve scaling issues of Proof Of Work (PoW) networks. Layer 3 This is the application layer. Primarily, layer 3 host the decentralized applications (DAapps) and many other protocols that enable other apps. In layer 3, the blockchain protocol is divided into two sub-layers - the application and execution layers. It is the most valuable solution developed to separate blockchains with cross-chain capabilities to achieve real interoperable operations. Conclusion Blockchain technology is potentially the needed tool to revolutionize industries and transform the way we conduct transactions. Understanding its layers provides businesses and investors the necessary information to leverage this technology’s benefits. By focusing on and improving the blockchain architecture, we can create a more secure, transparent, and efficient digital network. Did you find this helpful?
