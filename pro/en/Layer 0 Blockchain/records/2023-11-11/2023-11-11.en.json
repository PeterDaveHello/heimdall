    "originBody": "Crypto Jedi · Follow 4 min read · 2 hours ago -- aptos token drop 2023 🚨 Speculations are swirling about the possibility of a second Aptos Blockchain token drop happening in the near future!If you thought you missed your chance, here’s some exciting news: another opportunity is on the horizon. Aptos Blockchain has just launched a new NFT minting event. In their previous event, they generously distributed $APT tokens with a $3,000 airdrop for participating in the Free NFT Mint. Stay tuned for updates on the upcoming Aptos airdrop and minting event! Could history be poised to repeat itself? 🤔 Almost a year has elapsed since Aptos Blockchain conducted their initial digital asset drop encompassing nodes and NFTs. Within the project’s tokenomics, 49% of the tokens are allocated for dispersal to the community, and a portion of these tokens is anticipated to be made available in the imminent future.In a remarkable turn of events, the most extensive wallet, thought to be in the possession of the project team, astonishingly received a substantial $120 million in $APT a mere five days ago. aptos digital asset drop 2023 WHAT IS Aptos Blockchain Aptos Blockchain is strategically positioned as a primary layer distributed ledger technology, purposefully designed for continuous development, and it belongs to the exclusive category of blockchains built using the Move programming language. Backed by substantial support, including a total investment of $350 million from prominent investors like Circle Ventures, Binance Labs, a16z, and others, Aptos Blockchain is well-equipped to make substantial strides in the blockchain industry. aptos airdrop 2023 A pivotal aspect of Aptos’ digital assetomics is the allocation of 51% of the total token supply to the community. However, in October 2022, the initial airdrop distributed only 3% of this allotted allocation. As a result, a substantial 48% is still reserved for potential future airdrops.

    "originBody": "Near Foundation and Eigen Labs partner to enhance Ethereum rollups By Bralon Hill November 10, 2023 at 6:42 pm Edited by Brian Stone News Collect the article Share Link copied The Near Foundation and Eigen Labs are joining forces to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of transactions on Ethereum rollups. The Near Foundation and Eigen Labs have announced a partnership that stands to significantly enhance the functionality and efficiency of Ethereum rollups. The Near Foundation, known for developing the Near protocol, and Eigen Labs, the creators of the restaking protocol Eigen Layer, are joining forces to address some of the current challenges in the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem. The core objective of this collaboration is to reduce the cost and increase the speed of transactions on Ethereum rollups. According to official statements, the partnership is set to achieve transaction times of three-to-four seconds, a notable improvement from current standards. Additionally, this initiative aims to facilitate low-latency communication across rollups, thereby reducing the fragmentation of liquidity between different Layer 2 solutions. You might also like: NEAR and Polygon partner to innovate on zero-knowledge proofs A key aspect of this partnership is the focus on enhancing the Near-Ethereum Rainbow Bridge, a trustless, permissionless and decentralized bridge that allows users to transfer assets and data between Ethereum and NEAR, by transitioning it to an actively validated service. This upgrade promises faster transaction finality, bolstered security, and improved decentralization, thereby creating a more seamless bridging experience between the Near and Ethereum blockchains. From the perspective of Eigen Labs, this collaboration is an opportunity to demonstrate the utility of restaking in cross-rollup transactions, highlighting its adoption not just within the Ethereum ecosystem but potentially extending beyond it. The partnership also aligns with Near’s ongoing objective to make the open web more accessible and efficient. Eigen Layer allows for the restaking of ETH and adjustments within the consensus layer without necessitating a new blockchain.

    "originBody": "Celestia Price Prediction 2023-2030: Will TIA reach $10? Charu Taneja November 11, 2023 Latest Celestia Crypto Price Since its listing in October, Celestia is up 70.8% Celestia Offers Distinct advantages over current Layer 1 and Layer 2 Blockchains but with the market cluttered with so many players, breaking out will be a challenge. Aptos for example with Pedigreed Founders is down 11.2% since its Launch in Late 2022. Read in Detail about Celestia and the latest forecasts.

Here is the aggregate value Celestia Price Prediction 2023 is $5.65 Celestia Price Prediction 2024 is $6.83 Celestia Price Prediction 2025 is $8.99 Celestia Price Prediction 2026 is $11.1 Celestia Price Prediction 2027 is $11.1 Celestia Price Prediction 2028 is $13.1 Celestia Price Prediction 2029 is $17.7 Celestia Price Prediction 2030 is $24.4 Can Celestia Tia reach $10 in 2023? Yes, Tia can reach $10 in 2023. Firstly, let me say this is quite a speculative forecast. We are 2 days into the launch and we have very little performance data. So why should anyone put forth such a forecast? At $10, Celestia would have a market cap of $1.2B. Aptos is at $1.7B today. Pepe’s peak market cap was $1.4B and Pepe’s utility is almost none [Though it has a social purpose] $10 is just 4x the current price, a multiple achieved by multiple cryptocurrencies in 1-2 months The Macro Environment is currently favorable with Trading volumes surging and Altcoins beginning to recover. No amount of DYOR will give you the confidence that this price is achievable this year. There isn’t enough data at the moment. Celestia Price Prediction 2023-2030: What is Celestia? Celestia is a modular blockchain system that focuses on data availability. It allows scalability, flexibility, and interoperability, making it easier for developers to create blockchain applications for a wider audience. Celestia focuses on scaling blockchain by decoupling execution from data availability and ensuring the latter through techniques like erasure coding and Data Availability Sampling (DAS). It uses Reed-Solomon codes for data resilience and Namespaced Merkle Trees (NMTs) for specific data retrieval by rollups. This approach results in lower rollup data fees, particularly compared to Ethereum-based solutions. Blobstream technology in Celestia allows Ethereum-based rollups to leverage it for data availability, significantly reducing gas fees. It comprises two main components: the orchestrator and the relayer, which manage attestations for data availability. Blobstream X further reduces costs by introducing a ZK-Tendermint light client for simplified verification. Building on Celestia is fast. Developers can deploy their own blockchains quickly and use any virtual machine. The platform also offers dynamic throughput, allowing for growth in user numbers. Modular blockchains in Celestia work in a collaborative manner rather than competing like monolithic layer 1 blockchains. Layer 0, or social consensus, is deemed the most important layer. Celestia was deployed to Mainnet Beta, marking the start of a modular data availability network. This is aimed at promoting verifiability, blockchain collaboration, and abundant blockspace for developers, thus starting a new era termed the modular era Looking ahead, Celestia has outlined milestones such as introducing 1GB blocks for better data availability, enabling 1 billion light nodes for security, and facilitating 1 million rollups to ease blockchain deployment. These efforts emphasize community participation in realizing these goals The Celestia ecosystem offers a wide array of apps and services built to support various functionalities. These range from gaming and DeFi to cross-chain interoperability and infrastructure.

It serves multiple functions: it is used to pay for data storage in Celestia’s blobspace, as a gas token for rollups, and to stake in the network for consensus and security. Users can manage their TIA tokens through various non-custodial wallets, including Keplr Wallet, Cosmostation, Leap, and Ledger. Celestia has launched its mainnet beta and distributed its native TIA token to 580,000 users. The Celestia airdrop is estimated to distribute $120 million in value, targeting users in the Cosmos and Ethereum layer 2 ecosystems Celestia(TIA) Allocations Public Allocation 20% 200,000,000 TIA R&D & Ecosystem 26.8% 268,000,000 TIA Early Backers: Series A&B 19.7% 197,000,000 TIA Early Backers: Seed 15.9% 159,000,000 TIA Initial Core Contributors 17.6% 176,000,000 TIA Celestia TIA can be purchased on Binance, Binance Turkey, Bitget, BitMart, OKX, Paribu, Coingate and numerous other exchanges. Review of Celestia Launch by Josh Lee of Osmosis Labs Josh Lee provided a comprehensive review of the Celestia launch, emphasizing both its strong and weak points. Among the successes was the smooth mainnet launch, which indicated thorough testing and preparation by the Celestia team. The airdrop distribution was another strong point; it was carefully planned to reach a diverse and strategic set of stakeholders. The node endpoint infrastructure managed to scale impressively during the launch, handling traffic that was over 10 times the usual volume. Additionally, Skip Protocol’s swap API integrated seamlessly with Celestia and Osmosis, proving its efficacy. However, there were also several areas that did not perform as well. One of the main issues was Keplr’s multichain user interface, specifically the ‘manage chain visibility’ feature, which users found confusing. Error messaging in Keplr was also identified as an area requiring improvement, as it did not provide adequate guidance for users to understand or fix issues. Another significant issue was the fee and mempool logic in the Cosmos ecosystem. Transactions were not effectively prioritized, leading to bottlenecks and delays, particularly during high traffic times. Lee highlighted that these issues are not specific to Celestia but are systemic within the Cosmos ecosystem.
