    "originBody": "HOME » OPINIONS » ZERO-KNOWLEDGE (ZK) 101: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ZK PROOFS Zero-Knowledge (ZK) 101: Everything You Need to Know About ZK Proofs Author: George Georgiev Last Updated Nov 15, 2023 @ 12:55 A closer look at Zero Knowledge and everything you need to know about the exciting and cutthroat concept that’s been making waves in the crypto industry. By Jay White, Co-Founder and Head of Research of Space and Time ZK is the crypto buzzword of the year—and for good reason—but if you’re not a cryptographer or a developer, you may be wondering: what exactly is a zero-knowledge proof (ZK-proof)? The core principle behind ZK-proofs is simple yet profound: they allow one party (the prover) to efficiently prove to another party (the verifier) that it possesses certain knowledge without needing to reveal the specifics of that knowledge. The concept originated from the groundbreaking work of a few academic researchers in the mid-1980s and has since blossomed into a practical mechanism for verifiable computation and laid the foundation for the modern Web3 ecosystem, where ZK-proofs are becoming increasingly integral. The Evolution of ZK in Blockchain While ZK-proofs existed in theoretical cryptography long before the rise of blockchain, it is the decentralized nature of the latter that has propelled ZK-proofs into the public eye. Blockchain, in its essence, is a public ledger. Every transaction, no matter how trivial, is recorded and can be viewed by anyone. But while transparency is one of the blockchain’s greatest strengths, it’s also its Achilles heel when it comes to user privacy. That’s where ZK began to show its power. ZK-proofs address the dichotomy between transparency and privacy in the blockchain space. They allow for transactions to be validated without revealing transaction details, thereby preserving user confidentiality while maintaining the immutable nature of the blockchain. By the mid-2010s, projects like Zcash started to build ZK protocols offering private transactions, leading to a surge in interest and adoption of ZK in Web3. But over the last decade or so, the Web3 use case for ZK-proofs has evolved from simple privacy preservation to arguably one of the most important advancements for blockchain technology: verifiable off-chain computing. Solving the Scalability Problem Before we can highlight the importance of verifiable off-chain computing, we have to talk about the extreme limitations of smart contracts. Smart contracts are inherently limited in three key ways: Types of data they can access: Smart contracts can only access the most basic on-chain data points (like wallet balances) and can’t natively access most on-chain data—even as simple as token prices—or any off-chain data. Storage capacity of the blockchain: Blockchains aren’t built to store vast amounts of data. It’s prohibitively expensive and resource-intensive to do so. The logic they can execute: A smart contract can only execute very basic conditional logic without needing exorbitant gas fees. Without a way to solve each of these problems, the blockchain can’t scale to meet the increasing needs of a growing Web3 ecosystem. Luckily, as Web3 has evolved, so too has ZK. While projects like Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network (DON) and cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP) have elegantly solved the first problem, several ZK protocols are working to solve the other two. The most elegant way to solve the limited storage and computing of the blockchain is by moving some of the data and computational work off-chain. The idea that you can perform actions off-chain and use a ZK-proof to succinctly and trustlessly communicate a summary of those actions to the main chain without transferring all the underlying data has ushered in a new paradigm for blockchain technology. Let’s take a look at some of the protocols that are building in this space. Solving for Storage: ZK-Proven Decentralized Storage A well-known solution to the blockchain storage problem is off-chain decentralized storage networks. Instead of storing large amounts of data, the blockchain only has to store smaller references to that data as it’s stored in the off-chain platform. However, simply moving data off-chain isn’t sufficient; in order to ensure that the off-chain data remains available and untampered (to be connected back to a smart contract), you need a ZK-proof. Filecoin’s PoST is a great example of this implementation: it provides periodic cryptographic proofs of continued data storage, fostering trust in the network while still alleviating the data load from the main blockchain. Solving for Compute: Transaction Rollups Perhaps the poster child of ZK, ZK-rollups have emerged as the preferred solution to the growing demand for faster and cheaper transactions on L1s like Ethereum. Instead of processing every transaction individually on the main chain, which can lead to congestion and higher gas fees, ZK-rollups take the computational heavy-lifting off the chain, aggregating multiple transactions into a single “rollup”. For every large batch of transactions processed off the main chain, only a single, compact proof is submitted back to it, providing cryptographic evidence that these transactions were correct. The main chain remains secure without being directly involved in the verification of every individual transaction. ZK-rollups not only enhance transaction processing speed but also conserve the main chain’s resources, significantly boosting throughput and reducing transaction fees. Some of the most prominent ZK-rollups include Polygon’s zkEVM, Matter Labs’ zkSync, and Starkware’s STARKEx. For an in-depth look at zk-rollups, please have a look at our podcast with Starkware’s Gal Ron: The Next Generation of ZK But while solutions like ZK-proofs over decentralized storage and ZK-rollups have certainly laid the groundwork for expanding the limitations of the blockchain, there’s still a critical missing piece. On one hand, decentralized storage solutions are just that: storage. While storage in and of itself is an important tool, these platforms’ inability to perform any sort of “compute” beyond simple data retrieval severely limits the use cases they’re able to support. And ZK-rollups, though powerful processing solutions that cover a wide range of computing functions, still don’t fill the gap entirely. Powering Applications at Scale So, let’s go back to the idea of scaling the blockchain—what does that mean, and what does it look like? If you compare the blockchain stack to the traditional application stack, you’ll notice some obvious differences. In traditional SaaS, apps (at the most basic level) are powered by three steps: Retrieving a query result: Asking a question about data and getting back an answer. Executing an action: Performing a task based on the answer. Updating a state: Telling the system that it’s performed the task. Let’s look at a couple of examples: Example 1: Social media platform The app queries content associated with a user’s connections and gets a ranking of what’s most relevant. The app displays the content in the user’s feed, and the user views the content. The app updates the backend state by recording content viewership/engagement (which then adjusts the algorithm). Example 2: Travel booking website The app queries available flights and gets the most relevant ones. The app promotes the relevant flight options to the customer, and the customer selects and purchases a flight. The app updates the availability and records customer booking details. In Web3, the blockchain serves as a state management layer, and smart contracts execute actions as arbitrary code, but one key component is still missing: queries. Smart contracts have no way to ask questions about data. Even something as simple as “which wallets have ever owned 2 NFTs from this collection on my chain?” cannot be natively answered by a smart contract. If we are going to realize the vision of Web3 and scale the blockchain to meet the demands of enterprise applications, we have to give smart contracts a way to trustlessly ask questions about data on their own chain, on other chains, and off-chain. Proof of SQL and the Verifiable Compute Layer Database computing — essentially, the ability to ask questions about data—has historically been relegated to centralized, trusted solutions, like PostgreSQL (for simple queries) or Snowflake (for analytics). Decentralized databases exist, but they don’t operate with nearly the same scale or throughput as their centralized counterparts. And while ZK has evolved to support verifiable off-chain computing, the solutions that have emerged are limited and fragmented, with no ZK project tackling the most important missing piece of the Web3 stack: queries. That’s why the team at Space and Time built Proof of SQL: a ZK-proof that juxtaposes the scale of a data warehouse (an enterprise-scale database) with the verifiability of a blockchain. Proof of SQL proves that queries run in a database are computed correctly on the right data and that both the query and the underlying data haven’t been tampered with. This allows smart contracts to access off-chain database computing in a verifiable way, fills the query gap in Web3, and enables developers to build trustless data-driven NFTs, protocols, and financial instruments on-chain. Proof of SQL enables Space and Time’s own decentralized data warehouse to serve as Web3’s Verifiable Compute Layer, but it can also be connected to any SQL database, centralized or decentralized, to provide verifiable query results to smart contracts. In Conclusion As we stand on the precipice of a decentralized future, the significance of ZK-proofs in reshaping Web3 cannot be overstated. The advent of solutions like Proof of SQL highlights the transformative power of ZK, expanding its utility far beyond mere transactional privacy. The continued evolution and adoption of ZK technology will be instrumental in creating a decentralized future that marries both scale and trustlessness, ushering in new paradigms of security, efficiency, and transparency.

This move was made following in the footsteps of its American rival, Coinbase Global Inc which launched Base earlier this year. OKX L2 to Utilize OKB as its Native Token Markedly, OKX’s strategic partnership with Polygon is geared towards the testnet launch of the network which is dubbed “X1.” The OKX L2, designed as a highly performant and secure Ethereum-based ZK network will utilize the exchange’s native token OKB as its custom currency. The indigenous coin will be used for gas fees on the network. advertisement According to a statement from the crypto exchange, the OKX L2 will be built with the Polygon Chain Development Kit (CDK). Furthermore, the new protocol will be the company’s new native network, providing users and developers with access to some of the world’s biggest blockchain ecosystems. “The utilization of Polygon CDK technology represents a significant leap forward, enabling developers to design and deploy ZK L2 solutions on Ethereum with ease. Looking ahead, Polygon CDK-deployed chains can interoperate and coexist within a larger network of ZK-powered L2s in the Polygon CDK ecosystem,” Sandeep Nailwal, Polygon’s co-founder said. Also, it was announced that the network was designed with developers as the core focus. The OKX L2 X1 will make it possible and easy for anyone to build and launch their DApps on its on-chain ecosystem, especially as it is compatible with Ethereum. Moreso, its user-friendly interfaces will go a long way in enticing several builders across Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as well as other businesses OKX to Enhance the Future of Web3 Join The DogeStar Presale Now !!!

Yes, Tia can reach $10 in 2023. Firstly, let me say this is quite a speculative forecast. At $10, Celestia would have a market cap of $1.2B. Aptos is at $1.96B today. Pepe’s peak market cap was $1.4B and Pepe’s utility is almost none [Though it has a social purpose] $10 is just 1.5x the current price, a multiple achieved by multiple cryptocurrencies in 1-2 months The Macro Environment is currently favorable with Trading volumes surging and Altcoins beginning to recover. There are clear risks though. The category is quite saturated. As a consequence, the ecosystem has expanded by just 11 in 5 months and the active accounts are trending lower. So while liquidity and sentiment could help Celestia easily breach $10, the fundamentals do not. As things stand today, liquidity will win but it could change if the Macro wins. Celestia Price Prediction 2023-2030: What is Celestia? Celestia is a modular blockchain system that focuses on data availability. It allows scalability, flexibility, and interoperability, making it easier for developers to create blockchain applications for a wider audience. Celestia focuses on scaling blockchain by decoupling execution from data availability and ensuring the latter through techniques like erasure coding and Data Availability Sampling (DAS). It uses Reed-Solomon codes for data resilience and Namespaced Merkle Trees (NMTs) for specific data retrieval by rollups. This approach results in lower rollup data fees, particularly compared to Ethereum-based solutions. Blobstream technology in Celestia allows Ethereum-based rollups to leverage it for data availability, significantly reducing gas fees. It comprises two main components: the orchestrator and the relayer, which manage attestations for data availability. Blobstream X further reduces costs by introducing a ZK-Tendermint light client for simplified verification. Building on Celestia is fast. Developers can deploy their own blockchains quickly and use any virtual machine. The platform also offers dynamic throughput, allowing for growth in user numbers. Modular blockchains in Celestia work in a collaborative manner rather than competing like monolithic layer 1 blockchains. Layer 0, or social consensus, is deemed the most important layer. Celestia was deployed to Mainnet Beta, marking the start of a modular data availability network. This is aimed at promoting verifiability, blockchain collaboration, and abundant blockspace for developers, thus starting a new era termed the modular era Looking ahead, Celestia has outlined milestones such as introducing 1GB blocks for better data availability, enabling 1 billion light nodes for security, and facilitating 1 million rollups to ease blockchain deployment. These efforts emphasize community participation in realizing these goals The Celestia ecosystem offers a wide array of apps and services built to support various functionalities. These range from gaming and DeFi to cross-chain interoperability and infrastructure.

It uses Manta’s Universal Circuits for ZK-as-a-Service, enabling developers to integrate ZK features into dApps. An important aspect of its development is the integration with Celestia’s Data Availability, aimed at reducing gas fees and improving scalability. This integration is a key step in Manta Pacific’s roadmap, positioning it as a platform for web3 applications, supported by institutional investment and backing. Celestia Price Prediction 2023-2030: Tia Token TIA is the native token of the Celestia blockchain. It serves multiple functions: it is used to pay for data storage in Celestia’s blobspace, as a gas token for rollups, and to stake in the network for consensus and security. Users can manage their TIA tokens through various non-custodial wallets, including Keplr Wallet, Cosmostation, Leap, and Ledger. Celestia has launched its mainnet beta and distributed its native TIA token to 580,000 users. The Celestia airdrop is estimated to distribute $120 million in value, targeting users in the Cosmos and Ethereum layer 2 ecosystems Celestia(TIA) Allocations Public Allocation 20% 200,000,000 TIA R&D & Ecosystem 26.8% 268,000,000 TIA Early Backers: Series A&B 19.7% 197,000,000 TIA Early Backers: Seed 15.9% 159,000,000 TIA Initial Core Contributors 17.6% 176,000,000 TIA Celestia TIA can be purchased on Binance, Binance Turkey, Bitget, BitMart, OKX, Paribu, Coingate and numerous other exchanges. Review of Celestia Launch by Josh Lee of Osmosis Labs Josh Lee provided a comprehensive review of the Celestia launch, emphasizing both its strong and weak points. Among the successes was the smooth mainnet launch, which indicated thorough testing and preparation by the Celestia team. The airdrop distribution was another strong point; it was carefully planned to reach a diverse and strategic set of stakeholders. The node endpoint infrastructure managed to scale impressively during the launch, handling traffic that was over 10 times the usual volume. Additionally, Skip Protocol’s swap API integrated seamlessly with Celestia and Osmosis, proving its efficacy. However, there were also several areas that did not perform as well. One of the main issues was Keplr’s multichain user interface, specifically the ‘manage chain visibility’ feature, which users found confusing. Error messaging in Keplr was also identified as an area requiring improvement, as it did not provide adequate guidance for users to understand or fix issues. Another significant issue was the fee and mempool logic in the Cosmos ecosystem. Transactions were not effectively prioritized, leading to bottlenecks and delays, particularly during high traffic times. Lee highlighted that these issues are not specific to Celestia but are systemic within the Cosmos ecosystem.
