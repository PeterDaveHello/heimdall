    "originBody": "PR Newswire zkLink Announces Launch of First Multi-ZK-Rollup Layer-3 Codenamed \"Nexus\" Read full article PR Newswire Thu, November 16, 2023 at 8:00 AM CST·3 min read zkLink's highly customizable Layer-3, Nexus, is a trading-focused blockchain infrastructure that unifies liquidity across the Ethereum L2 ecosystem SINGAPORE, Nov. 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- zkLink, developers of zero-knowledge (\"zk\") powered blockchain solutions, today announced the launch of Nexus, a production-ready and highly customizable Layer-3 (\"L3\") designed to bridge the gap among different zk-Rollup Layer-2 (\"L2\") ecosystems to reduce liquidity fragmentation. zkLink (Nexus) is a Layer-3 platform, meaning that it is a third layer of blockchain tech built on top of Ethereum Layer-2 Rollups, like zkSync, StarkNet and Polygon zkEVM, to facilitate greater scale, lower gas costs, and more app-specific customizability. This platform will be invaluable to developers of dApps, such as decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and more, that require a highly customizable trading layer on Ethereum designed to bridge the gap among different L2 ecosystems while reducing liquidity fragmentation and offering cross-rollup security via zk-Proofs. Co-founder of zkLink, Vince Yang, commented on the news, \"We're excited to introduce the fundamental infrastructure needed to create a unified trading layer for the Layer-2 protocols that exist in the Ethereum ecosystem. Now dApps that require deployment on multiple Layer-2 protocols can use our Layer-3 solution, Nexus, to easily integrate their product into the Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystem.\" As a multi-zk-Rollup trading layer, Nexus is focused on aggregating liquidity across zero knowledge rollups. Additionally, some of the features that make zkLink Nexus unique include: Security inherited from Ethereum, via zk-SNARKs: a zk-Rollup architecture based on zk-SNARKs that allows the platform to connect to multiple general purpose zk-Rollup L2s and strictly inherits the security of Ethereum using zk-Proofs. Adaptive Liquidity Rebalancing: for the dynamic rebalancing of assets across multiple networks Developer Friendly Interface: provides developers with a unified SDK for easy integration to multi-network liquidity without having to navigate the complexities of different L2s. Cross L3 Composability: allows for token transfer from one zkLink Rollup instance to another. Efficient Proof Systems Without Trusted Setup: development of several innovative new proof systems, makes the platform a faster, more cost-effective solution that operates without a trusted setup. Customizable Data Availability: which enables various options for data storage and availability Multi-Application Recursive Proof Verification (MARPV): a gas-efficient proof verification technology Trading-Specific Domain-Specific Language (TS-DSL): a trading-focused programming language. Story continues Now, if a developer wants to deploy a DeFi dApp across multiple rollups, like StarkNet, Polygon zkEVM, and zkSync, while inheriting all the benefits listed above, they can simply plug into Nexus' APIs as opposed to building on each rollup separately. Once integrated, users would be able to deposit on Starknet for example and withdraw from another rollup like zkSync while still benefiting from the security of Ethereum and zkLink's ZK-Rollup service. You can learn more about zkLink's Nexus platform in our comprehensive intro blog, here The Nexus platform will be unveiled publicly at the first Layer-3 summit which will be held at Nippon Hotel on November 16th during Devconnect in Istanbul, Turkey.

    "title": "LooksRare Introduces Zero Fees for NFT Sales, Competing Against OpenSea",
    "originLink": "https://cryptotvplus.com/2023/11/looksrare-introduces-zero-fees-for-nft-sales/",
    "originBody": "News LooksRare introduces zero fees for NFT sales Published 20 hours ago on November 16, 2023 By Chuks Nnabuenyi Jr LooksRare is implementing a zero-fee policy for all NFT sales, ensuring that sellers receive the full value of their listed items without any deductions. This bold move comes as a direct challenge to industry giant OpenSea, which has faced criticism for its fee structure. LooksRare is a decentralized NFT marketplace that operates on the Ethereum network. It is a community-first platform that rewards all its creators, collectors, and traders with its native utility token, LOOKS. The platform emphasizes giving back to the NFT community and has adopted a modular framework for its smart contract, which facilitates the addition of new features in the future. LooksRare used to charge a 2% sales fee on NFT sales. It offers several attractive features such as trading rewards, staking rewards, trait offers, and more. Users buying or selling NFTs on the platform receive rewards in LOOKS. The LOOKS token is central to the LooksRare ecosystem and can be staked to receive shares of daily trading fees, received in LOOKS and wrapped ether (wETH). LooksRare stated that its users can now enjoy a fee-free experience, a stark contrast to some other platforms that continue to charge fees on transactions. The company is taking a dig at OpenSea. OpenSea has been known for its fee structure associated with NFT transactions. Unlike some platforms that have introduced zero-fee initiatives, OpenSea typically charges fees on transactions that occur on its marketplace. Users on OpenSea are accustomed to facing fees when buying, selling, or transferring NFTs. These fees can include gas fees, which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain, as well as platform fees implemented by OpenSea itself. Gas fees are variable and depend on network congestion and transaction complexity, while OpenSea’s platform fees are a percentage of the transaction value. Criticism has been directed at OpenSea and similar platforms for the impact of these fees on users’ overall experience. Some users have expressed concerns about the transparency of fee structures and the potential impact on the profitability of NFT transactions. As part of this promotional initiative, LooksRare said it’s not only eliminating transaction fees but also waiving all protocol fees on both the LooksRare V2 marketplace and LooksRare’s Seaport implementation. It was added that the promotional period is set to run for the next 30 days, concluding on December 16th, 2023, at 13:00 (UTC). Sellers on LooksRare can leverage this fee-free period to participate in the NFT market without the usual transaction-related costs.

Get a comprehensive recap of the day’s top stories delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up here! (Kitco News) – Layer-one (L1) tokens have consistently been among the top performers during the cryptocurrency bull market because they serve as the foundational blockchain for the entire ecosystem, making it possible for all other sectors to Becomes – from gaming and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi) – possible. So it is no surprise that some of the top L1 protocols are on the rise as the current bull market cycle begins to intensify, and according to analysts, past cycles show that these tokens may reach their peak before then. Still a long way to go. Protocols currently attracting investor attention include Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVX), and a new arrival on the scene, Kaspa (KAS), each of which offers different benefits to users. Institutions showed interest in Solana Solana has been one of the top performing coins in 2023, climbing from below $10 at the beginning of the year to its current price of $62.12, an increase of nearly 550%. Read also: What is layer 0, layer 1, layer 2, layer 3? SOL/USD Chart by Tradingview SOL hit a new yearly high on Wednesday after ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood described the network as a major infrastructure player in the broader blockchain ecosystem and praised its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. “At the time, Ether was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin — that’s how we got Ether,” Wood said during an interview on CNBC. “Solana is faster and cost-effective than Ether.” In a note shared with Kitco Crypto, Guy Gottschalk, co-founder and president of My Digital Money, said the recent surge has sent Solana up 170% in the past month, “easily more than seven times better than Ethereum.” Performing.” “This is the exact opposite of what investors were expecting, as in September 2023, a Delaware bankruptcy court authorized the sale of assets from collapsed exchange FTX, which included a substantial SOL of $55.75 million,” he said. Gottschalk said the recent surge in SOL’s value “may be linked to the realization that some tokens are either vested or locked up from the bankruptcy sale.” He added that “the FTX liquidation plan imposes a $100 million weekly limit on sales, reducing initial fears about asset liquidations and increasing optimism among investors about the limited impact of the sales.” “SOL’s impressive gains are driving its futures open interest to a significant level of $745 million, not seen since November 2021,” he said. “While the derivatives market may appear to be the primary driver of SOL’s rally, there is compelling evidence of growth in the use of deposits and decentralized applications (dApps) within the Solana ecosystem. In the last month alone, deposits into Solana’s dApps have increased by 10%. Gottschalk said he thinks the price of SOL will climb above $100 next year and in the long term he believes “Solana is going to be Ethereum’s closest competitor.” “In 10 years, $2,000 is very feasible,” he said. Mercario Chief Business Officer Arthur Firstov also sees the increase in user adoption of Solana as the driving force behind the rally. “Many people still think Solana is rising because of FTX, but this is not the case,” he said. “Users who try out the on-chain, DEX, NFTs, wallets, performance, costs, and markets will see how advanced and user-friendly this protocol is. Overall, dApp usage increased, compressed NFTs, and to 1 million NFTs Reducing on-chain costs to 5 SOL increased usage and demand for Solana across the board. Firstow also highlighted that “Solana now has a larger institutional embrace as demonstrated by Grayscale’s increase in Solana trust.” Data provided by Coinglass shows that the Grayscale Solana Trust now has a 342% premium on the trading price, which is a notable sign as it implies that institutions are using SOL’s existing assets to gain access to an institutionally available product. Willing to pay well above market value. “All of these developments are based on a positive performance-first environment with good builders and entrepreneurs,” Firstow said. “Solana may see increased enterprise adoption through Firedancer, the blockchain’s path to 1 million TPS (transactions per second), a high-performance protocol compared to Visanet’s 65,000 and MasterCard’s 5,000.” He concluded, “Overall, I am bullish on SOL for the long term, as we expect it to retest its all-time high of $260 at least in the next bullish phase.” Announcing major adoption for Avalanche The source of Avalanche’s newfound speed can be attributed to the network being used in JPMorgan and Apollo Global’s proof-of-concept pilot project, which is part of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian. During the pilot, Layer Zero connected JPMorgan’s Onyx digital assets with a permissioned Avalanche Evergreen subnet that facilitated subscription and redemptions for funds offered by WisdomTree, a leading asset manager and leader in fund tokenization. . “This initiative under Project Guardian is fundamentally aligned with Ava Labs’ mission to digitize and tokenize the world’s assets using the speed, scalability, and customizability of Avalanche,” said John Woo, President of Ava Labs. Provides tools and technology for “We are proud to work with such industry leaders as they help drive the future of finance.” The announcement of Avalanche’s partnership with Project Orchid resulted in the AVAX price surging 41% over the past two days to a high of $24.11. On October 19, AVAX hit a low of $8.68, meaning that in the past month, it has increased by more than 177%. AVAX/USD chart by Tradingview According According to market analyst Altcoin Sherpa, “If the price can hold above this current level then $29 is the next target,” and many analysts believe that AVAX will reach its all-time high of $146.22 at some point during this bullish market cycle. Is reaching. Caspa benefits from Binance listing Caspa is a new proof-of-work blockchain with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) architecture that it says is “the fastest open-source, decentralized and fully scalable layer-1 in the world.” According to the project’s website, the Caspa Network is “the world’s first BlockDAG – a digital ledger that enables parallel blocks and instant transaction confirmation – built on a robust proof-of-work engine with a fast single-second block interval.” has been made.” There has been hype surrounding the project since the beginning of the year as the KAS token was gradually listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. On January 1, KAS traded at a price of $0.0052, and since then it has risen 2,554% to a new all-time high of $0.148 on Thursday. KAS/USD chart by TradingView The main source of recent momentum was the listing of the KAS token on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume. Binance listings have a history of triggering significant price rallies as it is often the first time that many investors get the chance to access the token, and the large group of Binance investors new and fresh tend to get a serious case of FOMO.
