    "originBody": "Technology Kraken Said to Seek Partner to Help Build It a Layer 2 Blockchain Network The crypto exchange is still considering which blockchain developer should build its network, with Polygon, Matter Labs and the Nil Foundation in the mix, according to people familiar with the situation. Rival crypto exchange Coinbase blazed the trail with Base. By Margaux Nijkerk Nov 7, 2023 at 1:16 a.m. UTC Updated Nov 7, 2023 at 2:10 a.m. UTC Kraken Chairman Jesse Powell (CoinDesk) 10 Years of Decentralizing the Future May 29-31, 2024 - Austin, Texas The biggest and most established global hub for everything crypto, blockchain and Web3. Register Now Kraken, the big U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is considering several of the leading blockchain-technology firms to help launch its own layer 2 network, people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk. Such a move would bring Kraken in line with the move earlier this year by rival Coinbase to launch its own layer-2 network. Kraken is considering Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation among others about using their technology as the basis for the new network, according to the sources, who asked not to be named because the effort was not publicly disclosed and the conversations are still fluid. There may also be other teams in the discussions. “We’re always looking to identify and solve for new industry challenges and opportunities,\" a Kraken spokesperson told CoinDesk. \"We don’t have anything further to share at this time.” Major crypto companies with established brands and customer followings have been seeking to grow their presence as blockchain builders, either as a potential source of new revenue or simply as an extension of their current operations. In August, crypto exchange Coinbase released its own layer 2 network, Base, which makes use of the OP Stack, from the OP Labs team that built Optimism, the second-biggest layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain. Polygon, a leading developer of Ethereum scaling solutions with its Polygon PoS network and more recently the Polygon zkEVM, earlier this year came out with a new software toolkit that developers can use to spin up their own blockchains. Matter Labs, the developer behind the zkSync layer-2 network, also offers its technology to upstart builders. Kraken recently added a job posting on the careers section of its website, advertising for a \"Senior Cryptography Engineer\" with \"knowledge of modern cryptography (including ZK proofs)\" whose opportunities could include \"design and implementation of layer-2 solutions.\" \"We are enthusiastic about open source, layer-2 technologies, zero-knowledge proofs, multi-party computation, and continuously strive to explore the potential of on-chain scaling solutions,\" the job description reads. \"The team has recently embarked on exploring how more protocols and decentralized applications can be integrated into Kraken.\" With reporting by Elizabeth Napolitano.

Nym’s mixnet tools secure blockchain traffic, safeguarding transaction data and preventing IP address exposure. NuggetRush (NUGX) is a community-driven play-to-earn (P2E) game on Ethereum, promoting social responsibility by supporting real-world miners in underdeveloped regions. Players can build mining facilities, stake minerals and NFTs, and earn attractive APY. Quant (QNT) advanced in the financial sector with its blockchain solution “Overledger Authorise,” posing a challenge to Ripple. However, despite positive developments, QNT’s price remains stable between $90 and $150. NEAR (NEAR) Protocol and Nym partnered to boost privacy and security within the blockchain sphere. On the other hand, NuggetRush (NUGX) introduced a community-driven play-to-earn game with a real-world impact, setting a new standard for decentralized gaming. Yet, Quant (QNT), a pioneer in distributed ledger technology, ventured into the financial sector with a specialized solution that takes on Ripple. Can NuggetRush (NUGX) keep thriving to dethrone NEAR Protocol and Quant? Let’s explore here. >>Buy NuggetRush Now>Buy NuggetRush Now<< Quant (QNT) Challenges Ripple with New Blockchain Solution for Banks, Price Stable Quant (QNT), a leader in developing distributed ledger technology for companies, has been increasing its presence in the financial industry using partnerships with big banks. In a notable development, Quant (QNT) introduced a specialized blockchain solution for the financial industry on October 10, 2023, positioning the platform as a strong rival to Ripple. This Quant (QNT) technology, named “Overledger Authorise,” tackles an important issue that banks grapple with – ensuring the security of blockchain-based transactions. Nonetheless, Quant’s (QNT) price remained in a range between $90 and $150 for the past six months despite all these positive developments. This price stability appeared to divide Quant’s (QNT) community, with some investors optimistic about the token’s future and others remaining cautious. On November 3, 2023, Quant (QNT) was trading at $97.70. While some analysts expect Quant (QNT) to surge to $230 by the end of 2023, it is advisable to approach such forecasts carefully. A plunge below $90 by Quant (QNT) could result in further declines toward the $50 support zone. With all these uncertainties, QNT is not the best crypto to invest in now.

    "originBody": "Solana trading volume surges amidst market rally By Mohammad Shahidullah November 6, 2023 at 9:53 pm Edited by Brian Stone Markets Collect the article Share Link copied Solana (SOL) becomes the most traded altcoin in US exchanges this year. Solana (SOL) is witnessing a dramatic climb in trading volume, outshining other altcoins on exchanges accessible in the United States over the current year. Leading exchange, Coinbase strategically increased its holdings by acquiring 2.2 million SOL tokens on Oct. 18. Since then, SOL is up by over 35%. In contrast, South Korea’s prominent exchange, Upbit, sold nearly 4 million SOL tokens. SOL’s monthly price chart What’s driving Solana (SOL)? A surge in network activity, particularly within liquid staking token protocols such as Jito, has contributed partially to Solana’s price acceleration, according to the data from Kaiko Research. As a prominent alternative Layer 1 (alt L1) blockchain, Solana is frequently juxtaposed with Ethereum (ETH), and the recent months have seen Solana outshine its counterpart. The comparative ratio of SOL to ETH has escalated from 0.011 in September to approximately 0.025, surpassing pre-FTX crisis levels. You might also like: Solana up 38% in a week, but it could soon crash Coinbase has spearheaded the net buying spree, with market purchases of Solana tokens since the rally’s inception. While Binance initially trailed, it soon ramped up market buying, reaching a cumulative volume delta (CVD) of 1.9 million since that date. In the broader context, SOL has outperformed other popular altcoins such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Polygon (MATIC) and Ripple (XRP) in trading volumes across exchanges available in the U.S., securing its position as this year’s favored alternative digital asset among U.S. traders.
