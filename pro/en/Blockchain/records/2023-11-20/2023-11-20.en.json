    "originBody": "Markets OpenAI CEO Drama Makes a Market for Blockchain Betters Over $250,000 in liquidity was built up in prediction market contracts on Polymarket over the weekend, from the serious to the absurd. By Sam Reynolds Nov 20, 2023 at 7:44 a.m. UTC Updated Nov 20, 2023 at 7:47 a.m. UTC Sam Altman at Village Global's The Grove in 2022 (Village Global/Flickr) 10 Years of Decentralizing the Future May 29-31, 2024 - Austin, Texas The biggest and most established global hub for everything crypto, blockchain and Web3. Register Now Nobody knows why Sam Altman was forced out of OpenAI. But betters on decentralized prediction platform Polymarket are putting their money where their mouth is when they take a guess. Over the weekend, Altman, the Chief Executive of the multi-billion artificial intelligence startup behind ChatGPT, was forced out of his role because he \"was not consistently candid in his communications\" with the board. While the memo was not specific about why Altman was forced to depart from the company, this was no reason for gamblers on Polymarket not to spin up prediction market contracts to bet on why he left – or what he plans on doing next. Currently, the market with the most liquidity is one that asks betters to predict if Altman will be back as CEO by the end of the year. While \"Yes\" shares are trading for 10 cents – representing a 10% chance – this outcome flipped over the course of Sunday U.S. time when Bloomberg reported that former Twitch boss Emmet Shear had been appointed to the role. (PolyMarket) Another contract asks if Altman would be criminally charged by Nov. 30, with Yes currently trading at 1 cent. A report from Axios, citing a leaked memo, says that Altman's firing \"was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices.\" Contracts are also asking betters if, for example, Altman will announce a new company by Nov. 24 (Yes is currently trading at 24 cents), if Altman will sue OpenAI, or if Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, will still be at the company by Jan. 1. More than $250,000 in liquidity was spread across eight prediction contracts on Sunday. Some reports say that Sutskever was instrumental in removing Altman from the company. Meanwhile, AI-themed tokens rallied over the weekend as Musk announced X was a shareholder of XAI, and OpenAI's Macbethian corporate drama intrigued traders. Edited by Omkar Godbole.

What is Solana and How Does it Work? Solana vs. Avalanche: A Comparison Decentralization in Avalanche and Solana Is Avalanche Better Than Ethereum? Smart Contract Design: Avalanche vs Solana Staking Rewards in Avalanche and Solana Transaction Speed Comparison: AVAX vs SOL The Future Potential of SOL vs AVAX FAQs What is Avalanche and How Does it Work? Avalanche’s Consensus Protocol: Snowflake, Snowball, and Avalanche Avalanche is a blockchain platform that aims to achieve high scalability, low latency, and decentralization through its unique consensus protocol. This protocol consists of three phases: Snowflake, Snowball, and Avalanche. In the first phase, Snowflake, a small set of validators is selected to propose new blocks. These validators are chosen based on their reputation within the network. Once a block is proposed, it undergoes a voting process where other validators can approve or reject it. If the proposed block receives enough approvals in the Snowflake phase, it moves on to the next phase called Snowball. In this phase, more validators participate in voting for the validity of the block. The votes are weighted based on the reputation of each validator. The final phase of the consensus protocol is Avalanche. During this phase, all validators in the network participate in voting for the validity of the block. This process continues until consensus is reached among a significant majority of validators. Unique Approach to Achieving High Scalability, Low Latency, and Decentralization with blockchains and blockchain projects. This approach is especially beneficial for cryptocurrencies and can be implemented on the avalanche platform. One of Avalanche’s key strengths lies in its ability to achieve high scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. Unlike some other blockchain platforms that rely on sharding or layer-2 solutions for scalability, Avalanche takes a different approach. Avalanche achieves scalability by utilizing subnets within its ecosystem. These subnets allow for parallel processing of transactions and smart contracts while maintaining overall network integrity. By dividing workloads across multiple subnets, Avalanche can handle a higher number of transactions per second compared to traditional blockchain networks. Furthermore, Avalanche boasts low latency due to its consensus protocol design. The multi-phase voting process enables fast confirmation times for transactions while still ensuring security and preventing double-spending attacks. Use Cases for Avalanche in blockchain projects include financial applications, decentralized exchanges, and gaming platforms in the crypto market. Avalanche’s high scalability and low latency make it well-suited for various use cases within the blockchain ecosystem. Some notable applications include: Financial Applications: Avalanche can support a wide range of financial applications such as payment systems, remittances, and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Its fast transaction confirmation times and high throughput make it an attractive option for users who require efficient and reliable financial services. Decentralized Exchanges: Avalanche provides an ideal environment for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to operate. With its ability to handle a large number of transactions per second, DEXs built on Avalanche can offer seamless trading experiences with minimal delays or network congestion. What is Solana and How Does it Work? Solana is a high-performance blockchain that stands out for its fast transaction processing capabilities. Its architecture is based on a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH), which ensures the accuracy and order of transactions. Solana’s primary focus is scalability, achieved through parallel processing and sharding techniques. PoH Consensus Mechanism Solana’s innovative architecture relies on the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism. This mechanism introduces a decentralized clock that timestamps each transaction, allowing nodes to reach consensus quickly. By using historical records to validate the order of events, Solana achieves high throughput and low latency. The PoH mechanism provides several advantages for Solana: Fast Confirmation Times: With PoH, transactions can be confirmed in milliseconds, enabling rapid transaction processing. Consensus Efficiency: The decentralized clock allows nodes to agree on the order of events without extensive communication or computation. Security: By leveraging historical data, PoH enhances security by preventing malicious actors from manipulating the transaction history. High-Performance Blockchain Solana differentiates itself as a high-performance blockchain capable of handling thousands of transactions per second. This scalability is achieved through various technical features: Parallel Processing: Solana employs parallel processing techniques where multiple transactions are processed simultaneously across different nodes. This approach significantly improves throughput and reduces congestion within the network. Sharding: Another technique employed by Solana is sharding, which involves dividing the network into smaller partitions called shards. Each shard processes a subset of transactions independently, further enhancing scalability. Tower BFT Consensus: Solana combines Proof-of-History with a practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm known as Tower BFT. This combination ensures both speed and security in transaction validation. Globally Distributed Nodes: To enhance performance and decentralization, Solana operates a network of globally distributed nodes. This distribution reduces latency and improves fault tolerance. Applications of Solana Solana’s high-performance capabilities make it well-suited for various applications in the blockchain ecosystem. Some notable use cases include: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Solana provides an ideal platform for decentralized finance applications such as lending, borrowing, and yield farming. Its fast transaction processing enables quick execution of financial transactions and interactions with smart contracts. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): NFTs have gained significant popularity in recent years, and Solana offers a robust infrastructure for creating, trading, and managing these unique digital assets. Solana vs. Avalanche: A Comparison Scalability Comparison: Avalanche’s Subnets vs. Solana’s Sharding Approach Both Avalanche and Solana have implemented unique approaches to handle high transaction volumes. Avalanche utilizes a concept called subnets, which are smaller networks within the larger Avalanche network. These subnets allow for parallel processing of transactions, resulting in faster throughput and increased scalability. On the other hand, Solana takes a different approach with its sharding mechanism. Sharding involves dividing the network into smaller partitions called shards, each capable of processing transactions independently. This distributed architecture enables Solana to achieve high scalability by allowing multiple shards to process transactions simultaneously. While both approaches aim to enhance scalability, they differ in their implementation. Subnets in Avalanche operate as separate chains connected through a shared consensus protocol. In contrast, Solana’s sharding approach ensures that all shards share the same underlying protocol and state. Consensus Mechanisms: Snowflake/Snowball/Avalanche vs Proof-of-History (PoH) Consensus mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of blockchain networks. Avalanche employs a family of consensus protocols known as Snowflake, Snowball, and Avalanche (S-Avalanche). These protocols utilize a combination of random sampling and voting mechanisms to reach consensus on transaction validity. On the other hand, Solana introduces an innovative consensus mechanism called Proof-of-History (PoH). PoH leverages a cryptographic clock that timestamps events within the network. This timestamping allows nodes to order transactions efficiently without relying solely on traditional consensus algorithms. The use of PoH in Solana provides several advantages such as improved transaction finality and reduced confirmation times. It also enhances overall network performance by enabling fast block propagation across validators. Transaction Fees Analysis: AVAX vs SOL Tokens Transaction fees are an essential consideration for users when choosing a blockchain network. In Avalanche, transaction fees are paid using the native AVAX token. The fees vary based on network congestion and the complexity of the transaction being processed. However, Avalanche’s fee structure is designed to be competitive and cost-effective for users. Solana, on the other hand, employs a similar fee model where transaction fees are paid using SOL tokens. These fees also depend on factors such as network demand and computational resources required for processing transactions. Solana aims to keep its transaction fees low to ensure accessibility for users while maintaining an efficient network. Both Avalanche and Solana strive to provide affordable transaction fees, making them attractive options for individuals and businesses looking to utilize blockchain technology. Decentralization in Avalanche and Solana Governance Models Both Avalanche and Solana have implemented governance models to ensure decentralization within their respective networks. These models allow token holders to participate in decision-making processes, giving them a say in the direction of the blockchain projects. In Avalanche, the governance model is based on the Avalanche Improvement Proposal (AIP) process. This process enables community members to propose changes or improvements to the network. Through voting, token holders can express their support or opposition to these proposals, with voting power proportional to their holdings. This ensures that decisions are made collectively and not controlled by a single entity. Solana, on the other hand, employs a similar governance model through its on-chain governance platform called “SOLAR.” Token holders can submit proposals for network upgrades or changes, which are then voted upon by validators and delegators. The voting power is determined by the number of tokens held and staked. This system encourages active participation from community members and promotes decentralization. Validators’ Role in Network Security Validators play a crucial role in securing both the Avalanche and Solana networks. They validate transactions, create new blocks, and maintain the integrity of the blockchain. In Avalanche, validators are responsible for achieving consensus through a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) mechanism called “Snowball.” They stake AVAX tokens as collateral and are selected through a random selection process known as “stake-based randomness.” Validators earn rewards for their participation in securing the network while also facing penalties for any malicious behavior. Similarly, Solana utilizes a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism combined with proof-of-stake (PoS). Validators stake SOL tokens as collateral and take turns producing blocks based on their stake weightage. The more tokens staked, the higher chances they have of being selected as block producers. Validators are incentivized with rewards for maintaining network security and participating actively. Token Distribution Analysis Analyzing the token distribution across Avalanche and Solana provides insights into the level of decentralization within their ecosystems. In Avalanche, the AVAX token had a fair launch, with no pre-mine or initial coin offering (ICO). This means that tokens were distributed through various mechanisms such as liquidity mining and community incentives. The absence of a significant concentration of tokens in the hands of a few entities contributes to a more decentralized network. Solana’s token distribution is also designed to promote decentralization. The SOL token was initially distributed through an initial exchange offering (IEO) on several cryptocurrency exchanges. A portion of tokens was allocated for ecosystem development, community grants, and partnerships. This diverse distribution helps prevent centralization and fosters a more inclusive network. Is Avalanche Better Than Ethereum? Comparing Transaction Speed, Scalability, and Gas Fees Several key features come into play. One of the most crucial aspects is transaction speed. Avalanche boasts impressive transaction speeds, with the ability to process thousands of transactions per second. On the other hand, Ethereum has been struggling with scalability issues, leading to slower transaction times and higher gas fees. Avalanche’s consensus protocol, known as Avalanche Consensus Protocol (ACP), allows for near-instant finality of transactions. This means that once a transaction is confirmed on the network, it is considered finalized without the need for additional confirmations. In contrast, Ethereum currently relies on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism which can cause delays in confirming transactions. In terms of scalability, Avalanche has implemented a unique approach called Subnets. Subnets allow for the creation of separate chains within the Avalanche network that can handle specific types of transactions or applications. This enables better scalability by distributing the workload across multiple chains instead of relying on a single chain like Ethereum. Gas fees have been a major concern for users on the Ethereum network. As more users join and demand increases, gas fees tend to skyrocket. However, Avalanche aims to address this issue by introducing low transaction fees through its efficient consensus protocol and scalable architecture. Smart Contract Capabilities Analysis Smart contracts are an integral part of blockchain platforms as they enable decentralized applications (dApps) to run autonomously without any third-party interference. Both Avalanche and Ethereum support smart contracts but differ in their underlying technologies. Ethereum uses its own programming language called Solidity and operates on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM provides developers with a robust environment for building decentralized applications but has limitations. Avalanche takes a different approach by allowing developers to write smart contracts using familiar programming languages such as Solidity, Ethereum‘s native language, and more. Avalanche offers compatibility with the EVM, meaning that existing Ethereum smart contracts can be easily deployed on the Avalanche network. Evaluating Developer Adoption Rates Developer adoption is a crucial factor in determining the success of a blockchain platform. Ethereum has long been considered the go-to platform for developers due to its first-mover advantage and established ecosystem. It has a vast array of tools, libraries, and frameworks that make it easier for developers to build decentralized applications. However, Avalanche has been gaining traction among developers due to its unique features and potential for scalability. The platform provides developers with a seamless experience by offering support for popular development frameworks like Truffle and Remix. Smart Contract Design: Avalanche vs Solana Programming Languages Supported by Avalanche and Solana Avalanche and Solana are both blockchain platforms that support smart contract development.Avalanche primarily supports Solidity, which is the same language used for Ethereum smart contracts. This makes it easier for developers who are already familiar with Solidity to transition to Avalanche. On the other hand, Solana offers a more diverse range of programming languages for smart contract development. In addition to Solidity, Solana also supports Rust and C programming languages. This flexibility allows developers with different coding backgrounds to choose the language they are most comfortable with when building smart contracts on the platform. Smart Contract Execution Environments Smart contract execution environments play a crucial role in determining the performance and scalability of a blockchain platform. Avalanche utilizes its own virtual machine called EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), which is compatible with Ethereum’s execution environment. This means that Avalanche can run existing Ethereum-based smart contracts without any modifications. Solana, on the other hand, has its own unique execution environment specifically designed for high-performance decentralized applications. It uses a custom-built runtime called “Sealevel” that offers fast transaction processing and low latency. The Sealevel runtime provides an efficient environment for executing smart contracts on Solana’s network. Security Features and Vulnerabilities Security is of utmost importance. Both Avalanche and Solana have implemented various security features to protect against potential vulnerabilities. Avalanche leverages a consensus protocol known as Snowman, which combines elements of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT). This consensus mechanism ensures that transactions are validated securely while maintaining decentralization within the network. Solana, on the other hand, utilizes a unique Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism in combination with Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The PoH mechanism provides a verifiable timestamp for every event on the Solana blockchain, enhancing security and preventing certain types of attacks. While both platforms have implemented robust security measures, it’s important to note that no system is entirely immune to vulnerabilities. Developers must remain vigilant and follow best practices when writing smart contracts to minimize the risk of potential exploits or attacks. Use Cases for Smart Contracts on Avalanche and Solana Smart contracts have a wide range of use cases in various industries, including finance, supply chain management, decentralized applications (dApps), and more. Both Avalanche and Solana offer unique features that make them suitable for different types of smart contract applications. Staking Rewards in Avalanche and Solana Overview of Staking Mechanisms Staking is a process where token holders lock up their cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations. In Avalanche, users can stake AVAX tokens through a mechanism known as “Delegated Proof-of-Stake” (DPoS). This system allows token holders to delegate their stake to validators who validate transactions and secure the network. Validators are elected based on their reputation and stake size. On the other hand, Solana utilizes a different consensus mechanism called “Proof-of-History” (PoH) combined with “Proof-of-Stake” (PoS). Token holders can participate in staking by delegating their SOL tokens to validators who maintain the Solana blockchain. Validators are chosen based on their stake size and performance. Comparison of Staking Rewards Staking rewards play a crucial role in attracting token holders to participate in securing the network.Both platforms offer attractive rewards for stakers. Avalanche provides an annualized staking reward rate ranging from 5% to 15%. The actual reward rate depends on various factors such as network activity and participation rate. Higher participation rates generally result in lower reward rates due to increased competition among validators for block validation. Solana offers competitive staking rewards as well. The annualized reward rate for SOL token holders ranges from 4% to 10%, depending on factors like network performance and validator competition. Similar to Avalanche, higher participation rates may lead to decreased reward rates over time. Analysis of Staking Participation Rates The level of staking participation within a network is an essential metric that reflects the confidence and engagement of token holders. In Avalanche, the staking participation rate has been steadily increasing since its launch. As more users recognize the benefits of staking AVAX tokens, they are actively participating in securing the network and earning rewards. Solana also boasts a growing staking participation rate. The platform has seen a significant increase in the number of SOL tokens being staked as more users realize the potential rewards and benefits of supporting the Solana ecosystem. Potential Risks Associated with Staking While staking can be a lucrative venture, it’s crucial to understand the potential risks involved. In both Avalanche and Solana, there are certain risks that stakers should be aware of: Transaction Speed Comparison: AVAX vs SOL In the world of blockchain, transaction speed plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and usability of a network. Let’s explore how these networks measure up. Measuring Transaction Speeds on Avalanche and Solana Networks Transaction speed refers to the time it takes for a blockchain network to process and confirm a transaction. It is typically measured in terms of average block time, which represents the time taken to add a new block to the blockchain. Both Avalanche and Solana are known for their impressive transaction speeds, but let’s take a closer look at how they compare. Avalanche boasts an average block time of around 1-2 seconds, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks in existence. This rapid processing capability allows for near-instantaneous confirmation of transactions, enabling users to carry out their activities swiftly without unnecessary delays. On the other hand, Solana also offers lightning-fast transaction speeds with an average block time ranging from 0.4-1 second. This means that transactions on Solana are processed within milliseconds, ensuring seamless user experiences even during periods of high network activity. Factors Influencing Transaction Speed While both Avalanche and Solana excel in terms of transaction speed, it is important to consider various factors that can influence these speeds. One such factor is network congestion. When there is a surge in transaction volume on a blockchain network, it can lead to congestion and slower processing times. However, both Avalanche and Solana have implemented innovative solutions to mitigate these issues. For example, Avalanche utilizes its unique consensus protocol called Avalanche Consensus Protocol (ACP), which allows for parallel processing of transactions across multiple subnets. This distributed approach helps maintain fast transaction speeds even during peak periods. Similarly, Solana employs a combination of Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms to enhance scalability and throughput. By leveraging PoH, Solana achieves high network performance by providing a historical record of events that allows validators to process transactions quickly and efficiently. Real-World Examples Showcasing Fast Transaction Processing Capabilities To truly understand the impact of fast transaction speeds, let’s explore some real-world examples that highlight the benefits of Avalanche and Solana’s rapid processing capabilities: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): In the DeFi space, where users engage in various financial activities such as lending, borrowing, and trading digital assets, fast transaction speeds are crucial.

Study of over 2,200 UK adults revealed only 13% of respondents understood what blockchain technology is 76% had no trust in social media UK men are 3x times more likely to own digital assets than women (18% vs. 6%) ZUG, Switzerland, Nov. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, BSV Blockchain launched its annual Blockchain Barometer in partnership with renowned research house, YouGov. The national survey reveals the UK's shocking lack of knowledge and understanding of key emerging technologies, including AI, cryptocurrencies, Chat GPT, blockchain, metaverse, Web 3, and IoT. The individual technologies that fared best in the UK have been widely reported in global media recently. AI ranked top, with 53% claiming to understand the technology, compared to 30% who understood cryptocurrencies, 26% the metaverse, 13% blockchain, and only 6% who said they understood Web3. As part of the study, the BSV Blockchain spoke to over 13,000 consumers across the UK, Spain, Germany, France, Sweden, and the US to take a pulse check on perceptions and trust in emerging technologies to understand knowledge gaps and priorities for education. Cyrille Albrecht, Managing Director of BSV Blockchain, commented, \"As stewards of the BSV protocol and as a membership organisation, The BSV Blockchain wanted to get a sense check on the broader sentiment towards new technology globally and, particularly in the UK. The BSV Blockchain commissioned this survey to assess whether the UK has disparities in understanding, knowledge, and trust in emerging tech, including blockchain.\" Brits in last place for trust in emerging tech (AI, Metaverse, ChatGPT…) 54% of UK consumers surveyed do not trust any emerging technologies listed in the survey (AI, Metaverse, Chat GPT, Web3, etc.). Spain and Sweden demonstrated higher confidence levels in the technologies and their use in everyday life. 34% of those surveyed in Spain trust and use AI in everyday life vs. 14% of US respondents and 15% of those based in the UK. Almost 2 in 3 (65%) Spanish 18–24-year-olds demonstrated trust in AI. 29% of German respondents and 37% of Spanish believe they will use blockchain technology in their daily lives within five years if they don't already. However, it isn't the only technology the British public struggles to believe in; 56% deemed the media untrustworthy, and 76% distrust social media. British men are at least 3x times more likely to own digital assets than British women There were notable differences by gender across the survey. Despite a lack of knowledge in the UK, men were three times as likely to have invested in some form of digital assets (18% vs. 6%). Across the board, women frequently expressed less use or belief in the technology than their male counterparts. For example, when asked Which technologies you trust to adopt and use in your day-to-day life (e.g., banking, paying bills, shopping, etc.), whether more cautious or savvier, 55% of UK women versus 52% of British men say they would not trust any technologies. Gen Z are flagbearers for emerging tech While the overall research findings paint a gloomy picture for the future of emerging tech, the results for Gen Z are much more positive. Globally, the 18-24 age group were much more open to learning about the technologies; 26% believed it would be part of their everyday life within five years if they were not using it already. In the UK, Gen Z was most likely to understand the differences between crypto and blockchain, as well as being more trusting in the technologies, especially AI and Web3, this age group was globally most trusting in social media (48%), compared to 76% of UK respondents deeming social media untrustworthy. What's in it for customers? Respondents were united in their response when asked what would make them more likely to gain interest in using blockchain technologies more widely for day-to-day finances. In the UK, there was a better understanding of the benefits, with: 35% said they would be most interested in understanding its benefits 30% wanted to understand the technology better 30% want to gain a better understanding of how the is currently being used Cyrille Albrecht added: \"One of the BSV Blockchain key pillars is to provide the necessary education on blockchain technology to augment widescale adoption, and the research results highlight the need to continue our commitment to fostering learning and training. It is abundantly clear that within the UK, we must double-down our efforts to build trust in the technology through informative education programmes, collaborating with schools and universities, whilst also continuing our engagement with regulators and policy makers.\" Loading...

Methodology This survey has been conducted using an online interview administered to members of the YouGov Plc panel of individuals who have agreed to take part in surveys. Emails are sent to panellists selected at random from the base sample. The email invites them to take part in a survey and provides a generic survey link. Once a panel member clicks on the link they are sent to the survey that they are most required for, according to the sample definition and quotas. (The sample definition could be \"GB adult population\" or a subset such as \"GB adult females''). Invitations to surveys don't expire and respondents can be sent to any available survey. The responding sample is weighted to the profile of the sample definition to provide a representative reporting sample. The profile is normally derived from census data or, if not available from the census, from industry accepted data. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 13047 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between 8th - 19th September 2023. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all surveyed country adults (aged 18+) in the UK, US, France, Spain, Sweden, and Germany. While 57% of those surveyed claim to understand AI, only 38% understood cryptocurrencies and 13% blockchain. 71% have not heard of blockchain at all, 60% don't know how to describe it, and 48% don't know if there is a difference between blockchain and crypto.

The initiative, announced Friday (Nov. 17), “provides a seamless, transparent, and efficient approach to funding by integrating blockchain, smart contracts, and artificial intelligence” (AI) the company said in a news release. The solution promises a “secure and immutable data environment,” lessening the risks connected to the traditional factoring process. “By implementing blockchain technology, MaxxChain aims to eradicate hidden rules and complexities, providing a transparent and trustworthy platform for trucking companies seeking faster payments,” the company said. The platform also integrates smart contracts into factoring. Once MaxxChain receives completed shipping contracts and invoices from trucking companies, the company records this information on the blockchain with bridged Web2 and Web3 technologies. Invoices are then fragmented into equally valued tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) within the smart contract and deposited onto a specialized marketplace within the MaxxChain ecosystem. “Moreover, MaxxChain assumes any remaining tokens or NFTs, providing immediate funding to the trucking company. Simultaneously, a new invoice is automatically generated and forwarded to the broker for payment under the originating terms,” the company said. “MaxxChain collects its share of revenue upon receiving payment from the broker, and the remaining funds are distributed among token or NFT holders based on the initial agreement.” PYMNTS examined the state of B2B payments in the logistics space last week in a conversation with Pat Dillon, CFO of Flock Freight. “There has been so much innovation … we’ve seen a proliferation of so many different payment options around things like speed, terms and visibility,” said Dillon, interviewed for PYMNTS’ “B2B Payments: Outlook 2024” series. The challenge, he added, involves providing a comprehensive dashboard view of these options and customizing payment solutions for individual companies. “It’s certainly a good problem to have,” he said. PYMNTS also spoke with Robin Gregg, CEO of RoadSync, about the challenges that come with transacting across supply chains and logistics. “In many ways,” she said, “B2B payments have fallen behind consumer payments … old-school payment forms are not fast, they’re not efficient, and they also are leaky.” That’s particularly true in trucking and logistics, where interactions and financial management are complicated undertakings, involving a range of distributors, warehouses, carriers and brokers. The gap is due to narrowing in terms of payments innovation, Gregg said. “That’s because business owners, of course, are consumers, too,” PYMNTS wrote. “As they’ve experienced efficient, convenient payments as part of their everyday financial lives, they’ve come to expect the same level of friction-free interactions as part of their professional activities.” Recommended MaxxChain Employs Blockchain for Faster Trucking Payments Card Issuer Petal Seeks Buyer Amid Struggle for Capital Credit Quality Declines as Card Companies Tighten Standards Report: Meta Reassigns Responsible AI Team to New Duties See More In: AI, artificial intelligence, B2B, B2B Payments, Blockchain, commercial payments, freight, logistics, MaxxChain, News, NFT, Non-Fungible Token, PYMNTS News, smart contracts, Trucking, Web3, What's Hot, What's Hot In B2B Trending News Former OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Joins Microsoft's Ranks The Existential Threat That Microsoft Missed — and Could Put Its GenAI Future at Risk Visa and Remitly Expand Collaboration to Digitally Streamline Global Remittance Market The Big Story The Existential Threat That Microsoft Missed — and Could Put Its GenAI Future at Risk Featured News Visa and Remitly Expand Collaboration to Digitally Streamline Global Remittance Market 93% of Middle Market Firms Say Current AP/AR Systems Don’t Cut It Liquidity Management Key to Taming FX Volatility in Emerging Markets Social Media Influencers Behind Lavish Wedding Comeback 4 in 10 Consumers Plan to Tap Into Savings to Cover Holiday Expenses Porch Rally Leads CE 100 Index Higher Again as Q3 Earnings Season Winds Down QSRs Add Voice AI, but Consumers Aren’t Biting Subscribe PYMNTS Today Artificial Intelligence Cryptocurrency B2B Retail TechREG® Digital Transformation SUBSCRIBE Partner with PYMNTS We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

    "originBody": "Saga blockchain raises a further $5 million News By Jon Jordan Last updated Nov 20, 2023 Share New layer 1 blockchain Saga has announced a $5 million seed extension round. It was led by US VC Placeholder, which was founded by crypto OGs Joel Monegro and Chris Burniske. Other participants in the round included Longhash Ventures, Dispersion Capital, Red Beard Ventures, Tykhe Ventures, Com2uS, and AVID3. Saga has now raised $13.5 million. “We expect blockchain architectures in the coming years to be much more reminiscent of cloud architectures, with Saga purpose-built to help usher in that future,” commented Burniske. “On-demand blockspace provisioning, paired with cutting-edge validator orchestration, sets Saga up to provide blockspace as it’s needed in a horizontal, scale-out fashion akin to the cloud environments of today.” The news comes as Saga prepares to move from its current incentivized Pegasus testnet to its mainnet, expected in early 2024. As well as partnerships with other L1s such as Polygon, Avalanche, and Celestia, Saga also has around 300 developers building a variety of products on its infrastructure. It’s particularly focused on games, however. Saga offers an integrated stack of automated, high performance, gasless, interoperable, and customizable chains which it calls chainlets. Developers can scale their applications across multiple chainlets and interoperate freely among them while taking advantage of their fast transaction finality to accessibly bridge to other blockchains. “We’re thrilled to have Placeholder lead this round, as they, along with our other amazing investors, are helping to empower and accelerate our support of projects with the Integrated Stack – what developers have been waiting for to easily create consumer apps for broad adoption,” added Saga CEO Rebecca Liao.

    "title": "Proton Mail Uses Blockchain to Verify Email Addresses",
    "originLink": "https://www.tomsguide.com/news/proton-mail-to-use-blockchain-to-verify-recipients-email-addresses",
    "originBody": "News Software Proton Mail to use blockchain to verify recipient's email addresses By Krishi Chowdhary published 20 November 2023 Proton Mail plans to tap blockchain tech for email encryption key verification Comments (0) (Image credit: Shutterstock) With the launch of its new Key Transparency feature, Proton Mail, one of the best email services and stablemate of one of the best VPN services, has now entered the blockchain arena. The latest feature will allow users to verify a recipient’s email address and ensure that the sender is actually who he claims to be. In an interview with Fortune, Andy Yen, Proton VPN and Proton Mail’s CEO, stated that they are using \"blockchain in its very pure form\" and that it has nothing to do with shady crypto scams. Proton Mail stands apart from other email providers due to its sheer focus on privacy. Each email sent through Proton is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring only the sender and recipient can access the contents. It even allows you to send password-protected emails to recipients who are not on Proton Mail. What is Key Transparency? End-to-end encryption works by encrypting a message using the public key of the recipient, which can be opened only by the recipient using their private key – and this is a staple of the modern internet. If you're using a website on https, you're end-to-end encrypted. However, the key concern lies in verifying the authenticity of the recipient’s public key. It might so happen that the system is tricked into encrypting a message using a fake public key created specifically for a “man-in-the-middle attack.” This is a type of cyber attack when a malicious third party eavesdrops messages between the sender and the recipient. However, the victims never know that they are being listened to and continue believing that they are, in fact, just communicating with each other. This is the exact problem Key Transparency aims to solve. The blockchain is like a permanent ledger—entries once made in a blockchain cannot be altered. So, by putting recipients’ public keys on the blockchain, it's near-impossible for perpetrators to initiate a MitM attack. The system cross-references these entries every time an email is sent, thereby ensuring that the correct private key is used every time. “In order for the verification to be trusted, it needs to be public, and it needs to be unchanging,” Yen said. Feature roll-out Key Transparency has recently been launched in its beta mode on Proton Mail’s private blockchain. If the tests turn out to be feasible, it will soon be introduced to public blockchains for mass usage. Although Yen accepts this is not a feature an average user will need, he has stressed the importance of Key Transparency for sensitive professionals such as journalists, executives, politicians, and activists. Plus, Yen advocates using Proton Mail to escape the constant online surveillance and behavioral analysis. Proton Mail currently caters to around 100 million users, with the numbers rising rapidly amidst growing privacy concerns. Get Black Friday deals in your inbox!
