    "title": "DLA Piper-backed TOKO joins BSN Spartan blockchain foundation",
    "originLink": "https://www.ledgerinsights.com/bsn-spartan-blockchain-foundation/",
    "originBody": "News • Technology Media Telecoms DLA Piper’s TOKO amongst members of BSN Spartan blockchain foundation 3 hours ago by Ledger Insights Last year saw the launch of the Singapore-based BSN Spartan Network, a network of multiple public blockchains that don’t use cryptocurrencies. Today it launched the BSN Spartan Foundation in a move to decentralize the network’s governance away from its founder, Hong Kong’s Red Date Technology. The other foundation members are DLA Piper-backed tokenization firm TOKO, German consultants GFT, web3 hosting firm Blockdaemon and web3 infrastructure firm Zeeve. BSN Spartan plans to have between 25 and 40 foundation members. The BSN Spartan goals are similar to the typical web3 vision, as a decentralized version of the internet. However, it has a greater focus on business usage of the network and sidesteps the speculative crypto aspect. For example, HSBC was amongst the Spartan beta testers. There are similarities with the governance of other public blockchains such as Hedera and Korea’s Klaytn, which both started with enterprises governing the network and controlling the validator nodes. However, that’s no longer the case with Klaytn and Hedera is also evolving. Unlike Spartan, both Hedera and Klaytn have cryptocurrencies. DLA Piper was amongst the first governing council members of Hedera. Meanwhile, Red Date is also the founder of the China-based BSN Network that provides low cost web3 hosting to SMEs. Co-founders were state owned UnionPay, the State Information Center (SIC) and China Mobile. For the Chinese network, cryptocurrency is a non starter because of the government’s stance. BSN Spartan – non crypto public blockchains Talking to Ledger Insights regarding the BSN Spartan Network, Red Date’s Tim Bailey outlined why it rejects crypto on public networks. “Cryptocurrencies are problematic for a lot of traditional businesses because of the regulatory uncertainty and because of the volatility.” He gave the example of a business budgeting process which becomes problematic because ETH or other cryptocurrency prices can change significantly. He added, “If you’re minting an NFT on our network, it costs two cents (US). If you’re minting an NFT on our network in 18 months’ time, it costs two cents.” Instead, users pay gas fees using a Non Tradeable Token based on USD (via Stripe) or the USDC stablecoin. The blockchain technologies supported are Ethereum, Polygon Edge and Cosmos. “We believe in BSN’s commitment, as a decentralized governance organization, in bringing blockchain technologies to the broader IT industry beyond cryptocurrencies,” said Scott Thiel, Managing Director of DLA Piper-backed TOKO. “As a full market licenced Virtual Asset Broker Dealer and Exchange services VASP granted by Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA), we look forward to contributing to the foundation with our wealth of expertise in the governance and regulatory space.” Separately, Red Date is also pioneering the UDPN network for interbank payments. In related news, two U.S. Representatives recently released a bipartisan Bill calling for a ban on U.S. government involvement with Chinese-related blockchains. It listed five networks and organizations, including Red Date, BSN and the BSN Spartan network. In response, the Spartan network pointed to this decentralized governance. The Tether stablecoin was also on the list despite not having Chinese connections. However, the Bill talked about methods of sidestepping sanctions enforcement and an impact assessment on the status of the dollar as a reserve currency.

    "originBody": "LONE STAR POLITICS Blockchain conference brings candidates and senators to Fort Worth The state of Texas is leading the country in Bitcoin mining. Industry groups hope to keep it that way and beat back Federal regulations. By Phil Prazan • Published November 16, 2023 • Updated on November 16, 2023 at 8:47 pm NBC Universal, Inc. Fort Worth hosted the North American Blockchain Summit on Nov. 16. NBC 5 political reporter Phil Prazan reports on high-profile names trying to make the once fringe industry mainstream. More cryptocurrency is created - or \"mined\" - in Texas than in any other state in the country. For the past three years, the North American Blockchain Summit has been held in Texas. This year it's in Fort Worth and the Texas Blockchain Council brought several current and former presidential candidates and United States senators to town. One reason Texas is a leader in mining the digital currency bitcoin is the state treats it like any other heavy industry, according to Texas Blockchain Council President Lee Bratcher. Local politicians embrace the technology as well. Recently the city of Fort Worth began its own mining operation. Blockchain leaders are trying to shed the industry's \"Wild West\" image and advocate for clear regulations and institutional buy-in. Many of them hope a deregulated currency system will grow if the public has greater trust in it. With attention, comes scrutiny. Critics argue mining strains the energy grid. Some also don't like how crypto companies get millions of dollars from the state to limit power usage when ERCOT's system is vulnerable. Bratcher told NBC 5 the new industry, however, is a boom for Texas in jobs and investment dollars - especially in overlooked, rural counties. “These are rural jobs in counties that are losing employment and they’re coming in revitalizing those counties,\" said Bratcher. The blockchain industry is trying to overcome regulatory hurdles in state and federal laws that they feel get in their way. Recently, industry leaders have also been recovering from a nationwide scandal that tarnished the technology's reputation. Local The latest news from around North Texas. FORT WORTH 3 HOURS AGO Fort Worth ISD launches Angel Tree this holiday season DALLAS ISD 3 HOURS AGO Dallas ISD is offering free meals for kids over Thanksgiving break Sam Bankman Fried, founder of the crypto exchange FTX, was seen as an industry titan until he was convicted of a large-scale fraud scheme worth billions of dollars. He faces decades in prison. \"His fraud that he perpetrated on the American people was a disaster and we’re working really hard to make sure that those kinds of bad actors will never see the light of day,\" said Bratcher. Candidates and senators Businessman and Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy used the summit in Fort Worth to lay out his blockchain policy pitch to voters. His pitch includes limiting the power of the Securities Exchange Commission to regulate the new industry like other securities and treating the coding behind blockchain technology more like speech. “We have a shadow government that then says if people want to opt out and hold other forms of currency, like Bitcoin, or cryptocurrencies, there’s increasing regulatory burdens to doing so,\" Ramaswamy told NBC 5 in an interview after his keynote speech. Former 2020 presidential candidate and co-chair of the Forward party, Andrew Yang, hopes one day the technology will allow Americans to vote in elections from their phone. Yang argues eventually the technology may be key to lowering poverty rates. In the meantime, he says the industry will help to grow the Texas economy. “There’s a lot of innovation in the state. There’s a lot of growth. I personally do have friends who’ve moved here to Texas. I know some of you have mixed feelings about that. But it’s a growth engine,\" said Yang, in an interview with NBC 5. Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. joined the event Thursday as well. The event has drawn state and national leaders of many political parties. Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and others are scheduled to speak and hold events.

    "originBody": "The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has revised its guidelines on the listing and delisting of cryptocurrencies. This move aims to bolster investor protection and ensure that virtual currency businesses adhere to heightened regulatory standards. Since 2015, the NYDFS has been a pivotal regulator in the virtual currency sphere, introducing specific regulations like BitLicenses and trust company charters. The department's initial guidance on the adoption or listing of virtual currencies was released in 2020. Replacing its 2020 guidance, the NYDFS’s new directive, effective immediately, introduces more stringent requirements after considering inputs from various stakeholders. The guidelines emphasize heightened consumer protection measures and clearer risk assessment procedures to reduce ambiguities in regulatory processes. Also included are exceptions for advance notifications in specific scenarios of coin delistings and updated definitions for clarity. Entities involved in virtual currency activities are now required to obtain DFS approval for their coin-listing policies, maintain detailed records, and communicate with DFS regarding self-certified coins. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the new regulations is the development of a comprehensive coin-delisting policy. Entities must formulate these policies and submit them for review, complying with the revised guidelines by January 31, 2024, while presenting their draft policies by December 8, 2023. These guidelines are set to influence a range of licensed digital currency businesses in New York. The NYDFS aims to maintain its leadership in regulating the evolving virtual currency market. The NYDFS’s initiative is part of its broader efforts to protect investors in the cryptocurrency market. Entities like Circle, Gemini, Fidelity, Robinhood, and PayPal must comply with these new regulations, reflecting New York's commitment to monitoring the cryptocurrency industry closely.

Dubbed Key Transparency, the system uses a “pure form” of blockchain rather than the cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme form. Proton CEO and founder Andy Yen said that the platform solves the thorny issue of ensuring that every email address belongs to the person claiming it.

    "originBody": "Market NewsNovember 17, 2023 by Kelly Cromley Revolutionizing Email Security: Proton Mail Introduces Blockchain-Powered Key Transparency In a pioneering move towards enhancing email security, Proton Mail, the privacy-focused email service, is delving into the realm of blockchain technology with its latest offering, Key Transparency. Departing from the cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme form, this innovative system leverages a “pure form” of blockchain, providing users with a means to verify email addresses securely. Addressing the Authentication Conundrum Proton Mail’s CEO and founder, Andy Yen, highlighted the significance of Key Transparency in resolving a persistent challenge in the realm of email communication. The crux of the matter lies in ensuring the legitimacy of the claimant for every email address. Through Proton Mail’s existing end-to-end encryption, senders can encrypt an email using the recipient’s public key—a complex sequence of letters and numbers. This encrypted message is then deciphered by the recipient using their private key. However, Yen emphasized the critical issue of verifying that the public key indeed belongs to the intended recipient. Yen elucidated on the potential risks, stating, “Maybe it’s the NSA that has created a fake public key linked to you, and I’m somehow tricked into encrypting data with that public key.” This underscores the vulnerability in the current email infrastructure, where malicious actors could exploit the system by creating deceptive public keys. Blockchain’s Immutable Solution Recognizing the inherent immutability of blockchains—where once data is entered, it remains unalterable—Yen envisioned a solution. Placing users’ public keys on a blockchain would create an indelible record, ensuring the authenticity of these keys. Furthermore, this record would be cross-referenced each time users engage in email communication. “For the verification to be trusted, it needs to be public, and it needs to be unchanging,” remarked Yen, emphasizing the pivotal aspects of transparency and permanence in this groundbreaking application of blockchain technology. Enhancing Trust through Decentralization Key Transparency’s integration of blockchain introduces a decentralized approach to email address verification. By distributing the verification process across a network of nodes, Proton Mail aims to mitigate the risks associated with centralized authentication methods. The immutable nature of blockchain ensures that once a user’s public key is recorded, it cannot be tampered with or manipulated. This adds an extra layer of security to email communication, alleviating concerns related to fraudulent public keys and unauthorized access. User-Centric Security In a user-centric approach, Proton Mail’s Key Transparency places control firmly in the hands of the individuals. Users can be confident that their public keys are securely recorded on the blockchain, preventing any unauthorized alterations. This not only safeguards the integrity of email communication but also empowers users with a heightened sense of control over their digital identities. The Road Ahead: Advancing Email Security Paradigms As Proton Mail ventures into uncharted territory with Key Transparency, it pioneers a new era in email security. The amalgamation of blockchain technology and email authentication marks a significant leap towards fortifying the foundations of digital communication. Conclusion: Proton Mail’s foray into blockchain technology with Key Transparency signifies a paradigm shift in email security. By addressing the authentication challenges inherent in traditional email systems, this innovative solution heralds a more secure and trustworthy future for digital communication. The decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain adds an extra layer of protection, assuring users that their email addresses are verified with transparency and permanence.",
