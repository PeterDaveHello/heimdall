    "originBody": "UPDATED 08:00 EST / NOVEMBER 06 2023 BLOCKCHAIN Truebit extends Web3 application and data integrity beyond the blockchain BY PAUL GILLIN SHARE Truebit Co., the developer of blockchain enhancement technology that enables smart contracts to securely perform complex computations, today announced a new verified computing platform that extends the functions of Web3 enterprise applications beyond traditional blockchains. Web3 technology, which is also called the decentralized web, enables peer-to-peer transactions to be conducted using blockchain technology without the need for centralized servers. It allows self-executing code called smart contracts to run on blockchain infrastructure. Web3 leverages consensus, verification and transparency for security, reliability, risk mitigation, portability, interoperability and cost control. International Data Corp. has estimated that 80% of enterprises will participate in ecosystems relying on decentralized Web3 code within the next five years. Truebit said it’s addressing what it says is 99% of application logic that executes outside the blockchain. For example, a smart contract may kick off a process that executes a financial transaction on a platform outside of the blockchain. That creates an opening for fraudsters to compromise transactions that can’t be verified inside the smart contract. “The question we’re working on is how do you fundamentally make computing transparent and secure?” said Blane Sims, Truebit’s head of product. In the case of the financial transaction, Truebit creates a certified transcript of identity validation services from a third party, verifies it with machine learning algorithms that look for suspicious activities, independently certifies that the intended trades are settled accurately, and certifies the accuracy of data reported to investors and regulators. Embellishing the blockchain “The blockchain is a very solid foundation for writing a ledger and for creating transparency and security around decentralized transactions, but it doesn’t fill in much of the architectural stack for a typical application,” Sims said. “[Application program interfaces] are not natively Web3 constructs. They’re part of the Web2 mainstream. Making an API call in a transparent way that shows proof of how the call was made, the interactions with the service, and proof of the data the service provided is where Truebit comes in.” Truebit said its serverless Verify integration framework lets developers read and write code to any API, deploy applications iteratively and quickly, optimize workflow and improve security, data integrity and process transparency. Applications can interact with multiple data sources and verifiably execute complex code. The product’s architecture provides a fully isolated sandbox for the safe execution of off-ledger tasks with code being immediately across all Truebit Nodes, which automatically verify each task and ensure that the code written is the same as the code executed. Truebit Tasks read and write data from public and private APIs with verified operations for data transformations or calculations. Tasks are always on, accessible from a standard REST interface and able to support an application’s event-driven architecture. The product supports JavaScript, Rust and C++ and is extensible to any language supported by the WebAssembly portal binary code. Programs can copy data and transfer assets between ledgers with rules and validation specifically to the application’s needs. The software runs on multiple decentralized nodes that execute the same functional call multiple times to verify that the result is the same. If results differ, “we enter into something called a verification game, which is where we go down to the machine code level in Web Assembly and step through it to pinpoint which of the nodes is not behaving properly,” Sims said. “It may be trying to alter the result of the function or perhaps has simply been misconfigured. In either case, that node’s results are thrown out.” The product’s architecture provides a fully isolated sandbox for the safe execution of off-ledger tasks with code being immediately across all Truebit Nodes. Tasks can read and write data from public and private APIs with verified operations for data transformations or calculations. Programs can copy data and transfer assets between ledgers with rules and validation specifically tailored to an application’s needs. Multiple, independent Nodes automatically verify each task and ensure that the code written is the same as the code executed. “Think of it as a message broker that’s taking the request for a function call to the nodes, gathering results, verifying the results and creating a transcript,” Sims said. The 20-person company was founded by Jason Teutsch, who designed the original Truebit verification protocol and described it in a 2017 research paper. The project is in beta testing and is expected to go live by the end of the year.

Between those innovations come data, described by experts as the new oil — extracted, amassed, refined, processed and turned into something useful. While most blockchain and AI use cases are still experimental and success can’t yet be measured, a developing app employs users’ personal data to contribute to research on prolonging human life. Speaking with Cointelegraph at the recent Cardano Summit, Jasmine Smith, CEO of Web3-based wellness app Rejuve.AI, said that crowdsourcing data from multiple sources helps accelerate longevity research. She explained that the current core data sets are narrowed to Western populations. She explained: “Being able to democratize that access and fill in the data gaps in places like Africa, Asia, and the Middle East will give us a more holistic picture of human health and longevity and [enable] us to give better recommendations… to assist their care.“ Day ☝of #CardanoSummit2023 is already in session! Come stop by our booth and say hi to part of our team! pic.twitter.com/Vl6qNqfxk5 — Rejuve.AI (@Rejuve_AI) November 3, 2023 Smith added that such initiatives do not aim to replace doctors and clinicians but rather help them in their work. “Open source development always creates better AI algorithms. We also have a section where people can contribute to our AI platform to make multiresolution simulations based on different factors,” she added. Related: VC Roundup: Private accounts, tokenization and healthcare infrastructure grab investor attention Rejuve.AI is a decentralized longevity research network where users can contribute their personal health data for aging science studies in exchange for rewards in the form of a token, which, in turn, can be used for other products and services within the platform. According to Smith, data collected from users will then be used to develop advanced test kits, such as genome sequencing, DNA methylation, and biological age tests — products that an average individual would not be able to access otherwise. Referring to concerns that the initiative may trivialize views on longevity research, Smith argued that people “innately like to be rewarded,” adding: “I think everybody wants to get something for what they give, especially when it comes to health data. We’re wearing smartwatches and rings, and while we might get some little cool graphs on the app, we’re not actually getting paid.” The executive pointed out that that aspect of Web3 “can be really powerful,” highlighting what comes out of the research that “goes far beyond just the token.” When asked about the philosophical debate and unintended societal consequences around extending human life, Smith explained that the project is not forcing anyone to “live past 100.” “It’s more about pushing the limits of science and technology to make something not just for rich people but for anybody who does have that drive and that motivation [to extend their lives],” Smith said. “It’s also not about pushing that driver motivation on someone that doesn’t already have it.” Smith said that she does not see AI replacing humans completely. Instead, she believes that the technology will not only make their jobs easier but also give them a more direct and detailed insight into a person’s value as an individual. She added: “[AI] can definitely speed up workflows, make tracking easier, and be able to connect an individual more to their data contribution, and to the proceeds that actually arise from putting their data toward different initiatives and products.” #Blockchain #Research #Business #AI #Health #Medicine Add reaction READ MORE Help or hindrance: Is Web3 really improving mainstream industry and products?

    "title": "Blockchain's Potential to Revolutionize Entertainment Industry: New Funding Methods, Combat Piracy, and Connect Fans to Artists",
    "originLink": "https://labusinessjournal.com/commentary/blockchain/",
    "originBody": "HOMECOMMENTARY COMMENTARY OPINION EDITORIAL How Blockchain Can Save Entertainment BY SHIRA LAZAR NOVEMBER 6, 2023 10 The entertainment industry is grappling with numerous challenges, with the writers’ and actors’ strikes this year standing as a clear sign that the current model is not sustainable. However, blockchain technology could be the key to addressing these challenges, potentially saving the industry billions of dollars. According to Leo Matchett, co-founder and chief executive of the Decentralized Pictures Foundation, “the blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the entertainment industry. It can help create a more transparent and equitable industry, and it can also connect fans with their favorite artists in new and innovative ways.” This isn’t a superficial statement for Matchett. With more than 20 years of experience as a software developer and film producer, he is spearheading efforts at the company co-owned by director Roman Coppola, whose father, the Oscar-winning director Francis Ford Coppola, is a household name. To understand the scope of this potential change, it’s crucial to comprehend what blockchain technology is. At its core, the blockchain comprises blocks of data, similar to a bank ledger that records transactions. It’s secure, transparent and immutable, meaning that transactions are irreversible once they happen. This concept has its benefits and downsides, which are continually being explored and addressed as the technology evolves and advances. Blockchain technology extends beyond the headlines about FTX or NFT pyramid schemes. This technology could be a game-changer for the entertainment industry in six ways: by curbing piracy, addressing fraud, boosting declining revenues, creating new funding methods, seamlessly tracking royalties and securing an equitable and sustainable future. Blockchain can counter piracy in several ways. It can create a secure and transparent record of digital content ownership, simplifying the process of tracking and prosecuting pirates. Furthermore, blockchain can implement digital rights management systems, which complicate the copying or distribution of copyrighted material without authorization. Additionally, blockchain technology can combat fraud in several ways. It can establish a secure and transparent record of transactions, making it harder for fraudsters to counterfeit tickets and other products. Consumers can verify the origins of a ticket and confirm its authenticity. Additionally, blockchain can facilitate the implementation of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts automate payments and other transactions, making it more challenging for fraudsters to commit theft. Ticketmaster and Sports Illustrated have already adopted blockchain as a solution to these issues. The entertainment industry is experiencing declining revenues, due in part to the rise of streaming services, the fall of traditional media outlets and the implosion of advertising. Justin Alanis, chief executive of StoryCo, a blockchain-based entertainment platform, has been testing ways to connect creators and fans through his company. He believes that “blockchain technology… can create new revenue streams, such as the sale of digital collectibles or nonfungible tokens and reduce costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries like record labels and distributors.” Blockchain can create innovative funding methods for the entertainment industry. For example, blockchain-based crowdfunding platforms allow fans to invest in their favorite artists and projects. Josh Frazin, co-founder of Hollywoodland, believes that “this can provide much-needed financial support for creative projects, and it can also give fans a sense of ownership in the success of their favorite artists.” Filmmaker Sherry McCracken, who became interested in smart contracts in 2018, has been all in ever since. She founded the Web3 film studio, Never Alone Xperience, as a way to make the world a better place for filmmakers and creators. Community members can participate in everything from supporting a project through funding to voting on what script should be made. Blockchain can be used to track royalties for artists and creators. This can ensure that artists are paid fairly for their work and help reduce fraud. Blockchain-based platforms can track the ownership of digital content and automate the distribution of royalties to the rightful parties. This could be an effective solution for tracking the use of your work or likeness by AI, or the amount of plays your show gets across various streaming platforms. SoundXYZ is an excellent example for the music industry, allowing artists to mint their songs as NFTs, creating a unique and valuable asset that can be sold or traded directly to their fans. Mike Musante, co-founder of Decentralized Pictures, and a seasoned film producer, is optimistic about “the potential to make the entertainment industry more transparent and equitable.” He also commented on the industry’s current opacity, noting, “it’s difficult for fans to know where their money is going or how their data is being used. Blockchain can change that.” Despite the promising potential, issues such as complexity, cost and regulation limit the evolution of this technology and its scalability. As Californians, at the center of entertainment and technology, we must do all we can to create an environment that allows this technology to flourish. That includes folks at the ground level working to help educate on blockchain, all the way up to our elected officials, who we are relying on to create a sound regulatory environment for blockchain technology. Working together to harness this technology, we have the opportunity to change the future of entertainment.

The patent, approved on October 24, details VeChain’s plan to make it easier for blockchain platforms to process a single transaction with multiple tasks. In its primer, VeChain explains that traditional blockchain platforms are inefficient in processing transactions that require the execution of multiple tasks. For instance, the patent details that existing blockchains struggle with mainstream application use cases such as fund distribution and mass product registration. As per VeChain, the inefficiency results from such chains requiring that users create multiple transactions for each item and cannot process multiple tasks in a single transaction. The solution being processed by VeChain addresses this problem in a four-aspect model that is more flexible and efficient. - Advertisement - At the solution’s core is a new transaction processing method in which a blockchain validator will receive a transaction request that “includes a plurality of fields.” The initial fields, in turn, include a transaction task field where the sender can specify the clauses (several tasks) that they wish to execute in that single transaction. The validator can only confirm the transaction as successful after processing all tasks in the designated fields. This approach, according to VeChain, eliminates the need for multiple transactions and makes public blockchains more suitable for broader use cases. VeChain Maintains Focus on Enterprise Adoption VeChain’s latest U.S. patent underlines the project’s commitment to pursuing enterprise-focused use cases. While VeChain caters to consumer crypto applications such as DeFi and NFTs, the blockchain has carved a niche in the industrial sector. In October, VeChain was prominently featured on Forbes as an innovative startup powering industry manufacturing. The project has also doubled down on the logistics industry, securing blockchain-based product tracking deals with top public companies such as BMW, Walmart, and DNV GL. - Advertisement - Outside of its major enterprise deals, the price of VeChain’s primary token, VET, has also recently impressed. Over the past seven days, the asset has seen a 7% gain, trading at $0.02 at the time of writing. Follow Us on Twitter and Facebook.

Speaking at the 2023 digital asset conference, JPMorgan's credit lead for distributed ledger technology markets, Emma Lovett, says there is \"quite an air gap\" between blockchain and crypto itself; the two are \"quite segregated.\" She expects that \"the banks are going to be working on one thing, the crypto side will be working on something else.\" At present, Lovett says the \"focus from the banks for the next few years is on connecting institutional platforms.\" The banks are looking for a \"single ledger that unlocks so that many of the advantages of blockchain aren't lost.\" This hopeful apprehension is also confirmed by Steve Ashley, the Nomura MD that co-founded and spun out its crypto arm, Laser Digital. \"There still is quite a low tolerance to being invested in this market,\" Ashley says, as firms remain \"fully focused on the infrastructure leg.\" The key issue for Ashley is the lack of a \"fully vertically integrated prime brokerage solution, fully backed by the market.\" This doesn't mean institutions don't want to trade crypto, rather they're waiting for someone else to prove it can be done without the current risks. Ashley says the attitude of firms right now is that they \"don’t want to be a leader in this space, but want to be a fast follower.\" It's a message that simply knowing about crypto isn't going to get you a job in a bank now: you need to know about blockchain too.

Security in blockchain payments is assured through rigorous audits and adherence to anti-money laundering standards, says Paumen. Helio CEO Stijn Paumen recently spoke with Benzinga where he shed light on the transformative role of blockchain technology. \"You might have applications that actually have hidden wallets and self-custody wallets,\" Paumen explained, indicating a future where blockchain is so embedded in services that consumers transact \"without even knowing that it's crypto.\" Join the conversation at Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14, where all the latest innovations in the fintech sector will be a prime topic of discussion. Paumen anticipates that the behind-the-scenes nature of blockchain will not only continue, but will reshape consumer behavior. The key, he suggests, lies in the fact that consumers won't have to alter their habits significantly: \"If people can continue to pay for their goods and services, but they're using blockchain rails instead of Visa or MasterCard or other payment networks, then we've made it seamless.\" Helio's approach points to a world where digital payments are more efficient, cost-effective, and instant, leveraging the power of peer-to-peer networks. The company aims to facilitate this transition by offering an intuitive user experience, allowing consumers to use crypto payments without needing to understand the underlying technology. The Helio CEO also highlighted the economic benefits of blockchain-based payment systems, pointing out the potential for reduced fees and instant transactions. Also Read: Here's When You Can Expect The Greenlight For Spot Bitcoin ETF, According To Valkyrie \"On average, payment fees are around 2% for online payments. At the moment, we can achieve at least half of that,\" he said, underscoring the efficiency blockchain can bring to the financial world. As for the differentiation between Helio and traditional payment processors like PayPal, Paumen was clear: \"What is very different with Helio is that we actually facilitate the payment between the buyer and the merchant using a P2P system... Helio never touches the money, doesn't sit on it, and doesn't take custody. We just facilitate that P2P direct transaction between the buyer and the seller.\" In addressing security concerns, Paumen expressed confidence in the robustness of blockchain networks and the importance of thorough audits to ensure the security of smart contracts. He also stressed the importance of meeting anti-money laundering standards and know-your-customer programs to maintain the integrity of the payment system. Paumen is also optimistic about regulations, suggesting that the path forward for blockchain payment services is to adopt best practices from fintech and strive for compliance with emerging regulations.
