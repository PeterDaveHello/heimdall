By Ian Allison Nov 7, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. UTC (Shutterstock) 10 Years of Decentralizing the Future May 29-31, 2024 - Austin, Texas The biggest and most established global hub for everything crypto, blockchain and Web3. Register Now Cryptocurrency brokerage sFOX is providing customers commission-free access to blockchain staking directly from regulated custody without the risks associated with transferring ownership of their coins, the company said Tuesday. A software layer designed to make staking easy, sFOX allows professional users, high-net-worth individuals, hedge funds and the like to store their staked crypto in Wyoming trust company accounts that offer complete segregation and protection of customer funds in the unlikely event of company bankruptcy, according to a press release. “We are providing a gateway to staking without stepping in the middle or taking any revenue or profit,” sFOX founder Akbar Thobhani said in an interview. “The customer can stake directly with the blockchain and receive rewards directly from the blockchain. It’s unlike some other staking projects where you transfer ownership of your assets and third parties can make decisions for you on how to stake or lend those coins.” A focus on segregated, bankruptcy protected and regulated custody makes sense following the various crypto companies that collapsed last year. The sFOX staking product aims to increase innovation, allowing portfolio managers to stake the same crypto on which they hold open positions on the platform, the firm said. “Most important right now is bringing transparency to crypto,” Thobhani said. “It means really having to rethink things in this space.” Edited by Sheldon Reback.

    "originBody": "COINTELEGRAPH INNOVATION CIRCLE 53 MINUTES AGO 9 tips for a food business considering blockchain for its supply chain With the right focus and plan, blockchain can add real value to the food and agricultural industry’s supply chain. 129 Total views Listen to article 0:00 INNOVATION CIRCLE Join us on social networks Supply chain management has become a complicated issue for many industries in recent years — none more so than food and agriculture. When you’re in the business of ensuring essential, but perishable, goods get to where they’re supposed to go in a reliable and timely fashion — and are of the quality consumers deserve and expect — an accurate, real-time tracking system is invaluable. That’s why some food and agricultural businesses are looking into using blockchain technology. With its clear transparency and traceability advantages, verifying the origin, handling and quality of food products is easier for all parties. A business that publicizes its use of blockchain technology for supply chain management can also earn the trust of consumers who are focused on issues like food safety and sustainability. However, leveraging blockchain tech is not as simple as purchasing a software suite. To achieve the full benefits and see ROI, food and agricultural businesses would be wise to first learn best practices and smart strategies for getting started. Below, nine members of Cointelegraph Innovation Circle share their tips for food and agricultural businesses that are starting to explore blockchain technology for supply chain management. Start with clarity on your objectives Blockchain can enhance traceability, transparency and efficiency, but it’s vital to understand the specific pain points you’re addressing. Tailor the solution to your unique supply chain needs, ensuring both scalability and real-world applicability. – Maksym Illiashenko, My NFT Wars: Riftwardens Emphasize simplicity Incorporating the “seamless principle” and “keep it simple, stupid” approaches is an excellent way to implement blockchain solutions in the food and agricultural industry. This combined approach emphasizes not only simplicity and user-friendliness, but also the importance of smooth integration and a frictionless user experience, all while enhancing transparency, efficiency and trust in the supply chain. – Myrtle Anne Ramos, Block Tides Prioritize transparency Industries with extensive supply chains must prioritize transparency. Guarantee that your blockchain system offers real-time, unchangeable records that are accessible to all involved parties. This transparency fosters consumer trust, verifies product authenticity and bolsters traceability — all pivotal elements for an efficient and trustworthy food supply chain. – Sheraz Ahmed, STORM Partners Start with a single, specific process Start small and identify a specific process that can benefit from blockchain technology — like traceability, transparency, food safety or reducing fraud. Blockchain solutions are most effective when multiple participants in the supply chain are involved. Engage with suppliers, distributors, retailers and other relevant parties to ensure their buy-in and participation in the implementation. – Tammy Paola, Zerocap Take an accessible, inclusive approach Ensure all participants, from farmers to retailers, have the necessary technological tools and training. Success hinges on each link in the chain actively participating and accurately inputting data, thus maintaining a transparent and traceable system. An inclusive, tech-accessible approach is crucial for the integrity and effectiveness of the blockchain solution. – Tomer Warschauer Nuni, Kryptomon Implement blockchain where independent validation is most beneficial Blockchain differs from existing methods of sending data to a database or dashboard because the value added is — or should be — independent validation (that is, mutual assurance the data has not been changed). By switching to unbiased proofs instead of records that could be falsified, chain of custody and provenance can be traced quickly. Implement blockchain where stakeholders agree that’s a benefit. – Stephanie So, Geeq Understand errors will be made by humans, not the blockchain The blockchain is unlike traditional systems and, as a result, it needs to be nurtured in a way that is beneficial for all parties. This means that there can be many complications, and within the food and agricultural industry, the margin for error is even smaller. Therefore, communication and understanding from all involved are vital, as any error will not be blockchain-related, but will instead be human error. – Ilias Salvatore, Flooz XYZ Know that several years of testing will be required One successful blockchain project is the IBM Food Trust, which provides verifiable details about the safety and sustainability of sourced food. One major thing we can learn from this project is that it takes several years of testing (in this case, from 2017 to 2023) to make sure that the solution accurately addresses a problem. This approach reduces the risk of failure post-launch. – Abhishek Singh, Acknoledger Ensure foodways remain intact Many pixels have been exhausted theorizing how blockchain technology could liberate industries and supply chains. However, ensuring digital assets actually account for the livestock or crops they represent is paramount to mitigating the dire impact subversion could have on at-risk populations. Therefore, those aiming to disrupt agricultural industries must ensure our foodways remain intact. – Oleksandr Lutskevych, CEX.IO This article was published through Cointelegraph Innovation Circle, a vetted organization of senior executives and experts in the blockchain technology industry who are building the future through the power of connections, collaboration and thought leadership.

    "originBody": "FORBESMONEY Modernizing Operations: How Businesses Can Benefit From Blockchain Anthony Georgiades Forbes Councils Member Forbes Finance Council COUNCIL POST| Membership (Fee-Based) Nov 7, 2023,07:00am EST Anthony Georgiades is the co-founder of Pastel Network and General Partner at Innovating Capital. GETTY As business operations continue to evolve, one innovative advancement is reshaping the way companies transact and manage their data: blockchain. Blockchain’s decentralized structure, cryptographic security and inherent transparency make it ideal for enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, improving trust and piquing the interest of investors. As an investor myself and having used blockchain in a variety of applications, including helping a portfolio company build out its market-making capabilities, I’ve had the privilege of seeing this technology leveraged in numerous ways over the years. These include data ownership, payments, supply chain management, digital identity and the development of smart contracts. Exploring these different applications, I’ve seen how this technology can be applied to any number of sectors and industries. From healthcare to agriculture to traditional finance, blockchain is streamlining operations and expanding the possibilities for how businesses function at home and around the world. Here are a few of the ways businesses can leverage it. Smart Contracts Implementing smart contracts on the blockchain can automate and shorten business processes, such as insurance claims, property transfers and compliance tracking. By eliminating intermediaries, businesses can modernize operations and reduce paperwork and processing time, mitigating the risk of errors and delays.

SEC’s Enforcement Division Targets PayPal’s New Stablecoin Crypto Now Braced For A Massive 300 Billion Price Earthquake Following Bitcoin Ethereum And XRP Surge Smart contracts can also be used when working with investors to facilitate transactions and investment agreements. As a VC—and co-founder of a blockchain company—I have seen various use cases for smart contracts, such as token sales. Given that, I understand the benefits of smart contracts within mainstream business. (The next step is getting other traditional investors to see their value, too.) Financial Transactions And Remittances Blockchain technology can revolutionize traditional payment and remittance systems by making transactions more secure as well as faster and cheaper. Cross-border payments, in particular, can be significantly simplified as this technology eliminates the need for intermediaries and reduces transaction fees and settlement times. Businesses can use blockchain-based payment solutions to facilitate frictionless global transactions while ensuring enhanced security and transparency. Digital Identity Verification And Authentication Traditionally, verifying identities involves cumbersome manual checks, leaving room for data breaches and identity theft. However, with the application of zero-knowledge proofs, a decentralized and tamper-resistant system emerges. This innovation ensures that sensitive personal data remains confidential while enabling entities to instantly access verified identity credentials. Consequently, this efficient and secure verification process not only expedites customer onboarding but also elevates the entirety of the user experience, offering robust protection against identity fraud. Data Sharing And Collaboration Blockchain technology enables secure and permissioned data sharing among different stakeholders. Businesses operating in consortia can use the blockchain to maintain shared records with secure access controls, enhancing data integrity and confidentiality. This collaborative approach uncomplicates information sharing and decision making while reducing the need for reconciliation across multiple parties. Competitive Advantage With Investors Investors are often drawn to companies that have the potential to revolutionize traditional business models and unlock new opportunities while maintaining a commitment to system integrity, transparency and immutability. Companies that can showcase significant efficiency gains through blockchain integration are likely to garner heightened investor attention. Its status as a cutting-edge technology with a diverse array of potential applications positions it as a very attractive feature for those who value forward-thinking enterprises capable of adapting to emerging technological trends. I’ve been fortunate to be on the front lines of this groundbreaking technology as more creative, innovative and life-changing use cases are discovered. By incorporating blockchain strategically, businesses can unlock new possibilities, drive funding, improve operational efficiency, foster trust and gain a competitive edge over their peers. Therefore, businesses should make embracing its transformative capabilities a priority.

FOLLOW Share VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Nov. 07, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BIGG Digital Assets Inc. (“BIGG” or the “Company”) (CSE: BIGG; OTCQX: BBKCF; WKN: A2PS9W), a leading innovator in the digital assets space and owner of Netcoins, Blockchain Intelligence Group, and TerraZero is pleased to announce the addition of the Spanish language to its offerings of cryptocurrency investigations and compliance services. This strategic move comes in response to the proliferating demand for cryptocurrency solutions in Spanish-speaking countries. It is a pivotal step to acknowledging the vast business potential in these markets. Crypto Adoption in Spanish-Speaking Countries Spanish-speaking countries have witnessed a remarkable surge in cryptocurrency adoption in recent years. In El Salvador, Bitcoin became a legal tender in 2021, and the government introduced the Bitcoin wallet Chivo, which has been downloaded by millions of users. Argentina has seen over 8 million users on the cryptocurrency exchange Ripio, which also offers a debit card for spending cryptocurrency globally. In Mexico, Bitso, another cryptocurrency exchange, boasts more than 6 million users and provides a remittance service for sending money to Mexico from other countries using cryptocurrency. This trend is also reflected in the rest of the Spanish-speaking regions. Countries such as Spain, Brazil, and Colombia have embraced cryptocurrencies, recognizing their potential to revolutionize financial systems and increase financial inclusion. This trend has created a growing demand for localized blockchain analytics tools to combat financial crime and thwart money laundering and terrorist financing activities. Blockchain Intelligence Group’s investigations and compliance suite aims at securing the financial system and safeguarding consumers from potential scams and fraud. In addition, this ecosystem of tools contributes to continuing the growth of the digital asset industry by ensuring a safer more compliance driven environment. Vast Market Opportunity Unlocked The integration of the Spanish language into Blockchain Intelligence Group’s investigation and compliance suite acknowledges the immense market opportunity presented by Spanish-speaking countries. By catering to this audience, Blockchain Intelligence Group is poised to tap into the burgeoning opportunities of the digital asset ecosystem in these regions. The Spanish-speaking community represents a vast market with a collective population of more than 475 million people, offering substantial potential for blockchain-based services, and demand for investigations and risk management solutions. Recognizing this potential, Blockchain Intelligence Group has made it a priority to provide localized services and support to Spanish-speaking clients. The addition of Spanish language capabilities positions the company as a valuable resource for cryptocurrency businesses, financial institutions, and government agencies looking to navigate cryptocurrencies in these countries. Spanish-language CCI training One of the highlights of this expansion is the ongoing availability of Spanish-language training through Blockchain Intelligence Group's Certified Cryptocurrency Investigator (CCI) programs. This comprehensive training program equips professionals with the knowledge and tools required to conduct thorough investigations and achieve compliance with local and global regulations. With all the CCI training programs already available in Spanish, BIG is equipping Spanish-speaking professionals with the necessary knowledge tailored to digital asset investigations and compliance needs of the future. The CCI training program covers a wide range of essential topics, including blockchain technology, the dark web, illicit use, and advanced obfuscation techniques. By offering this training in Spanish, Blockchain Intelligence Group is empowering professionals across Spanish-speaking countries to stay ahead of the curve in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. Lance Morginn, President of Blockchain Intelligence Group, expressed his enthusiasm for this strategic expansion, saying, \"Our goal has always been to provide cryptocurrency investigation and compliance solutions to clients around the world. By adding Spanish language capabilities to our suite of services, and our existing localized CCI training programs, we are reinforcing our commitment to serving the growing digital asset sector in Spanish-speaking countries.” On behalf of the Board Dan Reitzik Interim CEO ir@biggdigitalassets.com About BIGG Digital Assets Inc.

Garrison Yang commends outgoing marketing team for their contributions during pivotal growth phases. Ava Labs, the company behind the popular blockchain platform Avalanche AVAX/USD, has announced a reorganization that resulted in a 12% reduction of its workforce. This move, detailed by Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of Ava Labs, is part of a broader strategy to harness the company’s agility and increase its focus on expansion during a turbulent market period. As Ava Labs realigns its focus, the timing coincides with the forthcoming Benzinga's Future of Digital Assets conference on Nov. 14. The conference aims to explore the trajectory of digital assets, with companies like Ava Labs at the forefront of the conversation, navigating through the complexities of the current financial climate. This restructuring equates to around 40 employees departing from Ava Labs, based on the company’s listed workforce on LinkedIn, signaling a considerable contraction for the firm.

    "originBody": "News Podcasts Unchained The Chopping Block Learn Guides Videos Shop About Contact News Podcasts Learn Guides Videos Shop About Contact Kraken Plans to Build Its Own Layer 2 Blockchain: Report Crypto exchange Kraken is reportedly in discussions with blockchain infrastructure firms as it considers who to partner with to launch its own Layer 2 network. Photo by PiggyBank on Unsplash Samyuktha Sriram Posted November 7, 2023 at 12:29 am EST. Crypto exchange Kraken appears to be following the footsteps of its rival Coinbase with plans to launch its own Layer 2 blockchain. According to a Monday report from CoinDesk, Kraken is in talks with blockchain technology firms, including Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation, to build out the network. Sources who asked not to be identified told the publication that conversations around the exchange’s effort were still ongoing, and they were yet to be made public. “We’re always looking to identify and solve for new industry challenges and opportunities. We don’t have anything further to share at this time,” a Kraken spokesperson told CoinDesk. Earlier this year, Coinbase launched a Layer 2 network Base using OP Labs’ tech stack – the same codebase that the Optimism chain is built on. It is fair to say that Base has quickly risen the ranks in the Layer 2 ecosystem, and now commands the third spot after OP Mainnet and Arbitrum One, with $574 million in value locked. Optimism, Arbitrrum and Base all utilize Optimistic Rollup technology, which are Layer 2 protocols designed to scale Ethereum by taking computation and state storage off-chain, processing transactions in batches. Optimistic Rollups rely on fraud proofs, which assume that transaction data submitted is correct and valid until proven otherwise. Meanwhile, existing Layer 2 solutions from Polygon, Matter Labs and Nil Foundation are zero-knowledge (ZK) proof solutions, which also aim to scale Ethereum, but rely on validity proofs for individual transactions. Although it is too early to tell which network Kraken will likely partner with, if it does intend to launch a Layer 2 network with the firms under consideration, it will likely be based on ZK technology. A look at the Layer 2 market in its current state shows that Optimistic Rollups command most of the share – something that could come down to the fact that the architecture behind them is relatively less complex than ZK-based alternatives. In the long run, however, some have opined that ZK Rollups will prevail, particularly if they are Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, because of their ability to eliminate waiting periods for transaction validity. “My opinion is that in the long run, ZK-Rollup will eventually beat Optimistic Rollup because they have basic advantages like users don’t need to wait 7 days for a withdrawal,” said Ethereum cofounder Vitalik Buterin at an event in Seoul last year.
