It’s a nerve-wracking scenario, akin to a tightrope walk where the fear of data breaches and unauthorized access looms large. But what if we told you there’s a superhero in town ready to turn that anxiety into awe? Enter Blockchain — not just a tech term but a revolutionary force set to redefine how we approach data sharing. It’s the digital guardian organizations didn’t know they needed, promising security, transparency, and efficiency in one seamless package. Navigating Data Sharing Challenges of Yesteryear Picture organizations in a high-stakes juggling act, grappling with centralized models, data manipulation, and security loopholes. It’s a rollercoaster of sleepless nights haunted by compromised data integrity and the constant threat of unauthorized access. Now, envision blockchain as the hero of this story — a game-changer ready to tackle these concerns head-on. It promises a new era marked by security, transparency, and a sigh of relief for organizations navigating the complexities of data challenges. Unraveling the Enigma of Blockchain Explore blockchain as more than tech jargon — it’s a superhero armed with decentralization, cryptographic security, and unwavering transparency. Decentralization: Picture a team of superheroes, each network node playing a crucial role without needing a central boss. No ultimate control, just collaboration.

Smart contracts aren’t here to complicate; they’re efficient work companions streamlining processes seamlessly. Self-Enforcing Marvels: Imagine having a personal assistant for contracts — proactive, saving you time and effort. Streamlining Processes: Smart contracts cut out the middlemen, making contractual processes smoother, faster, and more direct. Error-Free Assurance: These contracts are virtually error-free, ensuring flawless execution of agreements. This isn’t just a technological shift; it’s a paradigm shift in how we approach agreements. Smart contracts simplify, making processes efficient and error-resistant — your new BFFs in the blockchain journey. Privacy Preservation: Why Permissioned Access Matters In the blockchain world, privacy is a sacred promise. Imagine owning your exclusive backstage pass, deciding who gets a front-row seat to your data — a personalized, secure experience in your digital haven. Transparency Amplified: Navigating the Audit Trail Clarity No more navigating confusing audit trails. Blockchain provides a crystal-clear audit trail, turning a once murky process into a well-lit room. It revolutionizes how we understand and trust the flow of information. Instantaneous Data Sharing: Eradicating the Waiting List Step into the dynamic realm of blockchain, where real-time data sharing is the vibrant pulse of the digital era. Blockchain takes the spotlight, bringing your valuable information to life with immediacy and vibrancy.

    "originBody": "home news Business Crypto funding: 3 crypto companies secure $90M+ raises Blockchain.com, BC Technology Group and Fnality all secured raises in excess of $90 million this week by Jack Kubinec / November 19, 2023 02:00 pm ElenaR/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks share Amid a funding dry spell, this week saw three of the largest crypto raises in recent months. Crypto exchange and wallet service Blockchain.com raised $110 million in a Series E round led by Kingsway, the parent company of crypto exchange OSL raised $91 million via a share subscription, and tokenized currency firm Fnality announced a $95 million round led by Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas. The raises came with crypto mired in a funding slump, seeing consecutive quarterly declines in venture capital dating back to the start of 2022. Blockchain.com’s $110 million round is the year’s fourth-largest fundraise, following Blockstream, LayerZero, and Worldcoin, according to DeFiLlama data. The company declined to disclose a valuation but Bloomberg reported a valuation of less than half of the $14 billion mark the platform secured last year. With the move, Manny Stotz, CEO of UK venture firm Kingsway and Nicolas Brand, partner at VC fund Lakestar, will join Blockchain.com’s board of directors. Hong Kong-based BC Technology Group, which owns the crypto exchange OSL, acquired $91 million when crypto firm BGX purchased almost 30% of the company’s stock through a share subscription. In August, OSL joined HashKey as the first exchanges to acquire Hong Kong’s new license to facilitate retail crypto trading in the city. Fnality is a fintech firm focused in part on tokenizing securities — that is, making traditional financial assets like gold or Treasury bonds synthetic and storing them on the blockchain. The tokenization of real-world assets has been popular among financial institutions as of late. JPMorgan and HSBC both ramped up potential tokenization offerings in recent weeks. The centralized finance platforms’ raises come amid a longer-term slide in centralized finance funding relative to decentralized platforms. Read more: JPMorgan tests tokenized portfolios with Avalanche blockchain tech Tokenization’s big week continues Tokenization company Superstate raised $14 million in a Series A led by CoinFund and Distributed Global, joining Fnality as the week’s other notable tokenization raise. Superstate is helmed by Robert Leshner, who founded the DeFi lending firm Compound before leaving to create Superstate. The raise comes less than five months after Superstate’s $4 million seed round was announced. The company filed an SEC prospectus at around the same time to let clients store tokenized government bonds on Ethereum. At Blockworks’ Permissionless conference in August, Leshner said DeFi’s onboarding of major institutions would require the space to compromise on crypto-native assets in favor of a focus on tokenization. “This is the big divide that is going to define the next ten years of DeFi,” Leshner said at the time. Other notable fundraises K-Pop fan engagement startup Modhaus raised $8 million in a Series A round led by Sfermion. CFX Labs raised $9.5 million in seed funding to grow its remittance-focused stablecoin payment product on Solana. Bitcoin ordinals project Taproot Wizards announced a $7.5 million seed round led by Standard Crypto. Don’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.

Meanwhile, asset manager WisdomTree has filed an amended Form S-1 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) prospectus with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and Europe-based CoinShares has the exclusive option to buy the U.S.-based Valkyrie Funds. ENS devs warn Unstoppable Domains: Drop patents or face lawsuit ENS founder and lead developer Nick Johnson recently posted an open letter on X (formerly Twitter) urging Web3 firm Unstoppable Domains to relinquish a blockchain tech patent or else face potential litigation. Failing that, ENS Labs stands ready to challenge this patent, which we believe is entirely derivative of our own inventions; a position we are able and willing to demonstrate. — nick.eth (@nicksdjohnson) November 16, 2023 Unstoppable Domains received its first U.S. patent in January 2023. According to the patent, Braden River Pezeshki, Matthew Everett Gould and Bogdan Gusiev are the inventors of a technology that uses blockchain technology to determine domains. Johnson disputes this claim and says ENS is the rightful creator of the patent. The ensuing discussion laid bare the disconnect between the two companies. WisdomTree amends S-1 form spot Bitcoin ETF filing as crypto awaits SEC decisions WisdomTree filed an amended Form S-1 spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETF prospectus with the SEC on Nov. 16. The update comes a few months after WisdomTree refiled its spot Bitcoin ETF application in June 2023, proposing a rule change to list and trade shares of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust on the BZX Exchange by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The amended prospectus mentions that the WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust ETF will trade under a ticker symbol BTCW, with Coinbase Custody Trust serving as the custodian holding all of the trust’s Bitcoin on its behalf. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the updated filing means that the firm is still planning to launch an ETF and is discussing the opportunity with the SEC. UPDATE: Theres the S-1/Prospectus amendment for @WisdomTreeFunds’s spot #bitcoin ETF pic.twitter.com/RKzWbuKnl1 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) November 16, 2023 “All issuers were expected to have to file one of these to potentially launch their ETF at some point. Just a step in the process. Nothing critical,” Seyffart wrote on X. Another Bloomberg ETF expert, Eric Balchunas, noticed that WisdomTree took “long enough” to amend its Form S-1. “Please tell me the SEC isn’t waiting till all S-1s are updated before issuing a second round of comments,” he added. CoinShares gets rights to buy Valkyrie’s crypto ETFs European digital asset manager CoinShares secured the exclusive option to acquire Valkyrie Funds, the ETF unit of its U.S. competitor Valkyrie Investments.

CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti said he hopes the Valkyrie acquisition will help it capitalize on a fragmented global ETF market.

Celestia (TIA) bills itself as “the first modular blockchain network.” The project aims to allow developers to build blockchain-based applications for mass adoption. Celestia’s native asset, TIA, is used to secure the network and as a gas token for rollups. The 59th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is trading at $6.49 at time of writing, up from its its initial $2.18 price on October 31st, when the network was successfully deployed to mainnet beta. TIA is also up more than 10% in the past 24 hours and more than 111% in the past seven days. Venture capitalist Chris Burniske, the founder of Placeholder Capital, said in September that Celestia’s defining characteristic is “availability.” Celestia calls modular blockchains the “new paradigm in blockchain design,” noting that they are specialized and optimized to perform specific tasks, rather than a single blockchain that’s forced to do everything. Top global crypto exchange Binance and top US exchange Coinbase both rolled out trading services for TIA shortly after the token’s launch. Other top exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken and Crypto.com, have also listed the new asset.

    "originLink": "https://coingeek.com/alex-agut-talks-unlocking-new-gaming-economies-on-bsv-blockchain-with-handcash-video/",
    "originBody": "Alex Agut talks unlocking new gaming economies on BSV blockchain with HandCash INTERVIEWS 2 HOURS AGO Steve Kaaru Gaming is a $225 billion market, and it’s projected to hit $610 billion by 2032. However, gamers still struggle with the same old challenges, including high fees and a lack of universal in-game payments. Alex Agut is out to change this, and in an interview with CoinGeek Backstage, he discussed how HandCash is unlocking a new gaming economy. Agut was at the Unbounded Capital Summit in New York, an event that brought together investors, innovators, and thought leaders in the blockchain sector. Agut was one of the speakers, and in his “Ping a Penny” presentation, he demonstrated how easy, fast, and cheap it is to transfer cents across the world with Bitcoin. “A demo is better than 1,000 videos. You can watch a lot of videos, but when you experience that you can send one cent immediately to someone in Japan, the possibilities are endless,” he told CoinGeek reporter Becky Liggero. HandCash has evolved to respond to market needs and changing customer preferences over the years. It launched as a Bitcoin wallet, but it has become an all-round ecosystem over time, and now, the focus is on gaming. Agut says the decision was easy for him and co-founder Rafa Jimenez as ”half our clients have been gaming companies, and we realized that there was a pattern; that they were trying to create this new kind of game economies with digital payments and all that.” Unlocking a new game economy powered by BSV blockchain Gaming ecosystems have evolved over the years, and today, most rely on in-game purchases for players to unlock new features. However, even this has evolved and become “more abusive” recently, says Agut. “The problem is that players who don’t have money have to grind a lot to get some features and level up their characters while others just throw money at the problem. This creates huge disparity…it’s very unfair to people who can’t afford to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to compete,” he noted. HandCash is out to change this through its BSV blockchain-powered micropayments, marketplace, and digital identity—the HandCash ID, “which is the most important part of all of this.” HandCash has introduced stablecoin payments on its ecosystem. “Gamers hate crypto,” he says, “but they like money and want more freedom.” Stablecoins are part of the HandCash commitment to making digital assets as easy to use for its clients as any other mainstream fiat platform. With stablecoins, any gamer can make and receive payments with a uniform medium of exchange, eliminating the need for supporting dozens of tokens. Stablecoins are also critical in targeting the non-digital asset crowd. Agut revealed that he meets several companies who love HandCash and its products, but they tell him to “come back when you can do all of this with US dollars.” Even with stablecoins, HandCash relies on the unbounded BSV blockchain network in the background to power its platform. Agut welcomes every company that wants to jump in on the gaming economy. “If you want to turn your online communities into thriving game economies, go to our website, sign up on the business dashboard and create your apps,” he said.

David Palmer, Blockchain Lead for Vodafone Business IoT With sessions running over two stages, David Palmer, Blockchain Lead for Vodafone Business IoT joined us on Stage 2 to discuss how banks are starting to see the value of the blockchain technology employed in the cryptocurrency industry. This comes after, as Palmer puts it, “a very brave, very bullish, very creative cryptocurrency sector showed us how you can do banking with smart contracts.” He continues: “What we are seeing today is a convergence where the big banks and finance companies are starting to move in. “Now that the crypto market is stabilising after volatility across 2021-2022, I think what blockchain has shown us is that it can help us to reimagine currency, it can help us to reimagine stores of value, and help us to reimagine digital ownership. “One of the greatest things of 2021 was decentralised finance (DeFi), and how you can do banking with smart contracts, DAOs, and with digital autonomous organisations. “Smart contracts themselves, which I believe blockchain can really link to through the tokenisation of real-world assets, is something I think is also starting to get a lot more attention.” For more from Palmer, you can click on the video link to his keynote speech above.

    "originBody": "3 cryptocurrencies to buy under $10 next week Ivan Zhelev Cryptocurrency Nov 19, 2023 The current cryptocurrency market is witnessing a substantial surge, capturing the attention of investors. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain prominent with their notable performances, there is a growing interest in more budget-friendly alternatives. For investors who possess a higher risk tolerance, allocating a portion of their investment capital, ranging from 10% to 20%, into these altcoins can provide a tantalizing chance to diversify their portfolio and position themselves for substantial gains in the forthcoming bull market, here are three cryptocurrencies priced under $10 to consider. Uniswap (UNI) Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that revolutionized the market with its innovative AMM (automated market maker) model. This model eliminates the need for traditional order books, providing a streamlined method for direct token swaps on the blockchain without intermediary involvement. Operating as a decentralized protocol, Uniswap allows anyone to create liquidity pools for various tokens, making it a go-to platform for trading new crypto assets before their listing on centralized exchanges.

Cryptocurrency This move could trigger XRP’s aggressive rally past $1 Opinion 3 lessons I have learned from the Bitcoin Standard The AMM model introduced by Uniswap has been widely adopted by decentralized exchanges across different blockchain platforms, with Uniswap maintaining its position as the most active decentralized exchange in terms of trading volume. Governance of the Uniswap protocol is in the hands of UNI token holders, who can submit and vote on proposals. UNI tokens were distributed through an airdrop to past Uniswap protocol users in 2020 and are now available for purchase on various trading platforms. Furthermore, Uniswap has expanded its offerings by introducing a non-custodial mobile wallet supporting the Ethereum mainnet, along with compatibility with the Arbitrum and Optimism layer 2 scalability platforms. (UNI Year-to-Date trading volume. Source: Finbold) UNI is currently priced at just about $5, but it reached $42.4 at its all-time hight and might see a significant price increase in the upcoming bull market. Cosmos (ATOM) Cosmos (ATOM) functions as a network designed to facilitate interoperability among different blockchain platforms. And it’s part of the Cosmos Hub, a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that not only oversees the Cosmos ecosystem but also enables connections with external blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The communication between various blockchains within Cosmos is facilitated through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Both the Cosmos Hub and other blockchains within the Cosmos network are constructed using the Cosmos SDK framework. These blockchains benefit from a robust Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, ensuring secure transactions with a fast processing time of approximately 7 seconds and minimal transaction costs, around $0.01 per transaction. The native cryptocurrency of Cosmos is known as ATOM. Users can stake their ATOM tokens to enhance the network’s security, earning staking rewards along with a share of the transaction fees collected by the network. Cosmos is set to undergo its v9-Lambda upgrade on March 15, introducing replicated security (RS) to the network. This upgrade allows blockchains within the Cosmos network to lease security from the Cosmos Hub, streamlining the process for validators. Replicated security aligns with the broader concept of interchain security (ICS) gradually implemented by the Cosmos project. This upgrade provides Cosmos-based projects the advantage of focusing on their unique strengths without the added concern of managing validators and security. Also, ATOM stakers may witness increased yield, as up to 25% of fees collected by “consumer chains” will be directed to Cosmos Hub stakers. (ATOM Year-to-Date trading volume. Source: Finbold) The current value of ATOM stands at $9.18, and there is anticipation that the forthcoming update could contribute to a price increase. Although the project is still in its early stages, investors seeking portfolio diversification and potential guaranteed upward price movement might find consideration of ATOM investment worthwhile. Celestia (TIA) Celestia (TIA) is a modular blockchain that utilises data availability (DA) sampling to enable the integration of multiple rollups and Ethereum-based DApps into its ecosystem. In modular blockchains, full nodes play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of the network, and without getting too technical, full nodes need to download and execute all transactions to generate proofs. However, if some block producers withhold certain transactions, it results in a “data withholding attack.” While full nodes can detect this by checking for missing transactions, light nodes lack this capability. Celestia addresses this challenge through Data Availability Sampling, enabling light nodes to verify data without downloading the entire block. This involves random sampling of a small portion of block data, and once confidence reaches a certain threshold, the block becomes available. Celestia has launched its maintet less than a month ago, and it generated a lot of traction among investors in Layer2 (L2) projects. Celestia witnessed a slow start in on-chain activity after the launch, but this did dampened investors’ enthusiasm, leading to a rally in its token, reaching $6.30 – 200% higher than its debut price of around $2.10. TIA is the native token for Celestia, with a total supply of 1 billion. The token mechanism is designed to inflate at 8% in its first year, which will decrease by 10% each year (7.2% in second year, 6.48% in third year etc.) until it reaches floor of 1.5% annually. The major use case for the TIA token is to pay for the blob space. In order to use the Celestia network for DA, roll-up developers must submit payforblobs (PFB) transactions to the network for a fee, which is denominated in TIA. Celestia’s success is contingent on the adoption of applications and protocols relying on its DA layer. According to Messari, Celestia will need to capture 2x the rollup adoption of Ethereum to justify the valuation, so a steep correction in TIA market price is anticipated before a considerable rally in the next two years.
