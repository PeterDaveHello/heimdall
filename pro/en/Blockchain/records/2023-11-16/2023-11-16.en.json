    "originBody": "COMPANIES ·BLOCKCHAIN Blockchain not crypto: Proton Mail CEO calls new address verification feature ‘blockchain in a very pure form’ BYLEO SCHWARTZ Andy Yen, the founder and CEO of Proton Mail. COURTESY OF PROTON Proton Mail, the leading privacy-focused email service, is making its first foray into blockchain technology with Key Transparency, which will allow users to verify email addresses. In an interview with Fortune, CEO and founder Andy Yen made clear that although the new feature uses blockchain, the key technology behind crypto, Key Transparency isn’t “some sketchy cryptocurrency” linked to an “exit scam.” A student of cryptography, Yen added that the new feature is “blockchain in a very pure form,” and it allows the platform to solve the thorny issue of ensuring that every email address actually belongs to the person who’s claiming it. ‘Man in the middle’ Proton Mail uses end-to-end encryption, a secure form of communication that ensures only the intended recipient can read the information. Senders encrypt an email using their intended recipient’s public key—a long string of letters and numbers—which the recipient can then decrypt with their own private key. The issue, Yen said, is ensuring that the public key actually belongs to the intended recipient. “Maybe it’s the NSA that has created a fake public key linked to you, and I’m somehow tricked into encrypting data with that public key,” he told Fortune. In the security space, the tactic is known as a “man-in-the-middle attack,” like a postal worker opening your bank statement to get your social security number and then resealing the envelope. Blockchains are an immutable ledger, meaning any data initially entered onto them can’t be altered. Yen realized that putting users’ public keys on a blockchain would create a record ensuring those keys actually belonged to them—and would be cross-referenced whenever other users send emails. “In order for the verification to be trusted, it needs to be public, and it needs to be unchanging,” Yen said. Threat model The feature will be automatic for users of Proton, which will do a search to ensure that the public key matches the intended recipient. If there isn’t a match, users will see a warning. Proton rolled out the beta version of Key Transparency on their own private blockchain, meaning it’s not run by a decentralized series of validators, as with Bitcoin or Ethereum. Yen said Proton might move the feature to a public blockchain after the current version serves as a proof of concept. In his interview with Fortune, Yen acknowledged that the feature isn’t necessarily for everyday people, but for users with a sophisticated threat model who need to ensure their emails are going to the correct destination, such as world leaders, executives, and activists. Despite the niche use case, he said Proton Mail currently has 100 million accounts and is starting to gain more mainstream interest amid privacy concerns around leading email clients like Gmail, which tracks user behavior. “It’s really a way to opt out of the mass surveillance that today is the prevalent model on the internet,” he said. “That’s why the average user should decide to switch.” Learn more about all things crypto with short, easy-to-read lesson cards.

The tests were carried out under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian and was designed specifically to enable fund managers to tokenize their portfolios on chosen blockchains. Wealth managers could also purchase and rebalance their positions across these different interoperable blockchain networks. The blockchain stacks chosen for this proof of concept include Provenance Blockchain, JPMorgan’s own Onyx Digital Assets and Avalanche. Cross-chain communication protocol Axelar and issuance-slash-trading platform Oasis Pro also contributed to the initiative. It is important to note that these transactions were done in a permissioned manner, meaning access was limited to a select few participants on private blockchain networks. So, the transactions won’t show up on public chain explorers such as Axelarscan, Mintscan or Snowscan, though example transactions are detailed in a recent JPMorgan and Apollo report. Galen Moore, global communications lead at Axelar, told Blockworks that Axelar created a permissioned instance for connecting different chains by modifying its existing cross-chain configuration so that it was in alignment with the privacy and access management requirements set by the proof of concept. “The purpose of this Project Guardian was to demonstrate a system that would allow a portfolio manager to manage a large number of discretionary portfolios comprising tokenized assets across multiple blockchains,” Moore said. “In that, it was successful.” How JPMorgan’s tokenized portfolios worked across multiple private blockchains It is uncertain whether public chains or mainnets will be involved in future deployments. Though this is the case, JPMorgan has been actively exploring possibilities in the blockchain technology space. Also for Project Guardian, JPMorgan processed tokenized foreign exchange trades on Polygon’s mainnet last year via a modified version of the permissioned DeFi platform Aave Arc. Most recently, it gave institutional clients more programmability over its payment offerings on its blockchain-based accounts with the JPM Coin system, allowing users to set parameters around payments based on different requirements. The bank has also been exploring on-chain digital wallets, allowing users to store and control digital identity on its platform. “Consistent with the goals of Project Guardian, we believe our POC is a critical moment at the intersection between traditional finance and blockchain technology,” JPMorgan wrote in a report. “We view our contribution to Project Guardian as the first step of a journey into the complex business of delivering higher quality discretionary investment portfolios in a thoughtful and efficient manner to improve the end investor’s experience and results.” Don’t miss the next big story – join our free daily newsletter.

    "originBody": "An attendee wearing a necklace featuring the Bitcoin logo during the Adopting Bitcoin summit in San Salvador, El Salvador, on November 7. The United States has a reputation for being the home of innovation, but the lack of clarify on cryptocurrency regulation has opened the door for other countries to emerge as hubs for the industry. Photo: Bloomberg Opinion Dominic Williams Asia is dethroning US as hub of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation As the US continues to send mixed signals to the cryptocurrency industry, the choice for blockchain developers is increasingly to move operations into friendlier countries in the Asia-Pacific, turning the region into a centre of innovation Dominic Williams + FOLLOW Published: 6:30pm, 16 Nov, 2023 Why you can trust SCMP The home of the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry has been a topic of debate ever since the bull market faded and the bear took its place. The cryptocurrency industry has been, and continues to be, one of the most innovative developments of the 21st century. Amid the technological advancement of the industry, countries and their regulators need to speed up the development of frameworks that will allow the industry to flourish. Recent regulatory developments within Asia – specifically in Hong Kong and Singapore – coupled with developer talent and an appetite for investment have positioned the region as a global hub for blockchain. The United States has historically been the global leader in innovation. The country’s innovation ecosystem was unrivalled globally, but blockchain technology has bucked this trend. In March, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent an official warning to Coinbase, alleging violations of federal securities laws over the offering of unregistered securities. Days later, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission filed a complaint against Binance, also over unregistered securities. Across the industry, there is a need for clarity around cryptocurrency regulation. This is in large part because US government officials themselves seemingly cannot decide how the space should be regulated, leaving key players in a constant state of limbo. The shifting regulatory landscape around cryptocurrency has frustrated developers, who are unsure what to expect from regulators. A proposed bill in the US House of Representatives seeks to create a centralised record of all off-chain cryptocurrency transactions where regulators can access all activity. This legislation could threaten the foundation that cryptocurrency was built on. By sending these mixed and sometimes hostile signals, the US government is limiting the innovative ecosystem the Web3 space needs to survive. 03:09 US company plans to use bitcoin mining to clean up coal waste US company plans to use bitcoin mining to clean up coal waste Following the latest regulatory moves from US lawmakers and officials, some Web3 leaders, cryptocurrency companies and blockchain developers feel they have no choice but to establish operations elsewhere. As it stands, the US will miss out on being a leader in the blockchain space. While the US has intensified its regulatory focus on the cryptocurrency space, Asia and Europe have taken steps to establish their own frameworks. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) has been approved by the European regulatory body. However, there is a significant barrier preventing this framework from going into effect in the immediate future. MiCA will apply across 27 European countries, but before it is a fully active framework, the regulatory authorities and governments in each of these countries still have work to do. Therefore, the goal of the MiCA framework going into effect by mid-2024 could be out of reach. Until the framework is fully fleshed out, cryptocurrency and blockchain companies must continue to err on the side of caution when setting up a base of operations within any European country. Even with the addition of MiCA and Switzerland’s innovative leadership in Europe, it still feels as though Asia will be the pivotal region for cryptocurrency in the next bull cycle. More blockchain companies in progressive regulatory markets such as Switzerland are looking to set up in the East. The Web3 talent pool in Asia is deep, and it is only getting deeper as developers flee the US in search of a safe haven. The US has lost 2 per cent market share in blockchain developers per year in the past five years, according to a recent report by Electric Capital. The other factor is the capital and appetite to invest. Reports show tech investment last year hit US$103.9 billion across China, India and Southeast Asia, with seed-stage investments a focus point for investors. Seed-stage investments in Southeast Asia alone increased by 73 per cent last year. Other reports project the value of Asia’s Web3 sector into the trillions of dollars. Hong Kong FinTech expo sees support for tokenisation as means to lift efficiency As for the cryptocurrency landscape in the Asia-Pacific, regulatory moves and clear guidelines have made the region one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency economy globally. For example, cryptocurrency firm Ripple recently secured an operating licence in Singapore, allowing its subsidiary to operate without transaction thresholds. The results of these moves speak for themselves, with Ripple saying that 90 per cent of the company’s business now comes from outside the US. Coinbase has had a public dispute with the SEC. Despite being a company that was developed, deployed and based in the US, Coinbase established an international exchange earlier this year and recently received a Major Payment Institution licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Brian Armstrong, co-founder and chief executive officer of Coinbase Inc, chats with Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, during the Singapore Fintech Festival, in Singapore, on November 4, 2022. Photo: Bloomberg In addition to Singapore, Hong Kong has also established licensing for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate in the city. This licence will lead to an inflow of retail traders from Hong Kong and other global jurisdictions, thus growing the cryptocurrency ecosystem further in not just the Asia-Pacific but the world. As the US continues to signal to the cryptocurrency space that it is not open for business, the choice for blockchain developers is increasingly to move operations into friendlier countries in the Asia-Pacific. Their progressive outlook has helped turn the region into one of the fastest-growing hubs for Web3 innovation, establishing Asian economies as the global leaders in the blockchain industry.

    "originBody": "Origin Protocol presents at Caracas Blockchain Week, showcases advancements in blockchain By Dalmas Ngetich November 16, 2023 at 6:56 am Edited by Dalmas Ngetich News Collect the article Share Link copied In October, Bitcoin (BTC) reached a nearly 17-month high. Meanwhile, Latin America appears to be positioning itself as a blockchain hub, with the industry valued at over $500 billion in 2022. Notably, in Mexico, the world’s second-largest recipient of foreign remittances, there is a surge in crypto payments. This shift has also been observed in various economies across Latin and South America, where blockchain and cryptocurrencies are seen as secure, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternatives to traditional financial systems. Caracas Blockchain Week, held from Oct. 24 to 28, served as a gathering for industry professionals, including pioneers, thought leaders, startup founders, investors, partners, and projects. The event featured workshops, a hackathon, and an interactive conference highlighting projects and platforms in blockchain. These discussions showcased the potential of both emerging and established blockchain initiatives.

There was also an emphasis on web3 adoption, providing a platform for a diverse audience, including new users, seasoned developers, industry decision-makers, and project leaders, to discuss developing a blockchain-based web3 future. Origin Protocol at Caracas Blockchain Week Origin Protocol participated in the event as a fully-fledged platform service. Founded in 2017, Origin focuses on developing products for the crypto industry’s growing areas, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (defi). Notable achievements include facilitating NFT sales, video tokenization, and collectible drops featuring figures like Paris Hilton. Origin has an experienced team, a global community, a platform-native governance token, and various investment, staking, and digital asset products. Its products, OETH and OUSD, are yield-bearing tokens that offer passive yield without staking lockups.

He said: “It’s always a pleasure to be surrounded by other enthusiasts from the web3 world, starting conversations, learning, and giving and receiving constructive feedback. At this year’s conference, we touched on the history of crypto, how it started, and how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains have contributed to the expansion of the blockchain space. Thanks to the super-interactive workshops, discussion panels, and brainstorming sessions, we’ve had a great time collaborating with experienced founders, community leaders, marketers, traders, and more. We look forward to working together toward a bright web3 future.” Understanding Origin Protocol With six years of development, Origin Protocol is deeply integrated into Ethereum’s ecosystem. Origin invented the yield-bearing stablecoin in 2019, attracting hundreds of millions of dollars of investment over the following years. In 2023, Origin used Origin Dollar’s codebase to launch a new yield-bearing token, Origin Ether (OETH). Similarly to OUSD, OETH earns passive yield for holders while keeping their funds always liquid. As an ether-pegged token, OETH tracks the price of Ethereum while making yield through liquid staking tokens and established DeFi strategies. By optimizing yield between stETH, rETH, frxETH, and defi strategies, OETH has delivered higher APYs than liquid staking since its inception. Origin Ether has gained over $80 million in TVL in six months.

    "originBody": "PayPal Takes a Stance and Says Blockchains Are the New Financial Rails The payments giant says blockchain technology offers a fundamentally new way to transact and that its stablecoin PYUSD is responding to customer needs. By: Camila Russo • Crypto News PayPal has made it clear: people want a better payments experience and crypto is the only technology that can deliver it. It also made clear that it's not backing down in the face of regulatory pressure. The payments giant said it's convinced blockchain is the new financial rail, and that stablecoins are the way to deliver the promise of crypto to the world. PayPal said its stance is not a fad, but a belief that this technology simply works better for moving money. \"Blockchain technology is the only technology that offers a fundamentally new way of doing payments,\" PayPal wrote on Mirror today. This rallying cry for crypto coms just two weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the company, requesting documentation on its PYUSD stablecoin. The fact that the open letter was posted on Mirror, which describes itself as \"the home for web3 publishing,\" is a signal on its own. Stablecoin Stance There's a gap in existing payment systems, as settlements take days, transactions are subject to closing hours and cross border payments are rife with friction, PayPal said. The firm argues blockchains can solve these problems as their settlement times are \"near instant to both a customer and a business — at any time, anywhere in the world.\" While PayPal says their position on crypto is neutral and that they \"have no ideological horse in this race,\" it takes a stance on stablecoins: It believes its customers \"want easier, faster, and cheaper payments,\" and that stabelcoins, and in PayPal's case, PYUSD, can fill that need. Companies can pay vendors swiftly, and individuals can transfer funds across borders, free from cost and time concerns. PayPal's PYUSD promises fast, cost-effective, and globally accessible payments, the company said. \"To say it another way, what we believe is simple: pay with crypto means pay how you want,\" PayPal wrote.

Morgan and Apollo in Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian. Axelar, Oasis Pro and Provenance Blockchain have collaborated with Onyx by J.P. Morgan and Apollo under the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s Project Guardian, to demonstrate how blockchain technology could be used to manage large-scale client portfolios, execute trades, and enable automated portfolio management of tokenized financial assets. Tokenizing fund management J.P. Morgan's Onyx Digital Assets team ran development of a proof-of-concept (POC) system in collaboration with Apollo, with the goal of enabling fund managers to tokenize funds onto their chosen blockchain, and to enable wealth managers to purchase and rebalance positions in tokenized assets across multiple, interconnected blockchains. The POC standardises processes to settle transactions on interoperable blockchains. Within the POC, Onyx Digital Assets leveraged the Axelar network to enable interoperability with a private and permissioned Provenance Blockchain Zone. Oasis Pro enabled the tokenization of assets, such as Apollo funds, on the Provenance Blockchain Zone. Officials from Onyx said that their goal is to create solutions that bring significant efficiencies and enable better outcomes for asset and wealth managers and investors through personalised, highly scalable portfolios, regardless of asset class or where those assets are managed and recorded. The interoperability achieved through Project Guardian is a step forward in showing how tokenized traditional and alternative investments can be automatically managed across multiple systems. Blockchain milestones and contributions to finance The POC, detailed in a report, is the latest step forward by J.P. Morgan’s Onyx Digital Assets and Apollo in advancing blockchain finance. In October 2023, Onyx Digital Assets executed a groundbreaking on-chain transaction to convert money-market shares into digital collateral for transfer between counterparties in an over-the-counter derivatives trade. In 2022, Apollo launched a digitally native investment vehicle to demonstrate how blockchain technology could support on-chain fund subscriptions, ongoing fund operations and fund administration for private funds. Provenance Blockchain, meanwhile, has supported over USD 16 billion in transactions, and currently has USD 9 billion in real-world financial asset value locked on-chain, including funds, loans, and private equity. Purpose-built for financial services, Provenance Blockchain is in use with more than 70 financial institutions and has played a key role in several financial-services firsts, including the first blockchain-native consumer loans, first asset-backed securitization on blockchain and the first bank-minted tokenized deposits in the United States. Axelar network connects 50+ chains over a decentralized cross-chain network that provides decentralized security and permissionless programmability. Increasingly, large enterprises are looking to Axelar network to integrate off-chain systems with on-chain networks, as well. For this POC, Axelar Inc. helped deploy private instances of the Axelar blockchain to meet requirements.

    "title": "Financial Firms Explores Blockchain Integration, Reveals Report",

    "originBody": "Departments Brokerage Buyside featured articles Technology Financial Firms Look Into Blockchain Integration, Finds Report By Anna Lyudvig - November 16, 2023 Share Tweet Share In recent months there has been an increasing number of financial institutions experimenting with blockchain technology, according to Pearl Imbach, BD Lead for Financial Institutions at Matter Labs. Pearl Imbach She said the most prominent use cases and benefits are tokenization, automating workflows using smart contracts and enhancing global interoperability. “The choice is almost always between a private blockchain, ensuring a permissioned environment, and a public Layer 1, allowing for interoperability and enhanced liquidity, most often the battle-tested Ethereum for its security, decentralization, and smart contract capabilities,” she said. “However, now there are options to have the best of both worlds: privacy and customization of your own app chain while enjoying the benefits of operating on a public network,” she added. On Wednesday, November 15, Matter Labs and a management consultancy Oliver Wyman, released a report that provides deep insights into the feasibility of public and private blockchain infrastructure for the financial services industry. The report titled, All Roads Lead to Rome, examines the evolving public and private blockchain landscape, and provides insights into the technological infrastructure, the sector’s challenges in terms of scalability, privacy and interoperability, and the innovative solutions developed over time for making blockchain integration into financial services impactful. “Our report explains more recent developments in blockchain technology and how they can unlock the future of on-chain finance,” commented Imbach. The report is inspired by the old adage, “All Roads Lead to Rome,” as the city ultimately served as a nexus of connectivity and commerce linked by a sophisticated network of roads. In the blockchain universe, both public and private domains reflect these foundational pathways, said Imbach. Though each brings unique challenges akin to different terrains, they all converge towards a shared vision: an interoperable and scalable ecosystem. Towards this vision, public and private blockchains serve different purposes today and offer distinct solutions to safeguarding privacy and enabling interoperability. Those financial institutions investing in blockchain and working on their infrastructure decisions can integrate the insights from this report, especially the articulation of the merits and constraints of various public and private blockchain solutions, into their assessment along with institution-specific roadmaps, preferences, constraints and risk parameters. Ugur Koyluoglu Ugur Koyluoglu, Partner and Global Head of Digital Assets at Oliver Wyman said there is still a lot of work ahead for the financial services industry. “Potential mass adoption with interoperable and scalable blockchains hinges on at least six essential advancements: enhanced privacy, digital identity management, prudent security, balanced governance structures, compatible protocols, and appropriate regulations,” he said. “In addition to the industry participants, regulators and public policy makers have to deepen their understanding of blockchain to foster innovation within safe-rails,” he added.

    "originBody": "Market NewsNovember 16, 2023 by Kelly Cromley PayPal Embraces Blockchain: PYUSD Takes Center Stage In a recent announcement, the global payments giant, PayPal, has emphatically asserted its commitment to revolutionizing the payments landscape through blockchain technology. Despite facing regulatory scrutiny, the company stands firm on its belief that blockchain presents a groundbreaking approach to transactions, with its stablecoin, PYUSD, positioned as a response to evolving customer demands. Blockchain: A Paradigm Shift in Payments: PayPal has declared that blockchain technology represents a transformative departure from traditional payment methods. In an official statement on Mirror, the platform it chose for this declaration, the company asserts that blockchain is not merely a passing trend but an enduring conviction that it offers superior efficiency in facilitating financial transactions. Regulatory Challenges Amidst Conviction: This resounding endorsement of crypto comes on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issuing a subpoena to PayPal, seeking documentation related to its PYUSD stablecoin. Despite this regulatory pressure, PayPal remains undeterred in its pursuit of a blockchain-driven financial future. Addressing Payment System Gaps: PayPal highlights existing inadequacies in current payment systems, emphasizing prolonged settlement periods, time restrictions on transactions, and the complexities surrounding cross-border payments. The company contends that blockchains, with their near-instant settlement capabilities, provide a solution that transcends geographical and temporal constraints. Neutral Stance on Crypto, Firm Stand on Stablecoins: While maintaining a neutral stance on cryptocurrencies in general, PayPal takes a definitive position on stablecoins. The company asserts that its customers demand a seamless, expeditious, and cost-effective payment experience. In this context, PayPal sees stablecoins, particularly its own PYUSD, as the means to fulfill these customer expectations. PYUSD: Enabling Swift, Cost-effective Global Transactions: According to PayPal, PYUSD is tailored to meet the needs of both businesses and individuals. The stablecoin facilitates rapid vendor payments for companies and enables individuals to transfer funds across borders without the encumbrances of time and cost. PayPal envisions PYUSD as the embodiment of fast, economical, and globally accessible payments. Conclusion: In conclusion, PayPal’s unyielding embrace of blockchain technology and its steadfast promotion of PYUSD as a stablecoin reflect a strategic response to the evolving landscape of customer preferences and demands. Despite regulatory challenges, the company remains resolute in its belief that blockchain is the future of financial transactions, offering a paradigm shift that aligns with the desires of its user base for enhanced payment experiences.",

The new tool, announced Wednesday (Nov. 14), employs blockchain infrastructure to price and perform bilateral spot FX trades, and was developed for the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) Project Guardian, a collaborative initiative by the MAS and the financial industry. The application, thus far not available to clients, tested trades involving the U.S. dollar and Singapore’s dollar, though the underlying solution “could be used for any fiat currency pair,” Citi said in a news release. “Citi’s on-chain solution provides real-time streaming of price quotes while recording trade executions on a blockchain, which supports the immutable, cryptographically secure record-keeping of trade data,” the release said. “At the same time, allowing for compliance and conformity with institutional practices and where applicable regulatory requirements, with only counterparties to a quote or trade having access to the underlying trade details,” the release added. Shobhit Maini, Citi’s co-head of digital assets for markets, noted that although blockchains have shown promise in streamlining post-trade processes, the bank’s goal “is to drive improvement at all stages of the trade life cycle, including pre-trade and execution.” Citi worked with T. Rowe Price Associates and Fidelity International on the application, the release said. “Developing user-friendly institutional grade execution is key to future scalability,” said Blue Macellari, head of digital asset strategy at T. Rowe Price. “This application is an important first step towards unlocking the value of a full end-to-end blockchain based trading lifecycle.” Project Guardian follows another initiative the MAS took part in recently, dubbed Project Mariana. Working with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and central banks of Switzerland and France, the groups announced last month that they had completed a test of wholesale CBDCs (wCBDCs) — with a focus on FX. In a paper detailing its findings, the BIS and the central banks stated that the benefits of CBDCs “include supporting simple and automated execution of FX transactions, providing options to broaden the range of currencies, eliminating settlement risk and enabling transparency.” As noted here in October, PYMNTS Intelligence has shown that 27% of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) view the complexity of cross-border payments as a roadblock to their ability to grow, while just 23% of SMBs said their current cross-border payment solutions were very or extremely satisfactory. “That leaves three-quarters of respondents noting that the solutions they have in place fall short in terms of what they need to manage their business’ cross-market flows,” PYMNTS wrote.
