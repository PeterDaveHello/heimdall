    "originBody": "BRAYDEN LINDREA 13 HOURS AGO Bitcoiners pitch draft bill to preserve blockchain, decentralization in Argentina The group, “Bitcoin Argentina,” previously rejected the idea that regulation was needed in the cryptocurrency industry. 4490 Total views 7 Total shares Listen to article 0:00 NEWS Join us on social networks Non-government organization Bitcoin Argentina presented a draft bill proposing to regulate the cryptocurrency market in a way that preserves decentralization and strengthens public trust. The proposed legal framework was pitched by Bitcoin Argentina's president Ricardo Mihura at LABITCONF 2023 in Argentina’s capital, Buenos Aires on Nov. 10. Bitcoin Argentina previously dismissed the idea that the industry needed to be regulated. However, the Bitcoin advocates now argue it is necessary to not only preserve blockchain but also hold bad actors accountable to the fullest extent of the law. “We have always rejected attempts to regulate the crypto economy, but this time we set ourselves the goal of giving a positive response, with only two purposes: preserving decentralization and protecting savings and public trust.” Mihura added: “We cannot close our eyes to the number of dishonest actors and projects that circulate with the blockchain brand.” Ricardo Mihura speaking at the cryptocurrency regulation panel at LABITCONF 2023. Source: LABITCONF. The first article of the legal framework focuses on separating cryptocurrency platforms and service providers into three categories to ascertain property rights — decentralized, local centralized or willing to dialogue with authorities, and global centralized. Platforms that fall under one of the two centralized categories would be allowed to operate freely, but its customers would be granted “the broadest possible judicial protection,” guaranteeing the right to claim damages in the event of a company downfall. It is understood that Argentina’s judiciary will not intervene on failures from decentralized platforms. Courts will decide whether or not a cryptocurrency platform is sufficiently decentralized when resolving claims put forward by allegedly injured customers. Related: Argentina's central bank halts cryptocurrencies from payment apps Mihura stressed that imposing an outright ban on cryptocurrencies — which some governments have tried to do — simply wouldn’t work given the global nature of blockchain: “Not even the United States can effectively prohibit the operation of the unlicensed cryptoeconomy [...] Argentina has no possibility of prohibiting its residents from operating in global environments [so] we believe that it does not make sense to propose a top-down ban and we choose to propose the best that the law can offer to its citizens.” “This includes those directly responsible and all those who profit in the marketing chain of a fraud, until the final victim,” Mihura added. Blockchain Argentina’s proposed bill comes one week ahead of Argentina’s presidential run-off election between Sergio Massa, the country’s economy minister and Javier Milei, an economist turned politician who wants to abolish Argentina’s central bank and adopt the United States dollar. Argentina is currently battling an inflation crisis. Over the last 12 months, the country has recorded the fourth largest annual inflation rate in the world at 121.7%.

    "originBody": "We Are/Getty Images Redeem now The rise of Treasury yields since 2022 has delivered a major boost to the tokenization of real-world assets. The total value of on-chain, real-world assets sits at $118.6 billion, according to Fundstrat. \"It's becoming increasingly likely that blockchains can become the back-end infrastructure for almost every asset class.\" Advertisement Advertisement The breathless rise of Treasury yields since 2022 has delivered a major boost to the tokenization of real-world assets. With US bonds paying 5% recently, investment firms like Franklin Templeton have issued more government securities on the blockchain. \"The rising interest rates over the past year has been big,\" Tom Couture, a Fundstrat analyst, told Insider, noting that yields in decentralized finance previously were much higher than for US bonds. \"But obviously over the past year and a half, rates have gone up and you get a risk-free 5% on US Treasurys. So demand has gone up.\" And it's not just Treasurys. There is a growing momentum around packaging commodities, currencies and investment funds into tokens and adding them to the blockchain. Advertisement Advertisement Right now, the total value of on-chain, real-world assets sits at $118.6 billion, according to Fundstrat. But experts say that number is expected to explode. Boston Consulting Group offered what it called a \"highly conservative\" forecast of $16 trillion by 2030, with a bullish scenario putting it at $68 trillion. That's still a long ways away from the total market value of real-world assets, which Fundstrat estimates is more than $992 trillion. But big banks are also jumping in. In October, JPMorgan went live with its Tokenized Collateral Network — a system that allowed BlackRock to tokenize one of its money market funds and transfer it to Barclays in a derivatives trade. Advertisement Advertisement And the global banking network SWIFT is also building a blockchain-based system for financial transactions with the tech company Chainlink. Perks of tokenization To be sure, tokenization is not new. ETFs and REITs are earlier examples putting assets into a package – or a token. But the tokenization of real-world assets onto the blockchain is a newer trend that's picking up steam. That's because investors see a lot of benefits. For one, it helps assets become a lot more liquid. When an asset is tokenized, it allows for fractionalization — divvying up that token into smaller pieces — which improves affordability. Advertisement Advertisement Also, a token on the blockchain can be traded 24 hours a day instead of the seven and a half hours on a typical stock exchange. Blockchain trades also have faster transaction speeds. \"It's becoming increasingly likely that blockchains can become the back-end infrastructure for almost every asset class,\" Couture wrote in a recent Fundstrat note. Obstacles to tokenization One reason that the tokenization trend hasn't leapt even further is because the market is very fragmented, according to Lee Bratcher, president of he Texas Blockchain Council. For example, tokenized government securities are available on various platforms instead of one centralized exchange. Advertisement Advertisement \"What we really need to happen for the tokenization of real world assets to take off is for an entity that has the requisite licenses to really become a national securities exchange like the CME for commodities or Nasdaq for stocks,\" he said. Bratcher said he doesn't know of efforts to accomplish this, but he sees a national exchange forming in as soon as three years. Whenever it happens, it could mark the next step in the evolution of finance. \"It's a huge paradigm shift in how finance is facilitated,\" Couture from Fundstrat said. \"At first you had analogue, a lot of paper. Then we moved into the digital age with computers and excel and digital ledgers. I think this is likely the next step where you have everything on transparent blockchain rails.\" Read next MI Exclusive tokenization tokenize traditional assets More... Advertisement",

If you encounter any issues, kindly report them to support@finbold.com. Crypto assets/products can be highly risky. Never invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. eTukTuk’s Radical Electric Vehicle Solution Combines AI and Blockchain Tech Press Releases Nov 12, 2023 Confronting one of our most urgent challenges, the battle against climate change necessitates leveraging every viable solution at our disposal. eTukTuk (TUK), driven by crypto and blockchain technology, is actively playing a role in this fight by introducing an innovative approach targeted at the electric tuk-tuk sector. Here, we delve into the precise ways in which eTukTuk is contributing to the fight against climate change. We also tell you about the staking mechanism and the increasingly popular TUK presale. eTukTuk is Technology At Its Best eTukTuk (TUK) leverages blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency asset to establish an ecosystem dedicated to mitigating carbon emissions by advocating for eco-friendly transportation options, specifically Electric Vehicles (EVs). This plays a crucial role in driving the essential shift towards widespread EV adoption. Furthermore, the system offers substantial advantages to all stakeholders, with drivers anticipating a notable increase in earnings. As an end user, you will also reap the benefits of a reduced carbon footprint. At the core of this initiative is the eTukTuk EV, providing a more cost-effective and reliable alternative to traditional TukTuks. Its operations rely on an efficient charging infrastructure. The commendable achievements and milestones of eTukTuk underscore its significant potential. The project has been steadily gaining recognition and solidifying its position as a global success story. In the near future, a new feature set to launch is a Play-to-Earn game reminiscent of Crazy Taxi, allowing users to efficiently pick up and drop off passengers while navigating traffic and ensuring their batteries remain fully charged. Naturally, participants will have the opportunity to earn TUK tokens through this engaging activity. eTukTuk has seamlessly integrated Layer 2 opBNB from the BNB Chain into its operations. This strategic move exemplifies eTukTuk’s dedication to advancing efficiency and innovation, offering compelling opportunities for early adopters in the cryptocurrency realm. The decision to implement the Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus method on the BNB Chain, a network experiencing substantial growth in 2023, drove this transition. In terms of ecosystem growth, eTukTuk made a significant impact through its partnership with The Capital Maharaja Group, a prominent conglomerate in Sri Lanka with a robust presence in various private sector enterprises and over 44 international collaborations. Through this collaboration, The Capital Maharaja Group acquired a 20% equity stake in eTukTuk’s Sri Lankan operations. eTukTuk and the Sri Lankan government are also collaborating. With official endorsement, this partnership aims to establish over 200 charging station locations, providing significant benefits for motorists. Drivers are anticipated to experience a remarkable 400% reduction in operating costs compared to using TukTuks powered by fossil fuels. Check Out eTukTuk TUK Presale Not One To Miss Out On Wake-up call: Climate scientists have been raising the alarm on climate change.#ClimateAction pic.twitter.com/s6JRiCsoyD — eTukTuk (@eTukTukio) October 15, 2023 Before delving into the specifics of the presale, it’s important to note that eTukTuk has implemented a buy-and-stake mechanism, currently boasting an impressive Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 1,356%. Naturally, the earlier one participates, the higher the potential APY, underscoring the importance of early involvement. Currently, the reward per block stands at 4.75 BSC. The TUK token’s presale phase has witnessed remarkable success, and the community is eagerly anticipating news regarding its upcoming exchange listing. The token is presently priced at $0.0245 during the presale, having raised approximately $161,000 thus far. There are only 8 days remaining until the next stage of the presale. Throughout this presale period, a substantial 40% community discount is available for a limited time, offering a valuable opportunity to acquire more TUK tokens. It’s crucial to bear in mind that both the token and the project are driven by a noble mission: “to permanently eliminate carbon emissions from our planet!” Despite this ambitious goal, the project demonstrates genuine dedication to environmental preservation. The TUK token plays a pivotal role in conferring benefits to users as the network of efficient charging stations expands. The team emphasizes that this impact extends beyond environmental benefits, also positively affecting underprivileged communities grappling with financial disparities and high living costs. The development of the TUK token holds paramount importance for the growth of the eTukTuk network. The ecosystem operates by charging drivers a fee for utilizing their cars, thereby generating network revenue. Furthermore, territorial partners and power stakers receive TUK tokens with each processed transaction. This scalable approach facilitates the global expansion of the network and supports a transition away from fossil fuels, both locally and on a broader scale. The team’s unwavering commitment to making a substantial impact is evident in the significant and successful solution they have devised to combat carbon emissions. This dedication is recognized and esteemed by external parties as well. Conclusion For those aspiring to make a positive difference in the world, exploring eTukTuk is highly recommended. The project is dedicated to enhancing our lives in various ways, benefiting not only the environment but also the drivers and all other stakeholders in the ecosystem. Don’t miss out on checking both the TUK presale and eTukTuk’s social channels for more information. Check Out eTukTuk",

    "originBody": "home news Business Crypto funding: A16z bets on blockchain infrastructure The tech VC participated in rounds for two infrastructure projects that went through a16z’s crypto startup school this summer by Jack Kubinec / November 11, 2023 03:00 pm Suriyawut Suriya/Shutterstock modified by Blockworks share This week, venture fund a16z joined two crypto funding rounds. This follows recent reports from Axios indicating a delay in Andreessen’s upcoming crypto investment initiatives to 2025. Both rounds centered on blockchain infrastructure ventures. A16z led a $4.2 million seed round for Pimlico, an infrastructure product working to let wallet developers abstract away parts of the payment process. In a blog post announcing the raise, a16z general partner Sriram Krishnan said Pimlico CEO Kristof Gazso participated in the venture firm’s crypto startup school in Los Angeles. “By the end of Crypto Startup School, we were convinced that no one was better equipped to build the supporting infrastructure for account abstraction than Kristof,” Krishnan wrote. The use of Pimlico’s form of account abstraction has increased for four straight months, according to data from 1confirmation general partner Richard Chen. A16z also participated in a $5.5 million seed round for the developer tool Stackr. Stackr built a software development kit (SDK) to let developers build Web3 apps using general-programming languages — starting with JavaScript. Stackr lets developers create “micro-rollups,” the platform’s term for rollups that separate execution and proving. This design prioritizes ease of development over decentralization, adapting rollup technology to better suit developers’ needs. Stackr also participated in a16z’s 2023 crypto startup school. These two investments mark a16z crypto’s return to backing blockchain infrastructure startups. Their last similar move was in LayerZero’s $120 million round in April, according to CryptoRank. Meanwhile, Lightspeed Faction announced its $285 million crypto venture fund this week, telling Blockworks that Faction is primarily interested in infrastructure and protocol level projects. A16z did not return a request for comment. Other notable recent ventures from the megafund include a restaurant rewards app and a Web3 gaming studio.

The round was led by Archetype with participation from Accomplice and Robot Ventures. In a blog post announcing the fundraise and the company, Ritual highlighted that the crypto space is already working to address key challenges for AI startups, such as centralized APIs, closed-source code and high computational costs. Ritual hopes to launch its platform in early 2024 with a focus on letting AI preserve transparency and privacy. The project is advised by the founders of NEAR Protocol and Eigenlayer. Ritual’s raise comes the same week as OpenAI’s DevDay conference and shortly after X debuted its own chatbot, Grok. Other notable fundraises The governance tooling platform Llama raised $6 million from Founders Fund and Electric Capital to develop its full stack platform that lets governance permissions be doled out more precisely.

    "originLink": "https://www.nationthailand.com/business/tech/40032778",
    "originBody": "Thammasat’s new blockchain-based voting platform proves to be safe and tamper-free SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2023 SHARE Listen Loading... Thammasat University’s blockchain-based voting platform, which won an award from the House Secretariat, has been adopted by several savings cooperatives after proving to be successful in 2019. The ThaiVote.io was first used for the election of the board of directors of Surat Thani’s Public Health Saving Cooperative. After its initial success, Thammasat landed a contract to hold an election for the cooperative every year. The platform, the development of which kicked off in 2017, was funded by the Physical Education Department and developed by the university’s Centre of Intellectual Property and Business Incubator. Prof Dr Arnat Leemakdej, director of the Intellectual Property Centre, said the platform helped not just speed up the election process of the Surat Thani cooperative but also reduced the cost. He said that previously, the cooperative used 30 polling booths, some of which were on islands, and vote counting became difficult. Also, many members of the cooperative, who are nurses and medical personnel, could not cast their votes due to work commitments. However, he said, with this platform, everybody can cast their votes and results can be released very quickly. Arnat said the ThaiVote.io was different from other electronic voting systems, that normally use a central base and servers. He said systems like this have a problem with transparency, as admins can tamper with the results and systems can be hacked. On the other hand, Thammasat’s blockchain system stores encrypted data, which is then split among other public blockchain centres. Arnat said once information is stored in a blockchain node, it cannot be altered, so the level of safety and trustworthiness is very high. “Blockchain-based systems prevent attacks and interference with results,” he added. He also said that each vote cast is confidential and the result can be learned soon after the voting is closed. A list of eligible voters, candidates and start and stop of voting times are preset in the system, which starts automatically at the correct time. Eligible voters can then cast their vote via their smartphones or even notebook computers after identifying themselves with a one-time password (OTP), face scan or ID card. Once the voting ends, the system will process the data and announce the results within 15 minutes. So far, he said, the system has been adopted by the savings cooperatives of the Justice Ministry, CAT Telecom and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives. The platform won the university an award from the House Secretariat in June this year. TU rector Kesinee Withoonchart said the platform had been developed with the goal of serving society and the university hopes it will be more widely adopted.
