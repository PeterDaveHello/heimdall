The legislation aims to prohibit federal government officials from conducting business with Chinese blockchain companies. The act would ban government employees from using the underlying networks of Chinese blockchain or cryptocurrency trading platforms. Furthermore, it would explicitly forbid U.S. government officials from engaging in transactions with iFinex, the parent company of USDT issuer Tether. In addition to iFinex, the CLARITY Act would prohibit officials from conducting transactions with the Spartan Network, the Conflux Network and Red Date Technology. In a statement on Wednesday, the lawmakers said that the legislation, if passed, would ensure the nation’s “foreign adversaries … do not have a backdoor to access critical national security intelligence and Americans’ private information.” Screenshot of the CLARITY Act of 2023. Source: nunn.house.gov Tether was reported to have been exposed to Chinese securities and other Chinese firms earlier in 2023. On June 16, several news sources, including Bloomberg, disclosed that the company previously held securities from Chinese state-owned firms. Bloomberg referred to documents released by the New York Attorney General and emphasized that deposits from entities like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China supported Tether (USDT). This revelation follows years of inquiry and concern about the assets backing Tether’s stablecoin. Tether’s reserves include substantial short-term loans to Chinese firms and a significant loan to the cryptocurrency platform Celsius Network. Tether had previously denied any involvement with the debt of China’s troubled Evergrande Group but had not revealed its holdings of other Chinese securities. Related: Tether issues $610M debt financing to Bitcoin miner Northern Data Further, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is also closely monitoring Tether’s operations. In September, a report suggested that the company secretly began offering USDT stablecoin loans to customers a year after it pledged to cease providing secured loans. As the bill’s sponsors state, the latest move underscores Washington’s growing concerns about Chinese connections within the cryptocurrency sector.

    "originLink": "https://www.ledgerinsights.com/us-bill-chinese-blockchains-tether-ban/",
    "originBody": "Legal and IP • News • Technology Media Telecoms US Bill wants to ban Chinese blockchains, Tether and its parent 2 hours ago by Ledger Insights Representatives Zach Nunn (Republican) and Abigail Spanberger (Democrat) tabled a Bill that aims to protect the United States from the blockchain activities of “China and other foreign adversaries”. It also includes defending the status of the dollar. This might be why iFinex, the parent of the largest stablecoin Tether is on the list. The Bill primarily prevents any government spending associated with the listed networks. Spanberger previously worked for the CIA and is a member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. And Nunn is on a Financial Services subcommittee that covers national security and illicit finance. “Within the next decade, every American will have sensitive, private data stored using blockchain technology,” said Rep. Nunn. “China’s heavy investment in this infrastructure poses a colossal national security and data privacy problem. If we don’t act now, this will be a disaster 1,000 times worse than China’s ownership of TikTok.” Apart from banning government involvement, the legislation requests a report on actors in the blockchain and DLT sectors. It requires “A description of what harms such countries, proxies, firms, and technologies cause to United States interests and sanctions enforcement, the use of the United States dollar, and international anti money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism standards.” They also ask for an impact assessment on the status of the dollar as the world reserve currency. The Chinese blockchain connection Apart from iFinex, the four other listed networks are the Blockchain-based Services Network (BSN), its international sister the BSN Spartan Network, Hong Kong’s Red Date Technology (a co-founder of BSN and Spartan) and the Conflux Network. BSN is a Chinese multi blockchain network that aims to provide SMEs affordable access to blockchain services. China’s State Information Center (SIC) initiated the platform along with Red Date, China Mobile and China UnionPay. Red Date is a common denominator between BSN and Spartan, which aims to be independently governed in Singapore. After relocating from China to Hong Kong, Red Date received a $30 million funding round two years ago led by a subsidiary of Saudi Aramco. Other backers are from Hong Kong, Thailand and “clients” of Switzerland’s Pictet bank. Red Date responded in a statement saying “The BSN Spartan Network is completely open source and we welcome agencies from the US or any government to review the source code and make their own conclusions about the technology.” It highlighted the governing foundation has members from the USA, Asia and Europe. And that Red Date has an equal vote to other members. That said, Red Date is the original architect and the network’s primary driver. Red Date is also launching the UDPN, an international payments network that uses blockchain. The Bill didn’t mention the UDPN. While BSN and Spartan use public blockchain technology, they don’t use cryptocurrencies in line with China’s stance. In contrast, the Conflux Network does. In various press announcements Conflux has touted itself as “the first regulatory compliant public blockchain in China”. Conflux worked with State-owned China Telecom to create a Blockchain SIM (BSIM) card that stores private keys for a blockchain wallet. The intention of using the SIM is to make it less vulnerable to malware. Some believe any news is good if it raises a company’s profile. Conflux’s coin rose by 6% on the news, although it has since lost some of the ground. It currently has a market capitalization of more than $600 million.

    "originBody": "Blockchain + FOLLOW Get more with myNEWS A personalised news feed of stories that matter to you Learn more Two US House lawmakers are looking to block government use of Chinese blockchain. Photo: Shutterstock TechPolicy US lawmakers target Chinese blockchains BSN, Conflux in bill that brings tech decoupling to Web3 Two US House representatives introduced a bill barring executive agencies from contracting with China-based blockchain firms The Blockchain-based Service Network and Conflux Network distanced their international operations from China, inviting people to examine their code Xinmei Shen and Orange Wang Published: 9:30pm, 9 Nov, 2023 Why you can trust SCMP US lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Wednesday aimed at barring federal agencies from using China-developed blockchain networks or doing business with related companies. The bill Creating Legal Accountability for Rogue Innovators and Technology (Clarity) Act, introduced by House Representatives Zach Nunn and Abigail Spanberger, prohibits the heads of executive-branch agencies from purchasing or signing new contracts for blockchain systems and services reliant on certain China-based firms. It also bars government officials from lending or granting funds for transactions to such technology providers. As examples of “foreign adversarial” distributed ledgers, the bill explicitly lists the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) and the network’s IT infrastructure service Spartan Network, along with its Hong Kong-based tech provider Red Date Technology. Blockchain firm Conflux Network and iFinex, owner of Hong Kong-based Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin, are also named. Company behind China’s Blockchain Service Network wants a Swift for stablecoins BSN is among blockchain companies that “pose risks to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States”, the lawmakers said. They called on government agencies to regularly conduct risk assessments on the named blockchain services. BSN was founded in 2020 by a consortium consisting of Red Date, state-owned telecommunications giant China Mobile, bank-card clearing service UnionPay, and China’s State Information Centre, a government think tank under the National Development and Reform Commission. The initiative’s main goal is to push the adoption of blockchain in enterprise IT systems without the involvement of cryptocurrencies. While operating an enterprise-facing blockchain infrastructure service in China, BSN last year also made a major push overseas with the launch of the Spartan Network, targeting businesses outside mainland China. The BSN Spartan Network is “an application-agnostic infrastructure” used to serve traditional IT systems, and is “completely open source”, Tim Bailey, Red Date’s vice-president of global business and operations, said in a written statement to the Post. “We welcome agencies from the US or any government to review the source code and make their conclusions about the technology,” he said. Red Date, the technology provider of the Blockchain-based Service Network, has distanced the network’s international operations from China. Photo: Red Date Technology The BSN and Conflux both leaned on their open code and governance structures to distance their international operations from the country of their founding. Bailey noted that the BSN Foundation, which governs the Spartan Network, is based in Singapore with members from the US, Europe and Asia. It is “completely separate” from the BSN networks in mainland China, he said, adding that Hong Kong-based Red Date is just one BSN Foundation member with a vote equal to that of any other member. Conflux Foundation co-founder and president Fan Long also took to X, formerly Twitter, to defend his blockchain. “Capitol Hill’s got that US-China drama on repeat,” Long wrote. “Sure, we are regulatory compliant in China, but that does not imply any governmental control.” The BSN has previously raised hackles in Washington. In 2021, Yaya Fanusie, an adjunct senior fellow at the Centre for New American Security, told the congressional US-China Economic and Security Review Commission that BSN’s ambitions to develop a new internet infrastructure “will go to building a world vulnerable to the particular sensibilities of the [Chinese Communist Party]”. “Within the next decade, every American will have sensitive, private data stored using blockchain technology,” Nunn, an Iowan Republican, said in a statement issued on Wednesday. “Our bipartisan bill ensures that the federal government is not giving China a back door to access critical national security intelligence and Americans’ private information.” Spanberger, a Virginian Democrat, said in the release that Beijing’s investment “in a state-controlled blockchain network poses significant risks to US data security”. “The United States must have a plan in place to keep US data out of the hands of our adversaries,” she said. The bill directs the US Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress actionable recommendations to address blockchain risks and to assess risks that include circumventing the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment messaging system and impact on countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative. “The call in the bill to assess what the impact and harm might be is good in general,” Fanusie told the Post. “It’s a signal for the US to be more informed about the evolution of the internet and how different parties are vying for leadership in new infrastructure.” Neither of the bill’s sponsors holds leadership roles on Capitol Hill, nor do they have key roles in any committees, giving the bill tough odds on making it to a vote. But it does reflect the continued interest in Congress to curtail the use of any China-linked technology, as evidenced by recent tensions over TikTok. Observers see a bipartisan consensus today in Washington on the wisdom of adopting a more competitive approach to dealing with China to defend economic and security interests. “While we must ensure that our trade policies are fair, the United States will also prioritise economic and national security, including protecting advanced technologies,” US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a press conference last month during his visit to China. Still, he added that “we do not seek a confrontation with China”. Additional reporting by Matt Haldane Post",

In a blog post on Nov. 9, Immutable said it will help the Paris-headquartered gaming company develop a “new gaming experience” that will unlock the “potential of web3.” Although no details were given, Immutable CEO and co-founder James Ferguson said in a statement to news outlets that with the collaboration, gamers will get “digital ownership,” suggesting Ubisoft did not abandon its plans for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) even though the company had faced backlash from customers before.

    "originBody": "Market NewsNovember 9, 2023 by Kelly Cromley Bitkub Chain Unveils Ambitious Plans to Become Thailand’s Leading Blockchain Ecosystem Bitkub Chain, Thailand’s leading blockchain network, has unveiled a bold roadmap for 2024, with a focus on becoming the foundational pillar for the national blockchain ecosystem. At the recent 3rd Bitkub Chain Developer Meet-Up (BKCDM), the company shared its vision for the future, which includes a number of key initiatives, including: The launch of Bitkub NEXT 2.0, a major user experience overhaul that will consolidate functions and decentralized applications (dApps) to make navigating the ecosystem more intuitive. The development of Bitkub NFT 2.0 and the Bitkub Metaverse Mobile Version, both of which will receive major updates aimed at enriching user engagement and opening up new dimensions of the digital experience. The expansion of Bitkub Chain’s global reach through listings on various digital asset trading centers. The introduction of the BKC Developer Pitch initiative, a program that incentivizes developers with potential digital coin rewards to build projects that enhance the Bitkub Chain landscape. These initiatives, together with Bitkub Chain’s existing achievements, such as the transition from Proof-Of-Stake-Authority to Proof-Of-Stake and the integration of KUB coin across seven major digital asset trading platforms, demonstrate the company’s commitment to building a robust and inclusive blockchain ecosystem in Thailand. Analysis: Bitkub Chain’s ambitious plans for 2024 are a significant development for the Thai blockchain sector. The company’s focus on user experience, innovation, and global expansion is well-aligned with the needs of the growing blockchain community in Thailand and beyond. The launch of Bitkub NEXT 2.0, in particular, has the potential to make Bitkub Chain’s ecosystem more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of users. The integration of NFT-1155 support and the introduction of NEXT Credit are also notable additions that could help Bitkub Chain to differentiate itself from other blockchain platforms. The development of Bitkub NFT 2.0 and the Bitkub Metaverse Mobile Version are also significant steps forward. The NFT market is booming, and Bitkub Chain is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. The Bitkub Metaverse, in particular, has the potential to be a major draw for users, providing a new and immersive way to interact with the digital world. Bitkub Chain’s expansion plans are also noteworthy. The listing of KUB coin on major digital asset trading centers will give the token a global reach and make it more accessible to investors. The BKC Developer Pitch initiative is also a positive development, as it will help to attract top-tier developers to the Bitkub Chain ecosystem. Overall, Bitkub Chain’s roadmap for 2024 is ambitious but achievable. If the company is able to successfully execute on its plans, it could become the leading blockchain ecosystem in Thailand and play a major role in the development of the Thai digital economy.",

    "originBody": "Forkast News Grassroots crypto adoption to follow real-world use cases, says Chainalysis APAC policy lead Read full article 1 Will Fee Thu, November 9, 2023 at 5:30 AM EST·3 min read Real-world use cases are essential for crypto adoption globally and the Asia Pacific region is emerging as a key driver for innovative blockchain applications, said Chengyi Ong, head of APAC policy at blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, on Thursday. During an online webinar covering aspects of the Chainalysis 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency report, Ong spoke about growing digital asset use in south and central Asian countries such as India and Vietnam, where crypto adoption is outpacing other regions. Much of this growth, Ong said, is driven by real-world use cases such as blockchain-based gaming, remittances and as a protection of value against currency volatility. “What the data tells us is that, where fundamental drivers are strong and where digital assets have real-world value to offer, adoption will follow in some way, shape or form,” she added. Ong and Chainalysis research director Kim Grauer, who led the webinar, spoke about the popularity of cricket-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in India and the Axie Infinity blockchain game developed by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis as examples of widely used commercial applications that have onboarded users onto crypto. The popularity of these blockchain-based apps and services “brings on a whole new cohort of users who are then now native to crypto,” Grauer said. It is those kinds of “innovation use cases” that are “going to drive the next wave of people coming on board,” she added. The 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency report argues that, while there’s no way of “sugarcoating” the fact that crypto adoption globally is now considerably lower than at its peak during the second quarter of 2021, low-to-middle income countries (LMIs) are an exception. See related article: ‘There’s no doubt we picked a side here’ — Chainalysis founder Michael Gronager talks analytics, Ukraine and crypto adoption in Asia That bracket includes APAC nations such as Pakistan and India and makes up some 40% of the world’s population. In terms of crypto adoption, LMIs are now back to “pre-FTX levels,” Grauer said. Story continues The collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange in November 2022 sent shockwaves throughout the digital asset industry, leading to a US$2 trillion loss to the market. Crypto adoption has since fallen significantly in both high and low income nations, Grauer said, with many high income nations reacting to the FTX collapse with increased regulatory scrutiny. The increased level of crypto adoption in LMIs is “extremely promising,” Chainalysis’ report suggests, particularly as uptake in LMIs develops in tandem with growing institutional interest in crypto in high income countries. “We could see a combination of bottom-up and top-down cryptocurrency adoption in the near future if these trends hold, as digital assets fulfill the unique needs of participants in both segments,” the report argues. New York-based blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis was co-founded in 2014 by Michael Gronager, a former executive at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. The company is backed by some of the biggest names in finance, including investment banks Blackstone and Bank of New York Mellon, and was valued at US$8.6 billion at its most recent funding round in 2022. However, the firm has since gone through two rounds of layoffs, including around 150 staff at the start of October. Chainalysis’s method for measuring crypto adoption weighs total crypto activity for a country by its purchasing power, producing a comparative metric that takes into account national income levels and population size. In an index of countries ranked according to this metric, India scored highest, with Nigeria second and eight Asia Pacific countries making up the top 20. TRENDING 1.

    "originBody": "How Layer 2 Networks Enhance The Blockchain Industry Blockchain News November 8, 2023 by Diana Ambolis No Comments Share Tweet Share Share Pin it Blockchain technology has made significant strides in recent years, gaining attention for its potential to disrupt industries and revolutionize traditional systems. However, as adoption grows, scalability and efficiency issues have become apparent. This is where Layer 2 (L2) networks come into play. In this article, we’ll explore what Layer 2 networks are, why they are essential, and how they enhance the blockchain industry. Understanding Layer 2 Networks Layer 2 networks are a type of secondary infrastructure built on top of existing blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin. They aim to address the scalability and performance limitations of these networks while maintaining the security and decentralization that make blockchains attractive in the first place. Layer 2 solutions can be thought of as a way to offload some of the transaction processing from the primary blockchain. Key Benefits of Layer 2 Networks Scalability: One of the most significant challenges facing blockchain networks is their limited transaction throughput. Layer 2 networks offer a solution by processing transactions off-chain or in a more efficient manner, significantly increasing the network’s capacity. This scalability is crucial for blockchain applications to handle a larger number of users and transactions. Speed and Lower Costs: Layer 2 networks can process transactions more quickly and at a fraction of the cost compared to on-chain transactions. This makes microtransactions and other low-value transfers feasible, opening up new use cases for blockchain technology. Reduced Congestion: With the ability to handle a higher volume of transactions, Layer 2 networks alleviate congestion on the primary blockchain. This, in turn, results in faster confirmation times and lower fees for on-chain transactions. Enhanced Privacy: Some Layer 2 solutions provide improved privacy features by conducting transactions off-chain. This can be beneficial for applications where privacy is a critical concern, such as financial transactions or data sharing. Interoperability: Layer 2 networks can be designed to be interoperable with multiple blockchains, allowing assets to move seamlessly between different networks. This interoperability is vital for the growth of the blockchain ecosystem. Also, read – What Is A Layer 2 Blockchain Protocol? Types of Layer 2 Solutions Sidechains: What They Are: Sidechains are separate blockchains that run in parallel with the main blockchain (mainchain). They are interoperable with the mainchain, allowing assets to move between the two. How They Work: Users can transfer assets from the mainchain to a sidechain, where transactions can be processed more quickly and at lower costs. Once on the sidechain, assets can be used within specific applications or services. Use Cases: Sidechains are suitable for scenarios where scalability and speed are essential, such as DeFi platforms, gaming applications, and supply chain tracking. They enable faster and cheaper transactions while retaining compatibility with the mainchain. Plasma: What It Is: Plasma is a framework for building scalable and secure applications on Ethereum. How It Works: Plasma chains are hierarchical blockchains that are periodically anchored to the Ethereum mainchain. This structure reduces the computational load on the mainchain while maintaining security. Use Cases: Plasma is ideal for decentralized applications (DApps) that require frequent interactions, like gaming or content distribution. It offers a scalable environment for DApps without compromising security. State Channels: What They Are: State channels are off-chain channels that allow participants to interact privately and quickly. How They Work: Participants open a state channel, conduct multiple transactions off-chain, and only settle the final state on the mainchain. This minimizes the computational burden on the mainchain. Use Cases: State channels are well-suited for microtransactions, gaming, and any application where participants need to interact frequently while minimizing transaction costs and latency. Rollups: What They Are: Rollups are Layer 2 solutions that bundle multiple transactions into a single batch and post the batch’s summary on the mainchain. How They Work: Rollups aggregate transactions off-chain, compute their results, and then submit a single transaction to the mainchain. This reduces the gas fees associated with individual transactions. Use Cases: Rollups are versatile and can be used in various applications, including DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and supply chain tracking, to reduce transaction costs and increase scalability. 2) Sending funds from L2 networks on the Centralized Exchange: Gas fees are cheaper on Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains. So, transferring funds from L2 networks is a great strategy to reduce bridging cost, I’d explain further 👇 — willz(💙,🧡) (@willzCrypt) August 18, 2023 Use Cases for Layer 2 Networks DeFi (Decentralized Finance): Use Case: Layer 2 solutions enable faster and more cost-effective transactions on DeFi platforms. This includes lending, borrowing, decentralized exchanges, and yield farming. Users can interact with DeFi protocols without incurring high gas fees, making DeFi more accessible. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): Use Case: NFT marketplaces benefit from Layer 2 networks by reducing the significant gas fees associated with minting, buying, and selling NFTs. This makes NFTs more accessible to creators and collectors. Gaming: Use Case: Online gaming platforms can leverage Layer 2 solutions to provide real-time gameplay and in-game transactions without the latency and cost issues of on-chain transactions. Gamers can buy, sell, and trade in-game assets more efficiently. Supply Chain: Use Case: Tracking and verifying the provenance of goods on a blockchain can be made more efficient with Layer 2 networks. This is especially valuable for industries where transparency and traceability are critical, such as food safety and luxury goods. Micropayments: Use Case: Content creators, such as bloggers, artists, and musicians, can receive micropayments for their work without being burdened by high transaction fees. This opens up new revenue streams and monetization options for digital content. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Use Case: Layer 2 networks can facilitate the movement of assets between different blockchains, promoting cross-chain interoperability. This is essential for applications that require interactions across multiple blockchain ecosystems. Current layer-1 chains such as #ETH and #BNB cannot handle these types of transactions, speeds, or low costs all together. Which is why they keep focusing on layer-2 solutions to scale their networks, which just adds more complexity to the transaction pipeline flow. — Xzo.eth (@Exzo_Dev) June 21, 2023 Conclusion Layer 2 networks are a crucial advancement in the blockchain industry, addressing scalability and efficiency issues while maintaining the principles of decentralization and security. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and find applications in various industries, Layer 2 solutions will play a vital role in expanding the possibilities and improving the user experience. With ongoing research and development, we can expect even more innovative Layer 2 solutions to emerge, further enhancing the blockchain industry’s capabilities.
