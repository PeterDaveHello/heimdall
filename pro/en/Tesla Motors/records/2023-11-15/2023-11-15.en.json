November 15, 2023 07:00 AM updated 25 minutes ago NORIHIKO SHIROUZU Reuters More Tweet Share Share Email Print RICHARD TRUETT TEI won the 2023 Casting of the Year award from the American Foundry Society for its castings for the Cadillac Celestiq (pictured). AUSTIN, Texas — If you can't beat them, buy them. For years, a little-known company called Tooling & Equipment International, or TEI, has helped Tesla Inc. push back the frontiers of \"gigacasting,\" the process it pioneered to cast large body parts for cars in one piece to save time and money. Until 2023, that is. TEI is now part of General Motors after agreeing to a deal that may have flown under the radar but is a key part of the U.S. automaker's strategy to make up ground on Tesla, four people familiar with the transaction told Reuters. By snapping up a specialist in sand casting techniques that accelerated the development of Tesla's gigacasting molds and allowed it to cast more complex components, GM has jump-started its own push to make cars more cheaply and efficiently at a time when Tesla is racing to roll out a $25,000 EV, the people said. Related Article Ford, Hyundai join Tesla in turning to Idra Giga Presses Tesla closes in on car manufacturing breakthrough With TEI gone, Tesla is leaning more heavily on three other casting specialists it has used in Britain, Germany and Japan to develop the huge molds needed for the millions of cheaper EVs it plans to make in the coming decade, the four people said. At the same time, Tesla is scrambling to find another sand casting specialist to fill the role TEI performed, or even develop such crucial expertise in-house to cut its reliance on outside suppliers, the people said. \"General Motors acquired Tooling & Equipment International (TEI) to bolster its portfolio of innovations and secure access to unique casting technology,\" GM said in a statement to Reuters in response to questions for this story. Tesla and TEI President Oliver Johnson did not respond to requests for comment. Like GM, a host of automakers from Ford Motor Co. to Hyundai Motor Co. to Toyota Motor Corp. are trying to copy Tesla's gigacasting know-how to match its design and manufacturing efficiency and avoid being undercut on the showroom floor. Gigacasting is core to Tesla's \"unboxed\" manufacturing strategy unveiled by CEO Elon Musk in March, which he hopes will slash the assembly costs of the next generation of cars by half. The strategy hinges on producing the structural platform and subframes of a car in one piece using gigacasting and then snapping it together at the end with the other parts of the vehicle being made in parallel. That gigacasting know-how, which uses casts made out of industrial sand with 3D printing, has been made possible in part by TEI along with the three other suppliers Tesla has been using. Celestiq castings Reuters has reported that the work of these four firms has been a key reason why Tesla can now develop a car from the ground up in 18 to 24 months and do so economically, while most rivals can currently take anywhere from three to four years. The specialists use sand casting in a process called rapid prototyping to help validate Tesla's designs and engineering specifications for its giant molds quickly and cheaply. According to all four sources, TEI began helping Tesla around 2017 to develop the Model Y and is considered in the industry to be one of the world's top sand casting specialists. Since then, TEI has been involved in gigacasting mold prototyping for Tesla's Model 3, Cybertruck and its heavy-duty Semi truck, according to two of the sources. When TEI's Johnson put the company up for sale last year, GM would have had a good idea about what gigacasting know-how it might get its hands on. GM's realization, the four sources said, certainly came when it conducted due diligence and was probably well before that as it had turned to TEI around 2021 to test and produce some underbody castings for its luxury $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq EV, which is due to hit showrooms next year. As part of that program, GM signed a guaranteed, long-term contact, and TEI invested in a new dedicated production line for the Celestiq at its base in Livonia, Mich., a 25-minute drive from GM's Detroit headquarters, one of the sources said. BREAKING NEWS ALERTS: Sign up and be the first to know when big news breaks. Email Address \"Bringing TEI into the GM enterprise builds on decades of the company's own casting experience and provides a competitive advantage with strategic castings for future low volume products like the Cadillac Celestiq,\" GM said in its statement. TEI won the 2023 Casting of the Year award from the American Foundry Society for those Celestiq castings. It formally became part of GM's Global Manufacturing division, which oversees all of GM's automobile and parts manufacturing operations, on July 1, according to one of the sources with direct knowledge. \"TEI will remain its own business entity with GM as its parent company,\" GM said. Two of the sources with direct knowledge said GM paid less than $100 million for TEI, with one of them estimating it paid $80 million at the most. Reuters was unable to determine whether Tesla was one of the several companies that bid for TEI. Front row seat While Tesla has leapt ahead of rivals when it comes to manufacturing techniques, and appears to be putting more distance between it and the rest of the auto industry, the TEI deal has given GM a front row view of how Tesla honed its gigacasting expertise. TEI and others make test molds out of industrial sand. Using a digital design file, 3D printers known as binder jets build a sand mold that can cast molten alloys. Among key benefits of this method are that a sand mold can be printed quickly and then reprinted multiple times at a minimal cost to tweak and adjust mold designs. TEI and the three other specialists have been particularly important for Tesla in coming up with new alloys to be used in sand casts, as well as techniques for heat-treating the large metal body parts once they've been molded to improve their quality, Reuters has reported. James Womack, a former research director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes Musk's new manufacturing initiatives have come as a shock to the legacy auto industry \"shaking up everyone else.\" \"It even woke up Toyota — the industry's current very best in manufacturing — to embrace gigacasting and other innovations from Tesla,\" said Womack, co-author of \"The Machine That Changed The World,\" the 1990 book about Toyota's lean production system. Womack believes the competition to achieve even greater efficiency is far from over. \"Gigacasting and unboxed are worthy of experiments, but cutting edge endeavors almost always take more time than initially projected to reach maturity and some experiments will fail,\" Womack said.

By Keithen Drury – Nov 15, 2023 at 7:30AM Key Points Tesla's gross margins are now in line with legacy automakers. The stock trades at a hefty premium to its peers. Future products may create unprecedented demand for Tesla, giving the stock an unknown upside. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Market Cap $755B Today's Change (6.12%) $13.70 Current Price $237.41 Price as of November 14, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Tesla's declining margins have given the bears some credence over the past year. Tesla (TSLA 6.12%) stock has taken quite the roller coaster ride in 2023. It has been as low as $108 and as high as $293 but currently sits at around $215 after a steady decline over the past few months. But the sentiment behind Tesla stock has also changed, as the company has changed its strategy slightly in the electric vehicle (EV) market. Previously, Tesla's margins were the best in the business, which provided shareholders with a one-two punch of strong growth and superior profits. With Tesla's change in strategy to sell its vehicles at a lower price (and thus lower margins) to secure its EV market share as the legacy automakers launch their products, some investors are rethinking their position. So what should investors do with Tesla stock? Tesla may not be earning its premium valuation anymore Much of the argument around Tesla's stock price boils down to its valuation. It's hard to argue about Tesla's U.S. EV market share, but the question is, is the company worth nearly $700 billion when legacy automakers like Toyota, Ford, and General Motors are worth less than half of that combined? Previously, the buy side's argument of superior gross margins held some water, as no other automaker (besides premium ones like Ferrari) had nearly the level Tesla did. But with rising input costs and cutting vehicle prices, Tesla no longer holds this crown. TSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts. This calls into question Tesla's valuation, as the sell side would say Tesla doesn't deserve its premium valuation anymore. With Tesla stock trading at 69 times trailing earnings compared to Toyota's 9.1 and Ford's 6.4, it would have a long way to tumble to match its peers. But the buy side would call out that short-sightedness. Management has repeatedly stated on conference calls that these price cuts are temporary, as they are adjusting to operating in a high interest rate environment because many people focus on monthly payments rather than the overall car price. This isn't Tesla's preferred strategy as it doesn't do loans in-house like many automakers do. But the key item here to watch is what happens when interest rates are eventually cut. If Tesla's margins improve, then the bulls can say they were right. But if they don't, the bears will have proven their argument. Still, that only focuses on Tesla's existing businesses. Tesla has aspirations to be much more than an EV maker In addition to what it's already doing, Tesla also has other projects like full self-driving (FSD), robotaxis, and additional car models aimed at different audiences. On the buy side, these are mostly legitimate products that could change the world if done correctly. It's hard to value something like FSD, as how many people would adopt it and at what rate is unknown. The same goes for robotaxis or Tesla's artificial intelligence (AI) investments. While many buy-side Tesla investors prefer to think about the future, the sell-side isn't convinced any of these products will become a reality and believes that investors should consider the products Tesla has now, as there are no future guarantees. Collapse NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Today's Change (6.12%) $13.70 Current Price $237.41 YTD 1w1m3m6m1y5y Price VS S&P Key Data Points Market Cap $755B Day's Range $230.72 - $238.13 52wk Range $101.81 - $299.29 Volume 1,829,666 Avg Vol 120,082,348 Gross Margin 19.81% Dividend Yield So, what do I think investors should do with Tesla stock? I'm in the middle at a \"hold.\" While the short-term margin decline concerns me, I'm confident in Tesla's product versus the legacy automaker's and that price hikes will go over fine once interest rates decline. Additionally, I think Tesla has some promising products in the pipeline, but none are anywhere close to implementation, so they shouldn't be considered now. Tesla's stock has always been divisive, and with the bears scoring a few points in 2023, it has evened the argument a bit more. The key to Tesla's stock price lies within its gross margins, as any more decline in that metric will likely send the stock down further. On the flip side, if it improves throughout 2024, don't be surprised if Tesla knocks on the door of becoming a $1 trillion company. Keithen Drury has positions in Tesla.

By Jess Weatherbed, a news writer focused on creative industries, computing, and internet culture. Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews. Nov 15, 2023, 12:10 PM UTC| Share this story Orders for the new Model 915 Cyberquad for Kids are expected to ship in late November. Image: Tesla After being recalled last year for not meeting product safety standards, Tesla’s $1,900 Cyberquad for Kids is once again available to purchase on the Tesla webstore in the US. The latest release of the Cybertruck-inspired ride-on toy — identified as Model 915 — is an updated version of the Model 914 Cyberquad for Kids that launched back in December 2021. Orders for the Model 915 are expected to begin shipping in late November. Like the Model 914, the new Model 915 Cyberquad for Kids was jointly created by Tesla and popular children’s toy maker Radio Flyer, best known as the makers of the Little Red Wagon. The battery-powered Cyberquad for Kids has a 500W motor with a top speed of 10 mph (that parents can switch to 5 mph) and a max range of 15 miles, with LED headlights and taillights. Much like its Cybertruck inspiration, this pint-sized version of the Cyberquad ATV for adults also features a steel frame and high-pressure rubber air tires. The new Model 915 Cyberquad for Kids has been updated with a new suspension and safety labels to comply with CPSC rules. Image: Tesla The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued a recall for the original Model 914 in October 2022 after determining that it was better classified as a youth ATV rather than a ride-on toy. The Cyberquad for Kids failed to meet the federal mandatory safety standard requirements for youth ATVs at that time, which are fairly extensive owing to the high risk of injury ATVs present. Now, in addition to a modified rear suspension, changes have been made to ensure the product meets both CPSC rules and ASTM F963 toy safety standards, including a slightly higher age rating of 9-12 years (up from 8-12 years, which remains the advice for Europe), a tire inflation warning label on the front-left fender, and another warning label clearly stating that the product isn’t a youth ATV and “is not for off-road use”... despite what that kid is doing on the promotional image above.

Related Lucid joins other automakers by adopting Tesla charging plug Watch how Tesla’s Cybertruck handles a compound bow’s arrow Tesla’s Cybertruck finally gets a delivery date But following a rethink, the automaker has removed the controversial clause from its purchase agreement, giving Cybertruck owners total freedom over what they do with their electric pickup once they take ownership of it. Electrek, which first reported on the removal of the clause, points out that it seemed like an odd rule to impose in the first place. Such a clause sometimes appears with rare or pricey motors, and automakers like Ferrari, Ford, and Porsche are known to sometimes use them. The Cybertruck isn’t expected to enter mass production until 2025, so it’s possible Tesla wanted to discourage scalpers and sell the early trickle of Cybertrucks to genuine customers, rather than seeing them immediately hitting the used market at a vastly inflated price. But for whatever reason, the automaker appears to have had a change of heart on the issue. Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck in 2019 and the electric pickup will be presented to the first customers at a special event on Thursday, November 30. The new owners can then take a look at the final purchase agreement to confirm its wording on reselling — not that many of them will be thinking of immediately putting it on the market. Reports in July claimed that Tesla had received around 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, with each customer asked to put down a $100 deposit. In the same month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that demand for the Cybertruck is “so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” Editors' Recommendations Tesla says Cybertruck resellers could face harsh penalties Tesla Model Y vs. Nissan Ariya: Can Tesla take out Nissan’s electric crossover?
