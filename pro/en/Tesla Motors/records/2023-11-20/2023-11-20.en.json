LUDOVIC MARIN—AFP/GETTY IMAGES; COURTESY OF TESLA Since taking control of Tesla in 2008, Musk has relied on several executives to help make it the biggest EV manufacturer in the world. One top Musk lieutenant is Omead Afshar, a former ski instructor who has worked for Tesla for more than six years and lists his most recent position as Office of the CEO. Afshar oversaw construction of Gigafactory Texas and moved to SpaceX in late 2022 where he’s working on the Starship deep space rocket. Then there’s Andrew Baglino, a senior vice president for powertrain and energy engineering at Tesla, who is considered a top candidate to succeed Musk. (Baglino, who has spent nearly 18 years at Tesla, is also the company’s most senior engineer behind Musk.) Charles Kuehmann, the former director of product design at Apple, works for both Tesla and SpaceX where he is currently VP materials engineering. He is credited with helping develop the steel alloy used for Tesla’s long-awaited Cybertruck. Some of Musk’s closest advisors have left him but haven’t gone far. Consider JB Straubel, who was CTO of Tesla for nearly 16 years and is considered a cofounder. Straubel went on to launch Redwood Materials, which focuses on recycling lithium-ion batteries, but he also sits on Tesla’s board. Here’s a look at the top executives running Tesla now. Elon Musk Tesla CEO, Technoking, and board member Executives Tom Zhu Senior vice president Zhu was named senior vice president, automotive, in April 2023. He was previously vice president, Greater China. Frequently referred to as chief of Tesla China and the second most powerful person at Tesla.

    "originBody": "Tesla 3D printed mould supplier Tooling & Equipment International acquired by General Motors by Sam Davies 20 November 2023 13:42 RSS Print × Expand Voxeljet General Motors has acquired casting manufacturer Tooling & Equipment International (TEI), a long-term user of Voxeljet’s binder jetting technology and supplier to Tesla. International news agency Reuters broke the news last week and has reported that the acquisition is a key element in General Motors’ strategy to ‘make up ground on Tesla’. Tesla is said to have leaned on TEI, as well as three other suppliers, to facilitate its Gigacasting processes for the casting of large car structures in one piece. By integrating TEI into General Motors, the automotive giant told Reuters it was ‘bolstering its portfolio of innovations and secure access to unique casting technology.’ TEI has reportedly been working with Tesla since 2017, with the casting company then agreeing a three-year contract with Voxeljet for the purchase of 3D printed sand moulds and cores in February 2018. While working with Tesla, TEI is believed to have supported the development of Tesla’s Model Y, Model 3, Cybertruck and heavy-duty Semi truck by prototyping large moulds. Come 2021, TEI was using two VX4000 sand 3D printing systems from Voxeljet and soon would earn itself a reputation as one of the largest users of sand 3D printing in the United States. Earlier this year, it was revealed the company had purchased a third VX4000 machine – expanding its additive manufacturing capacity to up to 2.5 litres per year – and was working with General Motors, producing cast cores for the series production of large-format, weight-saving structural components for the electric Cadillac CELESTIQ vehicle. With its expanded sand 3D printing capacity, TEI has been able to print hundreds of cores for several vehicle sets in one night. It is this capability that initially attracted General Motors to partner with the company and subsequently acquire it. It is understood that TEI will remain its own business with General Motors operating as its parent company.

    "originBody": "Breadcrumb Home China Auto Show November 20, 2023 04:20 AM updated 48 minutes ago BYD's Tesla rival leads new EV launches at Guangzhou auto show Electric SUVs and multi-purpose vehicles dominate the China show. Bloomberg More Tweet Share Share Email Print BLOOMBERG BYD's Sea Lion is pictured at the Guangzhou auto show. China’s top-selling automaker BYD’s unveiling of its long-awaited rival to Tesla’s Model Y — the Sea Lion 07 — led a slew of new vehicle launches at this year’s Auto Guangzhou, one of the country’s biggest annual car events. Crowds flocked to the Guangzhou International Automobile Exhibition — which started Nov. 17 and runs until Nov. 26 — to see new offerings from electric vehicle makers like Li Auto and Volkswagen Group’s new China partner Xpeng. SUV and multi-purpose vehicles dominated the display booths as automakers seek to appeal to a new generation of tech-savvy, environmentally conscious drivers. While the world’s biggest auto and EV market may not be as hot as it was 12 months ago, the year-end push to grab headlines and boost sales to hit annual delivery targets is in full flow. Related Article Tesla revamps Model Y in China, keeps starting price unchanged BYD gains on Tesla for EV sales crown with another record month Here are some of the highlights of the vehicles on display: BYD Sea Lion 07 The Sea Lion 07 is BYD’s answer to Tesla’s top-selling Model Y. It’s the first midsize full-electric SUV from China’s top car brand and comes as BYD jostles to dethrone Tesla as the world’s biggest maker of EVs. Among Sea Lion’s features are BYD’s in-house “DiSus” body control system, which it says makes the car capable in almost any driving condition and scenario. Local media reports say the Sea Lion 07 will be priced between 200,000 yuan to 260,000 yuan ($27,700 to $36,000), which puts it below the base Model Y, which currently sells for 266,400 yuan in China. LI AUTO Li Auto MEGA MPV. Li Auto MEGA MPV Beijing-based Li Auto finally unveiled its first pure-electric model, having risen in popularity with its extended-range EVs (which carry electric motors powered by gasoline engines). The seven-seat MEGA MPV secured 10,000 pre-orders within two hours of its release. The design of the MPV was a major talking point with its uninterrupted, curvaceous windscreen and roof — which the company says makes it more aerodynamic, extending its range — and squared-off, boxy rear. Powered by Contemporary Amperex Technology Co’s 1,000 kilometer (621 mile) capable Qilin battery, the MEGA MPV can charge to 500 kilometers of range in just 12 minutes. The starting price will be under 600,000 yuan, and mass production and deliveries could start as soon as February. ZEEKR The Zeekr 007 sedan. Zeekr 007 sedan The 007 is the first electric sedan from Geely Automotive Holdings’s premium Zeekr brand — designed by a team led by long-time Audi veteran Stefan Sielaff. The futuristic-looking car has clean lines — there are no door handles — and a tech-laden design, with the front bumper featuring a 90-inch intelligent lighting display. The 475kW all-wheel drive can go from zero to 100km/h in just 2.84 seconds. Inside, there is a central console display that tilts toward the driver or front seat passenger. In sport mode, the special seats (for the racier model) grip the passenger’s body and the pricier version will have a heads-up display that projects the dashboard onto the front window.The 007 comes in two ranges, 688 kilometers (428 miles) and 870 kilometers. Its fast-charging technology delivers up to 610 kilometers of range in 15 minutes. Zeekr picked up 20,000 pre-orders in the first 48 hours. The discounted pre-sales price starts at 224,900 yuan, ahead of deliveries from January. XPENG The Xpeng X9 MPV. Xpeng X9 MPV The seven-seater is the first pure electric MPV from Xpeng, which recently signed a partnership to develop two VW-branded EVs for the German auto giant. The automaker’s new flagship will start at 388,000 yuan and offer 610 kilometers of range on a single charge, and is a step up for Xpeng, which has previously targeted the mass market. With the family market in mind, the interior features a 21.4-inch entertainment screen, an in-built fridge and a maximum storage capacity of a spacious 2,554 liters. Xpeng’s autonomous driving features will also be deployed on this model. CADILLAC The Cadillac Optiq. Cadillac Optiq SUV One of the few foreign automakers on display, the U.S. brand launched the Optiq electric SUV, it’s first China-exclusive model. Also targeted at potential Model Y buyers, the crossover comes with 502 kilometers of range, and while pricing has not been announced yet, it will be cheaper than its sister model, the luxury Lyriq SUV. Cadillac and its parent General Motors have been losing market share in China and are trying to revive their appeal to customers who are increasingly favoring electric cars. Changan Lieshou Pickup Changan Automobile Co.’s Lieshou (which means “hunter” in Chinese) pickup stood out in the sea of sedans and SUVs in the exhibition hall. Pickups, which are treated as trucks in China, have not been as popular as other types of passenger cars because some cities restrict their entry. But bans have been lifted in recent years due to more electric and hybrid models coming onto the market. The Lieshou is designed as an extended range EV capable of up to 1,031 kilometers. The range on pure battery power is 170 kilometers, and fuel consumption is about 1.9l/100km, compared with 6 to 7 liters for small gasoline cars.

    "originBody": "Automobile Tesla faces strike in Sweden Although Tesla does not manufacture its vehicles in Sweden, the manufacturer's electric cars are serviced in the country by more than 120 mechanics. These are now also being supported in their strike by dock workers who are refusing to unload Tesla vehicles. Image: Tesla By Chris Randall 20.11.2023 - 14:02 Tesla Sweden BEV X LinkedIn Facebook The mechanics employed by Tesla in Sweden are organized in the IF Metall union. After their employer rejected their demand for collective agreements, they went on strike on October 27. According to Reuters, they are now being supported by port workers. They are said to have joined the mechanics’ strike on November 7, blocking the four largest Swedish ports for Tesla cars. The action was extended to all ports last Friday. Reuters quotes a spokesman for the Transport union (which organizes the dock workers) as saying that the Swedish ports often receive one to three deliveries of Tesla cars per week. Not a single delivery is said to have been made since the strike began. Tesla is known to avoid collective agreements. In the USA and Germany – Tesla’s current production nations – there are none. Should this change as a result of the protest in Sweden, it could possibly set a precedent that would have an impact in other countries. Marie Nilsson, head of IF Metall, told Reuters that the union had received indications at the beginning of the dispute that Tesla was using strike-breaking tactics by flying in workers from other countries. But the union wants to counter this: According to Nilsson, IF Metall has no intention of ending the strike any time soon. “As long as it is needed,” she said. reuters.com Tags Tesla Sweden BEV 0 Comments about „Tesla faces strike in Sweden“ Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

Shenzhen-based BYD launched its new premium brand Sea Lion and under it, a sport-utility vehicle (SUV) model named Sea Lion 07 on Friday, to take on the US carmaker’s Shanghai-made Model Y, which has been around since 2021. Although BYD did not say that the Sea Lion series would take on Tesla or its products, analysts were quick to note that the model would target the same market segment. “It will become a tit-for-tat race when BYD builds vehicles similar to Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y,” said Chen Jinzhu, chief executive of consultancy Shanghai Mingliang Auto Service. “It will be a stern challenge for Tesla because BYD now enjoys a cost advantage over its US rival.” A BYD Co. Sea Lion SUV on display at the Guangzhou Auto Show in Guangzhou, China, on Friday, Nov. 17, 2023. China is the world’s largest electric vehicle market. Photo: Bloomberg BYD, backed by Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm owned by Warren Buffett, unveiled the Sea Lion 07, a full-electric SUV to be priced between 200,000 yuan (US$27,879) and 260,000 yuan, at the Guangzhou Auto Show that began on Friday. The Sea Lion 07 is fitted with BYD’s self-developed DiSus body control system, which prevents the vehicle from rolling over while negotiating corners at high speed. Toyota plans to trial new EV pickup in Thailand to counter Chinese rivals BYD dethroned Tesla as the world’s largest EV maker last year, but most of its pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars target low- and middle-income wage earners on mainland China, sporting a price tag of 100,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan. On the other hand, the price range for Tesla’s Model Y, assembled at its Gigafactory in Shanghai, starts at 266,400 yuan. According to a report from investment bank UBS, BYD’s Chinese factories have a production advantage over Tesla’s Shanghai-based assembly. The cost of building a BYD Seal EV, a potential rival to Tesla’s Model 3, is 15 per cent lower, it said. In April, BYD unveiled its super luxury model Yangwang U8, a luxury car priced at 1.1 million yuan, in a move to display its heft in car design and manufacturing. The U8’s appearance evoked comparisons with Range Rover among market experts. It can accelerate to 100km/h from a standstill in 3.6 seconds, and its four wheel-side motor allows the vehicle to make so-called “tank turns” and even allow it to “crab-walk” sideways. At present, Tesla is competing against three top Chinese EV start-ups – Li Auto, Xpeng and Nio – on the mainland market, all competing to build superior, battery-powered vehicles, featuring autonomous driving technology and sophisticated digital cockpits. Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory delivered 28,626 units to mainland customers in October, a month-on-month decline of 34.2 per cent, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). That followed a 32.8 per cent month-on-month slide in September. Post",

    "title": "Multiple Automakers Adopt Tesla's Supercharger Network for Reliability and Ease of Use",
    "originLink": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/drive/mobility/article-why-carmakers-are-jumping-on-the-tesla-supercharger-bandwagon/",
    "originBody": "Open this photo in gallery: A Tesla vehicle charging at a Tesla supercharging station in Kettleman City, Calif., on Jan. 25.MIKE BLAKE/Reuters Comments Share Bookmark In May, Ford Motor Co. was the first major automaker to announce that its EVs would soon be able to use Tesla Inc.’s Supercharger network. In less than six months, 20 more brands have joined Ford. The latest is Lucid, which announced the move in early November. Companies are charging ahead with Tesla’s fast chargers because they’re more reliable and easier to use than most other fast charging networks, said Daniel Breton, chief executive officer of Electric Mobility Canada, a Montreal-based national non-profit that promotes EV ownership. After two EV road trips, I would want my next one to be in a Tesla “They’re seeing that the consumer experience is so much better than most other networks,” he said. “[Ford CEO] Jim Farley went on a vacation with his kids in a Ford F-150 Lightning and said he saw that the only chargers that always worked were Tesla’s Superchargers. That, to me, says everything.” Public fast chargers can charge an EV to 80 per cent in about 20 to 45 minutes, depending on the car and the speed of the charger. Tesla launched its proprietary Supercharger network of EV fast chargers in 2012. They only worked with Teslas and use a different plug than other chargers. A year ago, Tesla announced it would start allowing other carmakers to use its proprietary charging standard, which it calls the North American charging standard (NACS). So far, Acura, BMW, Fisker, Ford, General Motors, Genesis, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Jaguar, Kia, Lexus, Lucid, Mercedes-Benz, Mini, Nissan, Polestar, Rolls-Royce, Subaru, Toyota and Volvo have all said they will be switching to Tesla’s charging standard on new EVs by 2025 (Acura and Honda say it could be 2026). Many have said they’ll also be offering an adapter next year so existing EVs with CCS plugs can use Superchargers with NACS plugs (2025 for BMW, Mini, Rolls-Royce, Acura, Honda, Genesis, Hyundai, Kia and Lucid). So far, the holdouts are Stellantis (which includes Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep and Ram) and Volkswagen Group (which includes Audi, Bentley, Porsche and Volkswagen). Both companies have said they’re evaluating the option. In a J.D. Power study of public chargers earlier this year, Tesla’s network came first for reliability. According to the study, 21.6 per cent of EV drivers who went to non-Tesla public charging stations couldn’t charge their vehicles – compared to 3.9 per cent who had problems at Tesla Superchargers. “When it comes to reliability, no other provider is even close to Tesla,” the report said. Unlike most other networks, which require an app, an RFID card, a credit card or a bank card to start charging, Tesla’s chargers are plug-and-pay – you plug in and that’s it. They automatically start charging and, when finished, charge the cost to your Tesla account. Automakers didn’t mention plug-and-pay capability in their announcements about the switch. Several of the companies who immediately responded to our questions, including Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and Volvo, said charging at Superchargers will be activated and paid for through their apps. When asked if that might change, most said they had nothing to announce now. But Breton suspects those EVs will eventually be able to plug-and-pay at Superchargers as part of a larger move toward the technology. “This year, seven car manufacturers [General Motors, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes Benz and Stellantis] said they’d be building 30,000 chargers together and they said they would be plug-and-pay,” Breton said. Tesla didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment. The company has also been adding built-in CCS adapters to some of its Superchargers to allow other EV brands to charge. So far in Canada, there are just two Supercharger stations with the adapters (which Tesla calls the Magic Dock) – in North Bay and Deep River, Ont. As of August, of the more than 4,500 fast charging ports in Canada, more than 1,900 were Tesla Superchargers, according to data from National Resources Canada. Even though these agreements with Tesla will mean more drivers will be competing for the Superchargers, Breton doesn’t think it will mean longer wait times. He expects most other charging networks to start using Tesla’s NACS plug, so Tesla drivers can more easily use them too. Right now, they have to use an adapter. “So in places where there’s no Supercharger, [Tesla drivers] will be able to plug their car in at ChargePoint or Flo,” he said. Also, if Tesla drivers have put their destination into the car’s GPS, it will send them to a Supercharger that likely won’t be busy, Breton said. “Even if other cars aren’t actually there yet, the network knows that their navigation systems are sending them there,” Breton said. “So it sends you to a different Supercharger.” John Dixon, a Burlington, Ont. Tesla owner and president of the Tesla Owner’s Club of Ontario says there hasn’t be much discussion about the agreements. “We have a Facebook group [with 3,900 followers] and this has not been a topic I’ve seen any concern about.” Dixon expects Tesla to open more stations and add more chargers to existing stations to keep up with demand – especially along the busy corridor between Toronto and Montreal. “They’re opening them fast and furious and they’re getting bigger and bigger,” he said. “There’s one opening in Mississauga with 32 chargers.” Dixon said he rarely uses Superchargers – he charges at home or when he gets to the cottage – but he thinks Tesla opening it’s network is good for EVs in general. “Tesla’s network is the most reliable – often when you go to other networks half the stalls are down or [your car] can’t communicate with the charger,” he said. “It’s good news for EVs.”",

Tesla has requested temporary tariff concessions in order to establish a manufacturing facility in India. However, New Delhi is opposed to any exemptions that would be company specific, senior government officials with knowledge of the matter told ET. \"The government's approach is for the industry as a whole and not for any specific company because we have very strong domestic companies in this sector,\" said an official who spoke with ET. The government is currently developing a policy to encourage domestic production of electric vehicles at a time when Vietnamese competitor VinFast and US electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla are solidifying their plans to enter the Indian market. Although the industry hasn't officially objected to the government yet, a number of automakers are worried that lowering import duties will give Tesla, which hasn't made any significant investments in this country, an unfair edge. In addition to domestic auto giants like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, which currently manufacture EVs in the country, other businesses like Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai-Kia have made large investments to establish plants for assembling batteries and battery packs, and they plan to introduce over a dozen electric vehicles into the market by 2030. Hyundai has declared plans to invest Rs 20,000 crore in Tamil Nadu, while Suzuki Motor Corp, the parent company of Maruti, has pledged to invest Rs 7,300 crore in the establishment of a battery plant in Gujarat. India's Minister for Commerce & Industry, Piyush Goyal, visited a Tesla factory in Fremont, California, on 14 November. The visit led to speculations that the government may be considering lowering taxes for Tesla in an attempt to lure it to build its cars here.
