Or follow us on Google News! October 21 was the 4-year anniversary of our dual-motor Tesla Model 3 Long Range (see picture from our 2019 delivery day above). The odometer now reads: 110,860 miles. Please find below my comprehensive review. CleanTechnica Chief Editor Zach Shahan just reviewed his Tesla Model 3 SR+ for its 4th anniversary as well. You can use this article as another data point on the reliability of Tesla Model 3s and what you can expect the car to cost you as time goes on. I haven’t estimated fuel costs, interest costs, resale value, etc. You can read Zach’s article for those costs. Why we still love our Model 3 after 4+ years and 110,860 miles I am a huge proponent of green technology, and in particular, electric vehicles. I am also a huge Tesla fanboy! I still get a big kick out of my Tesla Model 3. My previous cars were Chevys, Toyota Camrys, and Nissan Leafs, so my Tesla with dual motors, heated seats, a 12-speaker sound system, etc., etc., etc. feels very much to me like a luxury car. Tesla has completely rethought how automobiles should work, making many things about operating your vehicle better. My Model 3 accelerates like a rocket and I love having my fueling station in my garage. I get to totally skip the trips to the gas station for a smelly refill. I also totally skip the trips to Jiffy Lube and sitting in their smelly waiting room for a not-so-jiffy hour. A Tesla Model 3 has a gorgeous huge screen where most of the controls are executed. The Tesla navigation using beautiful satellite maps on the huge screen is so good that I don’t miss Apple CarPlay. The big screen is also great for watching Netflix movies and letting my grandkids play games. The sound system is fabulous, and with the music streaming service, I can play almost any song I can think of. I love using my smartphone as a key that unlocks the car as I approach and locks it as I leave when I am ~15 ft away. There’s no start button. As soon as you touch the brake, your car is activated and ready to go. With numerous software updates over the last 4 years, it feels like I have a new car every month or so. Many Tesla innovations were totally new to the automotive industry. However, many have been copied by other manufacturers by this time — but routinely remotely updating your car’s software like you do with a computer is still a struggle for some (or most) companies. Full Self Driving (FSD) Beta I have spectacular Full Self Driving (FSD) Beta, which will drive my car to any location I put in the navigation. In rural Northern Wisconsin where we spend the summers, I can give a voice command for any business or other location in the area and just sit and watch the car steer and navigate even on roads with no yellow or white lines to that location — with no intervention. However, unfortunately, it still screws up occasionally, so you need to be prepared to intervene instantaneously. Also, it is a little bit too timid, so you need to give it a little help with the accelerator pedal in heavy traffic. However, the steering remains totally automatic. I only need to torque the steering wheel a little or twiddle one of the thumb wheels on the steering wheel to let the system know that I am paying attention. There is also a camera over the rear-view mirror watching my face, so I can’t look away from the road, look at my phone, or shut my eyes too long or the system will complain. It seems to me that the camera system for determining my attention to the road is much superior to requiring my steering wheel twiddling. I hope that Tesla will remove the requirement to touch the steering wheel soon. FSD Beta has been improved numerous times over the last 2 years. For example: It now navigates rotaries (roundabouts) properly some of the time. It has stopped trying to make a turn not specified by the navigation at a certain intersection in Orem, Utah. It goes around cars and obstacles protruding into your lane. It responds properly to construction barrels closing a lane of traffic. However, it still slides into the second (passing) lane on two lane roads when staying in the main traffic lane is the proper response. Maintenance Costs Please see my maintenance costs below, which haven’t gone up since my report at 90,000 miles, 22,000 miles ago. I know that, in principal, EVs are much less complex than cars with internal combustion engines. The internal combustion engine (ICE) rebuild cost is ~$9000. And such engines seldom run over 200,000 miles without that very expensive rebuild or replacement. In addition, ICE cars have very complex transmissions (replacement cost ~$5000). You also have exhaust and emission control systems, radiator/cooling systems, etc., etc., etc. — which EVs do not have. An EV has a very expensive battery. Do I need to be worried about replacing it? I am treating mine with kid gloves and expect it to last over 10 years and over 500,000 miles. I almost never charge over 80%, and at least ¾ of my charging is done at Level 2 in my garage. However, I have used Tesla’s fabulous faster charging Level 3 Supercharger network often for long cross-country road trips. The EPA range of my car was given as 310 miles when new. When your Tesla is charging you can set the charge limit to 100% and your car will give you a battery range estimate. Mine is reading 285 miles now. 310–285=25 25/310= ~8% battery loss, which is great for 112,000 miles. The drive system and battery warrantee on my Model 3 will run out at 130,000 miles. Therefore, the most expensive components of my car are warrantied for another 18,000 miles. I have solar panels on my roof, so when at my Utah home, I’m driving on sunshine. Driving cross country using Tesla Superchargers, my electricity cost is similar to driving a gas car. However, the heavy EV battery and fabulous acceleration causes tires to wear out more quickly than for an ICE vehicle — so that is an increased cost for EV maintenance. In 112,000 miles, the total cost of the tires and unforced out-of-warranty repairs for my Model 3 have been $4,646.60. My tires are already wearing thin again, so I expect another big hit for tires soon. This is more than I expected, but probably not more than what I would have paid driving a gas car with costs for repairs, tires, oil changes, emission inspections, brakes, other miscellaneous items, and higher cost for fuel. The big savings will come going forward when the gas car would see those costs repeated, plus muffler, exhaust, and emission control system replacement — and eventually transmission and engine rebuild. If I live long enough, I expect to drive my Tesla over 500,000 miles. It is not unrealistic to expect the electric drive system and battery to last that long. Tunnel Road, Zion National Park, Utah. Photo by Fritz HaslerCleanTechnica. In the image above, we see my wife with our dog Zuni, our Tesla Model 3, and my ebike on the back at Zion National Park. We spend a good deal of the winter at our daughter’s home in Saint George, Utah, only 40 miles away. See my itemized service costs through 112,000 miles below. Except for needing another set of tires soon, I have had no additional service costs since 90,000 miles. Conveniently, I was able to obtain the dates, mileage, and exact cost of my Tesla repairs from the Tesla app on my phone. Not conveniently, it appears to go back only 2 years. Find below what I paid for unforced issues with my car not covered by the warranty. I have needed to replace the tires three times. The third set is wearing thin but would normally get me to 120,000 miles. However, with winter approaching I will probably get tires earlier so that I don’t get stuck on my way up the canyon to go skiing. I have paid $578.93 + $565.44 + $1252.23 = $2395.60 for the three sets of tires I’ve bought so far. I replaced the cabin air filter for $29.00. The mobile service man didn’t charge for the installation. Also note: the cabin air filter comes as two units. I watched the mobile service man do it and I wouldn’t recommend doing it yourself unless you have the right tools and are very handy with DIY repairs. Around April 2020 and April 2021, I had 4 wheel alignments twice ~$280. November 3, 2021 — 54,131 miles: Reseal right front upper control arm ball joint (squeaking) $49 November 3, 2021 — 54,131 miles: 4-wheel alignment $90.75 July 22, 2022 — 73,149 miles: Remove and replace Superbottle (battery and drive system cooling valve — car wouldn’t go over 50 mph) $672.75. February 2, 2023 — 88,705 miles: I had the mobile service man replace the windshield wipers for $23.00. This was a simple operation which most anyone could do themselves. February 20, 2023 — 90,029 miles: Remove and replace PTC/cabin heater (car wouldn’t go into drive) $1148.00 Note: Ironically, my Model 3 has an old fashioned 12 volt lead-acid battery that is used to boot the electronics when my car starts up. This battery is supposed to last 4 to 5 years. Mine is still working fine, but I am wondering whether I should change it proactively. [Editor’s note: The car will give you a message on the touchscreen when you need to change the 12V battery, but then you should do it without too much delay. —Zach] I believe newer high-end Teslas are now using lithium-ion batteries for this function. Lithium-ion batteries are more durable and should last at least 10 years. Repair/Maintenance Cost Summation: 3 sets of tires: $578,93 + $565.44 + $1252.23= $2,395.60 4-wheel alignment x 3: $370.75 Replace Superbottle: $672.75 Replace PTC: $1148 Replace cabin air filter: $29.00 Replace windshield wipers: $23.00 Getting picky: 3 bottles of windshield wiper fluid at $2.50 each for a total of $7.50 Total: $4646.60 Other Costs The annual registration in Utah for my 2019 Tesla Model 3 is $318.25. Part of this is the electric vehicle fee of $188. Utah has levied this fee on EV drivers to make up for the fact that we don’t use gasoline and therefore don’t pay the road use tax. Utah offers a mileage-based fee which saves money for low-mileage cars. Mine is high mileage, so I paid the fixed $188 fee. The Elephant in the Room I just checked on the cost of my Bear River insurance policy on my Tesla. I was surprised to learn that I am paying $3,089 per year. Therefore, over four years, my insurance cost has been $12,356. This dwarfs the $4,546 I paid for tires and out-of-warranty repairs by a large margin. It’s clear that if I thought buying an expensive electric car would be saving me money, I’ve been sadly mistaken.

    "originBody": "BYD Seal (2023) review: hitting the ground running Published:Yesterday 12:00 At a glance Handling4 out of 5 Performance4 out of 5 Usability4 out of 5 Feelgood factor4 out of 5 CAR's Rating4 out of 5 Car leasing offers » By Keith Adams Devout classic Citroen enthusiast, walking car encyclopedia, and long-time contributor to CAR Sections: CAR Review Specs Photo Gallery By Keith Adams Devout classic Citroen enthusiast, walking car encyclopedia, and long-time contributor to CAR View all BYD Reviews ► BYD Seal driven in the UK in both guises ► Up to 354 claimed miles of range ► LFP Blade battery pack maximises interior space Pity any new carmaker that wants to pitch up and place its tanks on the lawns of the European and US blue bloods. Making waves is so hard to do for a newcomer – but as Tesla has proved, the changing world we live in makes it more than possible. All you need to do is offer something genuinely new, useful and desirable. BYD – the biggest automotive brand most Westerners have never heard of – is hoping it can ‘do a Tesla’. It’s well-established in China and sells in huge numbers globally, but it is now pushing west with a high-tech, innovative, and good value range of EVs. It’s hoping to grab a slice of carbuyers’ newfound ability to cross-shop into less conventional brands – with the Seal acting as a halo product to tempt people in the way the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6 have done elsewhere. So it’s entirely logical that its newest and most impressive EV – the Seal – is packing technology that significantly moves on the electric car game. Although you might be forgiven for thinking that when you take a look at it in the metal for the very first time. It has definite shades of Porsche Taycan about the headlights and front end, with a bit of Mk1 Renault Laguna around the rear three-quarters thrown in for good measure. But the shape’s halfway between the smooth curves of a Tesla Model 3 and a Hyundai Ioniq 6, and it’s packing a drag coefficient 0.219Cd. It’s a handsome, almost generic, effort that you’d come to expect from the team of Wolfgang Egger, BYD’s global design director, formerly of Audi’s parish. But dig into Egger’s CV and the Seal’s modestly good looks (and lack of a faux grille) make more sense. He started out at Alfa Romeo where his fingerprints made it on to the achingly attractive Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione 8C and 156 and 166 saloons before moving to Volkswagen Group via Lancia. So, it’s likely to make quite a splash based on looks and tech alone. The Seal joins BYD’s European product offensive at a good time and and acts as a flagship to sit above the Atto 3 SUV and Dolphin hatchback. That’s three new EVs in one year, but the firm won’t be leaving it at that. For now, though, the Seal lands in the middle of an almighty battle for honours in the D-segment electric saloon car market. Right now – in terms of sales – that’s dominated by the improved Tesla Model 3 Highland, but the BMW i4, Polestar 2 and Hyundai Ioniq 6 are all jockeying for a slice of that juicy pie. The good news is that the BYD Seal able to comfortably swim in that pack, acquiting itself very well on the road. Just how well… read on. BYD Seal: battery, motors, range and charging The BYD group manufactures almost all of the Seal in-house, including the batteries, motor units and even the semiconductors, so it’s more or less immune to supply chain issues and should mean customers only have to wait a matter of weeks for a factory order rather than the months some manufacturers demand. In the current climate, this is likely to play well for buyers who are happy to cross-shop their brands, and are happy to try something new. Under the skin is BYD’s e-Platform 3.0, a scalable platform that also underpins the Atto 3 and the Dolphin. Here, though, the 82kWh lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) ‘Blade’ battery is totally structural, the top cover of the battery pack being the body floor. That gives the monocoque excellent torsional rigidity (40,500Nm/deg compared with an industry average of around 25,000) and a lower floor than its rivals for more effective interior packaging and a better seating position. It’s a battery technology that’s proven to be safer and less fussy about charging over the longer term – are you listening, insurers? The Seal is available with two motor options. There’s a 308bhp single-motor rear-wheel drive variant, known as the Design. It’s capable of 354 miles on a full battery on the WLTP testing cycle and the 0-62mph time is 5.9 seconds. That’s longer and quicker than a base-spec Tesla Model 3, for reference, and more than quick enough for most tastes. The range-topping dual-motor, AWD model, called the Excellence, makes 523bhp and has a claimed range of 323 miles. Slightly more powerful than a Tesla Model 3, the American contender does beat the BYD to 62mph by around 0.5 seconds and has a little more range. But BYD is so happy with its 3.8 second 0-62mph time, that you’ll find it’s flagged as the BYD Seal 3.8S on the bootlid. At the chargers, it performs well, if not at the leading edge. Maximum charge rates are more impressive than the Atto 3 or the Dolphin, and the Seal will top up at a middling 150kW from a suitably powerful charger. On a two-phase AC supply, it’ll charge at up to 11kW. That won’t trouble an Ioniq 6’s charge rate, but is more than fast enough (for now) for the UK’s public network. What’s it like to drive? We’ve driven the Seal on road and track in the UK and the news is good on the dynamic front. We tested both forms of the Seal on a Spanish test circuit – a slalom course as well as a drag strip to show off the acceleration of the Excellence AWD – and on a mixture of urban, shoddy UK rural and motorways in Germany. On the circuit, the Seal impresses with plenty of punch, direct steering with a quick rack, and a general sense of agility. It’s not physics-busting in the way a BMW i4 is, but tidy handling, good response, and excellent body control in general. Brakes, too, are consistent and offer excellent stopping power, even if a couple of examples we tried had softer brake response than we would have expected. Out on the public roads, there was more opportunity to delve deeper. There are several drive modes to choose from, but we limited ourselves to Normal and Sport, as most drivers aren’t likely to get too experimental with their Seal wranglings. Starting out in the more powerful 523bhp Excellence and regardless of drive mode, throttle response is almost aggressive. But it’s progressive enough for quick acclimatisation, and soon you’ll be delving into its performance without feeling the need to constantly exploit it. Take up is smooth and accompanied by a unobtrusive EV hum, and motorway cruising is hushed thanks to effective sealing and double glazing. However, if standing starts are your thing, then the Excellence model delivers. That 3.8 second 0-62mph time can be repeated ad nauseum. Two demonstration Seals on the drag strip had already had repeated full-bore acceleration tests at least 20 times by the time we climbed in, yet performance was unchanged. Try that in a Tesla Model 3 – you’ll get a quicker launch, twice, and then it’ll overheat. Get it away from the drag strip, and the Seal is even more impressive. Steering is quick and well-weighted, although in Sport mode, it’s probably a little too direct for most tastes. Dial it back to Normal mode and it’s still on the sharper side of normal with quite aggressive response around the straight ahead. Good thing, too, as in corners it feels neutral, turning-in responsively and with low levels of body roll to contend with. There are no steering wheel-mounted paddle controls, and any adjustments to regen are done within the settings menu – a shame because this can be a very useful feature. On a rain-affected test drive, it never felt anything other than confidence inspiring. Ride quality, is on the sporting side of comfortable. It’s very compliant that seems suited to UK roads, even if those who like a softer experience might be disappointer by some patter on irregular road surfaces. However, we noticed than the ‘semi active’ system in the Excellence model suffered from a little too much of this, failing to settle down fully at certain speeds. What’s it like inside? The Seal’s cabin is dominated by BYD’s 15.6-inch touchscreen infotainment system, complete with pirouetting party piece as it switches from portrait to landscape at the touch of a button. It works less well here than it does in taller vehicles, honestly, but still has its uses for those who appreciate a long forward view on their sat-nav. However, in portrait mode, there’s a bit of a letterbox effect as it gets uncomfortably close to the rear-view mirror. The system itself is fast and easy to use, and a model of simplicity and restrained design. The rest of the interior is also largely very successful. It feels suitably premium – moreso than the minimalist Model 3, actually – with a more inviting aesthetic and some very nice-looking trim materials. These including a very tactile flavour of suede, which lines the dash and door cards. But that extends throughout the entire cabin – everything you touch is swathed in either soft-touch plastic, suede or vegan leather, and the switchgear mostly feels good, though the crystalline gear selector is a little gauche, and the door pulls and column stalks feel disappointly plasticky. The seats are well shaped, nicely trimmed and they look good. They offer an interesting mix of softness and support, although some might find the boldly ‘BYD’-embossed headrests a little tacky. Practicality is where the Seal scores well, thanks to that compact blade battery taking less space beneath your feet than rivals’ less space-efficient power packs. There’s loads of legroom up front, as well as for rear passengers, where it easily matches the Model 3, and pulls clear of the Polestar 2. Headroom isn’t quite as generous due to the plunging roofline back there, though, but it could have been worse, with the vast (non-opening) panoramic glass roof clawing back that all-important inch or two. Finally, a nice flat floor means there’s a lot of footroom in the rear, although disappointingly, you can’t tuck your feet very far under the front seats. Boot space is an okay-ish 402 litres, with a similarly narrow loading aperture to the Model 3. We’d have preferred a hatchback, of course, and wonder why this fastback design couldn’t wasn’t conceived that way. There is a 53-litre lidded ‘frunk’ that should make tidying up charging cables a little easier, though. When can I buy one? The Seal will launch in the UK towards the end of 2023 and. youcan order one now in the aforementioned two versions. This will be followed by a smaller-battery version in 2024, which should bring the entry price down further. Speaking of which, the Seal is priced slightly below the equivalent Tesla, although because there is no entry-level version as yet, it relies on similar performance but glitzier specs to justify its £45k starting price. However, the jump to the AWD Excellence model isn’t huge, and well worth the small uplift. Speaking of which, BYD has published PCP and PCH finance figures for the car, and currently, they’re around the same level as the BMW i4 and someway above the Model 3. Expect those to head south, as the car becomes more familiar in the UK. Verdict It’s a very impressive package, balancing efficiency, performance, good looks and generous equipment levels very well indeed. Dynamically, it’s impressive, with incisive steering and sharp handling – and a firm suspension set-up that will appeal to sportier drivers. The Design makes a lot of sense. It’s cheaper, doesn’t feel that much slower on the road, goes about 20 miles further on a charge and also rides with a little more consistency. However, given that on current finance figures, there’s only £20 or so per month between them, so the added performance and equipment of the Excellence are well worth it. A lot depends on the dealer back-up, though. Also important is how they treat their customers while the network grows, but if BYD gets this right, while continuing to offer the super-short lead times it offers with the Atto 3, then the Seal looks very tempting. In an era where brand loyalty melts away as buyers become increasingly comfortable in an era of start-ups, recommending BYD’s bold new sports saloon doesn’t look as daft as it might have done 10, even five, years ago. As it stands, it’s a convincing proposition against a Model 3, Polestar 2, BMW i4 or Ioniq 6. It’s more reponsive than the Hyundai, roomier than the Polestar and feels more luxurious than the Tesla. But the early signs are there, and the rest of the car looks very good indeed. That is quite a reflection of the astonishing pace the Chinese motor industry has moved towards a dominant position in the electric car market.

    "originBody": "AARIAN MARSHALL GREGORY BARBER BUSINESSNOV 17, 2023 6:00 AM Why Teslas Totaled in the US Are Mysteriously Reincarnated in Ukraine Ukraine’s fearless and expert EV mechanics bring electric vehicles declared unfixable in the US and Canada back to life on the other side of the world. PHOTO-ILLUSTRATION: WIRED STAFF; GETTY IMAGES THIS SUMMER, A Vancouver car mechanic named Max got a perplexing ping on his phone: Betty White was in Ukraine and needed his help. This was surprising because she had died on a Canadian highway back in January. When Max last saw Betty White, his nickname for his Tesla Model Y Performance, they were both in rough shape after getting sideswiped on the highway. Max’s rotator cuff was torn in several places. The small SUV had bounced off multiple concrete barriers at high speed and was bashed in on all four corners, its wheels ripped to pieces. Coolant appeared to be leaking into the battery chamber. From his own work on EVs in the garage, Max knew that Betty was done for. “No auto shop would put a repair person at risk with that kind of damage,” says Max, whose last name isn’t being used out of doxing concerns. A damaged EV battery can become dangerous due to the risk of shocks, fire, and toxic fumes. His insurer agreed, and Betty was written off and sent to a salvage yard. Months after he had last seen the car, Max’s Tesla app was now telling him that Betty needed a software update. It showed the car with an extra 200 kilometers on the odometer, fully charged, and parked in Uman, a town in Ukraine’s Cherkasy Oblast, midway between Kyiv and the front line with Russia’s invasion force. Minutes after that first ping, the app showed the car in service mode, suggesting Betty was undergoing repairs. “I thought it must be a mistake,” Max says. There was no mistake. WIRED tracked Betty down to a Ukrainian auto auction website, looking good as new, maybe even better, with newly tinted windows and rearview mirrors wrapped in black. Betty 2.0 was being sold by “Mikhailo,” who wrote that the car had suffered “a small blow” in Canada and been repaired with original Tesla parts. The price, $55,000, was roughly the same as a new Model Y Performance costs in the US. 1 / 5 COURTESY OF MAX Early this year a Tesla Model Y nicknamed Betty White got into a high speed crash in Vancouver.

For a long time, cars written off in North America have found their way to Eastern European repair shops willing to take on damage that US and Canadian mechanics won’t touch. In 2021, the most recent data available, Ukraine was a top-three destination for used US passenger vehicles sent overseas, close behind Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates. And Ukraine’s wreck importers and repairers are particularly known for their ingenuity. Some have made fixing EVs written off across the Atlantic into a specialty, helping to drive a surge in the number of electric vehicles on the country’s roads, even as the war with Russia rages. Though few automakers sell new EVs in Ukraine, the share of newly registered vehicles that are fully electric, 9 percent, is about the same as in the US and nearly double that of neighboring Poland and the Czech Republic. Most of Ukraine’s refurbished EVs come from North America, and many arrive with major damage. There’s a ready supply of crashed North American EVs in part because electrics are becoming more common, and also because in recent years, relatively new EVs with low mileage have been written off at a higher rate than their gas-powered equivalents, according to data from insurers. US and Canadian repair shops and insurers see them as more dangerous and difficult to fix. Scrapyards find it hard to make money from their parts and instead ship them abroad.

His five-year-old repair business in Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine, fixes about 100 Teslas a month, roughly a fifth of them from overseas, and employs a staff that varies between six to 10 people. He’s currently away from home, serving with the Armed Forces of Ukraine, but he manages his workers, and sometimes makes software-mediated repairs, remotely. “We have problems in our lives and can fix them, whether a battery or a full-scale invasion,” says Malakhovsky. “Electric cars, electric car batteries—it’s no problem.” An electric vehicle battery is made up of thousands of individual cells, which store and release energy. Sometimes, Malakhovsky says, he and his coworkers will break up large EV batteries damaged beyond repair and repurpose the cells to power electric scooters or even drones for the war effort. He says the vast majority of Teslas on Ukrainian roads were once involved in wrecks in North America.

Ukraine has a public charging network of some 11,000 chargers, according to Volodymyr Ivanov, the head of communications at Nissan Motor Ukraine—that’s more than the state of New York, and double the number in neighboring Poland. Since 2018, Ukraine’s government has removed most taxes and customs duties on used EV imports. In the US, electric vehicles tend to be expensive, and the average EV driver is still a high-income male homeowner. North American wrecks, Ukraine’s EV incentives, and its relatively low electricity prices have created a different picture. “There is a joke here that all poor people are driving electric cars, and all the rich people are driving petrol cars,” says Malakhovsky. “Tesla is a common-people, popular car because it’s very cheap in maintenance.” That’s a relatively recent development, says Hans Eric Melin, head of Circular Energy Storage, a UK-based consultancy that tracks the international flows of used EVs and batteries. He began watching the Ukraine market in particular a few years ago, after he noticed more ads for Nissan Leafs on auction sites listed in Ukrainian than in English. At the time, the Leaf, a pioneer among EVs, was essentially the only one that had been around long enough to develop a healthy used market. Over time, Ukraine’s electric fleet grew to encompass the full range of EVs sold around the world, including Teslas, as more cars hit the roads and aged or got into crashes. Melin had suspected Ukraine’s EV boom would end with the war. “I was completely wrong,” he says. By this summer, Ukraine’s EV fleet had doubled since July 2021, to 64,312, according to data compiled by the Automotive Market Research Institute, a Ukrainian research and advocacy group.

ROMAN TYSCHENKO, A 25-year-old IT worker who lives in Kyiv, decided last September that he was sick of his Jeep’s $400-a-month gas bill. Friends had purchased used, damaged electric cars on an online auction website called Copart, a US-based public auto reseller with 200 locations around the world. He logged on and spent $24,000 on a gray 2021 Tesla Model Y that had taken a solid blow to its passenger side in Dallas, Texas. Its bumper was almost fully detached; its hood was tented; some of its airbags had deployed. That Texan Model Y was likely declared totaled by an insurer. From there, it probably moved to a salvage auction in the US, where licensed exporters, salvage shops, and repairers tried to figure out how much value they could squeeze out of the wreck. The winner, or perhaps the insurer itself, listed the car on Copart, which made it available to anyone around the world who wanted a smashed-up Tesla and was willing to pay for shipping. Roman Tyschenko's Tesla Model Y gets a facelift at a Ukrainian repair shop. COURTESY OF ROMAN TYSCHENKO If Tyschenko hadn’t brought the Texan Tesla to Ukraine himself, it had a good chance of being shipped there anyway by someone who professionally flips cars to countries like Ukraine. These exporters look for wrecks potentially worth more than their scrap value, but little enough that an expensive US repair and resale wouldn’t make sense. Some ship vehicles directly to Ukrainian repairers and pay for the fix, while others import damaged cars and relist them for sale to Ukrainian buyers who can figure it out for themselves. It takes a damaged North American car between one and five months to reach a nearby port. Before the war, wrecked cars headed to Ukraine’s Port of Odessa on the Black Sea. Since Russia invaded in 2022, they come through Klaipėda in Lithuania on the Baltic Sea, or Koper in Slovenia on the Adriatic, and are brought to Ukraine by truck. A shop like Malakhovsky’s can fix a Tesla in somewhere between one week and one year, depending on the damage.

The technician sent him videos of the EV’s ongoing revamp every few weeks, and Tyschenko stopped by to visit a handful of times. By May, he had paid the technician some $25,000 for his work and was driving the Model Y around Kyiv. Content To honor your privacy preferences, this content can only be viewed on the site it originates from. Two months later, the battery died and Tyschenko spent another $4,000 to replace it—a demonstration of the risks of electric vehicle rescues. Still, he’s happy with how things worked out, and now pays just $10 to $100 a month to refuel his car, depending on whether he charges at home or at public stations. Finding parts to repair Teslas and other EVs can be a challenge. On Facebook and Telegram, groups like “Renault Zoe Club Ukraine” host thousands of EV owners who barter with each other for spare parts. Oleksandr Perepelitsa, a 25-year-old electric vehicle repairer in Kyiv, says that when he first began his work three years ago, he and his business partners would buy two wrecked Teslas from overseas to create a single working vehicle to sell to local Ukranians. “Even that was profitable for us,” he says. Now, business connections can send Tesla parts from the US or Europe, or repairers buy cheaper Chinese reproductions.

THE SUCCESS OF Ukraine’s EV resurrection industry is the flip side of the failure of insurers and manufacturers in North America to figure out what to do when a shiny new EV becomes roadkill. US insurers are more willing to write off vehicles of all kinds that in the past may have been fixed. New vehicle repairs have gotten more expensive, in part due to vehicles getting more complex and computerized, as well as a shortage of vehicle technicians. In the past decade, the damaged cars up for auction “are better and less damaged,” Copart CEO Jeff Liaw told investors on an earnings call this year. MOST POPULAR CULTURE Taylor Swift and Beyoncé Are Resurrecting the American Movie Theater ANGELA WATERCUTTER BACKCHANNEL The Mirai Confessions: Three Young Hackers Who Built a Web-Killing Monster Finally Tell Their Story ANDY GREENBERG SECURITY Google’s New Titan Security Key Adds Another Piece to the Password-Killing Puzzle LILY HAY NEWMAN GEAR 13 Best Deals at Target’s Black Friday Sale MEDEA GIORDANO Industry-wide data is hard to come by, but numerous sources suggest that EVs are more likely to be written off than gas-powered cars, and can be declared unfixable after even minor crashes. A Reuters analysis this year found that a “large portion” of damaged EVs sold for scrap were low-mileage, nearly-new vehicles. While one in 10 new cars sold in the US and Canada this year are forecasted to be electric, the infrastructure and expertise needed to assess and fix damaged EVs can be patchy. “In an ideal world, electric vehicles are as easy to repair as internal combustion engine vehicles,” says Mark Fry, research manager at Thatcham Research, which crunches auto market data for insurers and other clients. It recently found British EVs get written off at disproportionately high rates. The main reason EV repairs are so tricky comes down to a lack of agreement on how to handle EV batteries after a crash. Worldwide, there is no industry standard for measuring battery health. Vehicle manufacturers sometimes refuse to sanction battery repairs because of liability concerns. “If you repair the battery, what's it going to be like after another two, three years and another 50,000 miles?” Fry says. It’s easier to let nearly new vehicles be declared dead than to find out. The North American scrap industry is also somewhat leery of EVs, says Megan Slattery, a researcher at UC Davis who studies what happens to damaged EV batteries. Scrap businesses generally make money by taking cars apart to extract the most valuable widgets to resell. But dismantling a battery takes dedicated workers, equipment, and—most important of all—space, due to the fire risks of storing lithium-ion cells. Many mom-and-pop dismantlers don’t have any of that. Plus, EVs tend to have simpler drivetrains, with more plastic and large, prefabricated body components that can’t be easily pulled apart. In some electric vehicles, the battery is built directly into the car’s structure, making it especially difficult to dismantle or repair. All of that means that exporters looking to sell to eager buyers abroad have less competition when bidding on totaled cars. In the US, there’s increasing pressure to keep broken EVs from heading overseas. Regulators are concerned about safety, hoping to better track broken batteries through shipping channels as fears rise of fires sparked by used EVs, including on cargo ships. Another is to avoid dumping e-waste on countries without the means to recycle or repurpose, and instead keep the valuable minerals inside batteries local. Battery recycling startups have received vast amounts of private and public investment—both in Western Europe and the US, with funds from the Inflation Reduction Act—with a promise to help shore up raw material supply chains. But so far, they have received only a trickle of used batteries.

More stringent European Union export rules for used cars and EV batteries in particular are one reason why the supply of Teslas to Eastern Europe is so dependent on North American wrecks. Without them, the electric revolution would be much less advanced in places like Ukraine, where US and Canadian write-offs have helped support the emergence of charger networks, trained repair specialists, and a wide familiarity and acceptance that electric propulsion is not just green but also practical. In North America, there's a widespread belief that “people don't want electric vehicles and that it's just laws and regulations that push us to buy them,” says Melin, the used EV analyst. “There are other markets that want to have electrics.” It’s a testament to a system that is working, Melin adds, that used EVs end up in places like Ukraine, where new models are difficult to come by. For Max in Vancouver, Betty White’s reappearance overseas did cause some headaches. The car was still logged into his Google, Netflix, and Spotify accounts, potentially allowing the new owners to access his personal data. When he asked Tesla support, he was advised to change his passwords, Max says. (Tesla did not respond to WIRED’s questions.) But looking back on the crash, and now driving a new Model Y—named Black Betty—Max says his old car’s resurrection is the best possible outcome. “I’m happy to see that Betty White has lived to see another day,” he says.

    "originBody": "In what I think is a world record, a Tesla Model S owner has driven his car nearly 1.2 million miles. Here's how this incredible feat was achieved. Posted: November 16, 2023 - 4:54PM Author: Jeremy Johnson 1.2 Million Miles In a Tesla Model S A Model S P85, has driven about 200,000 km (about 124,274 miles) each year all across Europe. In one year, the owner has driven what many people do for the lifetime of their vehicle. Keep in mind that this is a Tesla Model S P85, and it is mentioned that he reached the 1 million km mark back in 2019. That means he bought the car around 2014, about when the Model S was first coming out. According to Matthew Santoro on X.com, his car is a single motor rear-wheel drive Model S. Major Repairs of the 2014 Model S Apparently, the vehicle has had the following major changes and repairs since driving a total of 1.9 million km (close to 1.2 million miles): At least three battery packs replaced Eight electric motors replaced 60 sets of tires This is how it was possible to go this far - it's a matter of making sure the primary functions are working (motors and batteries) and changing tires when necessary. The first electric motor lasted 800,000 km (497,000 miles). That's a very impressive feat! Word on X.com says that he stopped talking about battery replacements after he changed the 2nd battery and moved on to the 3rd. I put in the 60 sets of tires changed because I am assuming he changed tires around every 20,000 miles. It's possible he had tires last longer than that, but I haven't found anyone who knows that information. The Owner Of This Model S The owner of this Model S, Hansjörg von Gemmingen, says he wasn't quite happy with how the Tesla performed and having to replace eight electric motors and is considering a Lucid Air for the future. The good news for Tesla is that their electric motors and batteries have greatly improved and most likely in Tesla's bought today, the battery and electric motor will outlive the car. Still, it's impressive the car frame has held up for 1.2 million miles. Wow! He's Been Documenting His Journey For Years Apparently, Hansjörg has been documenting his journey for years as he travels all across Europe. I have reached out to Hansjörg to see if he will accept an interview to talk more about his incredible journey in his 2014 Model S.

Toyota, Lexus, BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce customers will have access to more than 12,000 Tesla Superchargers across the United States and Canada. The automakers joins a list of other companies that have struck similar deals with Tesla in recent months including Volvo, Ford, General Motors, Nissan, Polestar, Rivian and Mercedes-Benz. Toyota will incorporate the NACS ports into certain Toyota and Lexus BEVs starting in 2025, including the all-new, three-row, battery-electric Toyota SUV that will be assembled at Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky. Additionally, customers owning or leasing applicable Toyota and Lexus vehicles equipped with the Combined Charging System (CCS) will be offered access to an adapter to enable NACS charging starting in 2025. advertisement advertisement There are six fully electric BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce models now available in the U.S. market, and more to come, says Sebastian Mackensen, president & CEO, BMW of North America \"It is our top priority to ensure that our drivers have easy access to reliable, fast charging,” Mackensen says in a release. “This agreement is the latest in our longstanding and continued effort to expand charging options for our customers as we continue on the road to electrification.” Toyota says its goal is to provide convenience no matter where customers choose to charge their vehicles. Through the Toyota and Lexus apps, customers have access to a charging network of over 84,000 charging ports in North America, including level 2 and DC fast chargers. With NACS, customers will have access to more charging options, especially DC fast chargers, allowing greater confidence to travel to even more destinations. This agreement is independent of BMW’s recently announced commitment with six other automakers to create a joint venture company that will build a new, high-powered electric vehicle charging network in North America. The new joint venture will build at least 30,000 new chargers in metropolitan areas and along major highways, which will be accessible to drivers of all battery electric vehicles from any automaker using CCS or NACS charging standards. The yet-to-be-named joint venture is expected to be established this year, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. automotive, green eco-friendly, partnership, technology Comment Next story loading UPCOMING EVENTS Email Insider Summit December 3 - 6, 2023 Stein Eriksen Lodge at Deer Valley Resort, Park City, UT Featuring top industry speakers including: Brenton Downey - Hello Fresh, Senior Director, CRM Correy Honza - RVO Health, Senior Director of Consumer Marketing YOU MAY ALSO LIKE...

    "originLink": "https://insideevs.com/news/696594/gm-buys-tesla-gigacasting-partner-tei/",
    "originBody": "NEWS REVIEWS SHOP CARS FORUM USA / GLOBAL Home News GM Quietly Gets Into The Gigacasting Game After Buying Key Tesla Supplier The move should help General Motors lower the cost of its upcoming EVs. Nov 16, 2023 at 1:04pm ET By: Iulian Dnistran General Motors acquired one of the most well-regarded sand-casting specialists in the world – and one of Tesla’s rapid prototyping partners – earlier this year, quietly entering the gigacasting game, as shown in a Reuters report published by Automotive News. Tooling & Equipment International, or TEI, has worked with Tesla to develop gigacasting mold prototyping for the Model Y, Model 3, Cybertruck, and Semi, all while dramatically cutting development time and costs during the process. By using casts made out of industrial sand with 3D printing, TEI, along with three other suppliers, helped Tesla halve the time it takes to develop a car from the ground up, going from three to four years to 24 months at most. GM And EVs GM And Honda Ditch Plans To Make Cheap Electric Cars Together GM Delays Chevrolet Equinox EV Market Launch But not anymore. Since July 2023, TEI has become part of GM’s Global Manufacturing division which oversees all of GM’s automobile and parts manufacturing operations, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. \"General Motors acquired Tooling & Equipment International (TEI) to bolster its portfolio of innovations and secure access to unique casting technology,\" GM said in a statement. The American car manufacturer first came in contact with TEI’s know-how when it approached the supplier to test and produce some underbody castings for the upcoming $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq, a source told Reuters. As luck would have it, TEI won the 2023 Casting of the Year award from the American Foundry Society for those Celestiq castings. General Motors isn’t the only so-called legacy automaker to go down the gigacasting path that Tesla carved. Earlier this year, Toyota announced that it too will employ the technique for its next-gen electric vehicles which are expected to hit the road in 2026. Volvo, Ford, and Hyundai are also going down this route. Gigacasting essentially means that a car has fewer but bigger metal components, which reduces complexity and manufacturing costs. Where a current vehicle might have a front subframe assembly made out of dozens of individual parts, a next-gen vehicle might have a single-piece subframe thanks to gigacasting. Mind you, TEI was not responsible for the massive die-casting machines that Tesla is using in its factories. Instead, it – and others like it – makes test molds out of industrial sand using digital design files and 3D printers known as binder jets. These build a sand mold that can then cast molten alloys. Compared to legacy casting techniques, this prototyping method enables a sand mold to be modified and reprinted quickly if adjustments are needed, with minimal cost.
