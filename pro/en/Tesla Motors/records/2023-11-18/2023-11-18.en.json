    "originBody": "Autoblog Partner PARTNER Elon Musk started a price war that Tesla can't win INSIDER Nov 18th 2023 at 7:00AM Elon Musk has started an electric-vehicle price war that Tesla can't finish. Under increasing pressure from new competition, Tesla spent the past year slashing the average price of its models by roughly 25%. The Model 3 fell from $48,000 to $44,380. The luxury Model S, meanwhile, plunged from a high of $130,000 to $96,380. The cars, as they say, have been priced to move. It's an unusual business strategy, to put it mildly. \"I can't think of another point in the history of automotive when a brand that wasn't going out of business cut prices 20% a year,\" Mark Schirmer, the director of communications at the research firm Cox Automotive, told me. Tesla is hoping that lower prices will drive up sales and slow the advance of the company's rivals — maybe even scare some of them out of the market altogether. But that's not what's happening. Lower prices are not translating into higher sales. The number of cars Tesla delivered to customers in the third quarter actually declined. Revenue is dropping, and the company's once fat profit margins are getting squeezed — down to 17.9% in the third quarter, compared with 25.1% a year ago. Competitors aren't being driven out of business, either. Once totally dominant in the EV space, Tesla's share of the US market has fallen from 62% at the beginning of the year to only 50% today. To make matters worse, the public's appetite for EVs isn't growing as fast as automakers expected. That means Tesla has set off a protracted battle for a piece of a pie that's growing crumb by crumb. \"If you do the price war, you have to make sure you have enough volume to increase and maintain profitability,\" John Zhang, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School, said. \"It has to be a continuous battle. This war you have to wage all the way. And you need to plan ahead. That's how you win.\" Conversely, some experts will tell you that price wars are unwinnable — that they're a race to the bottom that serves only to kill profitability for the entire industry. And in an industry where the underlying technology — and, thus, the costs of production — are changing rapidly, no one can be sure where the bottom is. Winnable or not, Musk chose a terrible time to pick a fight. As legacy automakers walk the tightrope to our electric future, they can rely on sales of their traditional combustion-engine vehicles to provide them with a safety net. Tesla has no safety net. For Musk, it's go electric, or bust. Tesla creates a cash problem — again Musk's decision to offer deep discounts on his vehicles was an act of pure desperation. That became apparent earlier this month when Tesla reported its third-quarter numbers. The results were frightful across the board: Tesla missed Wall Street's expectations on revenue, vehicle deliveries, and free cash flow, which was down to $848 million from $3.4 billion a year before. Most importantly, the company reported that its gross margins — a measure of the company's profitability after costs — continued to shrink. This horrified investors who had just gotten used to Tesla making money. Over the past two years, despite Tesla's addition of more moderately priced vehicles such as the Model 3 sedan and the Model Y compact SUV, its margins have grown to be some of the fattest in the car business. That has bolstered the argument that Tesla wasn't a traditional car company such as Ford or GM and deserved its much, much higher stock price. Naturally, this is a status Musk would like Tesla to keep, so he's promised to do everything he can to cut costs. (On the conference call on third-quarter earnings, he said it's like \"'Game of Thrones,' but with pennies.\") Unfortunately, cost cuts can't be spoken into existence, not even by Musk. In the third quarter, Tesla's capital expenditures actually ballooned to their highest level in a year — $2.4 billion, up from $1.8 billion a year ago. If prices are going down, and costs are going up, even the most fervent of Musk's Wall Street believers will tell you that margins don't have a prayer. Months into his pricing campaign, Musk has nothing to show for it, and no plans to change. Musk gave no indication of when this cash drought would end or how margins would improve. He could not say when the company's Cybertruck would be available to the public and even admitted that Tesla had \"dug its own grave\" trying to build the new vehicle. He also could not provide details on when there would be a meaningful update to the aging models that currently make up Tesla's fleet. But there was one thing Musk was clear on: Prices need to keep coming down. In a call that Wall Street widely acknowledged as one of Tesla's worst in some time, it was like a mantra Musk repeated over and over again, with a certainty borne more of faith than facts. \"So I just can't emphasize again how important cost is,\" Musk said. \"It's not an optional thing for most people. It is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable so that people can buy them.\" The only real hope Musk offered investors was a suggestion that driverless-car technology would (eventually, someday) offset Tesla's falling prices. But how exactly the math would work on that trade-off was unclear. Months into his pricing campaign, Musk has nothing to show for it, and no plans to change. The market responded to Musk's disappearing profits by dragging Tesla's stock down 15%. The whole EV market is in a cash bleed Tesla's dismal results illuminated Musk's short-term reason for the desperate pricing strategy. But the underlying reason is even more alarming: Despite increasing demand and bountiful government investment, the world's transition from gas to electric cars is not going as smoothly as automakers expected. Experts will tell you with certainty that EVs are the future and that internal-combustion engines will eventually disappear from America's driveways and parking lots. But the march to electrified highways isn't proceeding in a straight line. There are two main reasons that consumer appetite for EVs hasn't been as robust as automakers initially expected. One is the uneven way new technologies are adopted; it inevitably takes awhile to sell people on even the most amazing innovation. The other is the slowing global economy. Customers around the world have become more price-sensitive, which is bad news for EVs: While the average selling price of an electric vehicle is going down — from $65,000 last year to $53,633 in July — it's still higher than the average selling price for new vehicles overall, which hovers around $48,451. While other automakers like Ford and BMW can coast on older models, Tesla doesn't have that option. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Traditional carmakers, from Ford and GM to BMW and Mercedes, have responded to the EV price challenge by doing what they do best: building the gas cars that customers still want. \"Ford is able to balance production of gas, hybrid, and electric vehicles to match the speed of EV adoption in a way that others can't,\" John Lawler, Ford's chief financial officer, said during the company's latest earnings call. \"That's obviously good for customers, who get the products they want — and good for us, too, because disciplined capital allocation and not chasing scale at all costs maximizes profitability and cash flow.\" But while the traditional automakers can coast on their older models, Tesla doesn't have that option. Cue the price cuts. \"Musk's starting a price war,\" Schirmer of Cox Automotive said. \"I do think there was nothing else he could do, in that he doesn't have anything really new to compete against these other companies. He says it isn't because he has a demand problem. But I've been in this business a long time, and I have never seen anyone cut prices without having a demand problem.\" Musk's goal to undercut the rest of the market on price is no secret — and it's made other car companies none too happy. Given the uncertainty around the future of EVs, almost every other automaker is reluctant to slash prices on their models because doing so would make continued investment in EV tech an even tougher business case to make. In April, Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's cuts could start an unsustainable price war. But the company still felt forced to cut the price of its Mustang Mach-E SUV at least twice this year. If Elon was smart, he would not drop the price. Instead, he should justify the cost of ownership. Many auto executives are refusing to engage in Musk's fight because they know from experience that the best way to win a price war is not to get into one in the first place. \"We have no interest in sinking prices to gain market share,\" BMW CEO Oliver Zipse said in a recent call with investors. \"That's not our strategy.\" There are other, more imaginative, more savvy ways to entice customers without a fire sale. During the 2008 recession, rather than slashing prices, Hyundai tried to figure out what was holding customers back from buying a new car. Turns out, it was worries over getting laid off. So Hyundai offered customers a guarantee: Anyone who bought a car and then lost their job could sell it back to the company. That's the kind of creative work-around that gets a car company through hard times unscathed. It's an exercise in market research and advertising. Tesla has given little indication that it does the former and has flatly rejected doing the latter. Musk has always maintained that his outsize public profile makes advertising for Tesla a waste. \"Rationally, he doesn't have to drop prices so fast. He can only delay the competition,\" Navdeep Sodhi, a managing director at the pricing consultancy Sodhi Pricing, said. \"If Elon was smart, he would not drop the price. Instead, he should justify the cost of ownership.\" Part of the point of advertising — and the reason investors are pushing Tesla to start spending money on it — is to educate customers about why Tesla's vehicles are worth their higher price tags. According to Sodhi, Tesla has a compelling argument to make about how much money EVs can save customers over time. Why slash prices if you can persuade customers to pay more? Building a market for a product such as an electric vehicle is a marathon, not a sprint. Traditional carmakers expect to lose money on their EVs for the foreseeable future. Tesla just became profitable in 2021. If it slides back into the red because of its price cuts, expect investors to run in another direction. A losing battle If the short-term point of Tesla's price cuts is to maintain its market share and sell more cars, it's not working. At the same time, the move could damage Tesla in the long term. When companies play with price, Zhang said, they're playing with customer expectations. Once customers get used to paying $40,000 for a standard EV, they're not going to go back to $60,000. In a price war, you may prompt a few more people to buy from you today, but you'll be sacrificing millions of dollars in future sales. Then there are all the customers who paid that $60,000 in the past. Learning that they could have saved thousands of dollars if they'd waited a few months to make their purchase has a negative impact on brand loyalty. In China, Tesla's price cuts even sparked protests among owners who paid more for their vehicles. Making cars is an expensive business, and if the price cuts don't generate more demand, Tesla's fortune could change rather quickly. But Musk isn't thinking about the future. He needs the money he hopes to make from price cuts — and he needs it now. Making cars is an expensive business, and if the price cuts don't generate more demand, Tesla's fortune could change rather quickly. \"If you have a factory that makes something and you're not selling it, you're losing huge money in automotive,\" Schirmer said. This is a moment when you want an experienced team of automotive executives at the helm of your company. Instead, Tesla is onboarding a new chief financial officer. Zach Kirkhorn — a Tesla veteran of 13 years who presided over the most profitable quarters in the company's history — stepped down as chief financial officer in August. According to company documents, his severance package included the kind of payoff and strict nondisparagement requirements that reek of a C-suite firing. In the end, price cuts won't be enough to drive sales. If Tesla is going to keep its business healthy, it needs to appeal to new customers beyond Musk fans and early adopters. It needs to conduct research and launch advertising that makes the right argument, to the right customers, that one of Tesla's four models is the right car for them. Discounting the sticker price may drive a few sales. But in the long run, you can't build a global automotive juggernaut without cash flow. Musk himself has admitted that Tesla narrowly evaded death by cash burn in both 2008 and 2018. Waging price war during a downturn is a challenge unlike any Tesla has faced before. The company has survived for years on a first-mover advantage, on being small and nimble, and on the willingness of investors to bail it out. But today's Tesla is increasingly a normal car company, with normal car-company problems. Musk's unfulfilled promises of robo-taxis and unmatched artificial intelligence may dazzle the market for a while, but they're not driving the sales Tesla needs to win the price war it started. The company has a growing fleet of competition, an expensive manufacturing process, and shareholders who have grown used to fat profits. If cutting prices is all Tesla can do to survive this new reality, it will continue to bleed money every time the rubber hits the road. And at some point, turning it around may no longer be an option. Linette Lopez is a senior correspondent at Insider.

    "originBody": "TECH ·TESLA Total your Tesla? It might be in Ukraine, where an electric-vehicle resurrection industry is thriving BYSTEVE MOLLMAN This Tesla Model Y won't be shiny and new forever—and it could end up in Ukraine. BRANDON BELL/GETTY IMAGES New Teslas are an increasingly common sight on North American roads, but they don’t stay new forever—and some get into accidents. If one takes more damage than is worth fixing, insurers might send it to a scrapyard. But a scrapyard might not want damaged Teslas either. It’s much harder to make money from the relatively few parts that go into electric vehicles than gas-powered ones, and there’s the added potential that its batteries may spontaneously catch fire. So from a scrapyard, a damaged Tesla might be shipped to a buyer overseas. But where do such vehicles end up? These days, the answer might well be Ukraine. As Wired reports, the war-torn nation has a thriving electric-vehicle resurrection industry, even as it battles Russia. Ivan Malakhovsky, who owns a repair business in Ukraine, told the publication that most Teslas driven in Ukraine were once involved in wrecks in North America. And when an EV battery is damaged beyond repair, his team will sometimes break up its cells to reuse them in drones on the battlefield, or simply in electric scooters. But EV batteries can pose dangers, as a high-end-vehicle scrapyard in Rancho Cordova, Calif., learned a few months ago, when a Tesla Model S spontaneously caught fire after sitting idle for three months. The vehicle had been salvaged “due to flooding from Florida,” Metro Fire of Sacramento wrote on X. After Hurricane Ian hit Florida in September last year, the fact that saltwater can cause EV batteries to catch fire later gained more attention. An EV battery that becomes ruptured during a collision can also catch fire. “Alarmingly, even after the car fires have been extinguished, they can reignite in an instant,” U.S. Senator Rick Scott wrote to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “Sadly, some Florida homes which survived Hurricane Ian have now been lost to fires caused by flooded EVs.” As the National Fire Protection Association notes, EV fires “are less common of an occurrence” compared to traditional vehicles, but are “more complicated of an event, since EVs fires can last longer and have the potential for electrical shock and reignition.” It adds, “the potential for fire-related hazards associated with the lithium-ion batteries that power these forms of transport is real and often underestimated.” In the Rancho Cordova scrapyard, “the vehicle was just sitting by itself, not around anything else,” Capt. Parker Wilbourn of Metro Fire told CBS13 News in Sacramento. “Nothing else could have potentially started it.” As Metro Fire noted on X—while tagging Tesla CEO Elon Musk—the Model S was “surrounded by millions of dollars in salvaged vehicles including Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bentleys.” When asked why it tagged Musk, the fire department responded, “Vehicles spontaneously combusting after sitting for weeks-months is a new challenge for both our community and fire suppression personnel. Thankfully this vehicle wasn’t inside a building.” Tesla, on its website, offers a “First Responders Information” page on how to deal with fires for each of its models. For a Model S that catches fire, it writes: “There must be no fire, smoke, audible popping/hissing, or heating present in the high voltage battery for at least 45 minutes before the vehicle can be released to second responders (such as law enforcement, vehicle transporters, etc.)…Always advise second responders that there is a risk of battery re-ignition.” In Ukraine, EV repair specialists like Malakhovsky seem willing to accept the potential risks. “We have problems in our lives and can fix them, whether a battery or a full-scale invasion,” he said. “Electric cars, electric car batteries—it’s no problem.” Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business.

    "originBody": "CYBERTRUCK NEWS VIDEOS Cybertruck updates: H2O rain testing, sharp 360° 4-wheel steering turn, production at Giga Texas By IQTIDAR ALI - NOVEMBER 18, 2023 131 0 -Advertisement- The Cybertruck Delivery Event is less than two weeks away. And that does not mean nothing is happening in the Tesla Cybertruck universe — of course, a lot is. In this post, we are going to share some important events, updates, and videos of the Cybertruck that have happened in the last few weeks on the road to the Cybetruck Delivery Event. Tesla is conducting the Cybertruck event at its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas which is home to the automaker’s global HQ as well. The space at Giga Texas wasn’t enough for the number of Tesla investors, influencers, and Referral Program prize winners, so Tesla had to conduct a random drawing to choose attendees. Cybertruck Rain Testing Tesla is now performing most of the in-house testing of the Cybertruck at Giga Texas. Last week, Tesla conducted the H2O/water pressure test also known as the Rain Test on the Cybertruck. Tesla has designed a container-like chamber to perform rain testing on its vehicles. This container is placed in the open area outside the production buildings. As we can see in the picture below, a water tank and multiple pumps are attached to this artificial rain-making container. It’s like a car wash but a bit different. We can also see that a Cybertruck is waiting on the ramp outside this rain-maker device to enter. Unfortunately, Giga Texas observer Joe Tegtmeyer wasn’t able to record the Cybertruck entering the container. According to Joe, this rainmaking device has been at Giga Texas since the start of this year (2023). Tesla has previously used this device to test Model Y electric SUVs for water/rain resistance. The H2O/Rain Test ensures a vehicle’s ability to resist water ingress to the vehicle’s cabin, frunk, and trunk during mild to heavy rain and or an off-road situation where the vehicle needs to go through splashes of water. Since deliveries are so close, hopefully the Cybertruck didn’t fail in this test. Tesla Cybertruck entering the artificial rain-making device at Giga Texas.

Cybertruck’s 360° Turn Before stopping for the rain test we’ve witnessed above, the Tesla Cybertruck took an impressive 360° turn. Although it’s not the same as the Rivian R1T Tank Turn, it’s still something Tesla can brag about — a wonder of the Cybertruck 4-wheel steering feature. Four circles of the water form as a Tesla Cybertruck takes a 360° turn on a wet surface before going for the H2O leak test at Giga Texas on 8th November 2023. Credit: Joe Tegtmeyer / YouTube (video above). We can see that four perfect circles are formed as the Cybertruck takes the 360-degree turn on the wet surface of the Giga Texas parking lot. It’s a timelapse video, so the Cybertruck has taken the turn slower than we see in the video above. According to the leaked Cybertruck specs, it’s an 18.6 feet (223.2 in) long pickup truck. This turning radius for such a large truck is truly impressive as well. Tesla began the development of the 4-wheel Cybertruck steering in 2021 after GMC announced Crab Mode for the then-upcoming Hummer EV pickup. Cybertruck Production Status Tesla is currently scaling up Cybertuck production at Giga Texas. Tesla CEO Elon Musk might release the actual number of Cybertrucks getting produced at the Tesla factory during the delivery event later this month. However, last week, a large number of Cybetruck underbody castings and door panels were spotted at Giga Texas. I counted the rows and columns of the castings and they are apparently 78 (the ones that are visible in the aerial photos by Joe Tegtmeyer). Elon Musk discussed about the Cybertruck production challenges during his Tesla (TSLA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call opening remarks. He said that it will probably take from 12 -18 months to scale Cybertruck production to a significant level. Until then, we should keep our expectations low. Cybertruck castings at Giga Texas today!

    "title": "Tesla worker voices concern over union strike in Sweden",
    "originLink": "https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-employee-laments-union-strike-sweden/",
    "originBody": "By Simon Alvarez Posted on November 17, 2023 Amidst the contrasting narratives surrounding the ongoing strike against Tesla in Sweden, there is one group that has mostly remained silent — Tesla’s employees themselves. And if a recent post from what appears to be a Tesla employee is any indication, it would appear that the company’s workers are getting quite exasperated with the union’s ongoing strikes. There are mostly two contrasting arguments in the escalating conflict between Tesla Sweden and IF Metall. The union claims that it is fighting to secure a collective agreement with Tesla for the sake of the company’s workers. Tesla, on the other hand, has claimed that it already offers “equivalent or better agreements than those covered by collective bargaining.” An opinion piece published in Nerikes Allehanda (NA), a daily newspaper in Sweden, suggested that Tesla employees are getting frustrated because nobody seems to be listening to the people who are actually working for the electric vehicle maker. The piece’s author clarified that Tesla workers are afraid, not of the electric vehicle maker, but of the union. Following is a translation of the Tesla employee’s opinion piece (translated using Google Translate). “Why is nobody listening to us who work at Tesla? You read that 130 car mechanics have gone on strike. The fact is that no one in Örebro has gone on strike at all. “Are we afraid? Absolutely not for our employer. Are we afraid of IF Metall? Yes, we are afraid of the union. I have received threats of dismissal from A-kassa. They have written that I am a traitor who does not stand up for my colleagues, etc. “I enjoy my job. In fact, Tesla is the best employer I have ever had. I used to work at another workshop that had a collective agreement, where we were much worse off, which is why I chose Tesla. “I chose Tesla because I want to be part of and contribute to a greener transition. Tesla is the car company that is responsible for the largest part of the green transition in Sweden, and I’m proud of it. “Why does IF Metall continue to threaten us all the time just because we democratically choose not to have a collective agreement? It is actually us service technicians (not car mechanics) who do not want a collective agreement. “The union threatens not to clean our facilities. Are we then to work in dirt and misery? Is it IF Metall’s agenda to make sure we feel bad at work? If Metall and their LO chairman, who thinks it is better that we are unemployed than that we are better off without a collective agreement. “Let us 137 service technicians vote on a collective agreement instead. Let democracy have its way. Is it the case that democracy does not exist in Sweden and in the trade unions anymore?” The battle between Tesla Sweden and IF Metall does not seem to be approaching its end yet. Just recently, IF Metall noted that it was looking to stop vehicle production at Giga Berlin, since a Swedish company that produces aluminum profiles for the Model Ys in the plant has become involved in a sympathy strike and blockade. Since the profiles are crucial for the Model Y’s crash safety, the production of the vehicle would get disrupted once the sympathy strike’s effects become evident. IF Metall strike general Veli-Pekka Säikkälä described the strategy. “There will be serious disruptions in production, and that is of course the aim… Without that detail, you cannot deliver the car… There is a very high risk that there will be serious disruptions in production, and that is, of course, the purpose for us to get Tesla to sign a collective agreement,” he said. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips. Just send a message to simon@teslarati.com to give us a heads up.

    "originBody": "As new leaks show the Cybertruck only has a 267-mile range, a picture has surfaced of a person trying to pump gas into the Cybertruck’s charge port. Given its range, would you be interested in an extended-range Cybertruck with an onboard gas generator? Posted: November 18, 2023 - 7:14AM Author: Tinsae Aregay A couple of days ago, there was a major Cybertruck leak demonstrating the vehicle’s unique door opening mechanism in action; showing the new stunning Cybertruck-specific “Cyber user interface”, and many more details. The level of access of the person videotaping the Cybertruck had suggests that it was filmed by a Tesla engineer in charge of testing the truck. Breaking: @Tesla Reveals It’ll \"Deliver First 10 Cybertrucks” to Customers at the November 30 Delivery Event. @elonmusk#tesla -https://t.co/0DL9lsid1N - pic.twitter.com/R6QdoNh8ZY — Torque News (@torquenewsauto) November 17, 2023 The video shares some major new information about the Cybertruck and there were even reports that Tesla was revoking Cybertruck delivery invites of anyone who shares the video online. However, those reports were later revealed to be untrue. Related News: Elon Musk Responds to Anti-Semitism Accusations Amid Pressure by Tesla Investors Whether Tesla takes action over this leak or not, one undeniable fact is that we have gotten a lot of new information. Especially the part of the video showing the Cybertruck’s new user interface has revealed the Cybertruck’s range number. Tesla’s onboard trip planner showed the Cybertruck will use a 6% charge to go 16 miles. If it takes a 6% charge to go 16 miles, then how far will a 100% charge take you in a Cybertruck? Doing some very basic math, we can extrapolate in a full charge the Cybertruck will go 267 miles. A few things to note here is that a lot of Tesla fans including myself were disappointed to see this number and have tried to debunk it by pointing out several possible reasons for the low range number. However, the truth is that from the video, we know that the Cybertruck was not towing anything and didn’t appear that it was going up some hilly mountainous road. First 8K Walk Around Video of a White Interior @Tesla Cybertruck Showcases Sub-10-Micron Level Impeccable Build Quality. @elonmusk#teslahttps://t.co/YxjfxT9Okx — Torque News (@torquenewsauto) November 11, 2023 And let’s not forget, as the hype for the Cybertruck pilled on expectations for the vehicle have increased. However, Tesla when it unveiled the vehicle back in November 2019 said, that there would be 3 variants of the Cybertruck. The 1st variant is rear-wheel-drive and will have a 250-mile EPA range, the second is dual-motor all-wheel-drive and has a 300-mile range, and the third is a tri-motor Performance and comes with a 500-mile range. If you say this was 4 years ago and plans for the Cybertruck have changed. I agree, however, Elon Musk in his recent appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience only a couple of weeks back has reiterated that a vehicle doesn’t need any more range than 250 miles. Musk’s reasoning was, if you are able to drive 80mph down a highway for 3 hours straight then you’re going to want to stretch your legs, maybe use a restroom, and get a bite to eat and in that time your vehicle will be charged and you’ll be able to go another 250 miles where you will want to repeat this process. Related News: Tesla’s 1st Ever YouTube Ad Shows a Model Y Getting Run Over by a Ford F-150 Pickup Truck This confirms it’s not outside the realm of possibilities for Tesla to produce a Cybertruck with a 267-mile range. Having said that, we know the onboard Tesla trip planner is a little bit conservative. We know that Tesla vehicles can go a few more miles after the trip planner shows zero miles left and there are other factors that force the vehicle to lowball the range estimates. Ford CEO Jim Farley Shares a Video of F-150 Lightning Going Toe-to-Toe With a @Tesla Cybertruk in 1st Off-Roading Show-Down. @elonmusk @jimfarley98 @Ford#teslahttps://t.co/dmhcdkVig0 — Torque News (@torquenewsauto) November 15, 2023 So let's be generous and putting these factors into play, let’s say the Cybertruck will have a 300-mile EPA-rated range. This gives the Cybertruck a run-of-the-mill range number in the electric pickup world. For example, in comparison, the Rivian R1T has battery options with a range of anywhere between 289 miles and 410 miles with the Max Pack option. And the Ford F-150 Lightning gets anywhere between 230 miles and 320 miles with the optional extended-range battery. Given the competition, an EPA-estimated range of around 300 miles is okay for the Cybertruck however, if you’re towing or carrying anything, this range quickly gets cut in half giving you a range of around 150 miles. At this point, the Cybertruck becomes unacceptable for anyone planning to go on trips and tow anything heavy. Especially given the fact that there aren’t currently a lot of pull-through superchargers which means every 150 miles you have to hook and unhook your trailer in order to be able to charge. This brings us neatly to new Cybertruck pictures that have hit the interwebs. As you can see above, the picture shows someone trying to pump gas into the Cybertruck’s charger port. Hope he’s using premium or the truck might not run properly! All jokes aside, the picture appears to be taken in a spirit of fun. This is not the first time a person has been spotted confused trying to refuel a Tesla through the charger port however, given the fact that the only Cybertrucks out on the road are being driven by Tesla engineers for testing and calibration, barring the world’s most incompetent employee, the picture by all accounts appears to be meant just for gags. Admittedly, seeing a Tesla at a gas station is an absurd proposition, however, it also raises an important question. Given the range numbers we’ve discussed above, would you be interested in an extended-range Cybertruck with an onboard gas generator? BREAKING: Tesla will also be releasing a hybrid version of the Cybertruck with an onboard generator, giving it unlimited mileage⛽📐 📸: Garrett S pic.twitter.com/Q2B3ERhIo4 — Drive Tesla 🇨🇦 (@DriveTeslaca) November 17, 2023 Last week, Ram showed off a brand-new electric vehicle with an onboard gas generator that will go on sale next year. According to Ram, this is not a hybrid and doesn’t have those complicated electric and mechanical powertrains. The new Ram is exclusively driven by the battery and electric motors and the gas generator's sole job is to recharge the onboard battery. Of course, this is not as ideal as having a pure EV with a long range however, Ram says using this approach they were able to increase the Ram 1500’s range from 145 miles to 690 miles. Most of the time, for most people at least, you don’t need to drive more than 145 miles a day however, when you’re going on that 800-mile trip towing a trailer a few times a year, you’ll fire up your generator and have a hassle-free trip. According to Ram, this is a necessary middle stop in our transition to all-electric vehicles. Ram says this is especially true for trucks which, unlike cars and SUVs, are meant to frequently carry heavy loads. So asking the question again, would you be interested in an extended-range Cybertruck with let’s say an 800-mile range? For now, there appears to be no sign that Tesla is considering offering such type of option however, we’ll be sure to keep you posted if Tesla’s plans change. Until then, make sure to visit our site torquenews.com/Tesla regularly for the latest updates. So what do you think? Did seeing someone trying to pump gas into a Tesla Cybertruck give you a chuckle? Also, what pros and cons do you see in offering an extended-range Cybertruck with an onboard gas generator? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

that high-end electric vehicles are more than just a fantasy. Still, when it comes to actually manufacturing these cars, the evidence continues to pile up that Tesla has more than its share of shortcomings. One Redditor posted a popular video on r/Wellthatsucks detailing all of the problems with his brand new $140,000 Tesla Model S Plaid.“I don’t understand,” he says while poking around the loose, unsecured door trim, front trunk, and more. “Can somebody please explain to me the build quality of Teslas?” “I understand Teslas are pretty much computers and they happen to manufacture vehicles,” he continues, “but the bits and pieces don’t fit, nothing is flush. It looks like toddlers put this together during recess.” The unhappy driver’s fellow Redditors were quick to weigh in. “Sister and her partner have a Model X,” one commenter writes. “The doors never close 100% making it absolutely horrible for your feet in winter.” “My friend has the same model,” another commenter adds. “Can confirm the same quality build. But he showed me the dash bends and moves just as bad!” “Some assembly is required!” writes a third. “All jokes aside, that must sting for the owner.” As for the reasons why this incredibly expensive car seemingly has so many issues, many commenters speculated that the company’s treatment of its employees was part of the problem. This is far from the first time that Teslas have made the internet buzz for their faultiness.The company is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for several crashes where self-driving Teslas ran into parked emergency vehicles, including one where the driver was killed.There have also been reports of Tesla steering wheels falling off while the car was in motion, and Tesla batteries spontaneously bursting into flames. Luckily for any prospective EV buyers, however, there are now many other EVs on the market that cost a fraction of Tesla’s asking price and don’t come with a litany of assembly and safety issues.

But he showed me the dash bends and moves just as bad!” “Some assembly is required!” writes a third. “All jokes aside, that must sting for the owner.” As for the reasons why this incredibly expensive car seemingly has so many issues, many commenters speculated that the company’s treatment of its employees was part of the problem. This is far from the first time that Teslas have made the internet buzz for their faultiness.The company is currently under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for several crashes where self-driving Teslas ran into parked emergency vehicles, including one where the driver was killed.There have also been reports of Tesla steering wheels falling off while the car was in motion, and Tesla batteries spontaneously bursting into flames. Luckily for any prospective EV buyers, however, there are now many other EVs on the market that cost a fraction of Tesla’s asking price and don’t come with a litany of assembly and safety issues.

Or follow us on Google News! Like all charging providers, EVgo is working hard right now to improve what the company is doing and make for a better driver experience. This continued in November with an advancement in EV charging construction speed and a deal with rental car company Hertz. Let’s take a look at each announcement and why they’re important! EVgo Uses Pre-Fabricated Stations To Speed Up Construction Time As we’ve reported before, EVgo is in a partnership with GM and Pilot Truck Stops (Which includes Flying J-branded truck stops). This partnership, along with others, has led to EVgo doing a lot of station construction, and often in situations where the layout is pretty much the same at every location. For the GM partnership, this involves multiple stations under an Ultium and Pilot or Flying J-branded canopy, much like the canopy that’s over the top of the gas pumps. When you do the same thing enough times, and know you’re going to do it again over and over, it makes sense to try to find ways to hurry the process along. In this case, EVgo’s doing something that Tesla has already been doing for a while, but the company is adapting and improving on it to make it work better for EVgo stations. By utilizing prefabricated modules, the aim is to cut the average installation time in half and save around 15% in construction costs at suitable sites. The design is also scalable, starting with six fast charging stalls per unit. This prefabrication module not only standardizes EVgo’s construction process and station layout, but also utilizes a modular skid. To make sure this approach actually nets the cost and time savings, this new approach is being tested in key markets around the United States. The EV driver experience is also elevated with numerous features, such as seamless integration of Wi-Fi infrastructure to enhance cellular connectivity. Prefabricated skids are designed to be future-proof, accommodating lighting, security cameras, and canopies for shade and protection from inclement weather (which should also mean better station reliability). Once installed, the skid frame is covered with synthetic turf, providing cushioning to safeguard connectors that will inevitably fall on them. Through prefabrication, EVgo assembles all charging equipment, including dispensers, power cabinets, and any necessary additional equipment, in a single base frame before shipping it to the fast charging site via semi-truck. This process enables EVgo to get stations up faster while also ensuring consistent, high-quality assembly in a controlled environment. Additionally, it allows for pre-commissioning at the fabrication facility, further expediting deployment timelines. One of the big advantage to all this is that the same skilled staff are doing the most complex tasks, and then leaving the normal electrical work for local electricians. This means that the stations should almost never suffer from problems that are caused by improper installation (a problem all charging providers have found to be more common than they’d hoped). “There are roughly 30,000 fast chargers in the U.S. today, and by 2030, industry analysts estimate we’ll need more than 300,000. Innovations like this prefabrication model are critical to scale EVgo’s network and build the infrastructure needed to meet the growing demand for public charging,” said Dennis Kish, EVgo COO. “Prefabricated stations can not only help us save time and cut costs, but also elevate the customer experience by providing popular features drivers want.” EVgo is currently implementing prefabrication projects in various locations across Florida, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Texas. The initial deployment of this innovative method will take place in Texas, with construction scheduled to start this month. The site aims to be open to the public by February 2024, and EVgo plans to do many more such installations next year. Discounted Charging For Hertz EV Renters Hertz and EVgo have recently partnered to introduce a special deal for drivers renting any EV model at a Hertz location nationwide, basically giving them one year of cheaper charging. But, before you run out and do a one day local rental to get in on it, keep in mind that it’s only available to new EVgo customers. “Hertz is committed to providing an exceptional rental experience and the widest choice of vehicles possible to meet our customer needs and preferences, including a variety of EVs at a range of price points,” said Wayne Davis, Chief Marketing Officer at Hertz. “We’re thrilled to partner with EVgo to provide our EV renters with more affordable and accessible charging options to support a smooth journey.” Hertz customers who are interested in taking advantage of this exclusive promotion with EVgo can find more information on the company’s website. For Hertz EV renters, signing up for this promotion is also possible in person. Just look for the QR code when renting the EV and associate it with a new EVgo account. “When people experience an EV for the first time, whether through a rental or riding along as a passenger, they see the benefits firsthand of quieter operation, smoother handling, quick acceleration, and of course, no tailpipe emissions,” said Maggie Tallman, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Solutions at EVgo. “By partnering with Hertz to expose new drivers to the electric experience, we can inspire more prospective EV drivers to make the switch and welcome them to the electric revolution.” It’s important to keep in mind that many people use rentals as a way to dip their toes into the water of EV ownership. If it doesn’t work out, they don’t have to go through the trouble of trading a car back in or terminating a lease. Renting locally or renting for a short road trip can help someone get a lot more information about how it works, and if they’re happy with it, they’d consider buying one. From EVgo’s perspective, it gives them an opportunity to snag some new customers when some of the renters turn around and buy an EV. With a discount to keep them visiting EVgo stations and the work of installing the app out of the way, EVgo’s hooked a new customer. From the customer’s perspective, it’s always nice to save a few bucks. Have a tip for CleanTechnica? Want to advertise? Want to suggest a guest for our CleanTech Talk podcast? Contact us here.
