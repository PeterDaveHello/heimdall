He also leaked personnel records and data about the company’s driver-assistance software. Credit... David B. Torch for The New York Times By Jack Ewing Published Nov. 10, 2023 Updated Nov. 13, 2023 A day after Lukasz Krupski put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location in Norway, seriously burning his hands and preventing a disaster, he got an email from Elon Musk. “Congratulations for saving the day!” Mr. Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, wrote in March 2019. But what started as a story about a heroic employee and a grateful employer has devolved into an epic battle between the carmaker and Mr. Krupski, a service technician. The fight has spawned lawsuits in Norway and the United States and caught the attention of regulators in several countries. After initially being hailed as a savior, Mr. Krupski said in an interview with The New York Times, he was harassed, threatened and eventually fired after complaining about what he considered grave safety problems at his workplace near Oslo. Mr. Krupski, originally from Poland, was part of a crew that helped prepare Teslas for buyers but became so frustrated with the company that last year he handed over reams of data from the carmaker’s computer system to Handelsblatt, a German business newspaper. The data contained lists of Tesla employees, including Mr. Musk, often with their Social Security numbers and other personal information. There were thousands of accident reports and other internal Tesla communications that Handelsblatt used as the basis for stories about flaws with the company’s Autopilot driver-assistance software.

Kenny Holston/The New York Times The data also provided the basis for stories by Handelsblatt and Wired magazine about how much trouble Tesla was having manufacturing the Cybertruck pickup, which the company has said will be delivered to customers at the end of this month, almost three years behind schedule. (Some of the information came from a second, unidentified Tesla employee.) Mr. Krupski said he had gotten access to sensitive data simply by entering search terms in an internal company website, raising questions about how Tesla protected the privacy of thousands of employees and its own secrets. The Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands, where Tesla has its European headquarters, is investigating whether the breach violated privacy laws. A spokeswoman for the authority confirmed that it was investigating but declined to comment further. Tesla and three lawyers representing the company did not reply to requests for comment. In the United States, Benson Pai, a former Tesla production worker, has sued the automaker in federal court in California, claiming that lax security by Tesla exposed employee information that could be sold to criminals. Lawyers for Mr. Pai are seeking approval from a judge to pursue the case as a class action on behalf of tens of thousands of Tesla employees. Image A Tesla location in Norway. Mr. Krupski said he had found sensitive company data by entering search terms in an internal website. Credit... David B. Torch for The New York Times Mr. Krupski shared the data with Aaron Greenspan, a prominent Tesla critic and short-seller, who urged him to provide information he had collected about Autopilot to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The safety agency has had a long-running investigation into the software, which can steer, accelerate and stop a car on its own but requires a driver to be ready to take control at any moment. The agency has interviewed Mr. Krupski several times, he said, an indication that his information was taken seriously. Mr. Greenspan said he had begun closing out his short positions in Tesla shortly after hearing from Mr. Krupski. The U.S. safety agency has confirmed that it is investigating whether Autopilot played a role in hundreds of accidents, some fatal, but declined to comment on any interactions with Mr. Krupski. Tesla has maintained that Autopilot makes cars safer and recently prevailed against a lawsuit that had claimed the software was responsible for a fatal crash in California. Mr. Krupski and Mr. Greenspan also wrote a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission raising questions about Tesla’s accounting practices, based in part on the data Mr. Krupski had collected. He said he did not know what the commission had done with the information. The S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Krupski remained anonymous until he spoke on the record to Handelsblatt last week. In the interview with The Times, Mr. Krupski, 38, said he was unemployed and had exhausted his savings. He has served Tesla with formal notice that he intends to sue for compensation, but cannot pursue the case further until he scrapes together enough money to pay a lawyer. Unlike lawyers in the United States, lawyers in Norway are not allowed to work on commission, collecting a share of any award if they win but nothing if they lose.

Ian Clontz for The New York Times Tormod Tingstad, an Oslo lawyer, is representing Mr. Krupski free of charge while they try to raise money. None of this could have been foreseen on March 30, 2019, when Mr. Krupski, who had been hired only a few months earlier, was part of a crew summoned on short notice to prepare Teslas for delivery to customers in Norway, where electric vehicles account for more than 80 percent of new car sales. Tesla, which sells cars directly to buyers, was using space in an exhibition hall near Oslo to deliver vehicles. Thousands of people were visiting a motor show in the same complex. Around noon, a charging device that another employee had improperly modified burst into flames beneath a Model 3 sedan. Mr. Krupski yanked the device away and, with his bare hands, pulled out wiring, pipes and other components that were burning and melting. He used rags and towels to suffocate the flames. “It is fair to say that if it wasn’t for his action, the result would have been a car on fire,” Mr. Krupski’s manager wrote in an email to Mr. Musk the next day. Mr. Krupski said the fire could have spread, endangering workers and customers waiting nearby and forcing evacuation of the motor show. The only person seriously injured was Mr. Krupski, who was hospitalized with severe burns but has recovered. After Mr. Musk congratulated Mr. Krupski, the technician replied with complaints about safety practices at Tesla’s Norwegian operation. On the day of the fire, he wrote, there were no fire extinguishers, cardboard boxes and other flammable material were strewn about, and employees were not briefed about where they would be working. “OK, please let me know if there’s anything we should still do,” Mr. Musk replied, according to a copy of the email included in legal documents prepared by Mr. Tingstad. But Mr. Krupski’s direct communications with the Tesla chief executive did not sit well with his bosses in Norway. According to Mr. Krupski, his supervisor began questioning his performance and telling him he had no future at Tesla.

Chiu/Associated Press “Long story short I am being fired,” Mr. Krupski wrote to Mr. Musk in late April 2019, less than four weeks after the fire. Mr. Musk replied, “I can’t read emails unless critical to Tesla.” That was the end of their correspondence. In the months that followed, Mr. Krupski said, he was threatened and harassed by co-workers and exiled to a basement. One co-worker threatened to stab him in the back with a screwdriver, he said. Mr. Krupski and other workers were furloughed during the pandemic, and he missed work because of stress-related health problems. Then, in 2022, he was fired after being accused of bad behavior and poor time management, and of being a negative influence. His bosses also said Mr. Krupski had taken pictures at a Tesla facility in violation of company policy. He said he had taken photos to document safety issues, which included use of a rolling table that employees put under a car when removing a battery. The table was designed to bear a maximum of 500 kilograms (about 1,100 pounds), Mr. Krupski said, while the batteries weighed substantially more. If a table collapsed, he said, workers could be seriously injured or killed. In a letter to Mr. Krupski’s lawyer, a Norwegian law firm representing Tesla said the company would dispute that he had been subject to retaliation. The letter accused Mr. Krupski of misappropriating company information and threatened to seek damages from him. Tesla has obtained an injunction from a Norwegian court ordering Mr. Krupski not to distribute any more company information. The court also seized his laptop and turned it over to Tesla. The company notified employees of the data breach on Aug. 18, about three months after it learned that Handelsblatt had the information. Information including work email addresses, compensation and Social Security numbers might have been leaked, Tesla told employees in an email, but said, “We have no evidence that any personal information was misused or will be used in a manner that could harm you.” Mr. Krupski said that he had suffered from depression, anxiety and sleeplessness as a result of his battle with Tesla, but that he felt relieved to no longer be anonymous. “I feel like just by going public I have a new rush of energy,” he said. “I have motivation that, OK, I can maybe start building my life again.” Noam Scheiber contributed reporting.

Tesla’s Model 2 is expected to be a hatchback, with the company offering options and upgrades similar to those available for its mid-priced cars and trucks — such as battery upgrades and service subscriptions.

Still, some budget car manufacturers like Honda and Hyundai are skeptical about Tesla’s proposed price point. “At this moment, a $25,000 [battery-powered EV] is difficult without compromising driving range,” Hyundai told CNBC in a statement. “Eventually, Hyundai expects [internal combustion engine] and [battery electric vehicle] models to reach price parity, but the exact timing is still unclear.” That said, there are plenty of other EVs — like the Chevy Equinox EV and the Vinfast VF7 — that are aiming for future price points in the same range as the Model 2.Join our free newsletter for cool news and actionable info that makes it easy to help yourself while helping the planet.

Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images Visitors wearing face coverings view the Telsa Cybertruck at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles in July 2020. Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images There is one person who can truly relate to the onslaught of criticism Tesla has faced surrounding its yet-to-be-released Cybertruck and it's an 85-year-old Italian man. That octogenarian is Giorgetto Giugiaro, the legendary car designer behind the Lotus Esprit, BMW M1, and most notably, the DeLorean DMC-12. The iconic sports car immortalized in the Back to the Future series faced a series of critiques in 1981 that are remarkably similar to those being leveled at the Cybertruck; particularly about its angular design and smudge-prone body. Tesla need not panic, Giugiaro told NPR over email. \"When you step outside the norms, it's almost always seen as a provocation,\" Giugiaro said. \"It happens in all fields, from furniture to cooking, etc. Everyone wants to distinguish themselves; it's a market necessity, and the Cybertruck will surely be successful, I'm sure of it. I'm convinced it will find its admirers.\" Enlarge this image Fernando Alfonso next to his DeLorean DMC-12 at a 2023 Independence Day car show in Brookhaven, Ga.

Fernando Alfonso III/NPR Foreshadowing a fraught manufacturing process First impressions mean everything and the one made by the Cybertruck and Tesla CEO Elon Musk wasn't great. In typical Tesla style, the unveiling in Los Angeles four years ago included a countdown clock and an auditorium full of fans and journalists. The stage was enveloped in artificial smoke as the truck made its entrance, accompanied by the resonating beats of music from loudspeakers. Along the edges, pyrotechnic flames ascended while the vehicle came to a halt before a graffiti-style Cybertruck graphic, starkly depicted in black and white. On Nov. 21, 2019, Musk engaged the crowd, asking, \"You want a truck that's really tough? Not fake tough?\" For the Cybertruck's exterior, Musk revealed a plan to use a stainless steel alloy, the same one his engineers at SpaceX utilized for the company's Starship rocket. However, the presentation took an unexpected turn during the \"Tesla armor glass\" strength test. A metal ball dropped onto a sheet of what Musk called \"regular car glass,\" resulted in a long crack. The Tesla glass was then subjected to a drop from around 10 feet, remaining intact. Musk, not satisfied, handed the ball to Tesla's chief designer, Franz von Holzhausen, who had previously demonstrated the truck's durability by whacking it with a sledgehammer.

Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images \"Franz, could you try to break this glass, please?\" Musk challenged. \"You sure?\" von Holzhausen inquired. \"Yeah.\" With little hesitation, von Holzhausen hurled the ball at Tesla's truck, creating a spiderweb of splintered and dented glass. \"Well,\" Musk reflected afterward, \"Maybe that was a little too hard.\" Hard is perhaps the most appropriate word to describe Tesla's Cybertruck development. The truck has been plagued by \"serious powertrain, braking, suspension, structural, and sealing issues\" that have resulted in deliveries being delayed by years, Motortrend reported. It was initially expected to hit the market about two years ago. Tesla now says the first deliveries will take place on November 30. At the heart of Cybertruck's woes is its stainless steel exterior, which is very familiar to designer Giugiaro. The complicated art of origami Before the 2019 event, Musk had given glimpses of various Cybertruck design influences, attributing inspiration to films like Bladerunner and The Spy Who Loved Me, where vehicles showcased sharply angled fronts and wedge shapes. This style was mastered in the 1970s in what Giugiaro called an \"architectural exercise that resembles a modern Miami or San Francisco 'chalet,' almost a provocation.\" Enlarge this image Giorgetto Giugiaro in his office.

The Italian designer is working on the new car design for Bizzarrini called the Giotto, he told NPR. Alberto Peroli/Alberto Peroli Giugiaro called this design approach \"origami.\" \"In 1972, his concept car for Maserati, the Boomerang, launched a whole new look for cars based on wedges and sharp, straight lines inspired by Japanese origami. The most famous commercial application of this 'folded paper' style would be the Volkswagen Golf Mk1, but the effect is visible in all the angular car designs that followed,\" Esquire reported in an exhaustive profile of Giugiaro in 2019.

Central Press/Getty Images The DeLorean debuted in 1981, the brainchild of Detroit bad boy John DeLorean who partnered with Giugiaro to create what would be his company's solitary offering: the DMC-12 (for more on the brilliance and infamy of DeLorean, Netflix's Myth & Mogul: John DeLorean is an apt primer). Despite being built more than 40 years apart, the criticisms levied against the DMC-12 are surprisingly similar to those being made about the Cybertruck: The Cybertruck has received blowback for its stainless steel body (the DeLorean's stainless steel body \"showed every fingerprint, every speck of dirt, and needed constant cleaning\" the New York Times wrote in Oct. 1982). There are reports of misaligned stainless steel panels on the truck (\"As luck would have it, the first 500 sets of [DeLorean] doors were pressed on sloppy prototype tooling. They simply can't be made to fit properly,\" Car and Driver wrote in July 1981). The Cybertruck has made some questionable interior choices (The DeLorean had \"knobs, buttons and other pieces\" fall \"off regularly,\" the Times added). Tesla did not respond to NPR's request for comment. Enlarge this image DeLorean DMC-12 parked in Atlanta.

Fernando Alfonso III/NPR DeLorean's DMC-12 would ultimately go on to become one of the world's most recognizable cars in no small part to Back to the Future, the public's (and Hollywood's) relentless fascination with John DeLorean's personal tragicomedy and Giugiaro's place in history as the \"Most Influential Car Designer of the 20th Century.\" Time will tell if the Cybertruck will earn a similar distinction. \"I don't want to judge the Cybertruck as beautiful or ugly. It certainly has its admirers who want a vehicle to stand out,\" Giugiaro told NPR.

Here's Why. By Adam Spatacco – Nov 14, 2023 at 5:37AM Key Points Tesla operates a network of over 50,000 charging stations where drivers can power up their vehicles. A wave of competing auto manufacturers have recently signed up for access to Tesla's charging system One Wall St. analyst believes Tesla's charging stations represent a multibillion-dollar annual revenue opportunity. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Market Cap $711B Today's Change (4.22%) $9.06 Current Price $223.71 Price as of November 13, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More While self-driving and robotics may be the talk of the town for Tesla, investors shouldn't sleep on the potential of its charging stations. One of the most closely followed stocks on Wall Street is Tesla (TSLA 4.22%). For years, Tesla built an extremely loyal following among the retail investor community, while many on Wall Street were skeptical of its long-term ambitions. Part of the reason why Tesla and its investment prospects remain so polarizing is because the company operates across a variety of different industries, and getting clarity from its eccentric CEO, Elon Musk, can prove difficult. Is Tesla a car company, an energy business, or an artificial intelligence (AI) play centered around robotics? Well, I'd argue that it's all of the above -- and more. For all the coverage and hype around Tesla, there's one aspect of the business that's still overlooked. The best part? It could add billions of dollars of value to Tesla sooner than people realize. Let's dig into why Tesla's supercharger network could represent a lucrative growth catalyst for the electric vehicle (EV) maker and how the company stands to benefit. What is the Supercharger network? The Tesla supercharger network is a fleet of charging stations that drivers can use to power up their vehicles -- basically Tesla's version of a gas station. Superchargers are typically located near highways and drivers pay a fee based on how much energy the battery draws while charging. As of today, Tesla has over 20,000 Superchargers in service in the U.S. And thanks to a wave of agreements announced in the past few months, these charging stations are no longer just for Tesla EVs. Rival automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Rivian, Polestar, BMW, Hyundai, Honda, and Lucid Group, among others, have adopted Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). Drivers of EVs from these companies can access Tesla's Supercharger network now (or in the near future). This is a huge development. Seemingly overnight, the Supercharger network and its growth prospects have become a lot more enticing. So, just how big could this new operation become? Image source: Getty Images. Wall Street says it's an \"AWS moment\" One of my favorite equity research analysts on Wall Street is Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. Ives is best known for covering the technology sector and often making more bullish predictions than some of his peers. During an interview segment on CNBC, Ives referred to the mass adoption of Tesla's supercharger network as an \"AWS [Amazon Web Services] moment\" or an \"Apple Services moment.\" In other words, Tesla has created an entirely new revenue stream out of its legacy EV business. The company has an opportunity to monetize EV drivers, regardless of who made the car. Not only that, EV charging is a recurring revenue stream, akin to AWS and Apple services, both of which represent tens of billions of dollars of revenue each year for the tech giants. Ives goes a step further by explaining how the margin profile in this business could mimic that of software. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses typically carry high gross margins -- sometimes in excess of 70% to 80%. It's easy to draw the comparison for Tesla and project that revenue from its Supercharger network partners will also be a high-margin category for the company, which should help expand profits and cash flow over time. While it's early days, Ives predicts revenue from charging stations could range between $10 billion and $20 billion per year within the next decade. Obviously, in order to reach this level of scale, a lot needs to go right. Tesla and its competitors will need to continue increasing vehicle production, and the demand for EVs can't afford to plateau. Is this enough to buy the stock? On the surface, I would say the recent developments around the supercharger network are not enough on their own to make Tesla stock a buy. However, when it comes to valuation, there's a methodology called \"sum of the parts\" that Ives has also referenced, and it really applies here. A sum-of-the parts analysis breaks down the various product lines of a business and assesses each one individually. For Tesla, an investor would need to look at the following categories: EVs, solar panels, batteries, robotics, and charging stations. When you look at it this way, investors can see that Tesla is far more diversified than a typical automaker. That list doesn't even include Tesla's self-driving technology, which could become a $500 billion business. Moreover, according to Musk, the inroads that Tesla is making in self-driving and robotics have the potential to make it the most valuable company in the world, and Tesla's battery technology and lithium refining operation could also lead to additional licensing opportunities down the road. The big takeaway here is that Tesla has many different ways it can monetize its various businesses, so when you consider the entire operation, the bull case is a lot more compelling. Data by YCharts. The chart above compares the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of Tesla and its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Nvidia. Tesla has the richest valuation by a wide margin, but the opportunities I mentioned above justify that premium. The mass adoption of Tesla's charging standard and Supercharger network is the first sign that many in the EV industry have fallen too far behind Tesla and know it. Tesla remains far ahead of its competitors when it comes to profitability and unit economics, and it has been able to reinvest its cash flow into robotics, AI, self-driving, and energy storage. Shares have trending down in the past few months as the tech sector cools off, and this is an opportunity to dollar-cost average into a long-term position at an attractive price point.

    "title": "Tesla Raises Prices for Model 3 and Model Y RWD in China",
    "originLink": "https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-china-raises-prices-model-3-model-y-rwd/",
    "originBody": "By Simon Alvarez Posted on November 13, 2023 Tesla has implemented a minor price increase for the Model 3 and Model Y Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) in China. The entry-level Model 3 RWD saw a slight increase of RMB 1,500, bringing its starting price to RMB 261,400 (about $35,800). The Model Y RWD, on the other hand, received a RMB 2,500 price hike, pushing the vehicle’s starting price to RMB 266,400 (about $36,500). Previously, the Model 3 Rear Wheel Drive was offered at a price of RMB 259,900 (about $35,600) before options. The Model Y RWD was offered at a starting price of RMB 263,900 (about $36,100) before options. Interestingly enough, the price adjustments to the Model 3 and Model Y RWD could be seen as a continuation of the price hikes that were implemented for the two vehicles last week. Last week, Tesla China rolled out price adjustments for the Model 3 and Model Y, but they were for the vehicles’ Long Range Dual Motor All Wheel Drive (AWD) variants. With last week’s price adjustments, the Model 3 Long Range Dual Motor AWD was listed with a starting price of RMB 297,400 (about $40,700), while the Model Y Long Range Dual Motor AWD was listed with a starting price of RMB 302,400 (about $41,400) before options. Amidst the recent price adjustments, delivery timelines for the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y in China remain unchanged. The Model 3 and Model Y RWD, as well as the Model Y Performance, are listed with an estimated delivery date of 2-6 weeks. The Model 3 Long Range and Model Y Long Range are listed with an estimated delivery date of 6-9 weeks and 6-8 weeks, respectively. Tesla’s pricing strategy in China has been quite dynamic in recent months. In August, the company lowered the starting prices of the Model Y Long Range and Model Y Performance by RMB 14,000. However, on October 27, the Model Y Performance’s starting price was raised by RMB 14,000. On November 9, the Model 3 Long Range and Model Y Long Range received RMB 1,500 and RMB 2,500 price increases. China is a key market for Tesla, and so far, the electric vehicle maker seems to be doing fairly well. Tesla’s October sales in China reached 72,115 units, with 43,489 vehicles exported and 28,626 sold domestically. The Model 3 contributed 7.94% to Tesla’s October sales in China, while the Model Y accounted for 92.06%. Don’t hesitate to contact us with news tips.

    "originBody": "NEWS REVIEWS FEATURES UK Home News UK: Not even 1,000-bhp Porsche and BMW can beat this Tesla in drag race The electric saloon is the heaviest and most powerful of the trio. 14 November 2023 at 09:33 By: Anthony Karr Published by: Brian Potter If you haven't been living under a rock, you’ll know the Tesla Model S Plaid is mighty quick. We’ve seen it beat all kinds of supercars in drag races and we know from a recent video it is also frighteningly fast around the Nurburgring. But can it compete against two very potent combustion-powered machines with heavy upgrades under the bonnets? The short answer is yes. But here’s the longer version. Carwow lines up a Model S Plaid against a heavily modified Porsche 911 Turbo and a tuned BMW M5. All three cars have around 1,000 bhp and the Tesla is the heaviest at around 2,200 kilograms (4,850 pounds). As a reminder, it has a three-motor electric powertrain, which makes it one of the quickest production cars available on the market today with a claimed 0-60 miles per hour time of 1.99 seconds. Nothing Can Beat A Model S Plaid: UK: See Tesla Model S Plaid Track Pack take on Taycan Turbo S, Audi RS e-Tron GT Tesla Model S Plaid vs 1,000-bhp Dodge Challenger Hellcat is a close drag race Against it, the Porsche relies on a 3.8-litre twin-turbo flat-six engine with aftermarket intakes, a new titanium exhaust system, and a custom ECU remap. The result is a peak output of 1,011 bhp. The 911 Turbo is the lightest of the trio tipping the scales at 1,650 kg (3,637 lbs). Last but not least, there’s an upgraded BMW M5. Its 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 has been tuned and now delivers 1,000 bhp. It is significantly heavier than the Porsche at 1,850 kg (4,078 lbs). In the first three quarter-mile drag races, the Model S Plaid takes comfortable wins. The M5 driver then proposes that each car gets three passengers but the result isn’t much different. Actually, this puts the Bavarian saloon in an even worse situation losing to the Tesla and Porsche by a bigger gap. Things get even worse for the BMW during the rolling-start races.

The electric pickup truck with a radical design broke cover in concept form in the late last decade and since then it has been making headlines around the world but is yet to reach millions of consumers who have booked the EV. However, Tesla is now finally all set to launch the Cybertruck on November 30. By: HT Auto DeskUpdated on: 14 Nov 2023, 17:18 PM Follow us on: Tesla has released the sale terms for its long-awaited Cybertruck ahead of its November 30 official debut and owners of the electric pickup truck are banned from reselling their vehicles during the first year. Tesla has released the sale terms for its long-awaited Cybertruck ahead of its November 30 official debut and owners of the electric pickup truck are banned from reselling their vehicles during the first year. Ahead of the Tesla Cybertruck's scheduled launch on November 30 this year, the EV manufacturer has revealed the sale terms for the electric pickup truck. Surprisingly, the consumers who will be buying the Tesla Cybertruck, won't be able to sell it in the first year, as the automaker's sale terms for the EV states. If a customer sells his or her Tesla Cybertruck in the very first year of purchase, he or she has to pay the automaker a hefty $50,000 penalty for that, as it will be considered a breach of contract. Watch: Will Tesla Come To India?All Things AutoHT Auto This comes as a unique clause from the EV manufacturer as no other automakers dictate to their customers such a contract term for a vehicle that is in demand. However, such agreements are typically normal for limited production of exotic cars.

This agreement states that the buyer agrees to not resell the electric truck for at least one year after taking its delivery. In some circumstances, Tesla will accept the Cybertruck's resell, but it will always have the first right of refusal. However, the automaker has not listed what are those circumstances. The electric car manufacturer has warned that reselling the Cybertruck in the first year may demand liquidated damages from the reseller in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater. What's more interesting is that Tesla has further warned its customers that the EV company may block the reseller of the Cybertruck from purchasing any future vehicles from the company.

    "originBody": "What’s happening with TSLA? Major price jump looms Andreja Stojanovic Stocks Nov 14, 2023 As a company, Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has been at the center of investors’ attention for many years. On the one hand, it represents the world’s most recognizable EV maker, piloted by one of the world’s most recognized billionaires. On the other hand, many have assessed that the firm is overvalued and priced as a big tech company and not a car maker – with Musk himself claiming the former on at least one occasion. No matter the stock market sentiment toward the EV maker, the numbers paint a decisive yet curious picture. Throughout 2020, Tesla delivered approximately 499 million vehicles and made $31.5 billion in revenue. In the first three quarters of 2023, the company delivered more than 1.3 million vehicles and already accrued more than $72 billion in revenue. Tesla’s earnings per share and profits have similarly vastly increased between 2020 and 2023 – $0.24 to $3.14 and $782 million to $11 billion, respectively. Despite the indisputable growth, the price of the EV maker’s shares is almost exactly the same at the time of publication as it was at the tail end of 2020 – hovering near $220. Will TSLA grow to reflect the production increase? Stocks Insider trading alert: Netflix chairman dumps $35 million of NFLX stock Stocks NVDA stock price prediction as Nvidia introduces new high-end AI chip Stocks Wall Street sets Li Auto stock price for the next 12 months Stocks Short squeeze alert: 2 stocks that could soar this week Stocks ChatGPT predicts Tesla stock price for start of 2024 The striking discrepancy between Tesla’s production and revenue growth between 2020 and 2023 and the apparent stagnation of its share price and market capitalization raised the question of whether the EV maker’s stock is bound for a manifold surge. Unfortunately, the future of Tesla’s stock remains a highly contentious topic. Based on the data from TipRanks, Wall Street analysts are themselves highly divided on how it will perform over the next 12 months. The average estimate shows a bullish sentiment – though nowhere near reflective of the revenue and production growth – and prices the shares at $248.93. It is important to note, however, that the difference between the highest and lowest estimates is very large and ranges from $85 per share to $380 per share. Analysts’ 12 month forecast for TSLA. Source: TipRanks Part of the reason for the apparent stagnation in the value of Tesla’s shares is that both the bulls and the bears have reasonably strong arguments. The bear case for Tesla As mentioned above, many have argued over the years that Tesla is severely overpriced, with Elon Musk himself sending its price down after expressing the opinion on X – then known as Twitter – in 2020. This stance is further reinforced by another relatively common opinion that the company should not be viewed as a tech company but rather as a car manufacturing giant – an argument that has seemingly gained validity in recent years as other, more traditional companies have started designing and producing electric vehicles. Should Tesla become more aligned with other car companies, its stock might realistically meet the most bearish expectations and fall into a range between $10 – like the Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) – and $100 – similar to BMW (ETR: BMW). Apart from the broader discussion on how Tesla should actually be classified, the company has been facing several difficulties throughout 2023. There has been an overall slowdown in the EV market, and the company’s Q3 earnings report is widely seen as disappointing. A common point raised by Tesla’s detractors is the many reported seemingly spontaneous combustions of its vehicles. According to Tesla Fire, a website that tracks all verified instances of Tesla vehicles catching fire, there have been more than 20 such incidents so far in 2023. It is important to note, however, that while the news covering such events does have an impact on Tesla’s image – and its stock price by extension – the EV maker’s machines appear not to be significantly more or less frequent than with other manufacturers. They only make the headlines more often due to the company’s prominence. The bull case for Tesla Despite the issues and concerns, a strong case for Tesla bulls certainly remains. No matter where the company falls on the spectrum between a technology company and a car manufacturer, the EV maker has always held a key spot at the bleeding edge of electric vehicle innovation. This is perhaps best exemplified by the relatively broad adoption of Tesla infrastructure by other players in the industry. For example, Lucid Motors (NASDAQ: LCID), another EV maker, joined Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS). Additionally, on November 13, the UK’s EG petrol station group announced it would acquire Tesla’s ultra-fast chargers to boost its own network. Additionally, Tesla recently made a breakthrough in the manufacturing process itself, leading to the news that its Berlin plant is likely to begin the production of a new €25,000 model. It is also possible that Tesla will enter a large, emerging EV market as soon as it is close to reaching an agreement with India’s government that would significantly reduce the country’s tariffs, according to a Financial TImes report from November 13. Finally, it is important not to look at Tesla’s share price in a vacuum. While it is similar to the values seen in late 2020, the company has achieved remarkable growth throughout the year and is up more than 100% since the start of the year. Additionally, it is handling the EV market slowdown comparatively well Tesla is maintaining its goal of 1.8 million vehicles. Tesla stock price analysis Whatever the future may bring for the EV maker, its share price stands at $223.71 at the time of publication. Over the previous 24 hours, it rose 4.22%. Its numbers for the previous month – largely due to the aforementioned Q3 report – are somewhat weaker, and the company declined by 11.90%. TSLA 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold Still, Tesla has experienced significant growth since January 1 and is up 106.95%. Its market capitalization is $711 billion at the time of publication – slightly above its 2020 level but noticeably below the high of more than $1 trillion that it reached in 2021.

    "originBody": "Autoblog Tesla Tesla News ELECTRIC Tesla could sue Cybertruck resellers for $50K if they flip it too soon The company added a Cybertruck section to its purchase agreement ENGADGET Nov 13th 2023 at 4:11PM 0 comments A new “Cybertruck Only” clause in Tesla’s purchase agreement stipulates that buyers cannot sell their new vehicle within the first year unless they have explicit permission from the automaker, or they may be sued. The company just updated its Motor Vehicle Order Agreement ahead of the first Cybertruck deliveries, which it said last month are on track for November 30. Under the terms, which have been making the rounds on social media this weekend, Tesla states that it “may seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the Vehicle” if buyers breach its resale provision, or it may “demand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater.” The terms also warn that offending resellers could be barred from buying vehicles from Tesla in the future. Tesla says it may grant exceptions to some people wishing to sell their Cybertruck within the first year, but they must get written consent. If the company does agree, it will either buy the car back at a reduced price — deducting $0.25 per mile driven, plus wear and tear, and the cost of any necessary repairs — or allow the owner to resell the truck to a third-party buyer. Tesla’s Cybertruck is only being released to a small number of select customers at first and won’t enter mass production until 2024, so naturally, the company is trying to get ahead of resellers looking to cash in on the vehicle’s rarity.
