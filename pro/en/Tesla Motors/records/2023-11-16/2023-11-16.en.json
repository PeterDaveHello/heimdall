Carnett/Bonnier Corporation via Getty Images Redeem now Redwood Materials and Toyota announced a major new deal on Thursday. The agreement will mean Redwood can recycle batteries from millions of old Prius hybrids. Toyota will then use some of that salvaged material to make new EV batteries. Advertisement If there was any doubt about Toyota's commitment to electric vehicles, a new deal announced on Thursday should clear things up. Redwood Materials, a battery recycling startup run by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, unveiled a big new agreement with Toyota. The companies expanded an existing pact so Redwood can recycle batteries from older Toyota vehicles. The Japanese auto giant will also source Cathode Active Material and Anode copper foil from Redwood for Toyota's new batteries that will go into future EVs. About 20 years ago, the Toyota Prius hybrid took the automotive world by storm. Many of these vehicles will be reaching the end of their useful lives soon. Thursday's new deal will mean Redwood can take the old batteries from these hybrid engines and recycle the materials. Advertisement Then, some of that valuable salvaged material will end up in EV batteries that Toyota plans to make in a new $14 billion factory in North Carolina that is slated to open in 2025. In all, Toyota expects to recycle, remanufacture and repurpose almost 5 million units. That's a lot of Priuses. Many of these aging hybrid vehicles happen to be in California, not too far from Redwood Materials' main facility in Nevada. Redwood Materials wouldn't say how much this Toyota deal is worth. However, a similar agreement with Panasonic in late 2022 was worth billions of dollars. Several traditional auto companies have scaled back their EV ambitions lately. Toyota has resisted going all-in on electrification in recent years. And in late 2022, a top Toyota executive said most of the auto industry didn't think EVs were the only way forward. Advertisement Despite this, Thursday's agreement with Redwood Materials suggests that Toyota is actually pretty committed to EVs. Sign up for notifications from Insider!

    "originBody": "The Human Horizons HiPhi A Is A 1,287bhp Tesla Model S Plaid Challenger Human Horizon’s latest creation is the Z-based A, with a promised 0-62mph sprint “just over” two seconds and a top speed of “almost” 186mph. Ryan Hirons 16 Nov 2023 Share on: When we saw the news of a Chinese car being claimed as a “hypercar”, a four-door, four-seat electric saloon wasn’t our expectation, but that’s what we have here. Meet the Human Horizons HiPhi A. If you’re not familiar with Human Horizons (or HH to make it a little easier from herein), we don’t blame you. The Chinese manufacturer has only just begun to bring its cars to Europe, offering the gullwing door X (we’ve heard that somewhere before) and very design-led Z in Norway with plans to expand soon. A tri-motor setup gives the HiPhi A 1,287bhp It's the latter car that serves as a base for the tri-motor A. The styling of the car has somehow been made even more ostentatious, with the addition of a mad aerodynamic package including the huge carbon wing. HH says it represents “the pinnacle of innovative technology while still paying tribute to the classics.” Sure. Just as interesting is what’s happening under the skin. Using three motors, one front and two rear, the A produces 1,287bhp said to allow for a 0-62mph “just over” two seconds with a top speed of “almost” 186mph. That’s still a little shy of the quoted figures for a Tesla Model S Plaid, but it’d be interesting to see the two face off in reality. Can you name a more ostentatious looking car? Other changes over the Z include a carbon fibre bulletproof shield underneath the battery with a fireproof cover over the top, plus “extra wide” tyres. There’s no word on when or indeed if the HiPhi A will come to the UK, but it would be a signal of intent for the brand as it plans to start selling cars on these shores in 2025.

Here's Why You Shouldn't Buy The Stock. By Travis Hoium – Nov 16, 2023 at 7:00AM Key Points Tesla's operating margins have become downright pedestrian and are comparable to domestic carmakers. Chinese EV buyers are moving to domestic brands and Tesla is losing market share to competitors. Tesla hinted that it's slowing growth expectations and recently pulled back on investment in Mexico. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Market Cap $772B Today's Change (2.29%) $5.43 Current Price $242.84 Price as of November 15, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Tesla has been a disruptive company, but recent operational performance shows why the stock isn't a good buy today. Ask any market analyst and they will tell you the auto business is a tough business for investors. They'll say energy is a tough business, too. While both are tough, they also happen to be businesses Tesla (TSLA 2.29%) competes in. Given Tesla stock's wild success, the company must have been doing something right these past few years. Still, the market is largely about what a company is going to do in the future, and Tesla's operations are starting to show strain as it manages a dramatic increase in capacity and takes on improved competition globally. Making 100,000 electric vehicles (EVs) at a high margin is one thing in the auto sector, but making millions of vehicles at high margins is something completely different, as Tesla is finding out. Margins aren't what investors hoped for Enthusiasm for Tesla stock comes, in part, from its reputation as a high-margin automaker, but that narrative has fallen apart in the last two years. Structural undersupply during the height of the pandemic gave Tesla an excuse to raise prices for vehicles in high demand. Now in late 2023, the company has seen demand ease and competition increase and it's cutting prices to move what is now a growing supply of vehicles. These adjustments led to a sharp decrease in margins that continues today. TSLA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts Operating margins have become downright pedestrian and if the trajectory continues we may eventually see margins fall below both Ford Motor Company (F 0.67%) and General Motors (GM -0.21%). TSLA Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts Despite falling margins, Tesla continues to increase supply and will introduce the Cybertruck soon, adding more capacity to the market. I don't see how this will help margins, especially as competition gets stronger. Tesla's Chinese competitors are serious U.S. EV competition is behind the curve, but Chinese competition is something Tesla investors might want to start worrying about. BYD (BYDDY 0.95%) may end up being the best-selling EV maker globally in 2023 while Nio, Xpeng, and others are growing capacity and lowering prices around the world. Tesla made a big bet by building a factory in Shanghai but that's now becoming a challenging place to operate because Chinese buyers are moving to domestic brands and Tesla is losing market share in Europe, South America, and Asia to Chinese competitors flooding the market. Innovators don't stay ahead for long in the auto business and Tesla is finding that out now. Collapse NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Today's Change (2.29%) $5.43 Current Price $242.84 YTD1w1m3m6m1y5y Price VS S&P Key Data Points Market Cap $772B Day's Range $236.45 - $246.70 52wk Range $101.81 - $299.29 Volume 1,865,099 Avg Vol 121,061,262 Gross Margin 19.81% Dividend Yield Tesla's FSD isn't full self-driving Tesla CEO Elon Musk talks a lot about autonomous driving, also called full self-driving (FSD), but the reality is that all of Tesla's autonomous driving features are Level 2 autonomy, which means the driver is responsible and ultimately in control. Tesla isn't even testing Level 3 or higher, as far as the public knows. Meanwhile, GM's Cruise and Alphabet's Waymo have logged millions of miles with no driver in the car, which is Level 4 autonomy. Mercedes-Benz has even introduced Level 3 autonomy in some of its vehicles. Until Tesla begins testing Level 3 or higher autonomous driving we can assume it will always be 1 year away, just like he's been promising since 2016. Valuation is a problem for Tesla None of this would be a problem if Tesla were valued like most auto companies are today. But it's not. Depending on the metric you look at, Tesla stock trades for between a 5x to 30x premium to its competitors. That's a lot of high-margin growth priced into shares at today's price. TSLA PE Ratio data by YCharts Tesla has already hinted that it's slowing growth expectations, recently pulling back on investment in Mexico and saying the 50% long-term growth rate is unattainable. So, what are Tesla investors paying a premium for right now? Manufacturing is a tough business There's a reason automakers have not historically been very profitable. It's also becoming clear that Tesla hasn't fundamentally changed the supply/demand dynamics that led to weakening profits. Some investors may point to autonomous software as the differentiator going forward, but I simply don't see that being a reality if Level 3 autonomy isn't even being tested seven years after Musk first promised that full autonomy was just around the corner. Tesla's foray into the energy business is a nice addition, but again we are talking about a commodity business where Tesla doesn't have any real differentiation. Its efforts there are not deserving of multiples 10x or more higher than peers. Tesla is a great company that has disrupted how a lot of the world makes and thinks about cars. But it's not all that great of a stock going forward and that's why I don't think it's a good buy at its current valuation.

    "originLink": "https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-youtube-ads-vehicle-safety-video/",
    "originBody": "By Simon Alvarez Posted on November 15, 2023 Tesla’s advertising efforts have expanded to YouTube, as observed by members of the electric vehicle community. The recently observed ad on YouTube focused on the safety of Tesla’s vehicles, which is arguably one of the best selling points for the company’s electric cars. During the 2023 Cyber Roundup, Tesla executives such as Elon Musk were asked if the company could start advertising its products. Despite Musk having a history of being averse to advertisements, the CEO stated that Tesla would try “a little advertising and see how it goes.” Since then, several ads for Tesla have been sighted across the globe. And while the electric vehicle maker’s ads are nowhere near the level of the advertisements from legacy automakers like Ford and General Motors (GM), they are a pretty big step for a company like Tesla, which has prided itself for being a business that needed no ads to grow. Meanwhile in Japan… an entire wall of @Tesla ads at Haneda Airport Garden.$TSLA #TSLA @elonmusk #テスラ @teslamotorsjp https://t.co/jsABV4H8gA — S.E. Robinson, Jr. (@SERobinsonJr) March 22, 2023 Amidst Tesla’s goals of hitting 1.8 million vehicles this year and attaining 20 million vehicles by 2030, the company would need all the help it can get to ensure that its products are pushed to as many consumers as possible. With this in mind, YouTube ads are a great way to inform a large audience of the benefits of Teslas. Focusing on the safety aspect of Tesla’s vehicles could be a pretty good way to introduce the company’s electric cars to those who are completely new to the brand. It’s also a good way for Tesla to foster an image of its vehicles as machines that offer both the best in tech and safety. Tesla YouTube Ad + link to website for a test drive. pic.twitter.com/qp9WAfACTL — Trevor Scott 𝕏 (@Space_Taz) November 15, 2023 Tesla mentioned a variety of important points in its YouTube ad, such as the vast amount of in-vehicle data that is gathered from its global fleet. Tesla also highlighted the Model 3’s affordable price after the federal tax credit in the US. Finally, Tesla also provided a link to its test drive page in its ad, so interested consumers can try out the company’s vehicles for themselves. YouTube has over 2.7 billion monthly active users as of 2023. This suggests that about 52% of internet users worldwide access YouTube at least once a month. Provided that Tesla’s advertising strategy on YouTube works, it would not be surprising if the company rolls out advertisements on other prolific social media platforms like Facebook as well.

    "originBody": "FORBESINNOVATIONTRANSPORTATION EDITORS' PICK Toyota Signs On As First Carmaker To Buy Battery Components From Redwood Materials Alan Ohnsman Forbes Staff I cover advanced transportation and climate-oriented technology. Nov 16, 2023,07:00am EST A Prius Prime plug-in hybrid charges up. TOYOTA Redwood Materials, the battery recycling and components maker created by Tesla cofounder JB Straubel, said it will supply Toyota with anode and cathode materials to make new batteries at a massive U.S. plant the carmaker is building, the startup’s first such deal with an automaker. The “long-term” contract for Toyota to buy cathode active material and anode copper foil from Redwood expands a relationship between the two that began last year with the Carson City, Nevada-based company recycling old hybrid and electric vehicle batteries from Toyota models. Financial terms of the new supply deal aren’t being disclosed, but it’s “significant and important for us,” Straubel told Forbes. “It’s our first end-to-end (automaker) supply agreement,” he said. “And the most interesting, newest part of this is it’s the first time as far as we’re aware that a major (automaker) has gone all the way from recycling back to component procurement.” The world’s biggest automaker has been noticeably less aggressive in introducing new EV models than many of its competitors, arguing that hybrids like the Prius and plug-in hybrids are a more affordable option for curbing automotive carbon emissions. That’s changing, however, as the company is investing nearly $14 billion in a massive factory in North Carolina to make battery packs for both EVs and plug-in hybrids starting in 2025. Though Toyota is likely to become a major commercial partner of Redwood’s, it’s not one of its investors, the company said. Straubel, who began developing battery packs and motors for Teslas nearly two decades ago, created Redwood to keep high-value raw materials used to make EV batteries, like lithium, cobalt and nickel, out of landfills by reusing them. He also intends to help create a U.S. supply base for new battery cathodes and anodes, the most expensive part of lithium-ion cells, which are currently produced almost entirely in Asia, particularly China. Redwood is making copper foil for battery anodes and cathode materials that it will supplying to Toyota. REDWOOD MATERIALS “Accelerating our recycling efforts and domestic component procurement gets us closer to our ultimate goal of creating a closed-loop battery ecosystem that will become increasingly important as we add more vehicles with batteries to roads across North America,” Christopher Yang, Toyota North America’s group vice president, said in an emailed statement. Closely held Redwood, which Straubel said will have “tens of millions of dollars” of revenue in 2023, previously announced plans to supply battery materials to Panasonic. It’s raised about $2 billion and secured a $2 billion federal loan to expand recycling and component manufacturing at its Nevada plant and a new facility under construction near Charleston, South Carolina. Redwood said it plans to use at least 20% recycled nickel, 20% recycled lithium and 50% recycled cobalt in the cathodes it will make for Toyota. Its anode copper foil for the carmarker will be 100% recycled copper. Straubel has history with Toyota, notably working on a jointly developed electric RAV4 using Tesla batteries and motors that was marketed about a decade ago. Toyota also played a game-changing role in Tesla’s early days, essentially giving it a shuttered factory in Fremont, California, in 2010 (selling the plant to it for just $50 million and then reinvesting $50 million back into Tesla). That allowed the EV startup to get its Model S sedan into production in 2012. That wasn’t necessarily helpful in shaping the new deal, but “it doesn’t hurt anything either,” Straubel said. “A lot of the world has changed since 2010, especially related to EVs. It feels like it could have been 50 years ago! Some of the same people, amazingly, are still involved.” Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website. Send me a secure tip.

    "originBody": "Top Tesla Gigacasting Supplier Gets Acquired By GM! November 15, 2023November 16, 2023 Zachary Shahan 0 Comments Cadillac Celestiq, Casting, casting machines, General Motors, GM, Tesla, Tesla Cybertruck Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News! Here’s a story from left field that we didn’t see coming! Tesla has jumped ahead of the auto industry in vehicle production time and costs in the past few years through the use of larger and larger castings for vehicle bodies. The Tesla Cybertruck is supposed to be a pinnacle of “gigacasting” — that’s the idea, anyway. Tesla may have just hit a setback on this path, though, or maybe it’s just a small speed bump. We’ll see. Reportedly, there are four companies Tesla has been leaning on for casting. Tooling & Equipment International (TEI) is one of those top suppliers, and it started working with Tesla in 2017 to develop and produce the Model Y. In case you missed it, this vehicle model has been a whopping success globally, proving so popular that it is on track to being the highest selling vehicle model (of any powertrain) in 2023. How much of that has come down to TEI’s efficient, cheap (if we can call it that) casting process. Errr, I guess we should now say GM’s efficient, cheap casting process. The good news for Tesla is that it has three more casting suppliers. But that probably also means less competition and higher prices. “By snapping up a specialist in sand casting techniques that accelerated the development of Tesla’s gigacasting molds and allowed it to cast more complex components, GM has jump-started its own push to make cars more cheaply and efficiently at a time when Tesla is racing to roll out a $25,000 EV, [four individuals familiar with the deal] said,” Reuters reports. GM seems to be taking a page out of Tesla’s book not just in terms of large castings, but also in terms of vertical integration. That is something Tesla has been famous for bringing back into fashion, in OG Henry Ford style. One has to wonder why Tesla didn’t buy TEI or another casting supplier before GM, but perhaps the company leadership just felt they were getting a good enough deal and didn’t want to get involved in another aspect of the vehicle production process. Whether or not Tesla was blindsided by this acquisition is also not clear. Does this throw a wrench into Tesla’s production plans, whether they be with the Model Y, the coming Cybertruck, or the next-gen affordable (~$25,000) EV? We don’t have confirmation of that, but there are hints of it. “Tesla is scrambling to find another sand casting specialist to fill the role TEI performed, or even develop such crucial expertise in-house to cut its reliance on outside suppliers, the people said.” Furthermore, “According to all four sources, TEI began helping Tesla around 2017 to develop the Model Y and is considered in the industry to be one of the world’s top sand casting specialists.” The three remaining casting specialists Tesla has been using are in the UK, Japan, and Germany. I can’t see this as good news for Tesla, while GM seems to have played the game like a boss. However, like I said at the top, it’s not clear if this presents a huge problem for the gigacasting pioneer or simply a speed bump. Stay tuned. As far as GM goes, it has worked with TEI at least since 2021, when it tapped the casting specialist to build a part for the company’s $340,000 Cadillac Celestiq EV, a not-so-cheap electric vehicle soon to be produced in Michigan. “TEI won the 2023 Casting of the Year award from the American Foundry Society for those Celestiq castings.” This is an impressive move from GM.
