    "originBody": "© Timon SchneiderDreamstime.com SECURITY & PRIVACY Temu class-action lawsuit: Is the cheap shopping app worth downloading? (No!) BY KIM KOMANDO, KOMANDO.COM • NOVEMBER 11, 2023 SHARE: CLICK TO SHARE ON TWITTER (OPENS IN NEW WINDOW) CLICK TO SHARE ON FACEBOOK (OPENS IN NEW WINDOW) CLICK TO SHARE ON PINTEREST (OPENS IN NEW WINDOW) I saw this coming. I’ve been warning about the shopping app Temu since April when its sister app, Pinduoduo, was caught planting malware. It was spying on other apps, reading notifications and messages, and even changing settings. The U.S. government accused Temu of data risks … and now the lawsuits are here. A class-action filed in Illinois says the Chinese app collects more info than it needs and than it discloses. Why in the world are people still using it? The deals, of course! On a slow boat from China An HD Wi-Fi security cam for $6.98. An Android fitness watch for $8.38. A $7.99 wedding dress feels like bad vibes, with even the cake in tiers. You might get lucky and find a gem that matches the description, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Shipping is slow, too, since they’re coming from China. In exchange for those cheap goods and prices, Temu makes money with your data. The app requests 24 permissions on your device, including access to your Wi-Fi network info, Bluetooth, photos and videos, contact info and payment details. Yikes. What about the website? If the app is off-limits, is the website safe to use? Sorry, but no. You’re still handing over (at a minimum) your full name, address, phone number, email and payment details. The more permissions an app requests … the more you should consider whether it’s worth having on your smartphone. Don’t see the big deal? Think about all you do on your phone: Have private conversations with friends, log into your bank app, type in passwords, enter your credit card info and more. Keep these security smarts in mind before you hit “install” on Temu: Biometrics (like fingerprint and face scans) should be stored locally, not sent back to an app’s servers. (Temu’s e-commerce buddy Pinduoduo does this.) Limit all the permissions you can. Turn off access to your camera, microphone, GPS location and anything else you can. Read the reviews. No, you can’t trust them all, but scan for reports of strange phone behavior after installation. That’s a sign of malware. It’s hard to tell what’s legit and what you should avoid. I’ve got your back. I compiled a list of Communist China-based apps you should get off your phone now. This story is definitely worth sharing, folks. Need help deleting apps? You’re probably an app master and already know how to remove them from your device. But just in case you need a refresher, here ya go. Delete apps from your Android phone: Long-press an app, then tap App Info > Uninstall. Go to Settings > Apps & Notifications to see a list of your apps and delete them the same way. Or open the Google Play Store app and navigate to Menu > My apps & games. Tap on the app and hit Uninstall. NOTE: Samsung and OnePlus phones have an Uninstall option under the app shortcuts menu. Delete apps from your iPhone Touch and hold an app, then tap Remove App > Delete App > Delete. Or use the App Library, introduced in iOS 14, to get a curated list of your apps grouped by category. Swipe past the last page of your Home screen to access it. Tap and hold the app, then select Delete App > Delete.

    "originBody": "Reuters China's Singles Day sales festival wraps up with e-commerce giants reporting sales growth Read full article Casey Hall Sat, November 11, 2023 at 7:47 PM CST·3 min read Person walks past a JD.com's advertisement promoting Singles Day shopping festival, in Beijing By Casey Hall SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Alibaba Group reported that its Chinese e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao recorded \"positive\" year-on-year growth over this year's Singles Day sales period, which wrapped up at midnight on Saturday. Meanwhile competitor JD.com said its festival GMV (gross merchandising volume) hit a \"record high\" over the sales period. Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on Nov. 11 each year in China, the 'Singles Day' festival - a nod to the digits in the date - has expanded into weeks of promotions across the country's major e-commerce platforms and in brick-and-mortar stores. This year marked the second time Alibaba has not disclosed the actual yuan value of its sales for its landmark festival, which this year celebrated its 15th anniversary. Last year, when sales were hit by continuing COVID curbs across China, was the first. The festival is closely watched as a gauge of consumer confidence, and expectations for sales growth this year have been subdued, as the economy has been flirting with deflation while making an unsteady recovery. E-commerce giant Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce player by market share, had put pressure on merchants to offer rock-bottom prices this Singles Day, announcing at the outset of the festival in late October that it would offer 80 million products at their lowest prices this year for the blockbuster event. That move was seen as a way to fight back against rivals such as Douyin and PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo which have changed the landscape of Chinese e-commerce in recent years by selling lower-cost and discounted items year-round. Steep discounts of 40-50% were much more common than in previous years as a result. A Bain and Company report released last week found that 77% of the 3,000 consumers it surveyed had planned to spend less or the same on Singles Day compared with last year. Bain saw shoppers spending on necessities such as tissues, handwash, instant noodles and pet food, while at the same time trading down and buying less in discretionary or big-ticket categories such as home appliances and furniture. Last year, the total value of goods sold during the shopping bonanza totaled 1.15 trillion yuan ($157.97 billion), according to Bain. Though several consultancies were predicting Singles Day GMV growth across platforms would reach anywhere from 14% to 18% - returning to double-digit growth for the first time since the pandemic - the final sales picture will take longer to energe. These GMV figures take into account the value of all orders placed, and will not capture the amount that will be returned later. Analysts and industry executives expect return rates to be high this year as consumers buy more in order to obtain larger discounts on checkout, only to return the items they don't need. Items related to health and wellness and outdoor lifestyles were expected to outperform, with global brands such as Nike and Lululemon expected to sell well. Alibaba reported that sales of road bikes jumped 300% during the first hour of sales. Colour cosmetics, traditionally a strong performer throughout the Singles Day sales period, were expected to struggle this year as make-up demand remains low almost a year after China lifted strict COVID-19 restrictions.

    "originBody": "Biz / Economy Singles Day campaign yields bumper sales for online giants Ding Yining Ding Yining 19:45 UTC+8, 2023-11-12 0 Leading e-commerce players reported upbeat performance without giving the exact sales figure for the past weekend, which closed the blockbuster shopping event Singles Day or 11.11. Ding Yining Ding Yining 19:45 UTC+8, 2023-11-12 0 Leading e-commerce players reported upbeat performance without giving the exact sales figure for the past weekend, which closed the blockbuster shopping event Singles Day, or 11.11 (11th day of the 11th month), where hundreds of thousand of brands reported sales spike with new offerings. Both Alibaba and JD said they witnessed a big increase in consumer spending on a wide range of products, with emerging channels such as livestreaming grabbing the limelight. The blockbuster shopping event, which wrapped up on Saturday night, serves as an important gauge for consumer sentiment and this year affordable products but with high quality and functionality gained momentum. The campaign started in late October, turning the 24-hour event into a month-long festival for not only online vendors but physical stores as well as supermarket chains. 100EC.cn, a local e-commerce portal, revealed that Tmall and Taobao contributed to 60 percent of total online retail spending during the promotion, followed by JD and Pinduoduo. Merchants targeted specific shoppers' groups through digital tools and vendors were also advised to better engage amid consumers' shifting demands with new designs products and service models as Singles Day returned to being a normal promotional event. Alibaba's retail sales units Taobao and Tmall Group said their direct discount venue offering 15 percent price reduction recorded 210 million orders during the sales period, while the venue featuring value-for-money products from manufacturers generated nearly 90 million orders. Taobao and Tmall recorded positive year-on-year growth in the total value of products and services sold, the order number, and the number of participating merchants compared with the same period last year. Ti Gong Taobao and Tmall said they recorded positive year-on-year growth in the total value of products and services sold, the order number, and number of participating merchants over last year. \"Our competitive pricing, diverse content offerings, and AI-driven technologies further optimized consumer and merchant experiences during the campaign,\" commented Trudy Dai, CEO of Taobao and Tmall Group. Taobao and Tmall merchants also added more than 100 million new members in total. This year is the second time Alibaba has not revealed the actual transaction value of its sales for the promotion period, with JD following suit. JD also said transaction volume, order volume, and user engagement reached all-time highs without giving the exact amount. Order volume of new merchants on JD also experienced a fivefold surge in order volume compared with a month ago. It also saw a 3.4-fold increase in new shop registrations during this Singles Day, and the number of established merchants participating in the grand promotion increased 1.5 times compared with last year's grand promotion. Procurement and sales managers were much sought after during livestreaming sessions as they offered a wide range of recommendations on affordable and high-quality products amid the latest efforts to streamline supply chain operations. Ti Gong JD's livestreaming sessions highlighted recommendations on affordable and high-quality products. JD drew more than 380 million viewers, and transaction volume for 60-plus brands surpassed 1 billion yuan (US$137.2 million), with nearly 20,000 brands witnessing a threefold increase in transaction volume compared to the previous year. Pinduoduo stressed that it will maintain its advantage in selling lower-cost and discounted items all-year-round by allowing more high quality offerings and agricultural produce to enter domestic households. During its promotional period, the number of shoppers from first-tier cities at its discount venue jumped 113 percent from a year earlier, and the amount of spending from fourth- and fifth-tier cities surged 167 percent. Seafood, lamb and fresh fruits recorded 110 percent increase in sales as small- and medium-sized merchants fully leveraged the platform to reach shoppers. 361 Degrees was one of the sportswear brands riding the wave of fitness and sports enthusiasm to offer latest products. On Pinduoduo, its sales more than doubled, with sales of carbon plate running shoes also jumping five times in lower-tier cities. Cainiao's call for package material recycling gained much attention. Technology prowess, and green and environment-friendly initiatives were also highlighted during the campaign to reflect increasing awareness for low carbon actions. Merchants have been leveraging logistics firm Cainiao's newly launched smart warehouse delivery and preferred warehouse delivery services to cut consumer wait times when orders are dispatched from the most cost-efficient sites which allow merchants to better manage inventories. Nearly 100 domestic colleges are soon expected to unveil dedicated package recycling zones and students and teachers can have a clearer understanding of their carbon-cutting efforts. JD also noted that 95 percent of retail orders were delivered within 24 hours, with over 10 million products eligible for same-day delivery.

Believe it or not, a handful of tickers are persistently driving their way higher this year, overcoming a couple of bouts of nasty marketwide weakness. Three of these magnificent stocks are worth a closer look just because their current rallies could continue into and through next year. 1. Cboe Global Markets If you&#39;ve been investing long enough, you&#39;ve probably heard the parable about who actually made any real, reliable money in the California Gold Rush of 1949. It wasn&#39;t the prospectors; most of them made little to nothing. The big winners were the people selling pickaxes and shovels to the folks who had gold fever. Or, perhaps you&#39;re more familiar with casinos&#39; business model. That is, while some bettors win at other bettors&#39; expense, \"the house always wins\" because it essentially takes a small cut of everybody&#39;s wagers for itself. Enter Cboe Global Markets (NYSEMKT: CBOE), parent to the Chicago-based exchange that handles the United States futures and options markets as well as a small amount of equity and currency trading. While it tends to disproportionally benefit from a roaring bull market, its role as a trading middleman means it does consistently well regardless of the environment. In fact, ugly bear markets that induce a great deal of selling can be just as beneficial to the Cboe exchange since it keeps a fraction of every trade&#39;s value for itself regardless of the direction the underlying stock, option, or future is headed. To this end, Cboe Global Markets&#39; top and bottom lines have both grown every year since 2020.Things are seemingly slowing down a bit this year, with investors waiting to see how the global economy will respond to the recent wave of rate hikes and slowing GDP growth. This is apt to only be a temporary slowdown, though. The market&#39;s still bidding Cboe shares upward in anticipation of an economic revival. And they just might get it. The analyst community is calling for stronger year-end revenue and profit growth, leading to healthy sales and earnings growth for the entirety of next year. 2. PDD Holdings When investors think of China&#39;s e-commerce stocks, names like Alibaba or JD.com typically come to mind. In fact, it&#39;s likely that many people have never even heard of PDD Holdings (NASDAQ: PDD) or its business moniker Pinduoduo. With the stock up 75% from May&#39;s low, though -- and near its recent 52-week high -- maybe this is a company more investors should put on their radar. It&#39;s an e-commerce outfit, although far from being typical. While it facilitates the online sale of predictable goods like apparel, electronics, and personal care items, its roots are actually in the fresh produce (yes, fruits and vegetables) business. It was the first to offer a major e-commerce platform to China&#39;s farmers. It&#39;s now estimated that more than 16 million farmers use the site to connect with consumers who may have otherwise remained out of reach. The company still serves this market, too, although it&#39;s evolved into so much more. In addition to most other categories of e-commerce, Pinduoduo provides social commerce tools that help sellers engage with potential customers. It even allows shoppers to play games via its app, with the ultimate intent of driving more sales, of course. More important to current and would-be shareholders, this quirky business model works! While China&#39;s annual \"Singles Day\" event that inspires a bit of self-indulgence is once again a respectable hit, few of its consumer-facing outfits reported triple-digit sales growth in as many markets and categories as PDD Holdings did during the shopping spree&#39;s earliest days. Take the hint. China&#39;s online shoppers are looking for something else beyond what JD.com and Alibaba are offering. That&#39;s why PDD shares are easily outperforming the other two similar tickers. 3. Ares Management Last, but not least, take a look at the performance Ares Management (NYSE: ARES) shares are dishing out. The stock&#39;s up an incredible 85% for the 18 months and higher to the tune of nearly 500% for the past five years. What gives? First things first. Ares Management isn&#39;t your typical for-profit corporation. Although its shares trade just like any other stock, Ares is actually an alternative investment management outfit. Its chief purpose is providing funding in the form of loans, lines of credit, or in exchange for equity in privately owned up-and-coming companies. Any returns achieved on this capital are ultimately directed back to the fund&#39;s shareholders in the form of capital gains and dividends. The key to success in this business? Knowing which companies to provide capital to and which ones to steer clear of. That&#39;s where Ares Management has more than proven itself with a track record that&#39;s nothing less than incredible. Not only have its management fees grown every single year since 2006, including the years it was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic, but its profit margin rate on these fees has also expanded every year since 2017. The company is well positioned for such growth going forward, too. Based on the growing interest in non-traditional investments like private debt and private equity, Ares believes the amount of retail (individual) investor capital allocated to alternative investments, like the ones it manages, will more than triple to $12.8 trillion. Of course, given Ares Management&#39;s history of success in its markets in an environment that&#39;s not always been great for more conventional stocks, who could blame individual investors for considering something different? This interest is already gelling, in fact. This ticker&#39;s persistent bullishness is the key clue to this growing demand.

Photo: The Yomiuri Shimbun via AFP Alibaba Group reported that its Chinese e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao recorded \"positive\" year-on-year growth over this year's Singles Day sales period, which wrapped up at midnight on Saturday. Meanwhile competitor JD.com said its festival gross merchandising volume hit a \"record high\" over the sales period. Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on November 11 each year in China, the 'Singles Day' festival – a nod to the digits in the date – has expanded into weeks of promotions across the country's major e-commerce platforms and in brick-and-mortar stores. This year marked the second time Alibaba has not disclosed the actual yuan value of its sales for its landmark festival, which this year celebrated its 15th anniversary. Last year, when sales were hit by Covid curbs across the nation, was the first. The festival is closely watched as a gauge of consumer confidence, and expectations for sales growth this year have been subdued. E-commerce giant Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce player by market share, had put pressure on merchants to offer rock-bottom prices this Singles Day, announcing at the outset of the festival in late October that it would offer 80 million products at their lowest prices this year for the blockbuster event. That move was seen as a way to fight back against rivals such as Douyin and PDD Holdings' Pinduoduo which have changed the landscape of Chinese e-commerce in recent years by selling lower-cost and discounted items year-round.

    "originBody": "The annual Singles’ Day online retail extravaganza in China is seeing a significant change in consumer behavior as shoppers tighten their purse strings. The event, popularized by e-commerce giant Alibaba, typically sees sellers slashing prices and offering enticing deals. However, this year’s festival is facing uncertainties due to faltering consumer confidence. In a Bain & Company survey of 3,000 Chinese shoppers, it was found that more than three-quarters of respondents plan to spend less or keep their spending level, citing concerns about the economy. The impact of the pandemic and a weak property market has led to reduced business for many entrepreneurs, such as Shi Gengchen, whose billiard hall in Beijing has experienced a significant decline in sales. Analysts suggest that Chinese consumers have become more cautious about splurging on extras, and the excitement surrounding Singles’ Day has diminished. Instead, shoppers are more focused on essentials like toothpaste, tissue paper, and laundry detergent, rather than luxury brands and high-end cosmetics. This shift in consumer behavior reflects a change in mindset as people prioritize daily necessities and seek value-conscious purchases. E-commerce platforms have responded by emphasizing low prices for this year’s festival, targeting customers who are looking for good deals. Alibaba’s Tmall promotes “Lowest prices on the web,” while JD.com’s tagline for its Singles’ Day campaign is “Truly cheap.” Rival retailer Pinduoduo’s slogan is “Low prices, every day.” These strategies have helped boost sales for the online platforms. While spending on durable goods like home appliances is expected to be weaker due to the crisis in China’s property sector, there is still a strong demand for products that enhance health, lifestyles, and self-expression. Categories like vitamins, pet care, and athletic apparel have seen significant interest among middle- and upper-class consumers. FAQ What is Singles’ Day? Singles’ Day, also known as “Double 11,” is an annual online retail event in China popularized by Alibaba. It features discounted prices and attractive deals leading up to November 11th. How has consumer behavior changed? Chinese consumers have become more cautious about spending on non-essential items, prioritizing daily necessities instead. The excitement surrounding Singles’ Day has diminished, and shoppers are focusing on value-conscious purchases. How are e-commerce platforms responding? E-commerce platforms like Alibaba’s Tmall, JD.com, and Pinduoduo are emphasizing low prices to attract customers seeking good deals during the festival. What products are consumers more interested in? Consumers are showing a strong interest in products that enhance health, lifestyles, and self-expression, such as vitamins, pet care, and athletic apparel.

Early this morning, Lei Jun wrote on Weibo: “Yesterday was a very happy day, Xiaomi 14 set a new record!” During the Double 11 promotion, Xiaomi 14 became a two-time champion of sales in the price range from 54n to 820 dollars on JD.com, a champion of sales on Tmall, a two-time champion on Douyin and a two-time champion on Pinduoduo. Just 5 minutes after the Xiaomi 14 went on sale, the new product improved the previous generation’s result for the entire day by 600%, and also topped the sales charts of JD.com, Tmall, Douyin and Kuaishou. Lei Jun added that the Xiaomi 14 series has made a historic leap: “The Xiaomi 14 series is our success.

Components Intel is confident in its dominance in the processor market, despite the active offensive of AMD and Arm Published 4 mins ago on November 12, 2023 By Robert Adams Intel, despite the active loss of processor market share in all major segments, is confident of its dominance in the foreseeable future. Speaking at the Intel Innovation Taipei 2023 Technology Forum, CEO Pat Gelsinger said Intel will maintain its dominance in the coming years, despite the unexpected increase in competition in the PC market and, in particular, in the AI PC segment. But this statement is due not only to the success of AMD, especially in the server segment, but also to numerous rumors about the active offensive of solutions based on the Arm architecture. Not only has Qualcomm already presented this, and the first tests of the Snapdragon X Elite are very convincing, but there are also many rumors that next year Arm processors for Windows PCs will be released by Nvidia with MediaTek and supposedly even AMD. Intel, among other things, is going to rely on artificial intelligence. The company says that by 2025 it plans to sell 100 million PCs (of course, we mean processors) with AI. Let us remind you that the first such CPUs will be Meteor Lake, which will debut on December 14.

To the point that many Windows components may also be moved to the cloud in the future. However, things may not be so rosy with this approach, as the company is reportedly set to release a new standalone version of the Office software suite. This will be Office 2024, which is already in development and will be released in the third or fourth quarter of next year. There are no details yet, but in general, what remains unclear is the reasons why Microsoft is going to release a new standalone Office suite, while actively promoting the cloud version.

It looks like the problem remains widespread Published 23 mins ago on November 12, 2023 By Henry Brown The story of melting power connectors on GeForce RTX 4090 video cards, as it may seem, is a thing of the past. However, in reality this is not the case, and the cards continue to fail. A NorthridgeFix repair shop owner says the problem hasn’t gone away. In fact, RTX 4090 adapters with a 12VHPWR connector continue to fail, and the cases are far from isolated. More precisely, we can say that the opposite is true, and we are talking about a huge number of cases. According to the author, his workshop receives 20-25 cards every week! And this is just one workshop, and one can only guess how many cases there are around the world. The author also notes that cards from all manufacturers are susceptible to the problem, but, unfortunately, it is unclear whether we are talking only about the conditionally first batches of adapters or whether fresh copies also remain unsafe.
