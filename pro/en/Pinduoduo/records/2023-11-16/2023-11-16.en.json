Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Why Shares of China's Alibaba and PDD (Pinduoduo) Are Up So Much Today By James Brumley – Nov 15, 2023 at 1:19PM Key Points Retail spending in China is not only still growing, but this growth is accelerating. This improvement in consumer spending is being supported by growing industrial output. The market still doesn’t see that China’s e-commerce giants have the most to gain from such an economic tailwind. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: BABA Alibaba Group Market Cap $210B Today's Change (3.81%) $3.20 Current Price $87.07 Price as of November 15, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More China's economy is in better shape than it's been feared to be in lately. It's a good day for the broad market, but Wednesday is proving to be a great day for several Chinese stocks. Shares of consumer-facing Alibaba Group (BABA 3.81%) are higher to the tune of 3.8% as of 12:30 p.m. ET today, while PDD Holdings (PDD 3.08%) stock -- the company formerly known as Pinduoduo -- is up 4.1% in that time frame. Just don't look for any company-specific reasons for this pronounced strength. You won't find it. Wednesday's prod for sweeping bullishness among China's top e-commerce tickers is rooted in much broader news. That's China's surprisingly strong recovery of the nation's consumer spending. China's economy isn't so bad off after all China's National Bureau of Statistics unveiled encouraging data Wednesday morning, indicating the country's industrial production grew 4.6% last month. That's better than the 4.4% economists were anticipating, and up from September's pace of 4.5%. The highlight, however, is October's retail spending. China's consumers upped their outlays by 7.6% last month versus expectations of only 7%, accelerating September's growth pace of 5.5%. Indeed, last month marks the third consecutive month spending growth has sped up, while industrial productivity growth has accelerated in two of those three months. It's a much-needed sign that China's economy is on a firmer footing than has been recently feared.

By then, however, a great deal of economic damage -- including to future growth prospects -- had been feared done. Following the second quarter's sequential GDP growth of only 0.8%, many economists dialed back their longer-term growth expectations for China's economy. For instance, the World Bank lowered its 2024 growth outlook for China from 4.8% to only 4.4%. Based on October's retail spending and industrial production data, China may be in better shape than recently believed. But are Alibaba and PDD worth buying? One month's worth of data isn't a trend. China's economic data has been unexpectedly strong for a few months now, however. Investors would be wise to take that detail and these numbers' growth trajectory at face value, and recognize the market is underestimating its budding economic rebound. Ditto for its aforementioned e-commerce stocks like Alibaba and PDD. Neither of these tickers have been red-hot performers of late, with Alibaba shares seemingly still losing ground despite China's improving economic backdrop. Savvy investors might want to take a shot in either name before more investors start connecting these dots. James Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The announcement came alongside in-line second-quarter revenue posted by the Chinese e-commerce giant, which in March announced plans to carve out the unit as part of the biggest restructuring in its 24-year history. The company also put on hold plans for an initial public offering of its Freshippo groceries business but said it would prepare external fundraising for its international digital commerce group arm. Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares were down 8.4% in premarket trading. \"The recent expansion of U.S. restrictions on export of advanced computing chips has created uncertainties for the prospects of Cloud Intelligence Group,\" Alibaba said. Alibaba's ex-group CEO Daniel Zhang abruptly quit just two months after concentrating his focus on cloud computing. The company then appointed Eddie Wu, one of Alibaba Group's co-founders and long-time lieutenant of former chief Jack Ma, as both CEO of Alibaba and the cloud unit. Regulatory filings also revealed on Thursday that Ma's family trust plans to sell 10 million American Depository Shares of Alibaba Group Holdings for about $871 million. Alibaba posted second-quarter revenue of 224.79 billion yuan ($31.01 billion), in line with the 224.32 billion expected by analysts, LSEG data showed. China's economic recovery has been uneven.

    "title": "Why Temu's Cheap Prices Come with Risks and Rewards",

    "originBody": "Skip to content Tech Internet Culture Streaming IRL Trending Video Originals About About Us Contact Jobs Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ethics Policy Newsletter Tech Internet Culture Streaming IRL Trending Video Originals About About Us Contact Jobs Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ethics Policy Newsletter Newsletter yanishevska/ShutterStock (Licensed) Why is Temu so cheap? Temu minimizes costs and offers remarkably low prices via a lean supply chain—but at what cost? Kahron Spearman Trending Posted on Nov 15, 2023 E-commerce has forever changed how we shop. Now and then, a new platform emerges, challenging the online shopping status quo. Enter Temu, the Chinese-owned digital marketplace that has rapidly become a favorite among online shoppers for its low prices. One of the questions asked most about the retailer is, “Why is Temu so cheap?” Let’s dig into that very question. Why is Temu so cheap? Here’s one reason A core aspect of Temu’s business approach is its direct connection between customers and suppliers. Unlike many e-commerce sites, which hold inventories and work with intermediaries, Temu is a facilitator. This model eliminates the additional mark-ups and costs that can increase consumer prices. By ensuring a lean supply chain where buyers can directly access sellers, Temu minimizes costs and offers remarkably low prices. The Influence of Pinduoduo It’s essential also to understand the influence of Pinduoduo, the sister e-commerce platform owned by Temu’s parent company, PDD Holdings. Pinduoduo’s success in the Chinese market, with revenues surpassing $18 billion in 2022, has provided Temu with insights and lessons on how to run a digital marketplace efficiently. Leveraging the strategies and operational know-how of a company with a solid track record in the e-commerce space is invaluable. But there have been significant issues regarding security. Per a CNBC report, “malware in Pinduoduo was found to leverage specific vulnerabilities for Android phones, allowing the app to bypass user security permissions, access private messages, modify settings, view data from other apps and prevent uninstallation.” @jwflorida is temu a scam? – BBB ISSUES WARNING OVER TEMU APP #temureview #tenuapp #news ♬ original sound – jwflorida Google even called it an “identified malicious app” and asking people to uninstall the app, which is heavy-handed in its asks of security-related privileges—which Temu does not require. It’s all been enough for the U.S. government to take notice, as evinced by a brief released in April 2023 warning of “the challenges posed by Chinese ‘fast fashion’ platforms, including exploitation of trade loopholes; concerns about production processes, sourcing relationships, product safety, and use of forced labor; and violations of intellectual property rights.” The de minimis loophole One of the most significant factors contributing to Temu’s affordable pricing structure is its strategic use of the de minimis provision. This U.S. policy allows imports under $800 to enter the country without duties, taxes, fees, or extensive inspections. By operating under this loophole, Temu can offer products to U.S. consumers at reduced prices. It bypasses many of the fees that other international sellers might incur, giving it a unique advantage in the market. Product Selection and Quality Control While Temu boasts a vast range of products, there’s a notable variance in quality. Products can range from excellent value for the money to incredibly cheap and with unsurprisingly lower quality to match. Temu’s product sourcing is diverse, with some items being absolute steals and others more akin to what you might find in a dollar store. This broad spectrum allows for a wide pricing range, but the lowest-priced items might need better quality and should be investigated thoroughly. However, Temu does offer an extended 90-day return policy for its products, per a USA Today article reviewing the site. Environmental and ethical Concerns With prices so low, questions naturally arise about the ethical production of items. While Temu’s Third Party Code of Conduct strictly opposes forced labor, there are concerns about the platform’s ability to ensure all sellers adhere to these guidelines. Critics argue that with affordable products, there are potential compromises in production standards, be it environmental, ethical, or labor practices. One TikToker, going under the name @thelegalpreneur, alleges that Temu ultimately hurts small businesses. @thelegalpreneur Why you should NOT be shopping on Temu. This site and similar ones hurt small businesses more fhan anything. #greenscreen #temu #boycott #shopsmall #buylocal ♬ original sound – Legalpreneur Data collection and consumer trust Cheap prices often come at a different kind of cost, as the Daily Dot has reported on in the past. Data collection is a crucial part of Temu’s operations, as it is with many e-commerce platforms. While Temu has policies to protect user data, consumers need to be aware of the types of information they’re sharing and how it’s being used. Trust is a currency in the digital age, and while Temu offers financial savings, users should always prioritize their online security and privacy. The final verdict Shopping on Temu offers fantastic deals, but it’s essential to approach it with a discerning eye. Just as with any online platform, there are risks and rewards. The allure of low prices is undoubtedly tempting, but understanding why these prices are so low provides a clearer picture of the trade-offs involved. As Temu continues its rapid ascent in the e-commerce world, only time will tell if its pricing model is sustainable in the long term or if adjustments will be necessary to maintain its momentum. You might wonder why is Temu so cheap as you’re reviewing prices, but then you also might be reminded of the maxim “You get what you pay for” and the saying “Buyer beware.” Share this article *First Published: Nov 15, 2023, 2:33 pm CST Kahron Spearman Kahron Spearman is the community manager for the Daily Dot and Nautilus magazine.

    "originBody": "Xiaomi Just Claimed A Record $3.11 Billion In Singles Day Sales Jannat Un NisaNovember 15, 20230 Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest Tumblr Linkedin Reddit Email In the electrifying spectacle of Singles Day, Xiaomi, the Chinese tech giant, emerged as a clear winner, boasting record-breaking sales that surpassed 22.4 billion yuan ($3.11 billion). From Oct. 23 to Nov. 11, Xiaomi’s products flew off the virtual shelves of major platforms, including Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao, JD.com, Pinduoduo, and Douyin. Xiaomi’s glory during the festival was underscored by the claim that its latest release, the Xiaomi 14 smartphone, secured the coveted top spot on Alibaba’s Tmall from Nov. 4 to 11. Asserting dominance across various smartphone sales categories on different platforms, Xiaomi’s success prompted HSBC analysts to revise their forecasts, anticipating positive earnings accretion and potential valuation re-rating in the future. The Singles Day extravaganza, evolving into a multi-week shopping fiesta, continues to be a powerhouse of sales in China. Despite uncertainties affecting retail sales, livestreaming and short videos on platforms like Alibaba’s Taobao and ByteDance’s Douyin continued to be formidable sales channels. Estimates revealed a 19% surge in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) from livestreaming during this year’s festival. Tmall led the charge with a 60% share, followed by JD.com at 28%, and Pinduoduo at 7%. JD.com reported that Apple products exceeded 10 billion yuan in transaction volume, while Lululemon witnessed a remarkable 260% surge in transaction volume compared to the previous year. Xiaomi’s triumph not only showcases the brand’s prowess but also reflects the broader trend of Singles Day transforming into an extended period of shopping promotions and consumer engagement across various platforms. As the Singles Day fervor settles, deeper insights into consumer trends and festival results are expected during upcoming corporate earnings calls. JD.com is set to unveil quarterly results on Wednesday evening, followed by Alibaba on Thursday evening (Beijing time), providing a comprehensive snapshot of the festival’s impact on Chinese consumer behavior and market dynamics.
