    "originBody": "Log In Sign Up Premium Markets Insider Trading Hedge Funds Retirement Opinion Premium NEWS - TECH 5 Best Social Media Platforms For eCommerce Published on November 3, 2023 at 9:15 am by RAMISH CHEEMA in News, Tech Share Tweet Email In this article we will list 5 small-cap social media platforms for ecommerce. For a more comprehensive list and our detailed discussion of the industry please see 10 Best Social Media Platforms for eCommerce. 6. Pinduoduo Latest Monthly Active Users Estimate: 623 million Pinduoduo is a Chinese eCommerce retailer operated by PDD Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PDD). It is one of the few electronic commerce platforms that blends a social experience with digital commerce. Pinduoduo offers several unique features, such as allowing buyers to form groups to make collective purchases and bargain for discounts from suppliers. Additionally, Pinduoduo also integrates WeChat into its application, and not only does it reward users for bringing more users to the platform, but all communications between buyers and sellers are done through WeChat. 7. Weibo Latest Monthly Active Users Estimate: 599 million Weibo is a Chinese social media network run by Weibo Corporation (NASDAQ:WB). Like Facebook, it also has features for social commerce one of which is the Weibo Store. It allows users on China’s Sina social network to operate their own stores, and the Weibo Store also enables customers with products on e commerce platforms to bring them to Weibo as well. 8. X (Formerly Twitter) Latest Monthly Active Users Estimate: 540 million X is perhaps one of the most popular social media applications today when it comes to current affairs, especially after its take over by Elon Musk. Mr. Musk has made several changes to the platform, including rebranding it to X from Twitter. Since the takeover, X has faced several problems as well, which include hesitation from advertisers to spend money. Twitter allows companies to set up their own pages and manage user engagement. 9. Pinterest Latest Monthly Active Users Estimate: 465 million Pinterest is a rather unique social media platform that enables users to share images with each other and make their own collections. It offers merchants a Verified Merchant Program and provides users with a shopping list to pin their favorite items. It also offers customized advertising options to merchants and has features such as Rich Pin to deliver specific products to users. 10. FANTOO Latest Monthly Active Users Estimate: 26 million FANTOO is a South Korean social media platform developed by Hanryu Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HRYU). It is one of the youngest social media platforms on our list, and a rather unique one as well since it is customized to target global fans of Korean pop culture. FANTOO is also making moves in the social commerce space, as the firm announced a new deal with Nature Republic – a Korean beauty and cosmetics brand in October 2023. Through the deal, FANTOO will provide Nature Republic’s products with unique marketing opportunities such as digital character to promote the products to users. Hanryu’s management believes that the deal showcases their platform’s unique selling points as a social media network. After all, few other platforms offer businesses with digital characters to promote their products, a feature that can engage younger users quite well. The deal, valued at $2.6 million, will also prove beneficial for FANTOO, as Nature Republic’s brand reach and customers can use FANTOO for their purchases and become long time users of the social network.
