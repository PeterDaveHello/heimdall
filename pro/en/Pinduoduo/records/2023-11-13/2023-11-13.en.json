(Photo by Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) From Oct. 23 to the end of day on Nov. 11, Xiaomi said it sold more than 22.4 billion yuan ($3.11 billion) worth of products on platforms such as Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao, JD.com, Pinduoduo and Douyin. Alibaba and JD.com declined for a second-straight year to share total figures for the Singles Day shopping festival. GMV from livestreaming rose by 19% during the shopping festival this year, according to estimates from data company Syntun and Morningstar senior equity analyst Chelsey Tam. BEIJING — Chinese smartphone and consumer electronics company Xiaomi claimed record sales across platforms during the Singles Day shopping festival. From Oct. 23 to the end of day on Nov. 11, Xiaomi said it sold more than 22.4 billion yuan ($3.11 billion) worth of products on platforms such as Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao, JD.com, Pinduoduo and Douyin. Xiaomi shares were briefly up more than 2% in Hong Kong trade late Monday morning. Locally traded shares of Alibaba and JD.com gave up earlier gains. For a second-straight year, the two online shopping giants declined to share total figures for the Singles Day shopping festival. JD only said transaction and order volume reached record highs. Alibaba said that gross merchandise value, order numbers and participating merchants grew from a year ago. GMV measures sales over time. Money Report NEWS 34 MINS AGO 5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday NEWS 39 MINS AGO Consumer spending fell in October, according to new CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor tracking card transactions By brand, JD said transaction volume of Apple products exceeded 10 billion yuan ($1.39 billion). That's the same figure JD shared for Singles Day results in 2021. It did not provide a comparable figure in 2022. Lululemon, a relatively new brand to the China market, saw transaction volume on JD increase 260% during the shopping festival from a year ago, the Chinese retailer said. Alibaba did not share much detail on sales by product or brand for the entire shopping festival period. Xiaomi claimed its newly released Xiaomi 14 smartphone was the top-seller on Alibaba's Tmall from Nov. 4 to 11. The company also claimed first place in different categories of Chinese brands' smartphone sales across other online shopping platforms. \"Much better-than-expected Mi14 sales creates earnings accretion and potential valuation re-rating ahead,\" HSBC analysts wrote in a Nov. 6 report. \"We raise our smartphone shipment forecasts for Xiaomi by 7% in 2023e to c150m units and by 6% in 2024e to 160m units,\" the analysts said. Low expectations Over the past decade, Singles Day has expanded from a one-day shopping festival into a multi-week period of shopping promotions across different online platforms in China. In 2022, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Alibaba had said its Singles Day sales were \"in line\" with the prior year, which had recorded the equivalent of $84.54 billion GMV at the time. Uncertainty about future income has weighed on retail sales in China over the last few years. Ahead of this year's shopping festival, a survey by Bain and Company found that 77% of consumers in China did not plan to increase spending. Livestreaming sales Livestreaming and short videos on platforms such as Alibaba's Taobao and ByteDance's Douyin remained a growing sales channel. GMV from livestreaming rose by 19% during the shopping festival this year, according to estimates from data company Syntun and Morningstar senior equity analyst Chelsey Tam. Tmall accounted for the bulk of sales, or 60%, in a category that Syntun called \"comprehensive e-commerce platforms,\" Tam said in a note. JD accounted for 28%, while Pinduoduo had a 7% share, the report said. Kuaishou, a short video and livestreaming app, said orders grew by nearly 50% during the Singles Day shopping period. More details on Singles Day results and Chinese consumer trends could come out during corporate earnings calls later this week. JD.com is due to report quarterly results Wednesday evening, while Alibaba is set to release earnings Thursday evening Beijing time.

    "originBody": "Bloomberg Alibaba, JD Fail to Inspire in China Discount Shopping Gala Read full article 1 Sarah Zheng Sun, November 12, 2023 at 10:40 PM MST·4 min read Alibaba, JD Fail to Inspire in China Discount Shopping Gala (Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. reported sales increases during China’s most important shopping festival, yet likely lagged newer entrants from social media platforms like ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin during a muted year for consumer spending. Most Read from Bloomberg Iceland Girds for Volcanic Eruption That Could Wipe Out Town China Weighs Ending Freeze on Boeing With 737 Max Deal in US Biden Has Wiped Away $127 Billion in Student Loan Debt Xi Jinping’s ‘Old Friends’ From Iowa Get a Dinner Invitation An Opioid-Like Drink Is Masquerading As a Wholesome Alcohol Alternative Analysts scrambled for clues after China’s two e-commerce leaders again failed to disclose overall revenue numbers during Singles’ Day, the annual bargains extravaganza built around a Nov. 11 event that Alibaba popularized over a decade ago. Historically a barometer for Chinese consumer sentiment, it’s become much harder to parse since companies stopped providing precise figures during the turmoil of the Covid era. Online transactions across the three largest platforms — Alibaba’s Tmall, JD.com’s main portal and PDD Holdings Inc.’s China-only Pinduoduo service — likely slipped about 1% to 923.5 billion yuan ($127 billion) during the festival, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ada Li estimated, calculating based on retail channel data tracked by Syntun. While a smaller piece of the pie, streaming platforms such as Douyin and Kuaishou Technology grew transactions by 19%, according to Li’s analysis. Others painted a slightly rosier picture. Alibaba and JD likely managed 1% to 3% growth in gross merchandise value over the three- to four-week period leading up to Nov. 11, when merchants embarked on their discounting spree, Goldman Sachs estimated. PDD, which targets lower-income and rural markets, racked up growth of 20%, analyst Ronald Keung estimated. Read More: Top Chinese Livestreamer Losing Steam Shows Consumers’ Fragility Alibaba and JD.com report earnings this week and should offer more insight into whether domestic consumption has recovered. Story continues “The slowing growth shows we need to roll out large-scale economic stimulus measures that are strong enough to lift market confidence and drive up the economy,” Ren Zeping, a well-known economist who was formerly a researcher at the State Council’s Development Research Center, wrote Monday. “Consumers are becoming more mature and rational as they go after high value for money. Their perception of brands is also changing, and domestic brands with high value for money are rising.” Chinese consumption has flagged in the country’s post-pandemic reopening, dogged by economic turbulence from a crumbling property market to rising youth unemployment. Deflationary pressures worsened in October, spurring concerns about the country’s growth trajectory. Singles’ Day this year focused on a low-price strategy to draw in reluctant consumers. Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall business said its direct-discount venue offering 15% price reductions notched 210 million orders, while more than 400 brands this year exceeded 100 million in earnings. “With cautious/selective spending behavior and availability of alternative platforms, we believe consumers have plenty of choices for ‘value-for-money’ products,” Citigroup analyst Alicia Yap wrote. “Consumer shopping time and wallet share have been diluted and split among traditional marketplaces and short video platforms.” Read More: China’s Consumption Recovery Is Losing Momentum, Data Show China’s postal delivery companies handled 639 million packages nationwide on Nov. 11, an increase of 16% from last year, the State Post Bureau said Sunday. The number handled in the first 11 days of November totaled 5.3 billion, jumping 23%, according to the bureau. Less-traditional platforms like Douyin and Kuaishou likely thrived, drawing shoppers with their more novel formats and a longer-than-normal discounts period that began around mid-October. The prolonged coverage plays in their favor because users spend more time on short video platforms in general, Goldman’s Keung said. JD’s credit payment business Baitiao brought together 400,000 brands and merchants to provide more than 1.5 billion yuan in subsidies for users. The company said more than 60 brands surpassed 1 billion in sales, and that almost 20,000 brands reported that transaction volumes tripled from a year earlier. “Growth during stage 1 (October 2023) was disappointing. Momentum likely picked up in November,” Jefferies analyst Thomas Chong wrote. “Having said that, growth momentum on the day of November 11 was slower than expected.” --With assistance from Jinshan Hong, Jeanny Yu, Yujing Liu, Stanley James and Mayumi Negishi.

REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights SHANGHAI, Nov 12 (Reuters) - China's largest e-commerce player Alibaba Group (9988.HK) said it recorded year-on-year growth over this year's Singles Day sales period that ended at midnight on Saturday, while rival JD.com (9618.HK) reported sales volumes at a record high. Data provider Syntun, meanwhile, estimated cumulative gross merchandising volume (GMV) sales across major e-commerce platforms rose 2.08% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion) compared with growth of 2.9% last year. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Originally a 24-hour online shopping event held on Nov. 11 each year in China, the Singles Day festival - a nod to the digits in the date - has expanded into weeks of promotions across the country's major e-commerce platforms and in bricks-and-mortar stores. Expectations for sales growth for the festival, which is viewed as a gauge of consumer confidence, were subdued this year as the economy struggles to recover. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Last year, when China was emerging from COVID-19 curbs, Alibaba, the country's largest e-commerce player by market share, did not disclose the yuan value of its sales for the festival for the first time. Again this year, it said only that sales were positive, without giving details, for its e-commerce platforms Tmall and Taobao. Alibaba, put pressure on merchants to price aggressively this Singles Day, and at the start of the festival in late October, said it would offer 80 million products at their deepest discount of the year. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Analysts saw this as an attempt to fight back against rivals such as Douyin and PDD Holdings' (PDD.O) Pinduoduo that have changed the landscape of Chinese e-commerce in recent years by selling lower-cost and discounted items year-round. Discounts of 40%-50% were much more common than in previous years as a result. A Bain and Company report released last week found that 77% of the 3,000 consumers it surveyed had planned to spend less or the same amount on Singles Day compared with last year. Bain said shoppers intended to spend on necessities such as tissues, handwash, instant noodles and pet food, while trading down and buying less in discretionary or big-ticket categories such as home appliances and furniture. Several consultancies predicted Singles Day GMV growth across platforms could return to double-digit growth for the first time since the pandemic, but the final sales picture will take time to emerge. The GMV figures take into account the value of all orders placed, and do not capture the amount that will be returned later. Analysts and industry executives expect return rates to be high this year as consumers buy more in order to obtain larger discounts on checkout, only to return the items they do not need. Items related to health and wellness and outdoor lifestyles were expected to outperform, with global brands such as Nike (NKE.N) and Lululemon (LULU.O) expected to sell well. Alibaba reported that sales of road bikes jumped by 300% during the first hour of sales. Colour cosmetics, traditionally a strong performer throughout the Singles Day sales period, were expected to struggle this year as make-up demand remains low almost a year after China lifted strict COVID-19 restrictions.

    "originBody": "WWD Singles’ Day 2023: E-commerce Giants Ignite Price Wars as Bargain-hunters Take Charge Read full article Denni Hu Sun, November 12, 2023 at 12:02 p.m. MST·4 min read Against the backdrop of an evolving economic landscape, Chinese e-commerce players have embraced a quieter Singles’ Day holiday by offering steeper discounts. According to third-party data agency Syntun, sales Friday and Saturday came in at 277.6 billion renminbi, or $38.5 billion, registering a year-on-year decline of 9.75 percent. The event generated 1.021 billion parcels, a decrease of around 16.65 percent compared to last year. The average customer unit price was 272.01 renminbi, or $37.82, an increase of 8.3 percent year-over-year. More from WWD Stilnovo Parent Company Eyes Acquisitions, Sees Growth in 2023 Versace Names Rosy Zhao Global Brand Ambassador Fashion's Top Takeaways From Tech Earnings Sales on Tmall, JD.com, and Pinduoduo accounted for 60.02 percent, 27.86 percent, and 7.34 percent, respectively, while other platforms accounted for 4.77 percent of overall sales. As the world’s biggest online promotional event, this year’s Singles’ Day ran for over two weeks to Saturday. The data reflects a current Chinese consumer sentiment of “willing to spend small for a bigger joy,” said Elena Gatti, managing director of Azoya Europe. According to a recent Bain & Company survey of more than 3,000 Chinese consumers published last week, more than 77 percent of them plan to reduce or spend the same amount for Singles’ Day. Seventy-one percent of respondents said they plan to cut or maintain retail spending through 2023. “Retailers are facing more than just discount fatigue,” said the Bain survey. “The spending caution related to the festival matches a more general mood of restraint. “That value-conscious mentality was also a feature for Gen Z shoppers in the bigger cities and higher income brackets who haven’t yet built up the spending power of their older peers,” the report added. As Alibaba’s first Singles’ Day since reorganization, its Taobao and Tmall branches recorded “positive year-on-year growth in gross merchandise value, order number, and participating merchants” compared to last year. Story continues Other than offering 50 renminbi off for every 300-renminbi order placed on the platform, the biggest discount in recent years, the e-commerce giant tested a real-time price analysis feature. The platform used AI technology to tag products with “the lowest price” compared to competing e-commerce platforms, such as JD.com, Douyin, and Pinduoduo. The transparent pricing strategy helped over 402 brands surpass the 100 million renminbi mark in terms of GMV. Tmall said 38,000 brands achieved 100 percent year-over-year growth in GMV. Playing defense, JD.com launched its first in-house livestreaming program where its product manager-turned-anchor quoted lower prices based on that of its rivals, such as Tmall’s “Lipstick King” Austin Li. An aggressive pricing strategy also lifted sales at new entrants Pinduoduo and Douyin. Neither platform released Singles’ Day sales results this year, but according to a recent analyst note from Citi, GMV at Pinduoduo is expected to grow in the “mid-to-high 20s,” in stark contrast with “less than 10 percent” at Alibaba and JD.com. “Pinduoduo’s success reflects a strategy of directing its promotional firepower to simple and continuous low prices rather than complex, one-off discounts,” observed the Bain survey, referring to the platform’s “10 billion yuan subsidy” initiative that subsidizes steep discounts. “Consumers are even now participating in bulk purchases for luxury and fashion products on Pinduoduo now,” observed Gatti. “We have noticed that brands such as Folli Follie, Coach, and Michael Kors benefit from a big presence across Pinduoduo’s women’s bag category. We guess these presences are mostly authorized by the brands.” As for Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok known for its livestreaming e-commerce operations, the platform recently revealed to local media outlets that its annual GMV reached two trillion renminbi, or $274 billion, from January to October, registering 60 percent growth year-over-year. Luxury players, which traditionally use the online shopping festival to promote capsule collections paired with striking campaigns, have discreetly released special offers during Singles’ Day. On Tmall, bargain hunters were thrilled to discover Prada loafers and Valentino Rockstud stilettos featured in flash sales at 30 to 50 percent off. Items like the Balenciaga x Adidas Destroyed Stan Smiths kicks quickly sold out. According to the JD.com scoreboard, transaction volume for Dior, Tiffany & Co., and Bottega Veneta products increased over four times compared to last year’s Singles’ Day. Transaction volume at Valentino increased more than sixfold year-over-year. “After long-suppressed spending on discretionary products, some consumers will make a move on their desired brands during Singles’ Day,” explained Gatti of the luxury spike. This year’s Singles’ Day also demonstrated a strong interest in health and wellness categories, with athletic apparel, health supplements and pet care enjoying upticks in sales, according to WPIC, the Beijing-based e-commerce consulting agency. “In fact, consumers are actively looking to ‘upgrade’ consumption in these categories to pursue quality,” said WPIC chief executive officer Jacob Cooke. The wellness hype was framed by Tmall as the emerging “dopamine economy.” “A lot of consumers, especially young consumers, are starting to pay attention to the emotional value of goods,” Liu Peng, the head of Tmall, told local media. “More specifically, e-sports-related, outdoors cycling-related products and Lego have become the ‘holy trinity’ for male shoppers during Singles’ Day,” Liu added.

From October 23 to November 11, Xiaomi recorded sales worth over 22.4 billion yuan ($3.11 billion) on platforms like Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao, JD.com, Pinduoduo, and Douyin.

For the second consecutive year, Alibaba and JD.com declined to disclose the total figures for the Singles Day shopping festival. JD.com shared that transaction and order volumes reached record highs, while Alibaba highlighted the growth in gross merchandise value (GMV), order numbers, and participating merchants compared to the previous year.
