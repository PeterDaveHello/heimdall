REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights BEIJING, Nov 10 (Reuters) - A ferocious price war among China's e-commerce retailers during the \"Singles Day\" shopping event is exposing further weakness in household consumption and raising concerns that the world's second-largest economy will resume its slowdown. Originally a 24-hour online shopping event in China held on Nov. 11, Singles Day, a nod to the digits in the date, has expanded into weeks of promotions, including in brick-and-mortar stores, making it the world's largest shopping festival. Advertisement · Scroll to continue This year's festival is being more closely watched than ever as a gauge of consumer confidence as China flirts with deflation and has identified boosting household demand as key to avoiding lost decades of sluggish growth. On Taobao and Tmall, platforms owned by e-commerce giant Alibaba (9988.HK), consumers can receive a 50 yuan ($6.86) discount when they spend 300 yuan. The company is pressuring merchants to offer rock-bottom prices during Singles Day after promising it will offer 80 million products at their lowest prices this year for the sale, which started in late October. Advertisement · Scroll to continue PDD Holdings' (PDD.O) Pinduoduo and JD.com have between them indicated they would offer billions in cashback deals over the sales period for people shopping on their respective platforms. \"Low prices and discounts has been the overarching theme,\" said Jason Yu, greater China managing director of market research firm Kantar Worldpanel, noting that even the newly-released iPhone 15 was selling with a 500 yuan discount. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"It's a sign that nobody's going to easily spend 10,000 yuan ($1,371) on a handset right now. Confidence is a bit weak.\" Data released on Thursday showing a drop in consumer prices to their lowest since the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the doubts in China's economic rebound after some months of indicators showing growth stabilising. China's big online shopping platforms did not release final sales figures for 2022, when analysts said COVID-19 restrictions inhibited spending and consumer confidence. It is unclear whether they will release figures for this year, but expectations are subdued, and for good reason. Bain and Company found that 77% of the 3,000 consumers it surveyed plan to cut or maintain their level of spending on Singles Day compared with last year. \"Macroeconomic headwinds are causing consumers to be more value-conscious,\" Bain said. Some indicators point to a slowdown in Singles Day sales. Data provider Syntun estimated e-commerce platforms sold 311 billion yuan of products from Oct. 31 to Nov. 3, a 7.1% decrease year-on-year. But it said that was partly mitigated by livestreaming platforms such as Douyin, Diantao and Kuaishou selling 10.5% more, at 99 billion yuan. Other analysts are more upbeat. Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of e-commerce consultancy WPIC Marketing+Technologies, expects total sales growth of 14%-18%, saying he is \"optimistic\" that Chinese growth is \"stabilising.\" TRIPLE DIP A downturn in China's giant property sector, where most of the household wealth is parked, indebted local governments cutting spending, youth unemployment rates surpassing 20%, and falling wages in some sectors of the economy have been keeping consumers in a thrifty mood. A surprise rise in imports in October had raised hopes that spending might be turning a corner, but the fall in consumer prices suggests that higher commodity prices probably had more impact on trade than consumer demand. Coupled with weak manufacturing surveys and waning external demand, the consumer price pressures point to China losing growth momentum into year-end. \"We continue to see a serious risk of a triple dip for the economy,\" Nomura analysts wrote in a note. For Tan Jiapeng, a 35-year-old office worker in Beijing, his only Singles Day purchase so far has been a Descente winter jacket, an \"essential purchase\" for the winter. Worried about job stability, he abstained from buying Pokemon smartphone games, body lotion, and some Moutai liquor, all things he wished for. \"It's known how difficult it is to find a job these days, even for the young people who are cheaper,\" Tan said. \"The economy is moving downhill, I can't spend as freely as before.\" ($1 = 7.2931 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Casey Hall, Sophie Yu; Editing by Marius Zaharia and Christian Schmollinger Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Photo: AFP Business Pinduoduo ranks last among China’s big e-commerce firms in sustainability, with no climate strategy revealed: Greenpeace China’s e-commerce giants ‘still don’t do enough’ and may be ‘bottlenecks for progress’, Greenpeace project manager says Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the country’s largest e-commerce platform Taobao, topped the rankings for a second consecutive year Yujie Xue in Shenzhen + FOLLOW Published: 8:00am, 10 Nov, 2023 Why you can trust SCMP Pinduoduo, China’s second-largest e-commerce platform, performs the worst among its peers in environmental actions, lacking in strategies and disclosures on climate change, biodiversity and waste management, according to Greenpeace. Alibaba Group Holding, which owns the country’s largest e-commerce platform Taobao, topped the rankings for a second consecutive year, according to a report released by the environmental group on Thursday. Vipshop came in second, followed by JD.com, ByteDance, Kuaishou and Pinduoduo, which also ranked at the bottom of last year’s report. Despite some effort, Tang Damin, Beijing-based project manager at Greenpeace East Asia, said he is worried that the platforms “are becoming bottlenecks for progress”. “Overall, China’s e-commerce giants still don’t do enough to leverage their platforms toward sustainability,” he said. “This stagnation is most obvious for the climate. But the impact on other environmental issues is also profound.” Alibaba topped the Greenpeace list thanks to its climate commitments and its strategies to engage both shoppers and sellers on its platform in reducing carbon emissions. Photo: Getty Images The Greenpeace report ranked the six platforms on their climate commitments, actual performance, disclosures and auditing, as well as their response to environmental risks for biodiversity, waste and hazardous chemicals. Alibaba topped the list thanks to its climate commitments and its strategies to engage both shoppers and the sellers on its platform in reducing carbon emissions. Alibaba owns the Post. The companies had not issued comments regarding the rankings by the time of publication. The report comes ahead of the United Nations COP28 climate summit, to be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from November 30 to December 12. There global leaders and key stakeholders will discuss major climate issues such as the energy transition and limiting global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. China, the world’s largest carbon emitter, is also the largest e-commerce market globally with more than 880 million digital buyers as of June, according to state agency China Internet Network Information Centre (CNNIC). In the first half of 2023, China’s online retail sales reached 7.16 trillion yuan (US$986 billion). More than 80 per cent of that was physical goods, which generate emissions in manufacturing, packaging and delivery, according to CNNIC. China’s actions on coal, oil and gas key to ‘keeping the 1.5 degrees target alive’ According to Greenpeace, while all the companies except Pinduoduo have disclosed some progress on responding to climate change, only Alibaba has a strategy to engage its users and partner businesses. The company in 2022 launched a “ carbon ledger platform” on Taobao, which rewards users for their low-carbon behaviours and promotes products that are considered environmentally sustainable. The five companies besides Pinduoduo have biodiversity protections in place to prevent illegal online trade of plant and animal species. Three companies, Alibaba, JD.com and Vipshop, have strategies on waste management, according to Greenpeace. Three companies have made carbon-neutral commitments, according to Greenpeace. Following China’s dual carbon goals to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, Alibaba announced in 2021 its plan to make its operations carbon neutral by 2030 and eliminate 1.5 gigatons of carbon emissions across its entire business ecosystem by 2035. Vipshop in August announced its aim to achieve carbon neutrality in its own operations and reduce the carbon emissions intensity of its wider value chain by 50 per cent by 2030. Emissions intensity gauges the carbon footprint per unit of revenue. Energy transition headed for panic situation due to lack of urgency: LGIM As the parent company of TikTok and Douyin, ByteDance announced its climate commitments in March. It committed to achieving operational carbon neutrality by 2030 by reducing at least 90 per cent of operational emissions and offsetting the remaining 10 per cent. Pinduoduo, with more than 750 million monthly active users last year, has not disclosed any information related to climate change or environmental action. Greenpeace called on the platforms to set up comprehensive climate goals as soon as possible, outlining emission reduction paths and timelines to get decarbonisation plans for their entire value chains aligned with the Paris Agreement. It also urged the companies to set up clear renewable energy targets and key indicators, such as the proportion of zero-emissions orders and zero-emissions transport methods, as well as goals for engagement with sellers and consumers, plus stronger environmental disclosures. As more Chinese e-commerce companies set up overseas branches, such as TikTok and Pinduoduo-owned Temu, they must be aware of their environmental impacts, the group said. “With different regulations in different countries, it is crucial that China’s e-commerce companies have strategies on how to manage their global climate and environmental footprints,” Tang said. “This is likely to impact their image and even the global image of Chinese companies as a whole.” Post",

    "originBody": "Mirage News Mirage News Mirage News World 10 Nov 2023 10:24 pm AEDT Date Time Share Chinas Singles Day E-Commerce Frenzy Sparks Stress, Inescapable Greenpeace \"So many shopping festivals this year!\" the young man explains. \"Every day is a shopping festival.\" Then, the calls suddenly start coming in. Delivery drivers bring products that were never purchased. Discount prices and \"unbelievable sales\" start ringing in their ears. It's all-consuming, highly annoying, and downright scary – there's no escaping China's shopping holidays! That's the joke at the center of this skit from Papi Jiang Papi酱, a skit comedian well known in China. But for her fans, the frustration is all too familiar. \"Delete the orange app and you'll be fine!\" she yells in the skit. For any shopper familiar with China's e-commerce platforms, that's Taobao, a major shopping app owned by Alibaba. \"The red app has shopping festivals, too!\" her friend replies, a reference to Pinduoduo, which is owned by the same company as Temu, a platform that has recently gained quick popularity in the US and UK for its super cheap products, where you can \"shop like a billionaire\". The horror-themed skit tells a real life story that frustrates many young people in China: the salesmanship of consumerist shopping holidays awaits them every time they open their phones, whether they have the money or not. Pop ups for new sales haunt them. Tempting, but ultimately empty, promises of cheap purchases follow them wherever they go. Escaping from the platform It's difficult to escape, in part, because these sales are pushed on the platforms managed by what in China are called platform companies. Alibaba, Pinduoduo, and Tencent are all platform companies, because they manage huge platforms. And their reach is inescapable. At Greenpeace East Asia, Beijing we strategically push platform companies to apply this leverage for good, not evil. Over the years, we have campaigned on the climate, biodiversity, and waste impacts of consumerism for years: as early as 2016, we called out the risks of consumerism; in 2017, we calculated CO2 emissions from clothing sales, which we found produced 258,000 tons in a year – equivalent to the CO2 absorbed by 2.58 million trees. And by 2019, we were tackling packaging waste and how unnecessary over-packaging has become a frequent frustration for people buying goods online in China. A second-hand clothing shop in Beijing full of clothes due to over-consumption © Greenpeace / Yan Tu Over that time, we've seen how people around China have started to sour to the salesmanship that barks at them each year as November begins. These platform companies have to move beyond the bottom line and think about their responsibilities to both the consumer and the environment. So in 2021, we published our first e-commerce platform ranking, evaluating how companies pledge and manage their environmental commitments. This year, Greenpeace East Asia, Beijing released another ranking of how e-commerce platforms perform on climate, biodiversity, waste, and overseeing chemicals sold in products. We examine their commitments, what they say they'll do, and whether they do it, by observing what actions they've taken to support sustainable use. Ultimately, we ask: are they using their platform the way they could? Overall, we found that platforms are warming up to action on climate, and we're watching closely how this translates into action. No progress from Pinduoduo Pinduoduo, China's second-largest e-commerce platform in terms of total users, has been successful in attracting thrifty Chinese consumers during this year's Double Eleven sale season. The platform's flagship subsidy program has covered over 620 million users, making it a popular choice among more cost-conscious buyers as China's economy slows. However, despite its popularity among consumers, Pinduoduo has once again ranked the lowest in the latest Greenpeace East Asia, Beijing e-commerce ranking, which covers Alibaba, Vipshop, JD.com, ByteDance, Kuaishou, and Pinduoduo. This is not the first time Pinduoduo has found itself at the bottom of the list, as it also ranked last in 2021's ranking. This ranking evaluates and scores the environmental performance of the above e-commerce companies in China with an updated set of criteria, which consists of three pillars and four environmental issues. While some companies have made progress, Pinduoduo has not disclosed any information related to climate change and environmental action. The growth of PDD Holdings, the parent company of Pinduoduo and Temu, has been incredibly rapid. However, this growth has come at a cost, as the company's lack of action on climate and environmental issues has become more apparent. Pinduoduo and PDD Holdings must take action now by setting decarbonization goals, disclosing information on climate and the environment, and building a corporate government structure dedicated to such issues.

(Photo by Nikos Pekiaridis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) An e-commerce app focusing on selling cheap goods to overseas consumers, Temu made its foray into Asia through Japan and South Korea in July. In Japan and South Korea, Temu has overtaken Shein by staying at the top of shopping app rankings in those locations for a longer period of time, according to data.ai analysis shared with CNBC. Temu is backed by Nasdaq-listed Chinese tech giant PDD Holdings, which also owns China-based e-commerce app Pinduoduo. Chinese low-cost retailer Temu is dominating app stores in Japan and South Korea in its category, dethroning rival Shein after its successful expansion in Western markets. \"Temu has rapidly expanded its footprint beyond the U.S. and into a number of international geographies and we believe is now available in 40+ countries ... where we continue to see opportunities for growth in the quarters ahead,\" said Goldman Sachs in an Oct. 4 report. The investment firm estimated that Temu, which is owned by PDD Holdings, \"now generates more than $1 billion of [monthly transaction value]\" and expects \"continued growth into second half 2023.\" Its rival Shein was estimated to be on track to hit $30 billion in transaction value in 2022, according to media reports. Temu has overtaken Shein in Japan and South Korea by staying at the top of shopping app rankings in those locations for a longer period of time, according to data.ai analysis shared with CNBC. Since its July launch in Japan to Nov. 2, \"Temu has ranked #1 by daily iOS & Google Play shopping app downloads in Japan for 101 days out of 124 days,\" said the app analytics and data company. Money Report NEWS 21 MINS AGO China's ICBC, the world's biggest bank, hit by cyberattack that reportedly disrupted Treasury markets NEWS 2 HOURS AGO Biden-Xi summit could be last chance to stabilize U.S.-China relationship: Op-ed By comparison, Shein spent just 17 days topping the two app stores in the same period in Japan. Temu was the fastest to reach four million downloads in Japan, taking around 121 days, compared to Shein which took 155 days, according to data.ai. Japanese marketplace Mercari took 427 days and Amazon 660 days, the data showed. Similarly, in South Korea, Temu ranked No. 1 by daily iOS & Google Play shopping app downloads for 65 days out of 93 days from Aug. 1 to Nov. 2, overtaking Alibaba's AliExpress (25 days) while Shein ranks among the top 5. Among the top shopping apps in South Korea, Temu was the fastest to reach 2 million downloads at around 88 days. Shein took 382 days while AliExpress took 366 days to hit the same milestone. Temu and Shein's rivalry extend outside the e-commerce space to the courtroom. Shein sued Temu in December over intellectual-property infringement while Temu accused Shein in July of threatening and forcing manufacturers into exclusivity agreements. But recent documents showed that both parties have applied to end their lawsuits against each other. Temu's rise Temu is backed by Nasdaq-listed Chinese tech giant PDD Holdings, which also owns China-based e-commerce app Pinduoduo. Launched in the U.S. in September 2022, Temu was PDD's first major push overseas and quickly found success among budget-conscious consumers. In just a few weeks, the Chinese ecommerce app rose to the top of app stores and subsequently expanded rapidly across countries such as Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U.K. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, the Chinese online retailer focuses on selling made-in-China goods, from fashion to household products, at low prices to overseas consumers. Similarly, Shein relies on contracted manufacturers, mostly in China, to design, produce and ship its low-priced products. Temu made its foray into Asia through Japan and South Korea in July. It then entered the Philippines on Aug. 26 before launching in Malaysia on Sept. 8. \"We believe the main reason for [PDD's] 131% year-on-year growth in transaction service revenues and 135% year-on-year growth in cost of goods sold in second quarter 2023 was related to fast ramp of Temu performance,\" Citi analysts said in a Aug. 29 report. The platform has been expanding rapidly since its launch by leveraging its parent company's strength in supply chain and marketing. \"Much of PDD's incremental investment dollars have been deployed to make Temu happen,\" said Bernstein analysts in a Sept. 15 report, adding that Temu's multi-million Super Bowl advertisement \"solidified Temu's mind share for a number of its target customers.\" \"We believe that Temu's rapid rise in popularity was supported by the company's elevated marketing investments, its low prices and focus on promotions, and to the success of its referral campaigns,\" said Berstein's analysts. The analysts said they expect to see \"an increase in the number of active users and order volume\" in Temu contributing to non-U.S. transaction value and \"increasingly contributing to growth from here.\" In June, the U.S. House Select Committee alleged that Shein and Temu violated import tariff law by importing goods into the U.S. without paying import duties or making shipments subject to human rights reviews.

    "originBody": "By Granth Vanaik (Reuters) – Black Friday? No. Cyber Monday? Nope. Prime Day? Absolutely not. The world’s biggest shopping event happens in China each year – and it’s called Singles Day. Originally a holiday to celebrate being single, as a counter to Valentine’s Day, the event has grown into a weeks-long online shopping festival that peaks on Nov. 11. WHEN DID THE IDEA OF SINGLES DAY ORIGINATE? The idea for Singles Day had originated at China’s Nanjing University back in 1993 and was originally called “Bachelor’s Day.” On the day, single people treat themselves with gifts and presents, while also organizing social gatherings and parties. HOW MUCH DO CONSUMERS SPEND? Last year, the total value of goods sold during the shopping bonanza – also known as “Double 11” – totaled 1.15 trillion yuan ($157.97 billion), according to data from consultancy firm Bain. That is more than four times the $35.3 billion U.S. shoppers spent last year during Cyber Week, the period from Black Friday to Cyber Monday, per data from Adobe Analytics. Cyber Monday immediately follows Black Friday, which falls on the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday, the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States. But growth has been slowing even as overall sales for Singles Day hit record highs, with last year’s 3% rise marking the slowest increase ever. The event has in recent years lost some of its novelty with the rise of other shopping festivals in China, including the midyear “618” sales that are the country’s second largest. Strict COVID-19 curbs in China impacted sales last year, but several industry experts are expecting a rebound, as the economy improves and livestream sales remain robust. “We’re optimistic about growth this year because the recovery seems to be stabilizing and consumption is on a more clear upward trend,” said Jacob Cooke, co-founder and CEO of Beijing-based WPIC Marketing + Technologies. His e-commerce consultancy firm expects sales for the Chinese shopping event to rise in the range between 14% and 18% from last year, which is higher than Adobe’s projection for a 5.4% rise in Cyber Week sales. WHAT MAJOR BRANDS AND PRODUCTS ARE SHOPPERS BUYING? While Alibaba started “Double 11” in 2009 to win over online shoppers with discounts and promotions, China’s major e-commerce platforms now all take part in it. JD.com joined in 2012 and PDD Holdings-owned Pinduoduo has also become a significant player, offering low cost products in competition with Alibaba-owned Tmall and Taobao platforms. Last year, Chinese shoppers spent more on essentials, supplements, vitamins and pet-care products. Those products are expected to stay in demand this year, along with more lifestyle-focused products such as athletic wear and sports equipment. “There is enormous demand among Chinese consumers for products and services that improve their lifestyles and facilitate self-expression,” Cooke said. HOW DOES SINGLES DAY COMPARE TO BLACK FRIDAY? In comparison, U.S. shoppers last year had bought more Pokemon toys, Hot Wheels, TVs, footwear and air fryers during the key Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping periods, according to Adobe. From 2014 until 2021, Singles Day had posted growth rates of about 34% annually on average, versus Cyber Week’s 17% average gain, according to data from consultancy Bain and from Adobe Analytics. WHAT OTHER COMPANIES HOPE TO BENEFIT? Several American companies from apparel makers Nike and Lululemon to cosmetics firm Estee Lauder and consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble have a big presence on the Tmall marketplace and stand to benefit from the event. Last year, Apple, Nike and L’Oreal were also among the biggest winners from the event, along with Chinese home appliance makers such as Haier and Midea and sportswear brand Anta. Nike said in December “Double 11” demand in Greater China grew by mid-teens, outpacing the broader sports industry, with demand from Gen Z consumers for the brand growing by 45% during the shopping period in China on Tmall. JD.com had noted Apple sold more than 1 billion yuan worth of products in the first minute of the event’s final sales period. However, for this year, several global companies ranging from L’Oreal to Estee Lauder have taken a cautious stance around the spending spree in China during the shopping event. “The presale period of Tmall and particularly on — in general, the Singles Day, confirms a softer trend versus a year ago,” said Estee Lauder CEO Fabrizio Freda last week, adding that the company was more optimistic about the next part of the Singles Day events in November. L’Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus on a post earnings call with analysts in October said it was too soon to comment on “Double 11.” “The shy consumers are less shy during the big events, and we have seen that whether it’s during Valentine’s Day, whether it is 6/18, the market has had its best peaks of growth during this moment,” Hieronimus said, adding he had lots of hope for the shopping bonanza.

It specializes in offering a wide range of products, from clothing and electronics to fresh produce and agricultural goods. What sets Pinduoduo apart from traditional e-commerce giants like Alibaba and JD.com is its unique business model. This incorporates social commerce and group buying.

Which is the parent company of Pinduoduo? The parent company of the firm is PDD Holdings. What is the official website of the company? The official website of the company is www.pinduoduo.com. Business Model Pinduoduo’s business model revolves around the concept of “team purchase.” Instead of individual consumers making separate transactions, Pinduoduo encourages users to collaborate with friends, family, or other users. The idea is to allow them to purchase products at lower prices collectively. This approach leverages the power of group buying, enabling customers to enjoy significant discounts in exchange for bulk purchases. One of Pinduoduo’s distinctive features is its integration of social elements into the shopping experience. Users can share product listings, deals, and discounts with their contacts on the platform, fostering a sense of community and collaboration. This social engagement has contributed to the platform’s rapid growth. Pinduoduo has also embraced agricultural e-commerce, connecting farmers directly to consumers. This approach has helped reduce the cost of agricultural products for consumers while ensuring fair compensation for farmers. It reflects the company’s commitment to both social responsibility and affordability. History a) Founding and Early Growth Colin Huang, a former Google engineer, founded Pinduoduo in September 2015. Huang’s vision was to create an e-commerce platform that would cater to the needs of value-conscious consumers in China’s lower-tier cities and rural areas. He believed that the existing e-commerce giants needed to be more effectively serving this demographic. This led to the birth of Pinduoduo. The company quickly gained traction by offering various products at highly competitive prices. It attracted users through a gamified shopping experience. It encouraged them to invite friends and family to join the collective buying process. This innovative approach to e-commerce enabled Pinduoduo to expand its user base rapidly. b) Going Public Pinduoduo made its debut on the Nasdaq Stock Market in July 2018. This marked one of the most significant initial public offerings by a Chinese company in the United States. The IPO raised over $1.6 billion, validating Pinduoduo’s position as a major player in the e-commerce arena. c) Rapid Growth and Market Share Pinduoduo’s meteoric rise continued in the following years. By 2020, the platform had surpassed 700 million active users, mainly from China’s lower-tier cities and rural areas. The company’s focus on affordability and the power of collective purchasing resonated with a vast and underserved consumer base. Pinduoduo’s success was also reflected in its market share. In 2020, it became the second-largest e-commerce platform in China, trailing only behind Alibaba’s Tmall. It surpassed JD.com in terms of gross merchandise volume (GMV). This rapid ascent solidified Pinduoduo’s position as a formidable competitor in the Chinese e-commerce landscape. Controversies Despite its remarkable success, Pinduoduo has been subject to controversy. Here are some major issues the company has faced over the years. 1) Counterfeit and Low-Quality Products One of the most significant controversies surrounding Pinduoduo is the presence of counterfeit and low-quality products on its platform. As the company expanded quickly, it faced challenges in monitoring and regulating its vast product listings. Many users reported receiving items that needed to meet their expectations regarding quality, authenticity, or safety. Pinduoduo has taken measures to address this issue. These included strengthening its quality control and implementing a stricter seller vetting process. However, the problem of counterfeit and substandard products continues to be a concern for the platform. 2) Labor Issues Pinduoduo faced allegations of exploitative labor practices in its warehouses. Reports emerged of long working hours, insufficient pay, and poor working conditions for employees in the company’s fulfillment centers. These allegations drew public attention and raised questions about the company’s commitment to fair labor practices. Pinduoduo responded that it would improve labor conditions and ensure its employees are treated fairly. Labor rights advocates and the media closely monitored the company’s actions to rectify these issues. 3) Data Privacy Concerns Like many technology companies, Pinduoduo has grappled with data privacy concerns. The vast amount of user data collected by the platform, including personal information and shopping preferences, has raised questions about how this data is used and safeguarded. Pinduoduo has tried to address these concerns by enhancing its data protection measures, including stricter data access controls and privacy policies. However, the broader conversation about data privacy in the tech industry continues to evolve. Pinduoduo, like many other companies, remains under scrutiny in this regard. 4) Malware concerns The company has faced malware concerns due to its vast user base and product listings. With rapid growth comes the challenge of monitoring third-party sellers. Some users have reported encountering malicious software or counterfeit products. Pinduoduo has taken steps to enhance security and ensure product quality, but the issue of malware remains a concern. Users receive advice to exercise caution and employ security measures when shopping on the platform. This emphasizes the need for continuous vigilance in the ever-evolving landscape of online marketplaces. Pinduoduo’s commitment to addressing these concerns is essential in maintaining its reputation and user trust.

    "originBody": "Share Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Maybe you have seen one or another video on YouTube with the phrase “spend like a millionaire” and it may have tempted you to buy after seeing the prices it offers. Therefore, you need to ask yourself “why is Temu so cheap?” This online store of Asian origin recently arrived in the Mexican market, with a presence for a couple of months. It has a free application in the App Store and Google Play that has maintained an increase in downloads that can only be compared with the arrival of TikTok, Didi or other similar options. Contents hide 1 Why is Temu so cheap? 2 How reliable is the Temu online store? Why is Temu so cheap? According to the company in response to TIME, the reason why Temu is so cheap is thanks to its extensive network of merchants, logistics partners and established ecosystem. [por Pinduoduo] built over the years. In fact, there are many new customers who actually pay nothing at all. This is because Temu has launched a social media campaign where the more you convince to sign up, the more credits you earn. According to Douglas Schmidt, a computer science professor at Vanderbilt University: “It appears they are being subsidized to be a loss leader in order to gain market share, which is not much different from what Amazon did for a long time.” . However, the company, the US subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, is also starting to develop a reputation for undelivered packages, mysterious charges, incorrect orders and unresponsive customer service. Temu has already received more than 30 complaints on the Better Business Bureau and has a rating of less than 1.5 stars on the BBB. There are concerns from agencies like the BBB about the company’s reliability, although so far they have not given any warnings about it. How reliable is the Temu online store? Temu itself acknowledges that its deliveries usually take longer compared to Amazon, generally 7 to 15 business days, because they come from “overseas warehouses.” However, it appears that Temu has also experienced difficulties in meeting this long delivery deadline. In October, the Better Business Bureau’s Boston office opened a file on Temu and has received 31 complaints related to the company’s website. The BBB’s Melanie McGovern says it’s unusual for such a new company to receive so many complaints in such a short period of time. Although Temu has responded to all complaints posted on the BBB website, many of them still remain unresolved. That said, it is important to note that there have been no complaints to the BBB alleging that products shipped by Temu are counterfeits or counterfeit products. Therefore, Temu may be reliable and the reason why its products are so cheap is only a sales strategy to confront the large online stores present such as Amazon, AliExpress, Mercado Libre, among others.

Whatever your opinion, always remember to check the terms and conditions when purchasing.",
