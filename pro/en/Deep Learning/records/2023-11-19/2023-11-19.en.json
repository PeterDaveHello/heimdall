    "originBody": "Chosun University Researchers Introduce a Machine Learning Framework for Precise Localization of Bleached Corals Using Bag-of-Hybrid Visual Feature Classification By Aneesh Tickoo - November 18, 2023 Reddit Vote Flip Share Tweet 0 Shares The most diversified marine environment on Earth is said to be found in coral reefs. Over 4,000 kinds of fish may be found in the coral reefs, home to an estimated 25% of all marine life. In coral, underwater parasite algae, or zooxanthellae, produces vibrant calcium carbonate structures known as reefs. When the water temperature rises, and algae escape from the coral’s tissue, the coral reef bleaches. Coral reef bleaching is linked to several environmental and economic problems. Because of the extremely high summertime sea surface temperature (SST), global warming is the primary cause of bleaching. In Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in 2016, bleaching killed 29–50% of the coral. Moreover, bleaching raises the CO2 levels in the world’s seas daily, making the environment more acidic and making it harder for other corals and marine life to form skeletons. Reefs are home to various marine life and contain many medicinal substances that can treat many of the world’s most serious illnesses. Monitoring and surveying marine ecology is necessary to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Due to artifacts and ambient noise in the underwater picture, the computer vision system finds it challenging to discriminate between the target item in the foreground and the background. Thus, techniques for improving underwater images have been created. By first transforming photos into the HSI model and then extending the saturation and intensity components of the image, the integrated color model (ICM) and the unsupervised color correction method (UCM) improve contrast. Researchers studying artificial intelligence (AI) want to create a reliable and computationally effective way to locate bleached coral reefs. However, differences in lighting, size, orientation, perspective, occlusions, and background clutter degrade the performance of their localization models. The camera’s depth, the mount’s location, and the fluctuating light sources in the surveillance area are responsible for the changes in the object’s scale, perspective, and lighting, respectively. 🔥 Free AI Webinar: How to Chat with Images Data Using New GPT-4 Vision API [Nov 20, 10 am PST] Researchers from Chosun University in this project aim to create deep learning and handmade feature extraction methods that can withstand the geometric and visual variances found in photos of maritime environments. While appearance-based characteristics include an object’s texture and color details, geometric features primarily rely on the local distribution of curves and edges that form an object’s shape inside the image. Variations in lighting, size, orientation, perspective, occlusions, and background clutter affect appearance features and geometry. In most classification jobs, manual feature extractors are replaced by deep neural network (DNN) models. Due to their domain independence and extensive dataset training, deep neural networks (DNNs) like ResNet, DenseNet, VGGNet, and Inceptions models achieve unparalleled performance across various applications. Because there are fewer bleached examples in the current datasets, the DNN overfits, which compromises the robustness and uniqueness of the features. However, the robustness and uniqueness of the handmade feature are independent of the strength of the training data. The handmade feature’s invariance is nevertheless impacted by changes in depth, underwater light, and water turbidity, even with noise robustness. The project aims to create an invariant feature extraction model that is resistant to changes in coral picture geometry and photometry. ↗ Recommended Read: LLMWare Launches RAG-Specialized 7B Parameter LLMs: Production-Grade Fine-Tuned Models for Enterprise Workflows Involving Complex Business Documents The suggested framework uses hybrid handmade and DNN techniques to extract raw features, and then the BoF reduces and introduces more invariance to increase classification accuracy. The suggested model uses local characteristics from the picture rather than global features to improve photometric invariance. Moreover, the suggested architecture’s use of a bag of features lowers the raw hybrid feature vector’s dimension, which reduces complexity and the need for storage. After much trial and error, the ideal patch, cluster size, kernel combination, and classifier have been determined. Check out the Paper.

    "originBody": "The Cloud in Your Pocket PockEngine cleverly breaks up large AI models so that they can be retrained on portable devices, enabling a new level of personalization. Nick BildFollow 17 hours ago • Machine Learning & AI PockEngine enables fine-tuning of large models on small devices (📷: MIT News) Large deep learning models are dramatically reshaping people’s opinions of artificial intelligence (AI), and are finding many useful applications in industry. But so far, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg. These technologies promise to be far more transformative when we move beyond the general, one-size-fits-all models that largely dominate the landscape today, and move into the era of personalization. Consider an AI application that is finely-tuned to who you are, knowing your preferences, personality, and so on. Such an application could revolutionize the way we interact with technology on a daily basis. Imagine a virtual assistant that not only understands your voice commands but also anticipates your needs based on your past behavior and preferences. This level of personalization could extend to various aspects of your life, from suggesting personalized fitness routines and dietary plans to curating news feeds tailored to your interests. As we delve deeper into personalization, these AI systems could become indispensable companions, seamlessly integrating into our routines and enhancing our overall efficiency and well-being. An overview of the method (📷: L. Zhu et al.) The impact of personalized AI extends far beyond personal assistants. In the realm of healthcare, for instance, personalized medical assistants could analyze vast amounts of patient data to offer tailored treatment plans, taking into account individual genetic factors, lifestyle choices, personal response patterns, and more. However, personalizing large models to individual users requires a great deal of computational power, often far more than what standard devices can provide. This necessitates transferring personal data to cloud servers, where the processing and customization can be done. However, this raises privacy concerns as sensitive information is being transmitted over the internet. This opens the door to data breaches or other unauthorized access that many individuals find unacceptable. A team led by researchers at MIT is seeking to put the power of personalization in your pocket with their recently published technique called PockEngine. Most portable consumer electronics, like smartphones, do not have the computational horsepower or memory needed to fine-tune a large machine learning model. This is true, in large part, because the way in which modern AI algorithms are trained requires that the full model, with all of its parameters, be loaded into memory at the same time. PockEngine gets around this requirement through some clever tricks that allow it to select specific portions of a larger model for retraining. Retraining can take place on portions of the model (📷: L. Zhu et al.) Initially, PockEngine fine-tunes each layer of a model, one at a time to understand how each segment contributes to the model’s overall accuracy. The system then determines which layers, or pieces of layers are the most important. These segments are extracted from the full network, then can be fully loaded into memory for additional training on new data for personalization. This process only needs to be done once, so the training process will not take a performance hit for using PockEngine. The researchers tested their methods on a wide range of systems, ranging from computers with Apple M1 processors to Raspberry Pis and NVIDIA Jetson edge AI computers. It was discovered that on-device training was sped up by as much as a factor of fifteen, and that speed was not met with any decreases in model accuracy. And importantly for these edge platforms, PockEngine also dramatically reduced the amount of memory that was required for retraining. Experiments were conducted in which popular models, like the Llama-V2 large language model, were retrained using PockEngine. In addition to the aforementioned benefits of the technique, it was also demonstrated that these models could be effectively personalized for individual users. Moving forward, the researchers intend to further refine their methods, such that it may eventually be possible to retrain even larger models on edge hardware. They plan, for example, to enable retraining models that incorporate both image and text inputs in the near future. machine learning artificial intelligence energy efficiency cloud smartphone Nick BildFollow R&D, creativity, and building the next big thing you never knew you wanted are my specialties.",

KIRSTY WIGGLESWORTH - WPA POOL/GETTY IMAGES OpenAI just underwent an abrupt, dramatic leadership shakeup. A key figure at the center of the turmoil, OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, is also a big reason why Tesla CEO Elon Musk is no longer friends with Google cofounder and former CEO Larry Page—years after a pivotal battle to recruit the artificial-intelligence expert. On Friday, OpenAI announced that cofounder and CEO Sam Altman had been fired by the board of directors, and that Mira Murati, the chief technology officer, would serve as interim CEO. The maker of the AI chatbot ChatGPT claimed that Altman was “was not consistently candid” with the board, without providing details. It also said that another cofounder, chairman Greg Brockman, would be removed from that role while staying at the company. But Brockman then indicated that he would quit. That meant that there was only remaining member of the core founding group behind OpenAI: Sutskever. A Russian-born Israeli-Canadian, Sutskever is a leading expert in deep learning, a subset of machine learning. He’s also on OpenAI’s board. Ilya Sutskever, Russian Israeli-Canadian computer scientist and cofounder and chief scientist of OpenAI, speaks at Tel Aviv University on June 5. JACK GUEZ/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES “Last night, Sam got a text from Ilya asking to talk at noon Friday,” Brockman wrote on X late Friday. “Sam joined a Google Meet and the whole board, except Greg, was there. Ilya told Sam he was being fired and that the news was going out very soon.” Central to the shakeup was the issue of AI safety, according to anonymous sources who spoke to Bloomberg, with Altman and Sutskever disagreeing on how quickly to commercialize generative AI products and the steps needed to reduce possible public harm. Musk’s tussle with Google over Sutskever Musk has a history with both OpenAI, which he played a key role in starting, and with Sutskever, whom he persuaded to join OpenAI as a cofounder and chief scientist in 2015, rather than stay at Google. On a Nov. 9 episode of the Lex Fridman Podcast, Musk described how pivotal Sutskever was to the success of OpenAI. In 2015, Musk said, he worked hard to recruit Sutskever to OpenAI, which he then envisioned as open-source nonprofit that would act as a counterweight to Google’s power in artificial intelligence. Musk has long warned of the potential dangers of AI. Meanwhile Demis Hassabis, cofounder and CEO of DeepMind, which Google acquired in 2014, was trying to persuade Sutskever that Google was the best place for him. “It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both trying to recruit Ilya, and Ilya went back and forth,” said Musk. “Finally he did agree to join openAI. That was one of the toughest recruiting battles I’ve ever had, but that was really the linchpin for OpenAI being successful.” Musk described himself as the “prime mover behind OpenAI, in the sense that it was created because of discussions that I had with [Google cofounder] Larry Page back when he and I were friends.” He described staying at Page’s house and talking to him about AI safety. “Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time he didn’t,” Musk said. “At one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human. And I’m like, ‘Well, what team are you on Larry?’” Musk said that what concerned him was that Google had acquired DeepMind and had “probably two-thirds of all the AI researchers in the world. They had basically infinite money and compute, and the guy in charge, Larry Page, did not care about safety.” When Fridman suggested Musk and Page might become friends again, Musk replied, “I’d like to be friends with Larry again. Really the breaking of the friendship was over OpenAI, and specifically I think the key moment was recruiting Ilya Sutskever.” Musk called Sutskever “a good human—smart, good heart.” Disappointment with OpenAI Musk left OpenAI’s board in 2018 after a power struggle. In the years since he’s expressed disgust with its direction under Altman, especially after OpenAI accepted billions in investments from Microsoft and moved away from its nonprofit status. Musk now has a ChapGPT competitor called Grok. Altman has called Musk a “jerk” but also recently acknowledged his role in OpenAI’s founding. “Elon was definitely a talent magnet and attention magnet, for sure, and also just like has some real superpowers that were super helpful to us in those early days,” he said on the In Good Company podcast in September. Musk, for his part, tweeted earlier this year, “OpenAI was created as an open source (which is why I named it “Open” AI), non-profit company to serve as a counterweight to Google, but now it has become a closed source, maximum-profit company effectively controlled by Microsoft. Not what I intended at all.” Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business. Sign up for free.

During training, local minima within the subspace spanned by these basis networks are sought, enabling significant compaction of the deep model. PRANC addresses challenges in storing and communicating deep models, offering potential applications in multi-agent learning, continual learners, federated systems, and edge devices. PRANC enables memory-efficient inference through on-the-fly generation of layerwise weights. The study discusses prior works on model compression and continual learning using randomly initialized networks and subnetworks. It compares various compression methods, including hashing, pruning, and quantization, highlighting their limitations. The proposed PRANC framework aims at extreme model compression, outperforming existing methods. PRANC is compared with traditional codecs and learning-based approaches in image compression, showing its efficacy. Limitations include challenges in reparameterizing specific model parameters and the computational cost of training large models. The research challenges the notion that improved accuracy in deep models stems solely from increased complexity or parameters. PRANC is a novel approach parameterizing a deep model as a linear combination of frozen random models, aiming to compress models significantly for efficient storage and communication.

The study emphasizes the need for extreme compression rates and compares PRANC with other compression methods. Limitations include challenges in reparameterizing specific model parameters and computational expense for large models. 🔥 Free AI Webinar: How to Chat with Images Data Using New GPT-4 Vision API [Nov 20, 10 am PST] PRANC is a framework that parametrizes deep models by combining randomly initialized models in the weight space. It optimizes weights for task-solving, achieving task loss minimization in the span of basis models. Using a single scalar seed for model generation and learned coefficients for reconstruction reduces communication costs. The optimization employs standard backpropagation, enhancing memory efficiency by chunking basis models and generating each chunk with a GPU-based pseudo-random generator. PRANC’s application to image compression is explored, comparing its performance with other methods. The approach evaluates PRANC’s image classification and compression performance, showcasing its superiority in both tasks. PRANC achieves significant compression, outperforming baselines almost 100 times in image classification, enabling memory-efficient inference. Image compression surpasses JPEG and trained INR methods in PSNR and MS-SSIM evaluations across bitrates. Visualizations illustrate reconstructed images using different subsets. Comparisons with pruning methods highlight competitive accuracy and parameter efficiency. ↗ Recommended Read: LLMWare Launches RAG-Specialized 7B Parameter LLMs: Production-Grade Fine-Tuned Models for Enterprise Workflows Involving Complex Business Documents PRANC is a framework that significantly compresses deep models by parametrizing them as a linear combination of randomly initialized and frozen models.
