(CBS) -- One year after a security guard was ambushed and shot on the job inside the River Oaks Mall in Calumet City, officials have announced a break in the case. Norman Thomas, an Army veteran who worked as a security guard at River Oaks Center shopping mall, was shot and killed during a jewelry store robbery on Nov. 16, 2022. Family photo Maxx Tucker and Frank Adkins, both 38, are both now facing first-degree murder charges. They were arrested by the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force on Monday. On Wednesday, Nov. 16, 2022, security guard Norman Thomas was shot and killed during a jewelry store robbery at the mall. Thomas was at the entrance of the store when the robbers ambushed him and immediately fired rounds. The guard did not have time to react. The three robbers then used their weapons to break a display case and steal jewelry. This all went down in under a minute. As the robbers left the store, they stepped over the bleeding guard, and then ran out of the mall with the goods and the guns they used. \"It's hard. It's really been hard,\" said Syrall Thomas, Norman Thomas' widow. \"Still heartbreaking.\" Norman Thomas' family spoke Friday to reporters, including CBS 2's Tara Molina, out outside the Calumet City Police Department Friday. They were joined by Calumet City Mayor Thaddeus Jones. Syrall Thomas expressed relief at the two arrests. \"It's just a great feeling,\" she said. Norman Thomas was a son, husband, father, and grandfather. \"He would also tell you that he was the protector,\" said Syrall Thomas. \"He would give the shirt off his back just to provide, if you needed it,\" said Norman Thomas' daughter, Erykah Thomas. Norman Thomas was a veteran who served during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. He was escribed as a family man, and a hard worker with a big heart. \"He is more than just a news story,\" said Erykah Thomas. \"He was a person. He was my father.\" Calumet City police Chief Kevin Kolosh said police are still looking for the third person involved in the murder. \"The investigation is ongoing, and we're not done here. There's more work that needs to be done. There's more follow-up that we have to do,\" Kolosh said. \"But to get these two off the street is something the community will benefit from.\" The mall has come under scrutiny multiple times over the past several years for. In 2019, there was a fatal shooting outside the mall. In 2021, someone fired shots inside and no one was hurt. Calumet City officials last year had been trying to acquire the shopping center to take control and increase security. CBS 2's Molina asked Kolosh what has been done to address concerns in the past year. \"The mall has been a lot better with their communication with us,\" Kolosh said. \"Their security staff has been spoken to; has been trained additional, and they're quicker at reporting things to us. And they're out there, and they're doing more patrol work.\" The South Suburban Major Crimes Task force continues to investigate the case.

A security guard at a high school in Miami was arrested after he was accused of inappropriate conduct with an underage student, police said. Kayaun Kendrick Whitfield, a security guard at Booker T. Washington Senior High School, was arrested Thursday on charges of offenses against students by authority figures, false imprisonment, and child neglect, an arrest report said. The alleged incident happened Wednesday when the victim, a juvenile student at the school, had asked for a ride home and was picked up by the 38-year-old Whitfield, the report said. Miami-Dade Corrections Kayaun Kendrick Whitfield The student said Whitfield took him to a liquor store and bought vodka and orange juice, and offered the student a drink but he declined, the report said. They then went to a restaurant and picked up food before stopping at an ATM, then drove to a parking lot at Traz Powell Stadium on Northwest 27th Avenue, the report said. Whitfield told the student to get in the back seat and when they were in the back, Whitfield handed the teen a $100 bill, the report said.

When they arrived at the student's home, the student said Whitfield locked the car doors and refused to let him out, while repeatedly asking if the student was going to tell his mother what happened, the report said. The student said he was eventually able to roll down a window and open the car door from the outside so he could get out and run home, the report said.

CALUMET CITY, Ill. (WLS) -- Two suspects have been charged in the fatal shooting of a security guard at River Oaks Mall last year, Calumet City police said Friday. Norman Thomas, a U.S. Army veteran, was working security at a jewelry store inside the mall on Nov. 16, 2022, when police said he was shot and killed during a robbery.

    "title": "Traverse City DDA Delays Installation of Downtown Security Cameras",
    "originLink": "https://www.traverseticker.com/news/dda-tables-downtown-security-cameras/",
    "originBody": "DDA Tables Downtown Security Cameras By Beth MilliganNov. 18, 2023 Traverse City Downtown Development Authority (DDA) board members put the brakes Friday on a proposal to install more than three dozen security cameras – which would’ve have been leased from a private security company and operated by the Traverse City Police Department – throughout downtown Traverse City. Board members were skeptical of the project’s price tag and wanted more data before moving forward, as well as to explore other options like deploying a smaller number of cameras as a pilot project or partnering with private business owners to install cameras. The project, which has been discussed since 2018 and was also included as a goal in the city’s Healthier Drinking Culture Strategic Plan, called for the DDA to fund the cameras and the TCPD to manage and operate them. The cameras – leased from Flock Safety, which also has agreements with Garfield Township, East Bay Township, and Peninsula Township for license plate-reading cameras through the Sheriff’s Office – would cost $28,500 to install initially and then $114,000 to operate annually. Those costs were increased from a few weeks ago when the DDA board first discussed the proposal due to staff recommending installing 38 cameras versus 31 to provide more coverage downtown. The camera costs would have been covered by a combination of TIF 97 and Old Town TIF funds. Board members questioned whether the DDA should solely bear those costs, or if the city/TCPD should partner in covering them. DDA CEO Jean Derenzy wrote in a memo that she believed that “due to downtown’s position as a regional attraction and the amount of associated foot traffic, our regional financial partnership (TIF) should be utilized for the cost of the installation of cameras and annual ongoing costs.” TCPD Chief Matt Richmond provided a memo answering several questions previously raised by board members about the cameras. He said they would not have facial recognition technology, nor would they record audio. The cameras rely on cellular service, though Richmond said it was possible they could connect to the city’s fiber system. Board members asked whether staff had explored buying versus leasing cameras. Richmond said yes: “The determination was made to lease, as Flock would be responsible for replacing/upgrading when upgrades occur and be responsible for maintenance,” he wrote. “The benefits of leasing versus purchasing were both a financial cost savings and professional knowledge of technology upgrades in cameras.” Derenzy said the project would help provide “transparency” and “safety” downtown. Richmond said camera footage has been vital in assisting with prosecution in many criminal cases. Having the public know cameras are present can also deter crime, particularly property crimes, he said. Richmond noted approximately 15-20 percent of the TCPD’s service calls take place within DDA boundaries each year. But while Derenzy and Richmond advocated for measuring the project’s value holistically – not just based on financial ROI but on the more difficult-to-measure benefit of improving public safety and security – several DDA board members were skeptical of the proposal’s cost. With so many other DDA project priorities, board member Michael Brodsky said there was “a lot we could do with” $114,000 annually besides pay for security cameras. “I don’t think we’ve been shown there’s an active need for these cameras,” he said. Board member Katy Bertodatto agreed. “I also have a problem with the cost of this, and I’m having a hard time seeing it justified,” she said. Board member Pete Kirkwood said he didn’t want to “frustrate” law enforcement efforts to protect public safety, but said it was also the board’s responsibility “to be conservative with our community’s” resources. Kirkwood questioned whether the DDA might tackle “lower-hanging fruit” by deploying a smaller number of cameras – say 10 – in the most high-trafficked areas of downtown. Richmond said it could be difficult to narrow those down, citing the need to cover significant areas like the Open Space, the bar-heavy 100 block of South Union Street, multiple blocks of Front Street, and side streets that accommodate parade routes or events like the CherryT Ball Drop. However, board members were not persuaded, with no one willing to put a motion forward for a vote on the proposal. After it was clear there was not enough board support to move ahead, Chair Gabe Schneider suggested the proposal be tabled and additional options explored. That could include staff providing additional data and justification for the security cameras for further board discussion or looking at a “scaled-down pilot project” with a lower cost and fewer number of cameras, Schneider said. He also suggested looking at a public-private partnership that could establish a DDA fund that downtown merchants could tap into to purchase exterior security cameras for their properties in exchange for agreeing to provide access to footage to the TCPD. Several board members said they’d be willing to support one of those options or still move ahead with some kind of camera project under different parameters. The proposal is expected to return for additional discussion at a future meeting.

    "originBody": "DETROIT GM kicks security firm's officers off property amid RenCen racism, abuse allegations Andrea May Sahouri Detroit Free Press View Comments General Motors ordered a private security police force to remove from its properties officers accused of acts of racism and abusing Black people at Detroit's iconic Renaissance Center for over a decade, the company told the Free Press on Friday. General Motors also said it's reviewing its contract with the private security firm and mandated racial sensitivity and de-escalation training for officers assigned to General Motors properties in Detroit. More:Lawsuits: White officers at RenCen have harassed, assaulted Black visitors for years The action taken by General Motors came a day after the Free Press first reported the allegations, which date back as far as 2011, against the private security force, Renaissance Center Management Company, and its white officers. Multiple federal lawsuits describe a pattern of white officers assaulting, targeting, harassing and unlawfully detaining Black people in a basement cell of the Renaissance Center that has gone unchecked for years. The security company was created by General Motors Corp. to patrol the property and is majority-owned by G4S Secure Solutions, an international security company based in Florida, according to court documents filed last year. Allied Universal acquired G4S in April 2021. GM, G4S and RCMC have each been named in various lawsuits. General Motors said its \"disturbed\" by the allegations and has \"zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination.\" \"We are taking the matter seriously and are reviewing the alleged incidents where bias and use of excessive force are claimed, Allied Universal’s practices and protocols, and our contractual relationship with the company,\" General Motors wrote in its statement. General Motors confirmed that Allied Universal complied with its request, and officers have been removed from the company's Detroit properties, including the Renaissance Center and the Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center. \"Allied Universal has zero tolerance for discrimination and use of force of any kind,\" the security company said in a Friday statement. \"We were shocked and appalled upon learning of the incidents taking place at the Renaissance Center. The entity that operates the security program at Detroit's Renaissance Center was created and jointly owned by G4S and General Motors. The entity became a subsidiary of Allied Universal when it acquired G4S two years ago. We are taking all allegations involving this site very seriously and are reviewing all of the actions that have occurred during, and prior to, our involvement in this jointly owned entity.\" Renaissance Center Management Company has a state license to operate as a private security police agency through the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards under Public Act 330, giving their officers the legal authority to carry weapons and make misdemeanor arrests. Joseph Kempa, deputy executive director of the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES), confirmed to the Free Press that representatives were on site at the Renaissance Center on Thursday conducting interviews with RCMC employees. Kempa said the agency is investigating potential licensing issues and other information that could lead MCOLES to revoke to RCMC's licensing . Kempa said because MCOLES is not a law enforcement agency, it does not have the authority to conduct a criminal investigation into alleged criminal conduct. Michigan State Police confirmed last week its investigators are probing the conduct of officers at the Renaissance Center Management Company.

The panel began by posting 90 hours of security video that had already been released to media outlets. Rep. Joe Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, blasted Friday's release of the footage. “It is unconscionable that one of Speaker Johnson’s first official acts as steward of the institution is to endanger his colleagues, staff, visitors, and our country by allowing virtually unfettered access to sensitive Capitol security footage,\" Morelle said in a statement. \"That he is doing so over the strenuous objections of the security professionals within the Capitol Police is outrageous.\" Capitol Police declined to comment. According to a senior congressional aide, and staff will be working to review, clear and release footage that does not compromise security on a rolling basis. The 40,000 hours of video is expected to be made public “over the next few months,” the aide said, noting that footage that doxes, or harasses private individuals will not be posted. Johnson's announcement comes months after former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., provided exclusive access to then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson to security video from the Jan. 6 attack. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, the chairman of the Administration Committee's oversight subcommittee, said in September that security video from the Jan. 6 riot would be made available at terminals to representatives of U.S. news outlets, \"qualifying\" non-profit organizations, Jan. 6 defendants and others. Loudermilk has been critical of the now-defunct House Jan. 6 committee, which released surveillance footage last year that showed Loudermilk giving a tour of the Capitol on Jan. 5.

Two men have been charged in the fatal November 2022 shooting of a security guard at River Oaks Mall in Calumet City, NBC Chicago’s Charlie Wojciechowski reports. Erykah Thomas wiped a tear away as she remembers her father, Norman, a U.S. Army veteran who was shot and killed one year ago at River Oaks Mall in Calumet City. “To have someone take my father from us is like having the rug pulled from underneath the whole family’s feet,” she said Friday on the stairs of the village's police station. Thomas was gunned down on Nov. 16, 2022, while working security at a jewelry store in the mall. Calumet City police on Friday announced the arrest of two men - Maxx Walker and Frank Adkins, both 38 years old. Calumet City Police Chief Kevin Kolosh credited his detectives and the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force with putting the pieces of the puzzle together. “Between analyzing evidence and getting additional evidence to conduct the interviews that led us to where we are at today, he said. For Thomas’ family, which had been waiting a year for progress in the case, the news provided a small sense of relief. “It’s a good feeling,” said Thomas’ wife, Syrall. “The detectives are doing a good job, and they have gotten someone right around the time of the anniversary so it’s a great feeling.\" Local CHICAGO WEATHER 3 HOURS AGO Winter-like conditions to arrive next week, wind chill values poised to tumble into the teens CHICAGO 3 HOURS AGO ICYMI: Re-watch Chicago's 2023 Christmas tree lighting at Millennium Park Thomas’ family remembered him as a hard-working man who loved his relatives and tried to help everyone he met. “He would give the shirt off his back,” said daughter, Erykah. “If you needed it and he had it...you had it.” Walker and Adkins were arrested on Monday and have since been charged with first-degree murder.

    "title": "Trump Court Dates: Criminal and Civil Cases, 2024 Election Primary Season",
    "originLink": "https://www.justsecurity.org/88039/trumps-legal-and-political-calendar-all-the-dates-you-need-to-know/",
    "originBody": "by Norman L. Eisen, Ryan Goodman, Siven Watt, Samara Angel and Beth Markman November 17, 2023 First published on September 5, 2023, last updated on November 17, 2023 Following a series of recent court developments, former President Donald Trump’s 2023-24 legal schedule is coming into focus, as is his political one. In the calendar below, we capture significant events in both domains—and how they interrelate. The busy legal schedule includes cases in which Trump is a criminal or civil defendant. The first major date was a fortnight ago, with the first day of trial in New York Attorney General Letitia James’ civil fraud lawsuit. The trials then cascade throughout 2024, starting with the second E. Jean Carroll case in January and reaching a crescendo with the federal election interference trial in DC in March, followed by the federal classified documents trial in Florida in May. As if that active legal schedule were not enough, it will all transpire alongside the election calendar with the primary season beginning in early 2024. We are publishing this calendar to track both the legal and political milestones and to understand the interaction of the case schedules with each other and with the political dates. While the full calendar tracks hundreds of events, here are the top 20 legal and political dates as of now: Monday, November 20, 2023 – DC Trump Case: Oral argument in Trump appeal of Oct. 17 order limiting extrajudicial prejudicial statements, at 9:30 AM, before Circuit Judges Millett, Pillard, and Garcia Tuesday, November 21, 2023 – MAL: Gov’t discovery status report due Wednesday, November 22, 2023 – DC Trump Case: Trump replies due in support of his Oct. 23 motions to dismiss on statutory grounds, constitutional grounds, and for selective and vindictive prosecutions Friday, December 1, 2023 – GA (Trump, Smith, Cheeley, Shafer): Hearing on Donald Trump, Ray Smith, Robert Cheeley and David Shafer motions to dismiss and quash, and demurrers Monday, December 11, 2023 – MAL: Hearing on pretrial motions (evidentiary and/or non-evidentiary) Friday, December 15, 2023 – GA (Meadows 11th Circuit): Oral argument in Meadows appeal against district court order denying removal petition; NY Civil Fraud: Trial projected to end by this date (approximate) Wednesday, December 27, 2023 – DC Trump Case: All motions in limine and motions to suppress due January 4, 2024 – NY Criminal Documents Case: Hearing on motions to dismiss Monday, January 8, 2024 – Georgia (GA): Motions (other than motions in limine) due Monday, January 15, 2024 – DC Trump Case: Trump to provide formal notice of whether he intends to assert advice-of-counsel defense, and, if he does, provide gov’t with the required discovery Monday January 15, 2024 – Iowa Republican Presidential Caucuses Tuesday, January 16, 2024 – Carroll I: Trial begins at 9:30 AM (on damages only) Thursday-Friday, February 12-13, 2024 – MAL: Hearing on CIPA § 4 motions Friday, March 1, 2024 – MAL: Scheduling conference to consider defendant motion to continue trial Monday, March 4, 2024 – DC Trump Case: Trial begins Tuesday, March 5, 2024 – Super Tuesday Primaries Thursday, February 22, 2024 – MAL: Filing of any pre-trial motions due Monday, March 25, 2024 – NY Criminal Documents Case: Trial begins Monday, May 20, 2024 – MAL: Trial begins Monday-Thursday, July 15-18, 2024 – Republican National Convention Turning to the full calendar below, it is largely self-explanatory for readers who simply want to dive in.

    "originBody": "Congress House Republicans make January 6 footage public, over Democrats’ security concerns People can view videos on a public website and by booking in-person appointments “We will continue loading video footage … the American people deserve transparency,” said Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., who chairs the House Administration Oversight Subcommittee. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) By Justin Papp Posted November 17, 2023 at 6:40pm House Republicans are releasing most of the security footage from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol to the public, Speaker Mike Johnson announced Friday. Roughly 90 hours of footage had been posted on the House Administration Committee’s website by Friday afternoon, in a move that Democrats and left-leaning groups have called a threat to security. Starting Monday, members of the public will be able to set up in-person appointments to view the Capitol Police security footage in designated rooms within the Capitol complex. Eventually, around 95 percent of the 44,000 hours of tape will eventually be made available, excluding segments that contain sensitive security information or information that could lead to retaliation against private citizens, Johnson said. “Truth and transparency are critical. Today, we will begin immediately posting video on a public website and move as quickly as possible to add to the website nearly all of the footage, more than 40,000 hours,” Johnson said in his statement. “In the meantime, a public viewing room will ensure that every citizen can view every minute of the videos uncensored.” The House Administration Committee became the steward of the security footage according to House rules at the beginning of the 118th Congress. The Republican majority’s handling of that footage has been a source of partisan tension, as Democrats have accused their GOP colleagues of trying to whitewash the events of that day, when pro-Trump rioters entered the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of election results. Around 140 police officers were injured as members of the crowd broke their way into the Capitol, resulting in just under $3 million in damage, according to the Justice Department. More than 1,069 defendants had been charged for their involvement as of this summer. In February, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s decision to grant former Fox News host Tucker Carlson access to most of the videos angered Democrats, who argued the broadcast of the footage could jeopardize Capitol security, and many in the media, who questioned the fairness of a policy that allowed access to only one outlet. Democrats on Friday again questioned the safety of publicizing the footage. “It is unconscionable that one of Speaker Johnson’s first official acts as steward of the institution is to endanger his colleagues, staff, visitors, and our country by allowing virtually unfettered access to sensitive Capitol security footage,” said New York Democratic Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, ranking member of the House Administration Committee. “That he is doing so over the strenuous objections of the security professionals within the Capitol Police is outrageous. This is not transparency, this is dangerous and irresponsible.” A spokesperson for the Capitol Police declined to comment. Another member of the House Administration Committee, Barry Loudermilk, has used his position as chair of its Oversight subpanel to reevaluate the conclusions drawn by the Democrat-led Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, which voted unanimously at the end of the 117th Congress to refer former President Donald Trump for federal prosecution. “The goal of our investigation has been to provide the American people with transparency on what happened at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and this includes all official video from that day,” Loudermilk said in a statement Friday. “We will continue loading video footage as we conduct our investigation and continue to review footage. As I’ve said all along — the American people deserve transparency, accountability, and real answers supported by facts instead [of] a predetermined political narrative.” The Georgia Republican was himself a target of the select committee because of a tour he led of the Capitol complex on Jan. 5, 2021, which included at least one person who took part in the riot the next day. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger later said the activities of the group were not suspicious, and in one of his first moves as Oversight Subcommittee chair, Loudermilk sought to exonerate himself, releasing materials that he said cleared him of any alleged wrongdoing. In subsequent releases, Loudermilk has raised questions about the presence of plainclothes Metropolitan police officers in the crowd on the day of the Jan. 6 attack and suggested the select committee withheld information from House Administration Republicans. In September, he announced that Jan. 6 footage would be made available to news outlets and defendants facing charges related to their involvement in the Capitol attack. Johnson, who was elected speaker in late October after McCarthy was ousted, said in his statement he was delivering on a promise to make the security tapes publicly available. The decision was rewarded with a cheer from Trump. “Congratulations to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson for having the Courage and Fortitude to release all of the J6 Tapes, which will explicitly reveal what really happened on January 6th!” Trump posted on Truth Social. Meanwhile, left-leaning activist groups, like the Congressional Integrity Project, panned Johnson for what they described as his fealty to the far right. “Speaker Johnson’s release of the January 6th tapes is a serious security concern and shows that his allegiance, like Kevin McCarthy’s before him, is to Donald Trump and the ultra-right-wing faction of the House,” said Hannah Muldavin, a senior adviser at CIP and former spokesperson for the select committee. “Not only did Johnson vote against certifying the 2020 election, but he was a leader of the legal campaign to overturn it, and continues to be a danger to our democracy today. The January 6th Select Committee worked with US Capitol Police to ensure no sensitive material was released to the public — Johnson releasing the tapes does the exact opposite.” Recent Stories House Republicans make January 6 footage public, over Democrats’ security concerns Tentative Senate calendar for 2024 available Bad behavior — Congressional Hits and Misses Bliley, who rode red wave to Commerce chair, dies at 91 Photos of the week ending November 17, 2023 Guest files motion to expel Santos; Raskin says he’ll support it this time",
