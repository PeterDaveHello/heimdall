    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT DEALBOOK NEWSLETTER The Cybersecurity Lawsuit That Boards Are Talking About An S.E.C. lawsuit against a software company hacked by Russian state actors in 2020 could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks. Share full article The chief executive of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, said an S.E.C. lawsuit against his company could make chief information security officers “more fearful.” Credit... Pool photo by Demetrius Freeman/EPA, via Shutterstock By Sarah Kessler Nov. 18, 2023, 8:00 a.m. ET For the last month, an under-the-radar lawsuit has privately been a hot topic of conversation in Fortune 500 boardrooms and corporate security departments. In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued a software company hacked by Russian agents in 2020, accusing it of defrauding investors by not disclosing allegedly known cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. The lawsuit named not just the company, SolarWinds, but also its chief information security officer, Timothy Brown. A year earlier, a former chief security officer at Uber, Joe Sullivan, was found guilty of failing to disclose a data breach to federal regulators. Executives heading up cybersecurity have a sense that their personal risk is increasing. “I’ve been doing this for 25 years, and I’ve always been protecting others,” said George Gerchow, the chief security officer and senior vice president of information technology at Sumo Logic, a software company. “Now, all of a sudden, I’m in a weird position where I’m having to protect myself.” Perhaps more alarming to boardrooms is that SolarWinds did disclose some cybersecurity risks — in the same way that just about all public companies do. “You can track it across a hundred different companies, that they’re all basically using the exact same language,” said Josephine Wolff, an associate professor of cybersecurity policy at Tufts University. Now it seems the S.E.C. no longer considers those boilerplate disclosures to be sufficient if the company knows of more specific risks. The lawsuit is the first in which the S.E.C. has charged a company with intentional fraud related to cybersecurity disclosures, according to the law firm White & Case. In his first interview since the S.E.C. complaint, the C.E.O. of SolarWinds, Sudhakar Ramakrishna, told DealBook that the company hadn’t known about the issue that exposed it to the cyberattack in 2020, and that the lawsuit was “an attempt, we believe, by the S.E.C. to advance policy.” The lawsuit could “actually make CISOs more fearful, not more emboldened to raise their voice,” he said. Most experts agree that, regardless of the lawsuit’s outcome, it could affect how companies handle cybersecurity risks. But they’re divided over whether it will encourage better or worse practices. The lawsuit is not the only sign the S.E.C. is paying attention to cybersecurity. In July, the agency adopted new cybersecurity disclosure requirements set to take effect in December. They require companies to report material attacks within four days and to make yearly disclosures about their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance. In a June speech, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, said it had “zero tolerance for gamesmanship” around cybersecurity disclosures. Some experts worry that the lawsuit could have a chilling effect. “There were some serious warning signs that he and his team had surfaced,” Wolff said of the SolarWinds CISO. “And now that’s being used against him specifically to say, ‘You knew about this, you didn’t disclose it in the S.E.C. filings.’ Which I think really does create an incentive to never document or never find any vulnerabilities anywhere.” That could make it difficult for the I.T. department to ask for money for cybersecurity, she said. Ramakrishna, the SolarWinds C.E.O., said that being expected to disclose every potential security vulnerability could make it easier for attackers to abuse them. “For one, it’ll be too many for the average investor to understand,” he said. “For another, I think we’ll be playing into the hands of the threat.” Others argue that the threat of S.E.C. action could empower executives in charge of cybersecurity. Jake Williams, a security expert who consults with companies when they’ve experienced a data breach, said he regularly saw CISOs being asked to “paint a rosy or maybe rosier-than-aligned-with-reality picture.” But he added: “That practice, I think, died the day the SolarWinds lawsuit was filed by the agency. No CISO can now risk basically painting an unrealistically positive picture of cybersecurity.” Harley Geiger is a lawyer who specializes in cybersecurity at the law firm Venable and is part of the team representing a coalition of tech companies including Cisco, Broadcom, Microsoft and Google. He said there were ways for CISOs to react to increased personal risk other than avoiding documentation of concerns and recommendations, including by erring on the side of escalating risks and vulnerabilities. “They may want to be covered by a company’s insurance policy. They may want indemnification in their employment contracts,” Geiger said. “I think it would be the wrong message for or the wrong takeaway for CISOs to choose to ignore or not escalate material cybersecurity information.” If generic disclosures aren’t enough, what is? Being too specific about vulnerabilities could give attackers valuable information, while being too broad isn’t valuable to investors. “The question,” Wolff said, “is can the S.E.C. define a clear middle ground.” — Sarah Kessler IN CASE YOU MISSED IT An inflation surprise ignites a market rally. The Consumer Price Index report released on Tuesday showed that inflation cooled last month more than analysts had expected, helped by a fall in energy prices. Investors cheered the news as a bevy of Wall Street economists concluded that the Federal Reserve was most likely done with raising interest rates. Another Republican drops out of the presidential race. Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, suspended his campaign this week. He and the rest of the Republican field have trailed Donald Trump by double-digit margins for months. Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor, had a better week. She appeared to be close to winning over big conservative donors, including Ken Griffin of Citadel. Trump’s social media platform is struggling. Trump Media & Technology Group, the firm that runs Truth Social, has racked up big losses and may not survive without new funding, a regulatory filing this week disclosed. Truth Social has been pinning its future on a long-delayed merger with a shell company meant to take it public, giving it access to roughly $300 million in funding. Image Image Fei-Fei Li’s new book tells the story of the growth of artificial intelligence and her ascent in the field as an immigrant from China. Credit... via Fei-Fei Li An A.I. pioneer on her life and science When Fei-Fei Li, co-director of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, showed the first draft of her book project to one of her colleagues, he told her to throw it away. “He said that there’s a lot of scientists who can write about the ideas of technology,” Li told DealBook. But the colleague added that “my unique personal journey, as an immigrant, as a woman, as someone whose coming-of-age as a scientist is so intertwined with the coming-of-age of modern A.I., would give even those who are not traditionally in the world of tech a voice to identify with.” Li persevered, and the book, “The Worlds I See: Curiosity, Exploration, and Discovery at the Dawn of AI,” was published this month, telling the story of the growth of A.I. and her own story as an immigrant from China who became one of the world’s leading experts in the field. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. What should a business leader take away from your book? There’s so much debate and confusion and, frankly, anxiety around A.I. Part of the anxiety comes from not knowing what it is. Part of it comes from not knowing what it’s going to do. I hope this book sort of dispels both. Tools are made by humans, designed by humans, used by humans. We have responsibilities as well as agency. You write about the complex consequences of commercial investment in A.I. Can you tell me more about that? At the beginning of my career, it was just pure scientific inquiry, curiosity. Nobody was paying attention. As A.I. became more powerful, as more resources from the industry poured into it, as its social impact was surfacing — it is a natural course of a profound technological change that it brings complexity. Our ecosystem of innovation in America is hopefully driven by a combination of private sector, public sector and government. Right now, we have an imbalance. I’m hoping the public sector can still be a trusted source of evaluating and assessing and understanding and explaining this technology, but also be at the forefront of scientific discovery for the public good. What risks are you most focused on? I personally focus on societal risks, from disinformation to bias and privacy, infringement to job disruption, to weaponization. I do think there is responsibility, especially for the media, as well as the government, to engage in this discourse responsibly. I’m concerned when the media is biasing their megaphones to very few voices that are much more hyperbolic, focusing on existential crises, rather than the real social risks that will deeply impact everyday people, especially people from underserved communities. Is the government doing enough? President Biden’s executive order was a good first step because it’s broad and relatively balanced. But that truly is a first step. What is really important is to have the humility, especially for policymakers and business leaders, to recognize that this is new. So learn about what this is before making policy. DealBook readers respond: Sam Bankman-Fried As crypto crime watchers know, Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty on Nov. 2 for his role in the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange. The big question remaining: How long of a prison term will the 31-year-old get? The maximum term is more than 100 years. Last Saturday, we asked DealBook readers what would be a fair sentence. Many respondents shared their view that the judge should not go easy on Bankman-Fried at the sentencing hearing, scheduled for March. Here’s a selection of what readers had to say about Bankman-Fried, the American justice system and the wider cryptocurrency market: “Perhaps because I am a former prosecutor, I believe white-collar criminals should be sentenced on a par with violent ones, or perhaps more severely because the societal impacts are generally broader and the mitigating factors (socioeconomic status, etc.) are less compelling.” — Ted Baker “What about the crypto investors who got fleeced; how does locking him up help them? Retributive justice and rehabilitation don’t speak in any way to making the investors as whole as possible.” — Thomas Haible “I think a factor is that crypto is primarily a fixation of gamblers. Call them traders. Call them investors. But they’re not. They’re bettors.” — Barry Morse Image Thanks for reading! We’ll see you Monday. We’d like your feedback.

The Importance of Increased Visibility in the Cloud-First Era Dave Stuart of Laminar Security, a Rubrik Company, shines a light on the importance of increased visibility in the cloud-first era. Put simply: you cannot protect or manage data that you don’t know exists. And staying in the dark about that data isn’t an option—not when regulations are tightening on what feels like a daily basis, and the costs of a data breach continue to soar. Like termites or black mold, data blind spots can wreck your operations from the inside before you’ve even become aware of the problem. Read on for more.

    "title": "K-12 Cybersecurity Report: Declining Postures and Top Threats",
    "originLink": "https://www.govtech.com/security/new-report-examines-pressing-k-12-cybersecurity-concerns",
    "originBody": "Schools faced off against ransomware, banking Trojans, cryptominers and other threats, while citing limited cyber funding. This year, more schools struggled with threat detection and incident response management. November 17, 2023 • Jule Pattison-Gordon Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Print Email Shutterstock A new report out Monday found K-12 organizations’ cyber postures slipping slightly over the prior year as they grapple with stubborn cybersecurity challenges and threats ranging from banking Trojans to ransomware. Cybersecurity funding remains a top concern for the sector, but federal officials are turning attention to the issue and various organizations offer low-cost and free cyber tools. On Nov. 13, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a pilot program that would provide funding supporting cybersecurity and advanced firewall services at schools and libraries. Plus, K-12 Dive notes, state planning committees could use funds from the ongoing State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program to help school districts in adopting cyber best practices. Meanwhile, organizations like the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) offer some free tools and resources, while the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's (CISA) Known Exploited Vulnerability list can be a helpful way to prioritize, advises the new Center for Internet Security (CIS) MS-ISAC K-12 Cybersecurity Report. STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES In 2022, 402 K-12 organizations participated in the Nationwide Cybersecurity Review (NCSR). They listed a familiar set of security concerns. Alongside funding shortcomings, those included cyber threats’ rising sophistication, insufficient availability of cyber professionals and lack of documented processes or cyber strategies. The NCSR scores organizations’ cyber maturity to help them assess strengths and gaps. In 2022, K-12 participants averaged a score of 3.25 out of a possible high score of 7. That’s a touch below 2021’s average score of 3.55 — although still “satisfactory,” the report said. Improving means K-12 must shore up areas like supply chain risk management. Plus, more K-12 organizations should adopt protective measures like collecting audit logs, maintaining data classification schemes and defending against some malware by disabling the autoplay feature on removable media. Those were also areas of weakness in 2021, but new issues emerged in 2022, too: lack of maturity around “information protection processes and procedures” and around “detection processes.” The report advised organizations ensure they’re conducting automated vulnerability scans of externally exposed enterprise assets, and that they’re taking incident response management steps like establishing and regularly exercising incident response processes. On the plus side, K-12 organizations showed new maturity around maintaining and repairing industrial control and information system components. They also continued a strong showing on identity management and access control, and cybersecurity awareness and training, per the report. During a CIS webinar Monday, Texas Education Agency Deputy CISO Todd Pauley said training goes a long way, because hackers often take advantage of social engineering and human mistakes. ”We [in K-12] are doing a wonderful job on training,” Pauley said. “If you look at any kind of statistics as far as initial access into a ransomware event or malicious event, it‘s 93 percent user-initiated — whether through phishing or a misconfiguration … on the flip side of that, it’s the people who catch those; they point those out.” Improving the security culture of an organization can require persistence and patience, said Brian Paulhamus, information security officer at Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit, a regional education service agency in Pennsylvania. Paulhamus managed to get cybersecurity to become a regular part of new employee orientation and monthly supervisor trainings — but not quickly. “Be patient,” Paulhamus advised during the webinar. “I'm talking a five-year-plus process to get to where we now have this embedded in the organization. Small wins are important just as much as the big ones are, because it can take literally years to see the fruits of your effort fulfilled in that way.” As K-12 organizations look to advance their cyber journeys, Indiana Department of Education Director of Educational Technology Brad Hagg recommended taking the free NCSR, both to better inform entities about where they stand and provide the sector with information to help advocate for supports. “[The NCSR] contributes to these incredible statistics that help inform our lobbying and legislative efforts to increase funding and availability of services to support the educational process,” Hagg said during the webinar. “… Giving those policymakers and people around the world as much data as possible, while improving your own posture, just to me seems like a great way to start no matter where you're at.” TOP THREATS The CIS MS-ISAC report identified top threats facing K-12 entities in the 2022-2023 school year, based on data from 4,600 K-12 MS-ISAC members, as well as findings from CIS’ security operations center and cyber threat intelligence team. Alongside ransomware, certain families of banking Trojans and a cryptocurrency miner were frequent threats. K-12 organizations also suffered from attackers using legitimate remote access tools to conduct activities while better evading detection, and Magecart card skimming was another common threat. Perpetrators using malware often gained initial access to K-12 entities by sending malspam, or emails containing malicious links or downloads — a method employed 43 percent of the time. Meanwhile, 14 percent of the time, hackers infected systems by dropping malware. All other times, the hackers used multiple methods. CoinMiner comprised 20 percent of malware affecting K-12 entities from August 2022 to May 2023. It’s a type of cryptominer, which hides in the background and uses victims’ devices to mine cryptocurrency. The malware family was also a common threat between August 2021 and May 2022, per last year’s report. Banking Trojans, meanwhile, aim to steal online banking customers’ credential and financial information. Tiny Banker — also called Tinba — captures victims’ information off login pages and web forms and comprised 11 percent of malware affecting K-12 organizations this past school year. Tinba often spreads through exploit kits. Per CrowdStrike, attackers using exploit kits typically find a compromised website and make it redirect traffic to a malicious landing page that scans visitors’ devices for vulnerable browser applications. If any are found, the kit exploits them and spreads and executes malware, infecting the victim’s host environment with malicious code. Qakbot, was the most reported threat, comprising 23 percent of all malware impacting K-12. This banking Trojan intercepts authentication tokens during active banking sessions, per the report. The danger doesn’t end there, with Qakbot operators often getting what they want from victims then selling access to other threat actors, who may then introduce their own malware — including ransomware. Qakbot often spread through malspam, including thread hijacking, in which attackers strive to appear more legitimate by sending their malspam within existing email conversation threads. Schools may be able to breathe easy on this particular threat, however: In August 2023, the FBI and international partners announced they’d dismantled Qakbot’s infrastructure. Another bright spot: Shlayer is no longer the significant threat it was in last year’s report. In April 2021, Apple issued a fix for a zero-day exploit Shlayer had been abusing in macOS, per TechCrunch and BleepingComputer.

    "originBody": "Home Technology Technology Cyber Security Ranks as Top Risk for Enterprises in 2024 Organizational risks keep accelerating and evolving, becoming more complex and interconnected than ever — but risk and assurance teams’ capacity to manage risk are not keeping pace. Nov. 17, 2023 Facebook Twitter Linked In Pinterest Print AuditBoard, the leading cloud-based platform transforming audit, risk, IT compliance, and ESG management, has released its 2024 Focus on the Future report based on an annual survey of risk management and internal audit leaders across North America. The report reveals a growing gap between risk and assurance teams’ capacity to effectively manage risks and the reality of today’s state of “permacrisis,” an extended period of instability and insecurity marked by one disruptive crisis following another. In a continuation of a trend identified by the 2023 Focus on the Future survey, the top 2024 risk cited by internal audit leaders is cyber and data security, with more than 80% of respondents not only rating this risk highly but also giving it the top spot for expected audit efforts in 2024. However, the survey also found risk and internal audit teams are still dedicating fewer resources to addressing some key risks, including two top-ranked risk areas — changing economic conditions (ranked #2), and the ability to attract and retain talent (ranked #3) — that received insufficient audit focus in 2023. This misalignment is expected to continue in 2024. Other key findings of the report include: Some internal audit leaders are delaying critical technology investments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and automation: 75% have yet to implement generative AI in internal audit, only 40% have a clear understanding of how AI is used in their organizations, and as few as 25% have defined the risks of or created guidelines for the use of AI. While previously seen as urgent, ESG risks are now ranked 13th out of 14. This decreasing sense of immediate concern may put auditors in a precarious position if they fail to adequately address increasing ESG risks and anticipated regulatory activities. Internal audit leaders are optimistic about receiving more resources in 2024, with over 60% of respondents forecasting increased internal audit budgets, and 31% planning for larger staff. The survey also reveals the use of internal audit strategic plans is lagging, with only one in five functions reporting comprehensive, well-documented strategic plans. Without a strategic view of the future, including a clear assessment of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats, priorities, and areas of vulnerability, internal audit may struggle to recognize the necessary actions to ensure organizational success. “The 2024 Focus on the Future report sounds a clear call to action for organizations confronted with the widening risk exposure gap,” said Richard F. Chambers, AuditBoard Senior Internal Audit Advisor, who authored the report. “Internal audit, with its capacity for foresight and understanding, is uniquely positioned to help organizations navigate these challenges. However, to do so effectively, internal audit leaders must embrace transformational opportunities — prioritizing strategic planning, AI technology adoption and governance, cross-functional collaboration, and high-impact communications.” To produce the 2024 Focus on the Future report, AuditBoard collected data from 453 respondents to an online survey conducted in August and September 2023. Respondents were risk leaders, chief audit executives, and internal audit directors in organizations based primarily in North America, representing a diverse group of industries and company sizes.

    "originBody": "Corvus ESS Receives Cyber Security Type Approval Corvus Energy improves safety and increases the value of marine battery systems by using machine learning and data analytics. Published Nov 17, 2023 12:00 PM by The Maritime Executive [By: Corvus Energy] Corvus Energy, the leading provider of Battery Energy Storage Solutions and Fuel Cell Systems for the marine sector, is thrilled to announce that they have been awarded Type Approval from DNV (Det Norske Veritas) for their Cyber Security Notation on the Control and Monitoring system of their Orca Energy Storage System (ESS). The Type Approval certificate signifies that Corvus Energy's control and monitoring system, along with its data collection through Lighthouse, has successfully met all the stringent safety, quality, and performance requirements related to cyber security, as outlined in DNV rules for classification – Ships Pt.6 Ch.5 Sec.21 Cyber Security, aligned with IACS UR E27. This achievement demonstrates Corvus Energy's commitment to ensuring the utmost security and protection for their energy storage systems and the data they handle. Data collection and machine learning are key. Over the last few years, Corvus Energy has transformed its approach to monitoring and data analytics. Collecting data from hundreds of system installations and establishing the Corvus Vessel Information Portal has improved the company's ability to monitor and analyze system performance. This also enables remote monitoring, saving both time and costs for the shipowner. Gathered data are also used to support future product development, determine accurate system sizing, optimize second life and recycling, as well as create new and improved services. Kolbjørn Berge, Senior Vice President of Regulatory Affairs at Corvus Energy underscores the significance of achieving the DNV Type Approval for Cyber Security. He states, \"Data collection and machine learning are key to gaining in-depth operational knowledge and real-time diagnostics of the battery system. Constant monitoring enables us to see that the system is used correctly, and it increases safety significantly as we can detect abnormal values at an early stage and take action before they become critical.” Today Corvus Energy already has more than 100 terabytes of data in the cloud and anticipates this will contribute to new potential business models. Ahead of schedule Corvus Energy has achieved this milestone well ahead of the deadline set by the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS) for making cybersecurity rules mandatory for new builds contracted after July 1, 2024. Looking ahead, Corvus Energy is actively commencing the Type Approvals process to attain Cyber Security Type Approvals for its full product range with DNV, as well as with other Marine Class Societies. The products and services herein described in this press release are not endorsed by The Maritime Executive.",
