CrackDowns FBI IPStorm Infrastructure The FBI has achieved a remarkable feat in the fight against cybercrime, dismantling the infamous IPStorm botnet network that infected tens of thousands of devices across various platforms worldwide. The brains behind this criminal operation, Sergei Makinin, a dual citizen of Russia and Moldova, has confessed to three counts of violating cybersecurity laws. Authorities Took BulletProftLink A notorious phishing service that supplied cybercriminals with phishing kits, scam pages, and stolen credentials has been disrupted by a joint operation involving Malaysian, Australian, and U.S. authorities. BulletProftLink, also known as a phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) platform, had been operating for several years and had a large customer base that engaged in various forms of online fraud, posing a serious threat to both individuals and businesses. Cyber attacks Malware in Kids’ Tablet In the ever-expanding market of Android devices, the allure of budget-friendly options can sometimes conceal unforeseen risks. Purchasing Android devices from online platforms like Amazon offers varying price points but also exposes consumers to potential security hazards. For her birthday, Alexis Hancock’s daughter received a tablet designed specifically for children. Given her profession as a security researcher, Hancock’s initial reaction was one of concern over the potential security risks associated with the device. FBI Reveals Scattered Spider Hacker Group Tactics In recent months, the Scattered Spider hacking group (aka Starfraud, UNC3944, Scatter Swine, and Muddled Libra) has made news for allegedly attacking the following casino giants:- MGM Resorts Caesars Entertainment The FBI and CISA recently issued a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) on Scattered Spider threat actors targeting commercial facilities. LogShield APT Detection Framework There have been several cases of GPT model-based detection for various attacks from system logs. However, there has been no dedicated framework for detecting APTs as they use a low and slow approach to compromise the systems. Security researchers have recently unveiled a cutting-edge framework known as LogShield. This innovative tool leverages the self-attention capabilities of transformers to identify attack patterns associated with Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). SystemBC SystemBC (aka Coroxy or DroxiDat) is a multifunctional malware known as Proxy, Bot, Backdoor, and RAT, adapting to attackers’ needs. Since 2018, this multifunctional malware has been active, and it remains popular in underground markets, with consistent annual incidents. Cybersecurity researcher REXor (aka Aaron) recently discovered that several ransomware groups are employing SystemBC, a Swiss Knife proxy malware, for their illicit purposes. Threats BiBi Wiper Malware Attacking Windows The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has taken a new turn as cyberattacks have become a prominent weapon for both sides. A new wiper malware, dubbed the BiBi-Linux Wiper, has been discovered by an Israeli security firm, targeting Linux systems and causing irreversible data loss. The malware is believed to be deployed by pro-Hamas hackers, who have also developed a Windows variant of the same malware. Stealc Malware Malware that secretly gathers private information from a victim’s computer is called an information stealer. They employ several techniques like Encryption, Polymorphic code, and Evasive behaviors to keep their stealth active. Cybersecurity researcher Aziz Farghly recently discovered an infostealer, “Stealc.” Plymouth has promoted Stealc, a new non-resident stealer, on Russian forums since January 9, 2023, offering it as Malware-as-a-Service. Stealc, with adjustable data settings, evolves alongside other top stealers. ChatGPT for Malware Analysis GPT excels in verbal thinking, skillfully choosing precise words for optimal responses. Understanding this key property is crucial, as much of its subsequent behavior stems from this ability. This AI model taps into an extensive cheat sheet; any historical answer in its training data can be reproduced with strange accuracy. Cybersecurity researchers at CheckPoint recently affirmed that security analysts could use ChatGPT for malware analysis by enhancing the GPT’s ability. Google Forms Abused To Evade Spam Filters Cybersecurity researchers at Talos have discovered that spammers are taking advantage of Google Forms quizzes to disseminate various types of online scams to unsuspecting victims. Since Google’s servers are where the emails are coming from, it could be simpler for them to get past anti-spam filters and reach the recipient’s mailbox. Ransomware Gang Files An SEC Complaint Alphv Ransomware gang filed an SEC complaint against MeridianLink for not disclosing a data breach. BlackCat, also known as ALPHV, BlackCat operates on the ransomware as a service (RaaS) model, with developers offering the malware for use by affiliates and taking a percentage of ransom payments. The ransomware relies essentially on stolen credentials obtained through initial access brokers for initial access. The group operates a public data leak site to pressure victims to pay ransom demands. Dark Web Forum Operator Jailed In a momentous development in cybersecurity, Thomas Kennedy McCormick, alias “fubar,” a resident of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for masterminding a racketeering conspiracy within the infamous Darkode hacking forum. The intricate web of cybercrime unraveled in the courtroom, revealing McCormick’s pivotal role in the development and dissemination of malicious software, resulting in substantial financial losses. Vulnerability 6Lakh WordPress Sites Open to Attacks In a recent development, the WPScan team has unearthed a significant security flaw within the widely-used WP Fastest Cache plugin. This vulnerability, categorized as an unauthenticated SQL injection, could potentially grant unauthorized access to sensitive data in the WordPress database. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2023-6063, affects versions of WP Fastest Cache lower than 1.2.2. Zero-day Vulnerabilities Patched Microsoft has released their security patches as part of their Patch Tuesday for November 2023. Microsoft has patched nearly 58 flaws, including 5 zero-day vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were associated with Privilege Escalation (16), Remote code execution (15), Spoofing (11), Security Feature Bypass (6), Information Disclosure (6), and Denial of Service (5). Microsoft also republished 15 non-Microsoft CVEs, which existent on Microsoft Bluetooth Driver and Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) as mentioned in their release notes of November 2023. CacheWarp CacheWarp is a new software-based fault attack that allows attackers to gain access to encrypted virtual machines (VMs) and escalate privileges on AMD’s Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP) technologies. The underlying vulnerability tracked as CVE-2023-20592 with Medium severity was uncovered by researchers from the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security in Germany, the Graz University of Technology in Austria, and independent researcher Youheng Lu discovered CacheWarp. FortiSIEM Injection Flaw OS command injection is a security vulnerability where an attacker exploits improper user input validation to inject malicious commands into an operating system. This can lead to:- Unauthorized access Data breaches System compromise FortiSIEM is a security information and event management (SIEM) solution developed by Fortinet. It provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications, helping organizations detect and respond to security threats efficiently. Intel Sued Over The ‘Downfall’ CPU Vulnerability A class-action lawsuit had been filed against Intel due to a critical “Downfall” vulnerability in Intel CPUs, a defect that Intel was aware of since 2018 but neglected to report. According to Intel, the only way to “fix” it is to apply a patch that reduces CPU performance by up to 50% when performing some common computing tasks, such as encryption, gaming, and photo and video editing. The plaintiffs are purchasers of Intel Central Processing Units (or “CPUs”). As a result, they are left with defective CPUs that are either extremely exposed to attacks or require drastic slowdowns. Exploits For Critical Flaws Sold on Dark Web Dark forums and Telegram channels have become great places for threat actors to sell critical vulnerabilities and exploits. These vulnerabilities and exploits were associated with the Elevation of Privilege, Authentication Bypass, SQL Injection, and Remote Code Execution in products like Windows, JetBrains software, Microsoft Streaming Service Proxy, and Ubuntu kernels. Recent discoveries state that these vulnerabilities were sold in underground forums even before the Vendor officially assigned them. Reptar A critical CPU vulnerability can pose a significant threat by allowing:- Unauthorized access to sensitive data Enabling malicious code execution Compromise the overall security of a system. System manipulation The escalating trend of vulnerabilities poses a threat to billions of personal and cloud computers. Google’s InfoSec team reported the flaw to Intel, who swiftly disclosed and mitigated the flaw with industry collaboration. ManageEngine Information Disclosure Flaw ManageEngine, one of the most widely used IT infrastructure management platforms that offers more than 60 Enterprise IT management tools, has been discovered with an Information Disclosure vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2023-6105. This vulnerability affects multiple ManageEngine products, including ADManager, ADSelfService, M365 Manager, Endpoint Central, Service Desk, Access Manager, and many others. The severity of this vulnerability has been given as 5.5 (Medium). Multiple Flaw with Zoom Clients The popular video messaging platform Zoom has discovered multiple vulnerabilities affecting Zoom Clients. These vulnerabilities might allow an unauthorized user to carry out denial-of-service, privilege escalation, and information disclosure attacks. To receive the most recent security updates and bug fixes, Zoom advises users to update to the most recent version of the Zoom software. Data Breach DP World Cyber Attack DP World Australia, a leading provider of landside freight operations, issued an update on Friday, November 10, regarding its efforts to address a cybersecurity incident that affected its systems. The company has collaborated with cybersecurity experts to restore its terminal operations securely and safely. McLaren Health Care Hacked In August of this year, McLaren Health Care suffered a cyber attack that resulted in the compromise of 2.2 million individual data records. The attackers claimed to have accessed approximately 6 terabytes of sensitive patient information, which is a significant breach of privacy and a serious concern for all those affected. Samsung Hacked Samsung Electronics (U.K.) Limited has announced a cybersecurity incident, corroborating the exposure of customer data that originated in July 2019. The disclosure comes as the tech behemoth contends with the repercussions of illicit access to personal information. Massive Cyber Attack On Critical Infrastructure In an alarming development, Denmark faced its most extensive cyber attack in May 2023, targeting crucial components of its energy infrastructure. A total of 22 companies fell victim to a meticulously coordinated attack, breaching their industrial control systems and prompting some to activate island mode operation. This cyber onslaught marks an unprecedented scale of attack on Danish critical infrastructure, signaling a new level of threat. Version Releases New Metasploit Exploit Modules Released Metasploit is an open-source penetration testing framework created by Rapid7 that enables security professionals to simulate attacks against computer systems, networks, and applications. It includes several tools and modules that can be used to test the target system’s security, detect vulnerabilities, and use them to gain access to the system. Two recent noteworthy vulnerabilities that have gained a lot of attention are CVE-2023-20198, which affects the Cisco IOS XE OS, and CVE-2023-46604, which affects Apache MQ and can lead to the deployment of ransomware. Weaponized LNK Files LNK files are shortcut files in Windows that link to a program or file. Hackers may exploit LNK files to deliver malicious payloads by disguising them as legitimate shortcuts, taking advantage of users who unknowingly click on them, and allowing for the execution of malicious code. Over the years, malware distribution methods have evolved and become more sophisticated in the realm of cyber threats. Recent data analysis reveals that cybercriminals no longer rely solely on Microsoft Office document files to distribute malware. Wireshark 4.2.0 Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer that is primarily used by security experts and network administrators for several purposes:- Troubleshooting Analysis Development Education Recently, Wireshark Foundation launched version 4.2.0, introducing new updates and features. Google Chrome Use-After-Free Vulnerability Google Chrome Stable Channel Update for Desktop version 119.0.6.45.159 for Mac and Linux and 119.0.6045.159/.160 for Windows has been released, which will be rolling out to all users soon. There were two vulnerabilities fixed, which were CVE-2023-5997 and CVE-2023-6112. Both of these vulnerabilities were associated with Use-after-free conditions in Garbage Collection and the Navigation of Google Chrome. The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) has yet to confirm the severity of these vulnerabilities.

Subscribe Today » FILE - Anne Neuberger, Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology, speaks during a news briefing at the White House, Monday, March 21, 2022, in Washington. Since a White House conference in August on ransomware threats, dozens of school districts have signed up for free cybersecurity services, and federal officials have hosted exercises with schools to help them learn how to better secure their networks, said Neuberger. Patrick Semansky - staff, ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Email Print Copy article link WASHINGTON (AP) — Some K-12 public schools are racing to improve protection against the threat of online attacks, but lax cybersecurity means thousands of others are vulnerable to ransomware gangs that can steal confidential data and disrupt operations. Since a White House conference in August on ransomware threats, dozens of school districts have signed up for free cybersecurity services, and federal officials have hosted exercises with schools to help them learn how to better secure their networks, said Anne Neuberger, the Biden's administration's deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology. Neuberger said more districts need to take advantage of programs available that would better guard against online attackers who are increasingly targeting schools. Their aim is to lock up computer systems, and in some cases, steal and publish sensitive personal information if a ransom is not paid. “Compromises happens again and again, often in the same way, and there are defenses to protect against it. And here the government has really brought companies together, brought agencies together to deploy some of those,\" Neuberger said in an interview. “Don’t give up. Reach out and sign up. And your kids will be a lot safer online.\" The administration announced steps over the summer to help cash-strapped schools, which have been slow to build up cybersecurity defenses. Ransomware attackers, many of whom are based in Russia, have not only forced schools to temporarily close but have exposed a wealth of students' private information. Last month, parents sued the Clark County School District in Nevada, alleging a ransomware attack led to the release of highly sensitive information about teachers, students and their families in the country's fifth largest school district. In another high-profile case this year, hackers broke into the Minneapolis Public Schools system and dumped sexual assault case records and other sensitive files online after the district refused to pay a $1 million ransom. More than 9,000 small public school districts across the United States with up to 2,500 students — that's roughly 70 percent of public districts in the country — are now eligible for free cybersecurity services from web security company Cloudflare through a new program called Project Cybersafe Schools, Neuberger said. Since August, roughly 140 districts in 32 states have signed up for the program, which provides free email security and other online threat protection, she said. James Hatz, technology coordinator for Rush City Public Schools in Minnesota, said the program arrived just in time for their district, quickly stopping 100 suspicious emails from getting to staff. Hatz said cybercriminals often try to get teachers to click on malicious links by pretending to be an administrator sharing documents about things such as pay raises. “We are not going to be bulletproof, but the more we can do to make it harder, the better between user training, this program and everything else,” Hatz said. Neuberger also said a $20 million grant program from Amazon Web Services that is designed to help schools improve their cybersecurity has received about 130 applications. The Federal Communications Commission has also proposed a pilot program that would make up to $200 million available over three years to strengthen cyber defense in schools and libraries. Neuberger said the hope is that money will be available to schools in the “near future.” But Doug Levin, director of the K12 Security Information eXchange, a Virginia-based nonprofit that helps schools defend against cybersecurity risk, said he fears attacks against schools are going to continue to grow both in frequency and severity without more federal support and requirements that schools have baseline cybersecurity controls. “Most have underfunded their IT functions. They do not have cybersecurity experts on staff. And they’re increasingly being viewed as as a soft target by cyber criminals,\" Levin said. “So, ultimately I think the federal government is going to need to do more.” NEWSLETTER First Read: The Latest News The latest news from across Lancaster County, delivered first thing every morning.

    "originBody": "Intelligence Delivering Safe Cyber Environment Through Indonesia National Cyber Risk Management Approach Strategically, any country who have digital activities must create and implement the cyber resiliency framework. BY MATHEACE RAMAPUTRA NOVEMBER 19, 2023 Photo by Tima Miroshnichenko on Unsplash SHARE Indonesia has started their strategic initiatives by discussing the Draft Bill of Cyber Security Act. However, the government and the parliament have yet to agree on several contents of the bill. On the other hand, the urgency of having a strategic and comprehensive cybersecurity approach has never been as important as today. We have seen several cyber attacks on the government’s official website, raising concern about how we trust the country’s cyber safety situation. National Cyber and Cryptography Board/Badan Siber dan Sandi Negara (BSSN) recorded over 370, 022, 283 cyber attacks in 2022, which increased from 266, 741, 784 in 2021. The strategic policies on procuring a safe cyber environment must be needed to tackle any severe impacts caused by these malicious cyber penetrations, but with the absence of cyber security law as our guidance, how should we mitigate any risk associated with the cyber realm? Current Approach The Government has enacted several regulations that address cyber security. For example, Law Number 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transaction accommodates cyber protection by imposing obligations to the electronic system providers. Protecting the confidentiality, availability, authenticity, and accessibility of electronic information is part of the electronic system providers’ obligations to procure a safe and sound cyber environment within their system. Furthermore, the government, through BSSN, has enacted the BSSN Regulation Number 8 of 2020 on the Electronic Security System. This regulation emphasizes that all electronic system providers must conduct a self-assessment to determine which risk classification that their system would fall. The result must be reported to BSSN and they must comply with cyber security obligations according to their category. If they fall into the high-risk category, they must obtain the specific SNI ISO.IEC 27001 and other applied standards determined by sectoral ministries. This approach introduces the risk-based approach to ensure that cyber management should be administered properly through a risk management approach. Indonesia has enacted Presidential Regulation Number 82 of 2022 on the Vital Information Infrastructure which determines nine vital information infrastructure sectors. All electronic service providers must be managed by their relevant ministries for any cyber security obligations. Furthermore, the Government also issued Presidential Regulation Number 47 of 2023 on the Cyber Crisis Management and National Cyber Security Strategy. BSSN is given a mandate to conduct an action plan to execute the area focus of the national cyber security, including the risk management plan. The risk management plan focuses on the risk identification, the risk analysis, and mitigation action. The Risk Approach In Cyber Resiliency Strategically, any country who have digital activities must create and implement the cyber resiliency framework. This framework is made to ensure that the cyber environment is managed properly, from planning to the maintenance process. It also becomes a reference for the government to determine a set of policies that they would do. Risk management in cyber resiliency falls into the planning process. Risk management in this sector consists of a risk assessment system, governance, and cyber resiliency strategy. The assessment system is important to determine standardised risk assessment methodology and risk mapping, which the risk mapping result should be enforced through a set of policies and regulations stated in the cyber resiliency strategy. Cyber governance is influenced by risk mapping and mitigation plans that any types of supporting measures must be led by the government i.e. establishing cyber authority, imposing obligations, stipulating prohibition, managing cross-department digital processes such as integrated licensing or cyber incident report and rectification. Unfortunately, Indonesia have yet to establish this approach and many experts believe that strategic cyber resiliency by focusing on the risk management approach for critical sectors is needed. Cyber Security For Critical Sector The protection of cyber security in the critical sector is very important because any system compromised by cyber-attacks may deter the government’s public services and put a country in a dangerous position. To give a visual imagination, if we watch Die Hard 4 starring Bruce Willis, we can see that cyber attacks conducted by terrorists make water, electricity, and military security systems down, causing disruption, chaos, and turmoil in the economic and politics. The cyber process in critical sectors influences a country’s stability and specific protections and mitigation plans must be needed. In the United Kingdom, the critical sectors are managed through a risk management approach under the Network and Security Regulation 2018 and National Risk Assessment. These two policies undermine the specific National Cyber Security Centre, under the Government Communication Headquarters as the Single Point of Contact and Cyber Security Incident Report. In addition, the assessment will be the basis of a risk management strategy and mitigation plan that should be executed by all stakeholders, from ministries to related digital service providers. Ireland, as one of the leading country in cyber security, also implement national cyber risk management by applying continuing risk assessment by engaging with other government entities such as An Garda Siochana (the police institution), the National Security Analysis Centre di Department of the Taoiseach, Central Bank of Ireland, Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), dan Commission for Communications Regulations (Comreg). What We Need Now The execution of a risk-based approach for cyber security policies should embrace at least two points. First, the government must ensure that the process must be carried out by all stakeholders proportionally. It means that proper identification of stakeholders must sufficiently address the current ability of all players in the field, especially any providers who engage in any sector under the vital information infrastructure. If the provider is a start-up, the government, through BSSN and related ministries, must ensure any nurturing policies for them to gradually comply with policies. Regulatory sandboxing or incubator of start-ups might be an alternative solution in the procuring nurturing process. This enables the longevity of the start-ups while preserving cyber security interests. Second, we have to ensure that cross-coordination and execution of risk management that would be made by BSSN must align with relevant ministries’ risk management policies. This is a challenging process because we have seen a lot of ego sectoral within government in almost every sector. If we can find the right approach in making the coordination better, we already resolve half of our problem.

    "title": "The Essential Guide to Password Security: Dos and Don'ts for Stronger Protection",
    "originLink": "https://www.fluxmagazine.com/dos-donts-of-password-security/",
    "originBody": "words Al Woods In an era dominated by digital interactions and online activities, the importance of robust password security cannot be overstated. Passwords are the gatekeepers to people’s digital lives, protecting sensitive information from prying eyes and potential cyber threats. To fortify your online defenses, it’s essential to adhere to best practices and avoid common pitfalls. This guide will explore the dos and don’ts of password security to help you navigate the digital landscape securely. Do Use a Password Manager With password managers, you only need to remember one strong master password to gain access to all your other passwords. If you run a business, a business password manager can help streamline password management for your team, ensuring a consistent and secure approach across all accounts. Many password managers have built-in password generators that create complex and unique passwords for each of your accounts. This eliminates the need for you to design and remember numerous intricate passwords. Password managers are often compatible across various devices and platforms. This ensures that your passwords are accessible when needed, whether on your computer, smartphone, or tablet. Do Create Strong and Unique Passwords Aim for passwords at least 12 characters long. The longer and more complex your password, the more resistant it is to hacking attempts. Steer clear of using easily accessible information such as your name, birthdate, or common words. Opt for combinations that are not readily associated with you. Resist the temptation to use the same password across multiple accounts. Creating unique passwords for each platform prevents a security breach on one account from compromising others. Periodically updating your passwords adds an extra layer of security. Consider updating your passwords at least every six months and more frequently for sensitive accounts such as online banking or email. Don’t Share Your Passwords Legitimate entities will never ask for your password via email or other non-secure communication methods. Avoid writing your passwords on sticky notes or in easily accessible digital documents. Someone who gains access to your physical space or devices could quickly compromise your accounts. Create unique passwords for each platform or service. Refrain from using passwords like “password,” “123456,” or common words found in dictionaries. These are the first combinations attackers try in brute-force attacks. Don’t Ignore Security Alerts If you receive alerts or notifications about suspicious activity or unauthorized login attempts, don’t ignore them. Investigate and take appropriate action, such as changing your password or enabling additional security measures. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, messages, or websites that prompt you to provide login credentials or personal details. Verify the sender’s authenticity before clicking on any links or providing information. Instead of relying solely on text messages for verification codes, consider using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy. These apps generate time-sensitive codes, adding an extra layer of security compared to traditional SMS-based 2FA. Password security is a fundamental aspect of safeguarding your digital identity. By following these dos and don’ts, you can significantly enhance the strength of your passwords and reduce the risk of falling victim to cyber threats. Remember to create strong, unique passwords, utilize password managers, and enable additional security measures like two-factor authentication. Stay vigilant, update your passwords, and adopt a proactive approach to online security. With these practices in place, you’ll be better equipped to navigate the digital landscape securely and protect your valuable personal information.",

But the fallout from its former CEO's remarks isn’t over. Two Israeli startups, Lasso Security and Ask-AI, are rejecting the investments of the tech conference’s venture arm after former Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave referred to Israel’s retaliatory strikes on Gaza as “war crimes.” Startups rarely attempt to return investments after the money is wired, underscoring how the conflict is dividing companies and institutions and their backers.",

    "originLink": "https://newsday.co.tt/2023/11/18/cyber-securitys-place-on-government-agenda/",
    "originBody": "Editorial Cyber security’s place on government agenda Newsday 10 Hrs Ago - In the 2024-2024 budget, Finance Minister Colm Imbert included a tax rebate for businesses spending up to $500,000 on cyber security measures. That may turn out to be far from enough to meet a threat that is becoming increasingly pervasive. The extent of the revelations of data breaches in the last two weeks alone – including one attack that affected TTPost that the Public Utilities Minister referred to in an offhand comment – is more than enough to give ordinary citizens pause. But has it been enough to move the government to more decisive action? The country doesn’t need a hasty proclamation of the clauses of the Data Protection Act that have not been assented to. The response to that legislation by media houses in 2017 was justified by the chilling effect it would have brought to the practice of journalism, for which an exemption clause is needed, as included in comparable acts overseas. The Data Protection Act (DPA) as presented in 2017 would have made detailed investigation and confirmation of the TSTT breach a crime for working journalists. But it’s been more than five years since those concerns were raised, and an acceptable suite of amendments hasn’t been presented to fourth-estate stakeholders. The government brought an amendment to two proclaimed clauses of the DPA in 2021 to make it legal for the state to process personal data without contravening the 2017 law. Amendments to the act were most recently presented in the Senate in March as the final proclamation moves to presidential assent. The Opposition has called for a national cyber security centre, but the elements of such a project are already present in the legislation or in practice in various forms. What’s needed is the will to bring legislation before Parliament that would empower agencies such as the TT Cyber security Incident Response Team to do more than offer advice and warnings to affected companies and state agencies, both of which have largely been ignored. That’s a bit surprising, given the profile that ransomware has assumed in the public record for more than two years now. On November 7, the Digital Transformation Minister announced that he would do a full audit of the cyber security measures in place at other government utilities. He has also acknowledged that the government’s cyber security profile is uneven; it’s unclear, however, whether he has the authority to change any of that. What is needed, in any case, is not a Digital Transformation Minister adding to a considerable and largely unfulfilled portfolio, but the real-world appointment of an Information Commissioner (the post exists, but has no appointee) with a team capable of proactively protecting the individual right to privacy and steering effective compliance with the Data Protection Act.",
