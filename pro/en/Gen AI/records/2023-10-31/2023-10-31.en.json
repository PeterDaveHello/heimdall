There are too many for me to name on this call, but a few examples include… in our stores business, we're using generative AI to help people better discover products they want and more easily access the information needed to make decisions. We use generative AI models to forecast inventory we need in our various locations and to derive optimal last mile transportation routes for drivers to employ. We're also making it much easier for our third-party sellers to create new product pages by entering much less information and letting the models do the rest.” Amazon has put the power of generative AI tech development into the hands of companies, giving the marketplace enterprise a unique view to IT investment trends and the future of AI. Leadership recently shared its take on gen AI growth during a recent call with investors. The company’s generative AI business model is growing “very, very quickly,” according to CFO, Brian Olsavsky, but it’s the insights garnered from companies that are tapping into the AWS-powered gen AI builder that’s the real indicator of use case expansion among CPGs and retailers. Adidas and Traeger Grills, for example, are two companies leaning into natural language processing abilities and visualization capabilities, leveraging the app builder to tailor gen AI functions to their specific enterprise needs. What do these investments say about overarching AI trends? While the industry is seeing a surge in adoption, Olsavsky emphasizes that we’re still in the “relatively early stages,” much like with cloud computing and storage. “I think cloud is early,” he said. “If you think about 90%-plus of the global IT spend being on-premises…I think that equation is going to flip in 10 years. With that lens on, I still think we're very early in generative AI.” The tech is largely in a test-and-learn phase, and Olsavsky said many companies are figuring out that large AI models end up being cost prohibitive, and delays due to data pool size can impact efficiency as well. “Customers are experimenting with lots of different types of models and different model sizes to get the cost and latency characteristics that they need for different use cases,” he said. [Read more: HanesBrands Leveraging Gen AI in Supply Chain Optimization Efforts] CEO Andy Jassy is seeing much of the same, with complications emerging as companies seek to use AI ethically and safely, and with learning curves ranging widely across organizations. “It’s still it's complicated to actually figure out which models you want to work, you want to use, and how you actually want to employ them — and trying to make sure you have the right results…and you end up with a cost structure and a customer experience that you want,” said Jassy. “There's a certain number of customers who have very deep AI expert practitioners, but most companies don't.” As a result of these wide gaps in knowledge, and a hesitation to go big on gen AI without having a firm grasp of what the ROI could be, 2024 investments in the space will likely focus on optimization of existing efforts, rather than overhauls. Jassy said a lot of optimization happened in 2023, but got stalled because companies were being more conservative with their spending amid the volatile economic climate. “And so, I think that what you'll see increasingly is that companies will both go back to those transformations they were planning on making, and working with a lot of systems integrator partners…to see the production in large scale of the generative AI applications that they're all working on and prototyping and starting to deploy into production,” Jassy added. Growth in this space might seem explosive, but these efforts likely won’t take full shape over a “one-year deal,” he emphasized. “I think that's going to be a several-year trajectory,” said Jassy. “You're going to see a lot of companies not just looking at the new generative AI workloads,” but also new customer transformations where companies move from being on-premises to the cloud.

More on Gen AI Industry Impact In retail and consumer packaged goods, the potential impact is $400 billion to $660 billion a year. — McKinsey & Company “As we think about retail data becoming much more complex — and the need for better integration of data resources, and collaborating around first-party data — AI can improve a lot of ways that those programs come to market and also how they're built on the back end.” — Elizabeth Lafontaine, EIQ Chief Retail Analyst When it comes to strategizing on core tech spending, “probably 60% of the big [CPG] players are integrating technology, data, and, increasingly, science into their planning. Our assumption is that number will steadily rise.” This includes data and analytics, accelerated by generative AI, he says. — Oliver Wright, Global Lead for Consumer Goods at Accenture 60% of B2B seller work will be executed through conversational user interfaces via generative AI sales technologies within five years. (For some context: Less than 5% of this work was executed in similar fashion this year.) — Gartner More AI News Ulta, Amazon, Shoe Carnival, and More Upgrade Tech Capabilities: Automation, AI and AR, Robotics Retailers continue to invest heavily across their enterprises as they look to streamline efforts, upgrade tech stacks, and implement end-to-end solutions.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Go to the 9to5Google home page Switch site Toggle social menu Toggle dark mode Toggle search form Exclusives Pixel Nest Android Chrome TV Workspace YouTube Alphabet Videos Reviews APPS & UPDATES YOUTUBE MUSIC GOOGLE AI YouTube Music will let you make custom playlist art with gen AI, adding ‘Speed dial’ Abner LiOct 24 2023 - 7:00 am PT 12 Comments YouTube Music announced today that it’s adding generative AI to let users create custom playlist art, while it made official the “Speed dial” redesign. Today, a playlist takes the artwork of the first four tracks and will present it in a grid. Customization, like the ability to upload your own image, has been a long-running feature request. Google is now addressing that by introducing an AI image generator to YouTube Music. When editing a playlist, tapping the artwork will let you start customizing. Start by selecting a category: Colors, Cycles, Travel, Moods, Nature, Animals, Landscapes, Food and Drinks, Fantasy, Workout, or Humor. You then get a Mad Libs-esque prompt, like the equivalent wallpaper feature on the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro. Instead of typing, you select from a carousel of options. In the case of animals, you select the creature and then the art style with some generated options shown above. There’s also a “Randomize” button below. Select the one you like and hit “Save” in the top-right corner. It will then appear for the playlist on all surfaces. This is rolling out starting today as an experimental feature for English language US users. Stay tuned for expansion to other regions and languages globally. Meanwhile, YouTube Music is replacing “Listen again” with “Speed dial.” Google says this “new feature on the Home tab that will help you quickly explore and listen to the songs and artists you’ve got on repeat.” As previously spotted in testing, you go from 20 items in a carousel to 9 presented in a 3×3 grid. This can include albums, artists, and playlists. A tap immediately starts playback in the miniplayer and notably does not open the full Now Playing screen, while a second click opens the album page. “More” in the top-right takes you to the same screen that’s available today. What you’re currently listening to is highlighted in white and with an animation at the center. This YouTube Music Speed dial is rolling out “in the coming months” on Android and iOS. The speed dial and generative AI art for playlists join other recent YouTube Music launches like the Samples tab, “Create a radio,” YouTube comments, and real-time lyrics.

    "originBody": "Skip to main content The Verge homepage / Tech/ Reviews/ Science/ Entertainment/ More Menu TECH/GADGETS/MOBILE Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 moves AI out of the cloud and onto your phone / The newest flagship mobile chipset is on-device AI all the way down. By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. Updated Oct 24, 2023, 5:17 PM CDT|1 Comment / 1 New Share this story The what-is-a-photo-pocalypse gets even more complicated. Image: Qualcomm Qualcomm’s new flagship mobile chipset is an on-device AI fest from top to bottom. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 brings generative AI capabilities right to the chipset, vastly speeding up the processing-intensive activities that are usually outsourced to the cloud. It’s one more leap forward in a year that has seen a lot of leaping when it comes to AI, and it will come sooner than later: the first phones with the new chipset are expected to debut in the coming weeks. The 8 Gen 3 supports a chatbot trained on Meta’s Llama 2, and it can accept text, image, and voice input. It can also talk back to you as well as generate an image or text. The chipset also runs the AI image generator Stable Diffusion on-device, something that Qualcomm demoed earlier this year. This time around, the company says it can generate an image in less than one second — the previous tech generated an image in about 15 seconds, which is still faster than the couple of minutes it can take on even a well-equipped laptop. It’ll even relay your favorite activities and “fitness level,” which sounds slightly dystopian All of this is housed in what Qualcomm calls its AI engine, utilizing the company’s Hexagon neural processor. Meanwhile, the Sensing Hub uses OpenAI’s Whisper for speech recognition. The Sensing Hub also supplies the AI engine with information about the user, including location, for more personalized responses. It’ll even relay your favorite activities, age, and “fitness level,” which sounds slightly dystopian if you ask me. Generative AI also plays a major role in the 8 Gen 3’s new image processing capabilities. It will support generative fill for image expansion so you can zoom out and re-crop photos — again, right on the device. The video features are even wilder: there’s an object eraser for video — just tap and an unwanted subject disappears! — and on-device night mode recording at up to 4K / 30p. Google announced its own Night Sight for video feature coming to the Pixel 8 Pro in the near future, but it will run in the cloud. There’s also a feature called Vlogger’s View that will layer video from the selfie and rear cameras together into one view. It’s not a picture-in-picture thing — this feature uses improved image segmentation to remove the background from the selfie video to make it look like you’re standing in front of whatever your rear camera sees. On-device AI is coming to a whole host of mobile devices in the next year. Image: Qualcomm There’s good reason to be concerned about the misuse of these tools, and to that end, Qualcomm is working with a company called Truepic. The tech it’s using is compliant with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity’s open standard, which is kind of like metadata to guarantee the authenticity of a photo or video. It cryptographically binds authentication to the digital asset — like a photo or video — so that it can’t be tampered with as easily as EXIF data can. It’s not all AI on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, though. Qualcomm claims a modest 10 percent bump in power savings compared to the 8 Gen 2 thanks to efficiency gains from the Kryo CPU and Adreno GPU. Dolby’s HDR photo format is supported, echoing Apple and Google’s push toward high dynamic range image capture in their latest devices. There’s the X75 modem-RF with more support for 5G carrier aggregation (remember 5G?), and the GPU supports improved hardware-based ray tracing for more realistic light reflections in mobile games. The system will support up to 240Hz refresh rates on compatible external displays. There’s also a new system called Snapdragon Seamless, which is designed to make it easy to pair laptops and phones with peripherals across manufacturers and OS platforms. Qualcomm says this will enable easier switching between devices — like switching to audio to your PC for a video call and back to music playing on your phone, for example. This seems mainly aimed at getting Android and Windows devices talking to each other more easily, at least at launch. Qualcomm says it’s an open platform that anyone can join, although initially the technology will be largely accessed by Qualcomm’s direct OEM and OS partners. Every garden has to start somewhere — even an open one. 1 COMMENT1 NEW Most Popular All the news from Apple’s ‘Scary Fast’ Mac event Apple ‘Scary Fast’ Mac launch event: the 4 biggest announcements Apple is getting ready for Prime Time Apple’s best move is giving us what we want That’s one pricey subscription Verge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.

A few years ago former football star David Beckham helped push the idea into the mainstream via a video from Synthesia, where he spoke different languages as part of a Malaria charity campaign. Aside from being a source of gimmicks, as well as more serious disinformation, these tools have several real-world applications, and the market is booming. The aforementioned Synthesia raised $90 million this year for its platform, which is used for several things, including generating product videos, as it can generate personalized videos from plain text. To date, it’s now raised a total of $156.6 million. However, while it’s possible to generate these videos, doing so millions of times over for millions of products is not easy, and can require a lot of manual intervention. Now Oxolo, a German startup out of Hamburg, has hit up on a novel way of doing so, using generative AI. Here’s how it works: Say a company wants to do a corporate training. Using Oxolo, it can build a video for an employee type, based on management level, gender, geography, etc. It can then send out videos that will automatically A/B their own performance. If an employee clearly loses interest in one video, then the video is adjusted and replaced with a better performing one on the fly. The same application can be made for product videos, for instance, creating better and better performing product videos. “Other platforms have avatars and maybe templates and you have to manually put in the text,” explained Elisabeth L’Orange, co-founder and CCO of Oxolo, over a call. “With Oxolo you just take a product link — say for socks — paste it into Oxolo, hit generate and you get the whole product video. You don’t need to add anything, and you can edit it. You don’t need to manually think about what you need to do.” Oxolo was co-founded by L’Orange, a former venture partner with Neuhaus Partners, and Heiko Hubertz, former founder & CEO of Bigpoint games. Oxolo claims its AI can integrate images, context, text-to-speech and human-based avatars. As a result of this rather magic approach, Oxolo has now raised a €13 million Series A funding round led by DN Capital. Also participating were German angel investors, including Christian Vollmann, Johannes Plehn, Thomas Hagemann, Stefan Wiskemann, Alex Täubert and Mischa Rürup. According to Market Growth Reports, the current market size for tools that enable the creation of video advertising content is estimated at $1.0-$1.5 billion in 2023, and is expected to grow at a 15-20% CAGR over the next five to seven years to $3.4 billion in 2028 and $4.3 billion by 2030.

    "originBody": "SEARCH GENERATIVE AI / ARTICLE How People Can Create—and Destroy—Value with Generative AI SEPTEMBER 21, 2023 By François Candelon, Lisa Krayer, Saran Rajendran, and David Zuluaga Martínez READING TIME: 15 MIN Key Takeaways A first-of-its-kind scientific experiment finds that people mistrust generative AI in areas where it can contribute tremendous value and trust it too much where the technology isn’t competent. Around 90% of participants improved their performance when using GenAI for creative ideation. People did best when they did not attempt to edit GPT-4’s output. When working on business problem solving, a task outside the tool’s current competence, many participants took GPT-4's misleading output at face value. Their performance was 23% worse than those who didn’t use the tool at all. Adopting generative AI is a massive change management effort. The job of the leader is to help people use the new technology in the right way, for the right tasks and to continually adjust and adapt in the face of GenAI’s ever-expanding frontier. Generative AI will be a powerful enabler of competitive advantage for companies that crack the code of adoption. In a first-of-its-kind scientific experiment, we found that when GenAI is used in the right way, and for the right tasks, its capabilities are such that people’s efforts to improve the quality of its output can backfire. But it isn’t obvious when the new technology is (or is not) a good fit, and the persuasive abilities of the tool make it hard to spot a mismatch. This can have serious consequences: When it is used in the wrong way, for the wrong tasks, generative AI can cause significant value destruction. We conducted our experiment with the support of a group of scholars from Harvard Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of Warwick.1 With more than 750 BCG consultants worldwide as subjects, it is the first study to test the use of generative AI in a professional-services setting—through tasks that reflect what employees do every day. The findings have critical implications across industries. The opportunity to boost performance is astonishing: When using generative AI (in our experiment, OpenAI’s GPT-4) for creative product innovation, a task involving ideation and content creation, around 90% of our participants improved their performance. What’s more, they converged on a level of performance that was 40% higher than that of those working on the same task without GPT-4. People best captured this upside when they did not attempt to improve the output that the technology generated. Creative ideation sits firmly within GenAI’s current frontier of competence. When our participants used the technology for business problem solving, a capability outside this frontier, they performed 23% worse than those doing the task without GPT-4. And even participants who were warned about the possibility of wrong answers from the tool did not challenge its output. When using GPT-4 for a task within the tool’s current frontier of competence, nearly all participants improved their performance. Those who used GPT-4 for a task outside this frontier performed worse than those who didn’t use the tool. Our findings describe a paradox: People seem to mistrust the technology in areas where it can contribute massive value and to trust it too much in areas where the technology isn’t competent. This is concerning on its own. But we also found that even if organizations change these behaviors, leaders must watch for other potential pitfalls: Our study shows that the technology’s relatively uniform output can reduce a group’s diversity of thought by 41%. The precise magnitude of the effects we uncovered will be different in other settings. But our findings point to a crucial decision-making moment for leaders across industries. They need to think critically about the work their organization does and which tasks can benefit from or be damaged by generative AI. They need to approach its adoption as a change management effort spanning data infrastructure, rigorous testing and experimentation, and an overhaul of existing talent strategies. Perhaps most important, leaders need to continually revisit their decisions as the frontier of GenAI’s competence advances. The Value at Stake Our findings make clear that generative AI adoption is a double-edged sword. In our experiment, participants using GPT-4 for creative product innovation outperformed the control group (those who completed the task without using GPT-4) by 40%. But for business problem solving, using GPT-4 resulted in performance that was 23% lower than that of the control group. (See Exhibit 1.) Learn More About Gen AI Learn More About Gen AI Generative AI Generative artificial intelligence is a form of AI that uses deep learning and GANs for content creation. Learn how it can disrupt or benefit businesses. Artificial Intelligence Scaling artificial intelligence can create a massive competitive advantage. Learn how our AI-driven initiatives have helped clients extract value. The creative product innovation task asked participants to come up with ideas for new products and go-to-market plans. The business problem-solving task asked participants to identify the root cause of a company’s challenges based on performance data and interviews with executives. (See “Our Experiment Design and Methodology.”) Perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, current GenAI models tend to do better on the first type of task; it is easier for LLMs to come up with creative, novel, or useful ideas based on the vast amounts of data on which they have been trained. Where there’s more room for error is when LLMs are asked to weigh nuanced qualitative and quantitative data to answer a complex question. Given this shortcoming, we as researchers knew that GPT-4 was likely to mislead participants if they relied completely on the tool, and not also on their own judgment, to arrive at the solution to the business problem-solving task (this task had a “right” answer). OUR EXPERIMENT DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY We also knew that participants were capable of finding the answer to the business problem-solving task on their own: 85% of participants in the control group did so. Yet many participants who used GPT-4 for this task accepted the tool’s erroneous output at face value. It’s likely that GPT-4’s ability to generate persuasive content contributed to this result. In our informal conversations with participants, many confirmed that they found the rationale GPT-4 offered for its output very convincing (even though as an LLM, it came up with the rationale after the recommendation, rather than creating the recommendation on the basis of the rationale). The double-edged-sword effect holds across all levels of baseline proficiency. (At the start of the experiment, participants completed a baseline task without using GPT-4 that we then graded and ranked; see the sidebar on our design and methodology). This has an important caveat: The lower the individual’s baseline proficiency, the more significant the effect tended to be; for the creative product innovation task, these individuals boosted performance by 43%. Still, the effect was material even for the top-ranked baseline performers, among whom the upside and downside of using GPT-4 on the two tasks were 17% and -17%, respectively. (See Exhibit 2.) (Throughout, our discussion of participants’ performance is not indicative of their absolute levels of competence and talents with respect to these or other tasks.) The strong connection between performance and the context in which generative AI is used raises an important question about training: Can the risk of value destruction be mitigated by helping people understand how well-suited the technology is for a given task? It would be rational to assume that if participants knew the limitations of GPT-4, they would know not to use it, or would use it differently, in those situations. Our findings suggest that it may not be that simple. The negative effects of GPT-4 on the business problem-solving task did not disappear when subjects were given an overview of how to prompt GPT-4 and of the technology’s limitations. (See “Our Use of Training in the Experiment.”) OUR USE OF TRAINING IN THE EXPERIMENT Even more puzzling, they did considerably worse on average than those who were not offered this simple training before using GPT-4 for the same task. (See Exhibit 3.) This result does not imply that all training is ineffective. But it has led us to consider whether this effect was the result of participants’ overconfidence in their own abilities to use GPT-4—precisely because they’d been trained. New Opportunities for Human Talent Effects at the group level, like the ones discussed above, aren’t necessarily indicative of how generative AI impacts individuals. When we look behind the averages, we find that the use of GPT-4 has two distinct effects on individual performance distribution. (See Exhibit 4.) First, the entire distribution shifts to the right, toward higher levels of performance. This underscores the fact that the 40% performance boost discussed above is not a function of “positive” outliers. Nearly all participants (around 90%), irrespective of their baseline proficiency, produced higher-quality results when using GPT-4 for the creative product innovation task. Second, the variance in performance is dramatically reduced: A much higher share of our participants performed at or very close to the average level. In other words, participants with lower baseline proficiency, when given access to generative AI, ended up nearly matching those with higher baseline proficiency. Being more proficient without the aid of technology doesn’t give one much of an edge when everyone can use GPT-4 to perform a creative product innovation task. (See Exhibit 5.) The fact that we observed this effect among our well-educated, high-achieving sample suggests that it may turn out to be even more pronounced in contexts that are more heterogenous, with a wider spread in proficiency. Digging deeper, we find that because GPT-4 reaches such a high level of performance on the creative product innovation task, it seems that the average person is not able to improve the technology’s output. In fact, human efforts to enhance GPT-4 outputs decrease quality. (See the sidebar on our design and methodology for a description of how we measured quality.) We found that “copy-pasting” GPT-4 output strongly correlated with performance: The more a participant’s final submission in the creative product innovation task departed from GPT-4’s draft, the more likely it was to lag in quality. (See Exhibit 6.) For every 10% increase in divergence from GPT-4’s draft, participants on average dropped in the quality ranking by around 17 percentile points. It appears that the primary locus of human-driven value creation lies not in enhancing generative AI where it is already great, but in focusing on tasks beyond the frontier of the technology’s core competencies. Interestingly, we found that most of our participants seemed to grasp this point intuitively. In general, they did not feel threatened by generative AI; rather, they were excited by this change in their roles and embraced the idea of taking on tasks that only humans can do. As one participant observed, “I think there is a lot of value add in what we can do as humans. You need a human to adapt an answer to a business’s context; that process cannot be replaced by AI.” Another noted, “I think it’s an opportunity to do things more efficiently, to stop wasting time on things that are very repetitive and actually focus on what’s important, which is more strategic.” However, it is worth keeping in mind the population of this study: highly skilled young knowledge workers who are more likely to be able to make this transition easily. Other professionals may feel greater fear or experience more difficulty adapting their role to the new technology. The Creativity Trap Even if you use GenAI in the right way, and for the right tasks, our research suggests that there are risks to creativity. The first risk is a tradeoff between individual performance gains and collective creativity loss. Because GPT-4 provides responses with very similar meaning time and again to the same sorts of prompts, the output provided by participants who used the technology was individually better but collectively repetitive. The diversity of ideas among participants who used GPT-4 for the creative product innovation task was 41% lower compared with the group that did not use the technology. (See Exhibit 7.) People didn’t appreciably add to the diversity of ideas even when they edited GPT-4’s output. The second risk is drawn from a sample of our interviews with participants. Roughly 70% believe that extensive use of GPT-4 may stifle their creative abilities over time. (See Exhibit 8.) As one participant explained, “Like any technology, people can rely on it too much. GPS helped navigation immensely when it was first released, but today people can’t even drive without a GPS. As people rely on a technology too much, they lose abilities they once had.” Another participant noted, “This [phenomenon] is definitely a concern for me. If I become too reliant on GPT, it will weaken my creativity muscles. This already happened to me during the experiment.” Businesses will need to be mindful of their employees’ perceptions of and attitudes about generative AI, and how those might affect their ability to drive innovation and add value. We don’t yet have data to confirm our participants’ perceptions; this is a topic for further study. But if employees’ concerns bear out, it could compound the group-level risk. Specifically, the loss of collective diversity of ideas may be exacerbated if employees experience some atrophy of individual creativity. The Generative AI Change Imperative Inspired by the findings from our research, we envision a series of questions, challenges, and options that can help business leaders make generative AI adoption a source of differentiation—and, as such, an enabler of sustained competitive advantage. Data Strategy. Any company that incorporates GenAI can realize significant efficiency gains in areas where the technology is competent. But if multiple firms apply the technology across similar sets of tasks, it can produce a leveling effect among organizations analogous to the pattern observed among participants in our experiment. As a result, one of the keys to differentiation will be the ability to fine-tune generative AI models with large volumes of high-quality, firm-specific data. This is easier said than done. In our experience, not all companies have the advanced data infrastructure capabilities needed to process their proprietary data. Developing these capabilities has been a key focus of AI transformations, but with the arrival of generative AI, it becomes all the more important: As we have argued elsewhere, the power of GenAI often lies in the identification of unexpected—even counterintuitive—patterns and correlations. To reap these benefits, companies need a comprehensive data pipeline, combined with a renewed focus on developing internal data engineering capabilities. Roles and Workflows. For tasks that generative AI systems have mastered—which, of course, is an ever-expanding list—people need to radically revise their mindset and their approach to work. Instead of the default assumption that technology creates a helpful first draft that requires revision, people should regard the output as a plausible final draft that they should check against firm-established guardrails but otherwise largely leave as is. The value at stake lies not only in the promise of greater efficiency but also in the possibility for people to redirect time, energy, and effort away from tasks that generative AI will take over. Employees will be able to double down on the tasks that remain beyond the frontier of this technology, reaching higher levels of proficiency. The value at stake lies not only in the promise of greater efficiency but also in the possibility for people to redirect time, energy, and effort away from tasks that generative AI will take over. Turning the lens on ourselves, we can already envision our employees spending less time manually summarizing research or polishing slides and instead investing even more effort in driving complex change management initiatives. The impact of generative AI’s disruption will of course vary dramatically across job categories. But at least some workers—including the majority of our participants—are confronting this prospect with optimism. Strategic Workforce Planning. To get the AI–human dynamics right in complex organizations, leaders must grapple with four questions that have no easy answers: Which capabilities will you need? As with any other technology, it will take people to define what and how generative AI will be used. But it isn’t obvious which human capabilities are best suited to maximizing the tool’s value or how often these capabilities will change. We’re seeing this uncertainty play out in real time with respect to LLMs: The role of “prompt engineer” didn’t exist a year ago, but demand for this role during Q2 2023 was nearly seven times higher than it was in Q1.2 (GPT-4 was launched toward the end of Q1, on March 14, 2023.) And yet, prompt engineers may no longer be needed once generative AI itself has mastered the task of breaking down complex problems into optimal prompts (as it appears it soon will with autonomous agents). Even the selection of optimal LLMs for specific business applications, which is largely done by humans at present, may in the future be outsourced to AI systems themselves. What is your hiring strategy? Because generative AI is a great leveler of proficiency on certain tasks, raw talent may not be a good predictor of high performance in a world of widespread GenAI use. For example, some people may have lower baseline proficiency for a type of task while being quite capable of partnering with generative AI to outperform peers. Finding these individuals will be an important goal for future talent strategies, but the underlying traits are not yet clearly identified. How will you train people effectively? As our findings indicate, straightforward training won’t be sufficient. Effective training will likely need to explicitly address any cognitive biases that may lead people to over-rely on generative AI in situations where the technology has not yet reached the right level of competence. We also see a potentially deeper issue: Even as certain tasks are fully handed over to GenAI, some degree of human oversight will be necessary. How can employees effectively manage the technology for tasks that they themselves have not learned how to do on their own? How will you cultivate diversity of thought? Our results suggest that GenAI detracts from collective creativity by limiting the range of perspectives that individuals bring to the table. This loss in diversity of thought may have ripple effects beyond what we can currently envision. One plausible risk is that it could shrink the long-term innovation capacity of organizations—for example, by making ideation more homogenous. It’s a slippery slope, as a decline in innovation capabilities means less differentiation from competitors, which could impede growth potential. The good news is that the ideas that humans generate on their own and the ideas that they generate when assisted by generative AI are vastly different. Setting aside the degree of diversity in each group, when we compared the output of the control and experimental groups, the overlap (semantic similarity) was less than 10%. The key for leaders will be to use both approaches to ideation—which ultimately will create an even wider circle of ideas. Experimentation and Testing. Generative AI systems continue to develop at a stunning rate: In just the few months between the releases of OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the model made huge performance leaps across a wide range of tasks. Tasks for which generative AI is ill-suited today will likely fall within its frontier of competence soon—perhaps in the very near future. This is likely to happen as LLMs become multi-modal (going beyond text to include other formats of data), or as models grow larger, both of which increase the likelihood of unpredictable capabilities. Given this lack of predictability, the only way to understand how generative AI will impact your business is to develop experimentation capabilities—to establish a “generative AI lab” of sorts that will enable you to keep pace with an expanding frontier. And as the technology changes, the collaboration model between humans and generative AI will have to change as well. Experimentation may yield some counterintuitive or even uncomfortable findings about your business, but it will also enable you to gain invaluable insights about how the technology can and should be used. We put our feet to the fire with this experiment—and we believe all business leaders should do the same. Generative AI will likely change much of what we do and how we do it, and it will do so in ways that no one can anticipate. Success in the age of AI will largely depend on an organization’s ability to learn and change faster than it ever has before.

TECH & INNOVATION CLOUD WARS Google Cloud's big bet on Gen AI disappoints as business customers pull back on spending In contrast, rival Microsoft announced an earnings beat driven by its cloud business By Grete Suarez PublishedOctober 24, 2023 Google Cloud business lagged in the third quarter of 2023Photo: Nacho Doce (Reuters) Alphabet’s cloud momentum waned in the third quarter, causing shares of the Google parent company to dip more than 5% in after-hours trading on Oct. 24. Google Cloud revenue was up 22.5% compared with last year’s third quarter, to $8.41 billion. But that missed Wall Street revenue estimates of $8.6 billion and marked the division’s slowest growth since the first quarter of 2021. While cloud growth is “strong across geographies, industries, and products,” Alphabet CFO Ruth Porat said during an earnings call, the below-forecast expansion rate “reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts,” a signal that customers are pulling back on their spending. This is a far cry from a more optimistic tone by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai last quarter, when he boasted “more than 70% of gen AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers” and that the company’s “AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models.” Google has been trying to play catch-up in the generative AI space ever since Microsoft’s surprise investment in OpenAI firmly placed it in the number one spot in the AI race. Based on Microsoft’s 29% increase in cloud revenue in the recent quarter, it appears to be putting more distance between itself and its rival. Awaiting “exciting progress” As Rohit Kulkarni, Roth MKM’s managing director, told Yahoo Finance, Google is the “godfather of AI” but “they’re still in search of that killer AI app.” Alphabet’s effort to integrate AI into products ranging from its search engine to its Workspace tools still may be in its infancy, however. “We’re continuing to focus on making AI more helpful for everyone; there’s exciting progress and lots more to come,” said Pichai in a statement. Alphabet’s performance for the third quarter, by the digits: $76.69 billion: Total revenue beat estimates of $75.96 billion $1.55: Adjusted earnings per share beat estimates of $1.44 $19.69 billion: Net income beat estimates of $18.52 billion $59.7 billion: Google’s advertising business beat revenue estimates of $58.9 billion—a 9% increase from a year before. $8.41 billion: Google’s cloud business sales fell short of the estimated $8.6 billion $44 billion: Google search ad revenue $7.95 billion: YouTube’s ad revenue beat estimates of $7.81 billion 📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",

      "Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue grew by 22.5% in Q3 2023 compared to the same quarter last year, marking its slowest growth period since Q1 2021, which led to a drop in the parent company's share prices.",
      "This slow expansion rate, which failed to meet Wall Street's projections, is attributed to cutbacks in customer spending.",
      "Although Google has been striving to emerge in the generative AI space, Microsoft's superior cloud revenue growth appears to be solidifying its position as a front-runner."

By Adam Ang October 24, 2023 11:39 pm SHARE 516 Photo courtesy of Ubie A new generative AI tool has been made available to doctors in Japan that helps summarise long and detailed preliminary interviews of patients. Japanese startup Ubie has recently launched a large-language model-based (LLM) feature on its AI-powered patient service platform. HOW IT WORKS The Medical Interview Summary Function is a new feature on the Ubie Medical Navi, a platform offering that replaces paper medical questionnaires with digital forms for patients. It is said that the service platform, which is currently only available to Japanese clinics and hospitals, can tailor preliminary interviews based on patient symptoms. After answering 20-30 questions related to their symptoms and lifestyle habits on the digital form, the LLM-based feature automatically summarises them and presents the summary to the doctors. To maintain the accuracy and reliability of this latest function, the original text before summarisation is used by default while a safety net allows for continuous reference to the original text during summarisation. The summary feature is now available to all 1,500 healthcare professionals using the Ubie Medical Navi in over 47 prefectures in Japan without additional cost. It was developed with doctors through the Ubie Lab, the company's research arm. Established in July, the research organisation aims to develop reliable and safe generative AI tools for healthcare. WHY IT MATTERS Ubie developed the summary feature following feedback from busy doctors who wanted to \"quickly and succinctly grasp\" patients' concerns and symptoms. It takes much of their time to go through every item from preliminary interviews of patients on Ubie Medical Navi and prepare their notes. Based on a trial with Ubie Medical Navi users, the LLM-driven feature has helped enhance both patient communication and operational efficiency. Ubie also noted user satisfaction which indicates continued use in the future. \"The [LLM-driven] summarised text is very easy to understand, and we are now able to grasp and communicate with patients more promptly than ever before. In the past, we had to selectively copy and paste text from Ubie into the [EMR]. Still, the time and effort required for this process have been greatly reduced, which is also helpful from the perspective of improving operational efficiency. Currently, we turn on the medical interview summary function for most of our medical examinations, and it has already become indispensable for us,\" one doctor user was cited as saying. MARKET SNAPSHOT The generative AI craze has also reached the healthcare industry in Asia-Pacific. For instance, Singapore's national health technology agency Synapxe is now working with Microsoft to enable the development of LLMs that assist healthcare professionals in the public sector. A Malaysia and Singapore-based startup recently launched its generative AI tool that can translate medical jargon, health reports, and complex imaging into digestible visual content. Meanwhile, medical AI startup AI4Rx in India came out recently with the MedBeat HealthConnect patient and doctor apps, which feature AI that generates summaries of patients' potential symptoms and diseases akin to Ubie's LLM-based offering. ON THE RECORD \"Generative AI, including LLM, is rapidly being utilised in many industries and professions in Japan. [B]ecause of the innovative nature of the technology, a number of issues need to be sorted out, such as its reliability and ethical considerations. [Particularly] in the medical and healthcare fields, more careful use is currently required considering its impact on consumers and patients, privacy protection, medical ethics, and so on,\" Kota Kubo, co-founder and co-CEO of Ubie, told Mobihealth News. \"As a leader in the AI healthcare field, [we] will continue to use [our] experience and knowledge to safely and effectively harness generative AI on our platform. This way we can improve healthcare professionals' productivity and guide patients to the right care.\" Tags: Ubie, Japan, generative AI, large language model, patient summary More regional news Mesh Bio refining digital twin tech for chronic disease management and more briefs By Adam Ang October 20, 2023 Sky Labs, maker of ring-type BP monitor, bags $15M Series C funding By Adam Ang October 17, 2023 Grab-backed telehealth startup Good Doctor scores $10M in Series A and more digital health fundings By Adam Ang October 13, 2023 SHARE 516 TOP STORY Japanese doctors start adopting gen AI EDITOR'S PICK YouTube launches new products for healthcare content creators Biofourmis CEO steps down a month after global layoffs GE HealthCare, Mass General Brigham codevelop AI algorithm for scheduling Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company partners with pharma company, COPD Foundation Health tracking ring company Oura partners with teletherapy platform Talkspace Healthcare robotics platform Mendaera secures $24M MORE STORIES President Biden's executive order on AI directs HHS to establish safety program Midi Health expands women's care access in all 50 states Survey: ChatGPT/GenAI is influencing investors' funding strategies Q&A: The state of healthcare innovation in Israel Butterfly Network announces partnership to codevelop brain computer interfaces Built at Redesign Health, Harmonic Health launches for dementia care delivery Senior care platform Sage secures $15M and more digital health fundings OrbiMed scores more than $4.3B in private investment funds MORE NEWS Healthcare IT News Healthcare IT News Australia Healthcare Finance News HIMSS TV MOBIHEALTHNEWS Email Address: Submit CONNECT Add MobiHealthNews to your network.

    "originBody": "Login Reviews Buying Guides Gaming Gear Entertainment Tomorrow Deals News Video Podcasts Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 brings on-device generative AI to more Android phones Expect better efficiency, improved gaming performance and camera upgrades. Kris Holt Contributing Reporter Tue, Oct 24, 2023, 3:00 PM EDT·4 min read 2 Qualcomm At its annual Snapdragon Summit on Tuesday, Qualcomm revealed its latest mobile chipset. Perhaps the biggest change in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is the introduction of on-device generative AI (akin to Google's Tensor G3). The chipset’s AI Engine supports multi-modal generative AI models and what Qualcomm claims is the world’s fastest Stable Diffusion system with the ability to generate an image in under a second. So, you should be able to whip up backgrounds and images for social media posts in a flash. Because GAI requests are handled on-device, Qualcomm says they remain private. There’s an AI assistant based on Meta’s Llama 2 language learning model. It can securely use personal data such as your favorite activities, location and fitness level to provide more personalized responses, Qualcomm says. The Qualcomm Sensing Hub (which powers this feature) is said to deliver an AI performance increase of up to 3.5 times that of Qualcomm's previous mobile chipset. The company also claims the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 delivers up to 98 percent faster Hexagon NPU performance and 40 percent better performance per watt. Qualcomm The camera and editing systems include support for features such as the ability to remove people and objects from a video with the tap of a finger. Qualcomm is promising voice-activated GAI photo and video editing thanks to its Cognitive ISP, along with the option to optimize different parts of a photo in up to 12 layers, whether you capture it with the front or back camera. The Photo Expansion feature uses GAI to extend the borders of a photo, akin to Adobe's Generative Fill tool. The Vlogger's View mode allows you to share video from both your rear and front-facing cameras at the same time, so you can feature your face in what you capture as you narrate what you're seeing. Qualcomm says that Dolby HDR tech allows for image playback and capture with a fuller range of colors, tones and shades. Meanwhile, you can apply a cryptographic seal from Truepic to a photo to indicate that it's the real deal and not something you whipped up with GAI, because that's the world we're living in these days. It's a different approach to applying a label to AI-generated content. Elsewhere, Qualcomm is promising some gaming upgrades in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. There's support for Unreal Engine 5.2 along with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing with global illumination, which the company says is a first for a mobile chipset. This, Qualcomm says, helps deliver \"lifelike, multi-source lighting\" in games. NetEase/Qualcomm The Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.0 can double framerates while sustaining the same power consumption as the previous chipset, Qualcomm claims. If you're so inclined to hook up a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-powered device to an external 240Hz display, you'll be able to play games at up to 240 fps. Snapdragon Game Super Resolution, Qualcomm's answer to upscaling tech like NVIDIA's DLSS, will help games to run at up to 8K on supported displays too. The company notes that it's open-sourcing Snapdragon Game Super Resolution. You can expect gameplay audio to be synced to the millisecond, according to Qualcomm, meaning that you shouldn't experience any lag while using earbuds. It's also promising uninterrupted lossless audio even as you move away from your phone or from one room to another thanks to its Expanded Personal Area Network Technology system. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is said to support 24-bit 96 kHz lossless music over Bluetooth. On the subject of connectivity, Qualcomm is using AI hardware acceleration in the X75 Modem-RF System. It says this can help to deliver better 5G speeds, coverage, mobility, link robustness and location accuracy. There's Wi-Fi 7 support too. Compared with the previous chipset, Qualcomm says the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3's Kryo CPU delivers 30 percent better performance and 20 percent more power efficiency. As for the GPU, it claims you'll benefit from a 25 percent performance improvement and 25 percent greater power efficiency, along with a 40 percent ray-tracing upgrade. Overall, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is slated to have 10 percent overall power savings compared with last year’s chip. You won't have to wait long to try out a phone with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 if you really want to. Qualcomm says devices that use the chipset should start to appear in the coming weeks. Among the brands and manufacturers that will use it are Sony, ASUS, OnePlus, Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi, Honor and ZTE.
