Key findings portray a legal industry that is embracing seismic innovations, such as generative artificial intelligence, while continuing efforts to deploy specialized legal technology solutions that can improve day-to-day work. This is all while law firms and corporate legal departments contend with the changes required to service crucial environmental, social and governance needs and attract and retain the talents of a future-ready workforce. “Even in a world increasingly impacted by ChatGPT and other forms of AI, the legal profession continues to derive its strength from human relationships,” Martin O’Malley, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory. “Still, the 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey suggests that lawyers are acknowledging the pivotal role of technology in creating more value for their organizations and for society as a whole. This is an essential development for the legal industry. With legal professionals facing the challenge of an ever-growing volume and complexity of legal and regulatory requirements, technology is playing an increasingly important role in their daily work. Whether it’s improving collaboration, cementing relationships, or improving workflows, technology is at the heart of driving the entire industry into the future.” Generative AI According to the survey, attorneys have only just begun embracing generative AI (GenAI). A sizable 73% of the lawyers polled in the survey expect to integrate GenAI in their legal work within the next year. Many respondents appear poised to greet this latest technological development with confidence, as 68% indicated that they feel prepared for GenAI’s impact, while 73% said that they understand how it can be applied to their work. Despite this, there seems to be no consensus among lawyers about whether they see GenAI as an opportunity or a threat. Almost half of the surveyed lawyers (43%) see GenAI as an opportunity, one in four (25%) see it as a threat, and 26% see it as both an opportunity and a threat. ESG While the majority of surveyed law firms (68%) have established dedicated ESG practices within the last three years, both law firms and corporate legal departments still have plenty of work ahead of them to meet the heightened demand for ESG-related legal expertise and guidance that has continued to rise steadily over the last two years. According to the survey, 69% of law firms and 61% of corporate legal departments are not yet very prepared to fully deliver against expectations in the area of ESG. Nevertheless, ESG remains an important strategic growth area, with half of the attorneys surveyed (50%) expecting demand [from clients for ESG legal services] to increase, and 45% expecting demand to stay the same (up from 36% in 2022). Technology Use Technology has become firmly established as part of the legal profession, with almost all attorneys (87%) saying that technology has improved their day-to-day work. Still, less than half (46%) believe they are fully leveraging technology, 50% are transitioning and 4% feel they are not leveraging technology as much as they should. Meanwhile, lawyers continue to face pressure to expand their investment in and use of technology in the face of client demands. Almost half of law firms (46%) rank the need to use technology to improve productivity and efficiency as a top need to meet client demands, as well as to improve collaboration and work processes. Lawyers from both law firms (85%) and corporate legal departments (84%) also expect to make greater use of technology that improves productivity. Workforce The difficulty of attracting the right people for the right role seems likely to become a major obstacle to tackling heavy workloads and productivity demands. A vast majority (81%) of lawyers from both law firms and corporate legal departments see their ability to recruit and retain talent as a key area of focus moving forward. Still, most (80%) said they’re ready to navigate recruitment demands. Among the most pressing demands from talent, 89% of lawyers said it’s important to have technology that supports the ability to work remotely. Technology aside, the nature of the work itself appears to be changing as well, with most lawyers (78%) from both law firms and legal departments expecting an increased demand for specialization and a decline in generalist work. The stakes are high: Law firm respondents cited specialization as one of the factors clients will use to evaluate their outside counsel in the next three years. Fortunately, a majority of firms and corporations (75%) said they are prepared to offer greater specialization to clients. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB) rates low on the list of workplace satisfaction indicators, according to the survey. Nevertheless, the survey found that most legal professionals (88%) are satisfied with their employer’s efforts to create a diverse workforce and culture. Additionally, a high percentage of lawyers (82%) work for organizations that claim to have successfully created a diverse and inclusive environment. However, those sentiments don’t necessarily reflect a more formalized approach to promoting DEIB. Only 55% of law firms and corporate legal departments surveyed currently have formal DEIB policies in place. Timing varies among firms and legal departments who are still firmly in the planning stage of their DEIB policy implementations, with 22% saying they plan to implement a formal policy in the next 12 months and 15% targeting “the next few years.” International Perspectives Generative AI and ChatGPT may be global phenomenons, but the survey indicates that views continue to vary from country to country. More lawyers in the Netherlands (65%) appear to be convinced about the benefits of GenAI than legal professionals in the U.S. (46%), Belgium (38%) and France (20%). Additionally, professionals from the Netherlands are most likely to see GenAI as an opportunity (65%) while also seeming to have the greatest understanding of how this technology applies to their work (89%), a sentiment that is also shared by 80% of U.S. legal professionals. Both countries also indicate a rise in demand for ESG guidance in the past year, and the majority have DEIB policies in place. Meanwhile, Belgium, France and Hungary each score below 40% when it comes to having DEIB policies in place. Like this story? Begin each business day with news you need to know!

    "originBody": "Legal Industry Legal Industry Technology Intellectual Property AI improves legal writing speed, not quality - study By Karen Sloan November 8, 20237:33 PM UTCUpdated 18 hours ago AI (Artificial Intelligence) letters and robot hand miniature in this illustration taken, June 23, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Companies Microsoft Corp Follow Nov 8 (Reuters) - Law students who used artificial intelligence on several legal writing tasks were able to complete their assignments faster, but their work product wasn’t consistently better than that of classmates who didn’t use the technology, according to a new study. Law students with lower grades on average saw bigger improvements on their legal writing tasks when using GPT-4 than did their higher-performing classmates, suggesting that the benefits of artificial intelligence vary according to the abilities of the user and the type of legal work being performed, the study found. Advertisement · Scroll to continue “These results suggest that generative AI will almost certainly become a vital tool for many lawyers in the near future, comparable to more familiar legal-tech tools like Westlaw, Lexis and ediscovery software,” reads the study titled, “Lawyering in The Age of Artificial Intelligence.” (Westlaw and Reuters are owned by the same parent company.) The study, posted online on Tuesday and conducted by two University of Minnesota law professors and a law professor at the University of Southern California, is the latest in a growing body of research examining AI in legal education. Two of those three authors in August released a study that found low-performing law students scored higher on final exams when given access to GPT-4, while their high-performing classmates performed worse when using the technology. Earlier studies found that the exam scores of the previous version of GPT-4 matched those of mediocre law students, while a newer one found that GPT-4 can pass the bar exam. Advertisement · Scroll to continue GPT-4 is a large language model from Microsoft-backed OpenAI that generates human-like text based on user queries. The authors of the new study recruited 60 Minnesota law students to undergo several hours of training on GPT-4 then complete four distinct writing assignments: drafting a complaint; a contract; a section of an employee handbook; and a client memo. Each participant used GPT-4 on two of those assignments and completed the other two without AI, and the assignments were graded. Advertisement · Scroll to continue GPT-4 did not result in any statistical improvement except on the contract drafting assignment, the authors found. But there were “large and consistent decreases” in the amount of time it took the students to complete the assignments when they used GPT-4, according to the study. Students who used GPT-4 to draft a complaint spent and average 32% fewer minutes on that task. The study urges law schools to ban the use of generative artificial intelligence in core first-year courses and their exams, in part because the technology disproportionately helps lower-performing students. But they should also develop upper-level courses that teach students how to use artificial intelligence effectively, it adds. Read more: These law students got to use AI on final exams.

    "title": "Preparing for the Legal Risks of AI in Business: Recommendations and Implications",
    "originLink": "https://fortune.com/2023/11/08/ai-playbook-legality/",
    "originBody": "TECH ·A.I. AI is about to face many more legal risks. Here’s how businesses can prepare BYJOHN KELL Some disputes are already in the early stages of working their way through the courts. ILLUSTRATION BY NICK LITTLE When clients approach Bennett Borden to ask questions about generative artificial intelligence and the impact on their businesses, the chief data scientist at law firm DLA Piper turns to fiction. He believes AI is more like Iron Man than the Terminator. For those not attuned to science fiction, Iron Man is a tech-advanced armor suit that helps its inventor, billionaire Tony Stark, save the world in the Marvel universe. In the original Terminator film, an AI-powered assassin is sent back in time to murder the heroine Sarah Connor. Both represent the emotions that AI can evoke, ranging from exhilaration about the potential of the technology to fears about how it could harm humanity. Borden says humans and AI can complement each other by pairing different strengths. People are better at judgment, inference, compassion, and persuasion, while AI is really good at collecting, summarizing, and analyzing information. “Is AI going to replace lawyers?” Borden asks. “No, but lawyers who use AI are going to replace lawyers who don’t.” Humans are worried. Nearly four out of 10 U.S. employees say they are concerned that AI might take some, or all, of their job duties in the future, according to a survey by the American Psychological Association. These fears are leading to litigation. There are over 100 AI-related lawsuits working their way through the legal system, according to experts, ranging from intellectual property, to the amplification of dangerous content, to discrimination. The pace of AI litigation is expected to accelerate in the years to come. Pending cases include copyright infringement lawsuits by scores of writers against OpenAI and lawsuits by a group of visual artists against AI companies including Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt. Legal experts say that intellectual property litigation is just the first wave of AI litigation to reach the courts. Cases centered on data accuracy, safety, and employment tools are likely next. This spring, a joint statement from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and other agencies warned public and private organizations would be expected to responsibly use AI for employment-related decisions. “If you think about how these models have been trained, they’ve been trained on trillions of examples of how human beings have expressed themselves in text in the case of large language models and whatever has been digitalized over the last 60 years,” says Borden. “Well, some of that stuff is factually accurate, fair, balanced, and nontoxic. And some of it just isn’t.” Companies, in particular multinationals, will have to navigate an uncertain AI regulatory landscape for at least a few more years. Sweeping federal legislation for AI is unlikely until after the 2024 presidential election, putting pressure on states, federal agencies, and regulators to fill in the gap. The European Union’s AI Act, meanwhile, is a risk-based proposal that has faced criticism from major employers including Heineken and Airbus. “If you can understand one sentence of it, you will understand one more sentence than I, and I think you will understand one more sentence than the people who wrote it,” says Tom Siebel, CEO and founder of enterprise AI company C3.ai. Regardless, the EU’s AI Act likely won’t go into effect until 2025 at the earliest. “We’re more likely to get guidance from the courts than we are for a big pronouncement from a legislator,” says Jordan Jaffe, a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati’s San Francisco office. “It is a hot mess,” says Brad Newman, a litigation partner resident in Baker McKenzie’s Palo Alto, Calif., office. “What I’m a big advocate for is a rational, pro-innovation, pro-protection omnibus federal AI legislation. I think Congress is starting to get there.” States and cities across America are already starting to act, which adds complexity to any business operating nationwide. An Illinois law requires job candidates to be informed if AI is used to analyze their interviews. New York City has a similar law on the books. “The state to watch in particular is California,” says Duane Pozza, partner at law firm Wiley Rein LLP. Under the Golden State’s privacy laws, it can create rules that regulate automated decision-making. On October 30, the Biden administration announced a sweeping executive order that set new standards for AI safety and security. The order shared guidance on privacy, equity, principles to support workers, and the promotion of U.S. competition in AI innovation. “The White House has helped to secure voluntary commitments from a number of industry players around the way AI is managed,” says Pozza. “I think overregulation is as bad as underregulation,” says Danny Tobey, chair of DLA Piper’s AI practice. “Companies should be really focused on the differences between generative AI and traditional AI.” Traditional AI is easier to corral and has narrower purposes, like predictive AI, while generative AI can do just about anything and would expose companies to greater risks. In the absence of clear regulatory guidance and with litigation working its way through the courts, companies are left to their own devices to sort out how to protect their reputations, while also steering billions of dollars toward AI investments. “There has to be C-suite responsibility for material use of AI in the corporation,” says Newman. He advises that companies designate a chief AI officer to understand how AI is being used, set a policy that’s both transparent and lawful, and doesn’t merely designate AI tools to data scientists. Newman says companies must also constantly test—both predeployment and post-release—to make sure the AI is fair—not violating privacy laws and not discriminatory. Firms should also notify employees and customers when AI is being used. Generative AI, which is used more as a creative tool, in particular presents risks to privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and quality issues. “You can imagine a situation where you want to use generative AI and it’s not really being rigorously reviewed by a human being before it goes out,” says Jaffe. “You want to have safeguards around that.” Pozza says businesses must have clear policies for how generative AI is used. “The importance of a policy is in large part because employees and contractors want to use this technology for new and interesting things, but management needs to have a handle on what it’s being used for, so that they can run the sort of legal and compliance risks down,” says Pozza. “Anybody who’s involved in the life cycle of AI has to be aware that there could be potential liability from using it.” Leaders, including a chief privacy officer or chief information officer, should enact firm AI governance, while other committees or internal structures should be in place to vet new uses of AI and manage compliance, experts say. The board and CEO also have a critical role to play. Some companies are trying to integrate AI into existing governance structures, though experts warn generative AI is a vast technological advancement that requires unique governance frameworks. One popular AI risk management framework was released at the beginning of the year by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Both the opportunities and risks AI presents should be considered, with a risk matrix that evaluates the low, medium, and high risk of AI that is deployed. AI that’s closer to touching decisions around customers and employees would be deemed higher risk use cases. And while legal experts naturally fret about AI’s risks, many say companies and regulators shouldn’t lose sight of the ways AI can improve lives, when used ethically and responsibly. “It is very important to me that lawyers are not seen as impediments to AI,” says Tobey. “Our view is very much that legal should be seen as business enablement.” His colleague at DLA Piper, Borden, agrees. “This is like the second industrial revolution, where companies that understood the transformative effect of the new technology and really leaned into it, those are the companies that took off and became the rulers of the world.” Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business.

Twitter RSS Feeds for Publishers For Reporters My Account Log In November 8, 2023 The Future of Generative AI in the Legal Industry Epiq + Follow Contact LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Send Embed Generative AI has taken the world by storm. A third of respondents in McKinsey’s Global Survey “The state of AI in 2023: Generative AI’s breakout year” reported regularly using generative AI for at least one business function. When looking at legal, business, and professional services 41 percent had tried generative AI at least once. Another 36 percent reported they regularly use it for work, personal use, or for both purposes. These statistics are probably not shocking; what is surprising is how rapidly Generative AI is integrating into the business world – especially the legal industry that is historically slower to adopt new tools. Generative AI’s transformation potential in legal is compelling. It is crucial to understand how legal is already using these tools, while also calling for transparency and to be conscious of ethical responsibilities. The Current State of AI in Legal The legal industry has embraced AI for years, as transformative tools and use cases continue to unfold and mature. AI tools are regularly used for document review, settlement evaluation, early case assessment, internal investigations, regulatory compliance, strategy decisions, and more. Seeing the benefits AI can offer has caused legal professionals to pivot and slowly turn an industry known for hesitation into one that embraces innovation. For example, AI tools have capabilities to detect and analyze data quicker and more efficiently. This has allowed lawyers to reallocate their workload, reach better outcomes, and tap into deeper business intelligence. The rate at which organizations are already investing in generative AI is unprecedented, especially since this technology is still in the early stages and undoubtedly has more evolution in coming years. The ability to answer questions in a conversational manner and produce content based on prompts – in a matter of seconds – has caused mass intrigue. It will be interesting to see how this technology fits into already existing legal transformation initiatives and if the hype persists. The New Frontier Legal professionals should consider how generative AI can integrate into their workflows. The most significant short-term opportunities for both legal departments and law firms will likely be improving internal processes. Examples include generating reminders around security and compliance; information summarization across commercial contracts; incorporating generative AI into existing eDiscovery solutions; template creation; and brief drafting. Industry sentiment reflects this. In the 2023 Wolters Kluwer survey “Generative AI in the Law: Where Could This All Be Headed?” over 80 percent believe generative AI will create transformative efficiencies for research and routine tasks. Only 31 percent believe that AI will transform high-level legal work. Imagine a lawyer preparing for a deposition. They're sifting through hundreds of emails, memos, and other documents to determine what can be disclosed and what must be kept confidential. Thanks to their organization's new AI assistant with advanced privilege detection capabilities, the lawyer receives a prioritized list of documents that are likely to be privileged. This allows them to quickly isolate sensitive materials and focus on preparing the deposition questions and strategy. Today the AI assistant's capabilities extend beyond privilege detection. Amidst the pile of documents is a complex, 50-page contract that could be pivotal for the deposition. Instead of spending hours dissecting it, the lawyer uses the AI assistant's document summarization feature. Within minutes, the assistant generates a concise one-page summary, highlighting key terms and obligations. This enables the lawyer to grasp the essence of the contract quickly, integrating its crucial points into the deposition strategy. The AI assistant can also flag any borderline cases for manual review, ensuring that the lawyer doesn't inadvertently waive privilege. This saves time and adds a layer of protection against potential legal pitfalls. By having a tool that can manage and execute routine tasks, the lawyer is left with more time to focus on value-driven work. The above scenario reflects a day in the life of a legal professional that has successfully integrated generative AI tools into their regular course of business. It may be daunting when thinking where to start. To come up with the best plan, a good resource is talking to provider partners about how generative AI can solve current issues and close process gaps. They have the expertise to consult, implement, and monitor new technology investments. Remaining Transparent and Ethical While new AI technology holds great transformative potential, lawyers need to remain intentional when adopting new solutions. It is important to use these tools responsibly, being transparent with clients and upholding ethical duties. Risk analysis and policy creation are critical to fostering safe integration of new tools. A recent Sedona Conference article by Hon. Xavier Rodriguez proclaimed that “AI is poised to re-shape the legal profession. But AI will require courts, rules committees, and ethics bodies to consider some of the unique challenges that AI presents. It will require attorneys to evaluate whether to use such products, and the risks associated with any use.” In the McKinsey survey, only 21 percent said their organization has policies around using generative AI for work tasks. The top risk cited was inaccuracy, which only 32 percent of respondents said they were currently mitigating. Consider the following ethical obligations: Competence: Lawyers must keep informed about innovative trending technologies and basic features even if not utilizing these tools, so monitoring generative AI updates is necessary. Confidentiality: Putting confidential client information into a generative AI tool can open the door to waive privilege and can violate the attorney-client relationship. Also consider the level of security and breach risk present before using a new tool. Factual Discrepancies: AI services may create untrue facts or leave out citations, but still appear convincing. This can result in violation of the ethical duty not to make false statements to the tribunal or third parties. Best practice dictates review of the facts to ensure they are accurate before filing with the court or transmitting to opposing counsel. To remain transparent, notify clients of using generative AI on their cases and have policies in place to lower the risk of violating the above ethical rules. Also review public studies or testing data, talk to colleagues, consult with industry experts, or meet with counsel before making an investment to ensure that preferred AI systems promote transparency. Regulation To utilize these tools responsibly, having a framework for implementation is prudent. More U.S. lawmakers have been pushing for federal regulation to keep up with advancements that are changing the way people work, such as generative AI. While lawmaking can often be a slower process, the rapid adoption of these tools and push for regulation may expediate the process. The Biden Administration also issued an AI executive order on October 30 setting forth requirements for the government’s use, evaluation, and procurement of this technology. It applies to over twenty federal agencies, but also provides requirements for certain private organizations. The order is comprehensive and includes directives on security, responsible innovation, competition, federal oversight, and much more. The President called out Congress to also act on regulating AI, which adds to the urgency. Conclusion It is becoming clear that generative AI is not just a tool but a partner in revolutionizing the legal industry. Legal professionals need to stay abreast of pertinent AI developments and consider how to thoughtfully integrate new solutions into their workflows. There will be a learning curve that will change over time as the tools advance, education ensues, and comfort level rises.

    "originBody": "Technology 73 Percent Of Lawyers Expect To Be Using Generative AI Next Year... But To Do What Exactly? Survey says AI is rolling into the profession sooner rather than later. By Joe Patrice onNovember 8, 2023 at 1:43 PMNovember 8, 2023 at 3:35 PM 1 Shares Only around 15 percent of lawyers may be using generative AI for work right now, but that’s set to change in a big way. And quickly. This morning, Wolters Kluwer released the 2023 edition of its Future Ready Lawyer Report, and in addition to insights about ESG work and diversity programs, respondents sounded off on artificial intelligence and a whole lot of them see AI entering their workflow soon. These are just the folks expecting to be using AI next year. Add in the poor schlubs who will get dragged into AI against their will and it’s likely somewhere north of three-quarters of attorneys will be getting answers from “MachineLearned Hand” by this time next year. But what exactly will AI do for these attorneys? Probably not explaining international airline law. According to the report, 77 percent of attorneys “expect it to be in the areas of big data and predictive analytics.” Which is interesting because those are use cases that get a little lost in all the pie-in-the-sky talk about whipping up first drafts of briefs. They’re also not use cases that present much risk. Legal tech has used artificial intelligence to find answers in the data for years. At the risk of oversimplification, generative AI just adds a bit more maturity and polish to the output. This 77 percent figure is down slightly from 80 percent offering that answer last year, which is probably just noise, but could indicate more attorneys looking outside the comfort zone of crunching big data for ways to use AI. Regardless of the answers in this survey, this tech is evolving so quickly that it’s doubtful the industry even knows how it’ll be best deployed by next November. And while most lawyers recognize that GenAI will have an impact on the legal profession, there’s no clear consensus on whether these applications are an opportunity, a threat, or both. Almost half (43%) see it as an opportunity, a quarter as a threat, and 26% as both a threat and opportunity. Isn’t there a Chinese character for that? Threatotunity? Homer Simpson references aside, it’s encouraging that so many lawyers see value in advancing technology. That’s certainly not always been the case. The legal community isn’t exactly known for operating on the cutting edge of tech. But here we are.
