    "originBody": "Wolters Kluwer 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey: industry embraces generative AI, but is not yet very prepared for ESG demands News provided by Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory 08 Nov, 2023, 09:00 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX 73% of lawyers expect to be integrating generative AI into their legal work 69% of law firms and 61% of legal departments are not yet very prepared to meet growing ESG demands 87% of legal professionals say that technology has improved their day-to-day work 43% of legal organizations still have no formal DEIB policies in place NEW YORK, Nov. 8, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Wolters Kluwer, a global leader in professional information, software solutions, and services, has released the results of its global Future Ready Lawyer Survey 2023. Key findings portray a legal industry that is boldly embracing seismic innovations, such as generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), while continuing efforts to deploy specialized legal technology solutions that can improve their day-to-day work. This is all while law firms and corporate legal departments contend with the changes required to service crucial Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) needs and attract and retain the talents of a future-ready workforce. \"Even in a world increasingly impacted by ChatGPT and other forms of AI, the legal profession continues to derive its strength from human relationships,\" said Martin O'Malley, CEO, Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory. \"Still, the 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey suggests that lawyers are acknowledging the pivotal role of technology in creating more value for their organizations and for society as a whole. This is an essential development for the legal industry. With legal professionals facing the challenge of an ever-growing volume and complexity of legal and regulatory requirements, technology is playing an increasingly important role in their daily work. Whether it's improving collaboration, cementing relationships, or improving workflows, technology is at the heart of driving the entire industry into the future.\" Approaching generative AI with confidence Attorneys have only just begun embracing generative AI (GenAI). A sizable 73% of the lawyers polled in this year's Future Ready Lawyer Survey expect to integrate GenAI in their legal work within the next year. Many respondents appear poised to greet this latest technological development with confidence – 68% indicated that they feel prepared for GenAI's impact while 73% said that they understand how it can be applied to their work. Despite this, there seems to be no consensus among lawyers about whether they see GenAI as an opportunity or a threat. Almost half of the surveyed lawyers (43%) see GenAI as an opportunity, one in four (25%) see it as a threat and 26% see it as both an opportunity and a threat. ESG preparedness not yet at required level While the majority of law firms (68%) have established dedicated ESG practices within the last three years, both law firms and corporate legal departments still have plenty of work ahead of them to meet the heightened demand for ESG-related legal expertise and guidance that has continued to rise steadily over the last two years. According to the survey, 69% of law firms and 61% of corporate legal departments say they are not yet very prepared to fully deliver against expectations in the area of ESG. Nevertheless, ESG remains an important strategic growth area, with half of the attorneys surveyed (50%) expecting demand [from clients for ESG legal services] to increase, and 45% expecting demand to stay the same (up from 36% in 2022). Lawyers pressured to expand technology use Technology has become firmly established as part of the legal profession, with almost all attorneys (87%) saying that technology has improved their day-to-day work. Still, less than half of them (46%) believe they are fully leveraging technology, 50% are transitioning and 4% feel they are not leveraging tech as much as they should. Meanwhile, lawyers continue to face pressure to expand their investment in and use of technology in the face of client demands. Almost half of law firms (46%) rank the need to use technology to improve productivity and efficiency as a top need to meet client demands, as well as improve collaboration and work processes. Lawyers from both law firms (85%) and corporate legal departments (84%) also expect to make greater use of technology that improves productivity. Finding and serving a future-ready workforce The difficulty of attracting the right people for the right role seems likely to become a major obstacle to tackling heavy workloads and productivity demands. A vast majority (81%) of lawyers from both law firms and corporate legal departments see their ability to recruit and retain talent as a key area of focus moving forward. Still, most (80%) say they're ready to navigate recruitment demands. Among the most pressing demands from talent – 89% of lawyers say it's important to have technology that supports their ability to work remotely. Technology aside, the nature of the work itself appears to be changing as well, with most lawyers (78%) from both law firms and legal departments expecting an increased demand for specialization and a decline in generalist work. The stakes are high: Law firm respondents cited specialization as one of the factors clients will use to evaluate their outside counsel in the next three years. Fortunately, a majority of firms and corporations (75%) say they are prepared to offer greater specialization to clients. Formal DEIB plans still a work-in-progress Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Beloning (DEIB) rates low on the list of workplace satisfaction indicators. Nevertheless, the survey finds that most legal professionals (88%) are satisfied with their employer's efforts to create a diverse workforce and culture. Additionally, a high percentage of lawyers (82%) work for organizations that claim to have successfully created a diverse and inclusive environment. However, those sentiments don't necessarily reflect a more formalized approach to promoting DEIB. Only 55% of law firms and corporate legal departments surveyed currently have formal Diversity, Equity Inclusion and Belonging (DEIB) policies in place. Timing varies among firms and legal departments who are still firmly in the planning stage of their DEIB policy implementations, with 22% saying they plan to implement a formal policy in the next 12 months, and 15% targeting \"the next few years.\" International perspectives Generative AI and ChatGPT may be global phenomenons, but the survey indicates that views continue to vary from country to country. More lawyers in the Netherlands (65%) appear to be convinced about the benefits of GenAI than legal professionals in the U.S. (46%), Belgium (38%) and France (20%). Additionally, professionals from the Netherlands are most likely to see GenAI as an opportunity (65%) while also seeming to have the greatest understanding of how this technology applies to their work (89%) – a sentiment that is also shared by 80% of U.S. legal professionals. Both countries also indicate a rise in demand for ESG guidance in the past year, and the majority have DEIB policies in place. Meanwhile, Belgium, France and Hungary each score below 40% when it comes to having DEIB policies in place. About the survey Wolters Kluwer's 2023 Future Ready Lawyer Survey includes insights from 700 lawyers in law firms, corporate legal departments and business services firms across in the U.S., the Netherlands, Germany, France, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Poland and Belgium.

    "originBody": "In a groundbreaking moment, AI successfully negotiated a contract with...AI. There were no real stakes involved, since it was a just a live demo, but artificial intelligence company Luminance just provided a glimpse of what the future might look like for the legal industry. On Tuesday, the UK-based company's large language model (LLM) automated a contract negotiation \"without human intervention, between two opposing parties.\" Luminance claims this is the first completely AI-powered contract negotiation. The model was trained on 150 million legal documents to gain legal knowledge. Industry-specific LLMs are one of the latest evolutions from generalist models like ChatGPT. Expect to see more of these customized AI models cropping up. On Monday, OpenAI announced custom GPTs, which allow the user to build and train a model for their own purposes without any coding experience needed. GPTs are marketed towards ChatGPT users, but also ChatGPT Enterprise customers who use a private version of ChatGPT internally. The benefit of using a bespoke model is not only data privacy, but also focused expertise for companies looking to automate tasks. Luminance, which does this for legal contracts, is aiming to cut down on hours lawyers spend negotiating terms. Reviewing legal documents is a time-consuming process for lawyers. LLMs like Luminance's proprietary legal-focused model, Autopilot, are able to understand and analyze massive amounts of information in a matter of seconds. Automating the review of routine contracts like nondisclosure agreements could save legal professionals tons of time. \"By putting the day-to-day negotiations in the hands of an AI that is legally trained and understands your business, we’re freeing lawyers up to focus their creativity where it counts,\" said Jaeger Glucina, Luminance chief of staff, in the announcement. This doesn't mean there's zero oversight. According to CBNC's Ryan Browne, who saw the live demo, there's a live log highlighting changes to clauses and suggested changes, so lawyers can review the process and double-check it for errors.

Nov 8, 2023 Nov 8, 2023 Updated 5 hrs ago Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email Print Save While there is no national law on the books regulating the use of AI-generated content in political ads, some states, including Washington, Texas, and California, have adopted their own requirements. Yet even without widespread regulations or requirements surrounding the use of AI in ads, radio stations need to be aware of the use of the technology to generate false images of candidates for use in attack ads, broadcast law attorney David Oxenford warns in a recent blog post. While broadcasters “are insulated from liability for the content of ads from legally qualified candidates and their authorized committees, they can have liability for ads from non-candidate groups,” Oxenford writes. He says his firm regularly warns broadcasters about potential penalties for running non-candidate ads after the station has been notified that the ads are false or defamatory. “The ability to generate political ads using AI will only increase the risk of such ads, and the burdens on media companies to vet these ads,” he explains. Oxenford cites two recent cases where broadcasters have been sued for running non-candidate attack ads that involved “old-fashioned” editing techniques that took the words of candidates and edited them to make it sound like the candidate said something they did not actually say. Suits were brought against the stations that continued to air the ads even after being notified that they contained false statements. “Certainly, this same question can come up (and no doubt will come up) with images generated by AI technologies,” Oxenford writes. He says broadcasters will face challenges and questions surrounding AI-generated content used in political ads whether or not there is any movement for federal regulation of such uses of the technology. “Media companies need to be thinking carefully about these issues now to be prepared for what may come their way in 2024,” Oxenford concludes.

    "originBody": "OUT-LAW / YOUR DAILY NEED-TO-KNOW OUT-LAW ANALYSIS 2 min. read Experts weigh in on the future of AI and in-house legal work 08 Nov 2023, 10:38 am Share via email Share on social Follow Managed legal services A panel of experts recently convened to discuss the challenges facing in-house legal teams as they work to boost efficiency using artificial intelligence (AI) and other technology, while still providing quality legal advice to their respective organisations. The panel event, held at the 2023 Legal Geek tech conference, aimed to provide practical advice on specific scenarios that legal teams might encounter during their transformation journey. The chair, Alexandra Morris of Pinsent Masons Vario, was joined by legal digital transformation experts Ben Shilito from Fujitsu and Will Morris from Rolls-Royce. Asked how in-house teams could respond to the expectations of CEOs looking for efficiencies through technologies like generative AI, Shilito stressed the importance of setting realistic expectations. He added: “I think an informed CEO would want to see a considered and structured plan. That probably starts with a playful approach to AI now, with a view that in two- or three-years’ time there will be some genuine transformation and a real shift in how you operate using the technology.” Will Morris Group Deputy General Counsel, Rolls-Royce The legal industry is changing a lot, which is extremely exciting. Individuals need to be prepared to go on that journey, and take control of how they are going to develop fresh skillsets and adapt in the new world. Will Morris addressed concerns about how generative AI might affect individual team members. He emphasised the need for adaptability and a proactive approach to acquiring new skills, staying informed about technologies, and networking. “The legal industry is changing a lot, which is extremely exciting. Individuals need to be prepared to go on that journey, and take control of how they are going to develop fresh skillsets and adapt in the new world,” he added. Asked how in-house teams should approach choosing the right legal tech vendors for AI and other software, Shilito said: “Start by looking at what you have, especially if you're at the early stages of your transformation journey. Building goodwill and demonstrating value is crucial. As you progress, focus on vendors that integrate into your environment effectively to avoid stand-alone solutions.” Will Morris also discussed the challenges of improving a contract lifecycle management (CLM) system – which manages the creation, negotiation, and ongoing management of contracts – that is underperforming. “The first thing you should do is just adjust your mindset to focus the positives,” he said. “Examine what you have gained from it – such as improvements in how the team handles data, or anything you might have learned about partners involved in the project.” Morris added that reviewing the performance of projects in this way provides an opportunity to pivot to new technology as and when it evolves. The panel also discussed how in-house teams could address questions from senior stakeholders over the need for a digital-led legal transformation. Will Morris advised teams to emphasise the positive aspects of legal transformation and the importance of aligning it with the organisation's goals. “Legal transformation is about being obsessed with optimising how we work in the legal department. It is about enabling the legal department to do what it is really good at.” The conversation concluded with a discussion on talent strategy. Shilito envisioned a smaller, more agile legal team. He said: “I think the skill sets we look for will be more consultative in nature. I think we will value people who are strong communicators, very strong influencers. I think we will look for people who are really strategic thinkers and people who can operate in an ecosystem of technology. That is not necessarily what law schools teach at the moment, however, that is definitely a change.” Artificial Intelligence Employment & Reward Energy Financial Services Infrastructure Legal project management Real Estate Technology enabled innovation Technology sourcing United Kingdom Written by Alexandra Morris Account Director +44 7833 480 368 alexandra.morris@pinsentmasons.com View Profile Latest News 40 minutes ago UK to move ahead with Automated Vehicles Bill 1 hour ago VAT on UK commercial property transactions 1 hour ago Amazon online marketplace trade mark case comes before UK Supreme Court 3 hours ago ‘Lack of clarity’ persists over UK real estate net zero journey 12 hours ago Recent decisions highlight traditional owner consultation requirements for Australian offshore projects Don't miss a thing Sign-up to receive the latest news, insight and analysis direct to your e-mail inbox Sign Up You might also like Out-Law News Workers with invisible disabilities lacking adequate support at work, research shows Helen Corden tells HRNews about HR’s role in raising awareness of invisible disabilities in the workplace 25 May 2023 Out-Law News New UK flexible working rights a step closer Anne Sammon tells HRNews about the new rights contained in the Employment Relations (Flexible Working) Bill 25 May 2023 Out-Law News Record GDPR fine and order issued over data transfers Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has imposed a fine of €1.2 billion on Meta’s Irish subsidiary and ordered the company to stop sending the personal data of Facebook users in Europe to the US – beginning in five months’ time. 22 May 2023 Data, privacy & cyber Left OUT-LAW NEWS 19 January 2023 UK government plans to revamp holiday pay calculation for part-year workers Show me more OUT-LAW ANALYSIS 23 February 2021 Pensions disputes: managing member expectations paramount Show me more OUT-LAW ANALYSIS 1 February 2021 UK subsidy control post-Brexit: access to effective judicial remedies Show me more OUT-LAW NEWS 8 February 2016 'Steps of court' settlement was not negligent, court rules Show me more OUT-LAW NEWS 27 August 2020 'Vast majority' of companies not seeking to avoid tax Show me more OUT-LAW NEWS 19 March 2021 'World first' industrial decarbonisation strategy developed in the UK Show me more OUT-LAW ANALYSIS 21 September 2020 3D printing: UK product safety issues Show me more OUT-LAW NEWS 18 January 2021 5G potential for business highlighted in UK funding programme Show me more Right Sectors and what we do Sectors we work in Energy Financial Services Infrastructure Technology, Science & Industry Real Estate What we do Your assets Your company Your finance Your legal team and resource Your people Your risks and regulatory environment",
