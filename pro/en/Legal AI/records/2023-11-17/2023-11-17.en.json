The Special Committee on AI Tools & Resources, formed by President Scott Westheimer this summer, is proposing a series of rule revisions that, if approved, would be forwarded to the Supreme Court for final consideration. A proposed amendment to the final paragraph of the commentary to Bar Rule 4-1.1 (Competence) would make it clear that a lawyer’s understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the use of technology, “includes generative artificial intelligence.” A proposed amendment to Bar Rule 4-1.6 (Confidentiality of Information) would add a warning to a portion of the commentary subtitled “Acting Competently to Preserve Client Confidentiality.” The proposed sentence would state, “For example, a lawyer should be aware that generative artificial intelligence may create risks to the lawyer’s duty of confidentiality.” A proposed amendment to Bar Rule 4-5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants) would add a sentence to the first paragraph of the comment that would state, “A lawyer should also consider safeguards when assistants use technologies such as artificial intelligence” and within the first paragraph under the heading “Nonlawyers Outside the Firm,” would add “using generative artificial intelligence.” Another proposed amendment, to Bar Rule 4-5.1 (Responsibilities of Partners, Managers, and Supervisory Lawyers), would add a sentence to the second paragraph of the comment that states, “consider safeguards for the firm’s use of technologies such as generative artificial intelligence.” A staff analysis refers to an incident that has become a red flag for lawyers nationwide when the subject of artificial intelligence arises. It notes that “[l]awyers have improperly used generative AI” to their detriment. “For example, a lawyer has been sanctioned in New York for filing a legal document generated by AI (ChatGPT) that included citations that were made up by the generative AI application,” the analysis states. Bar rules “themselves are broad enough principles to address AI,” the analysis notes, “but commentary will alert Florida lawyers to their responsibilities regarding AI.” In other action, the Board will be asked to affirm or reverse a Professional Ethics Committee decision that a law firm “may not ethically identify a nonlawyer as the firm’s ‘Chief Executive Officer’ (CEO), despite limitations on the nonlawyer’s authority.” The inquiring firm asserted that the nonlawyer CEO would report to the firm’s supervising partner, will not have a policymaking function, will not supervise the practice of law, and will be paid a salary and bonuses unconnected to the law firm’s profits. “Further, the inquiry states that the ‘position will not be known to the public other than on the firm’s website’ but concedes that it would be included on ‘business cards and possibly other written material.’” The Professional Ethics Committee voted on June 23 to affirm a staff opinion that the use of the title by a nonlawyer would violate Bar Rule 4-8.6 (c) which provides that “[n]o person may serve as a partner, manager, director or executive officer of an authorized business entity that is engaged in the practice of law in Florida unless such person is legally qualified to render legal services in this state.” The inquiring firm is asking for the board review, arguing that “application of the rule is limited…to only those instances where the nonlawyer employee engages in a policymaking function.” In other business, the board will be asked to consider: Proposed amendments to the Preamble to Chapter 4, and Bar Rule 4-1.3 (Diligence), that would remove references to “zeal, zealous, and zealously” from commentary, and add a new comment explaining the historic change. The Real Property, Probate & Trust Law Section’s Professionalism and Ethics Committee has argued that “Z” words have been used to excuse bad lawyer behavior and that they carry a negative connotation. A proposed amendment to Bar Rule 4-4.4 (Respect for Rights of Third Persons). The Board Review Committee on Professional Ethics proposed amendment is meant to “expressly prohibit a lawyer from threatening to make or threatening to assist a client in making false social media posts as leverage in civil litigation,” according to a staff analysis. Comments to and potential adoption of Proposed Advisory Opinion 23-1. Proposed Advisory Opinion 23-1 addresses whether a Florida lawyer may be a passive investor in an “alternative business structure” that provides legal services in another state but does not maintain any presence in Florida or provide Florida legal services.

    "title": "Legal Industry Embraces Gen AI for Enhanced Research, Document Drafting, and Case Prediction",
    "originLink": "https://legaltechnology.com/2023/11/17/legal-it-latest-gen-ai-product-announcements/",
    "originBody": "Legal IT Latest: Gen AI product announcements Leave a Comment / AI & Data Analytics / By Caroline Hill - Editor-in-Chief / 17 November 2023 The past week has seen a number of significant generative AI product launches and announcements, here are the ones you need to be aware of. Advertisement Thomson Reuters on 15 November announced the debut of generative AI within its legal research platform Westlaw, which is available now to customers in the United States, leveraging its acquisition of Casetext earlier this year. The US-headquartered company also announced that it will be leveraging Casetext CoCounsel to launch an AI assistant that will be an interface across Thomson Reuters products. Thomson Reuters says that CoCounsel will be fully integrated within Westlaw Precision, Practical Law Dynamic Tool Set, Document Intelligence, and HighQ, and will continue to be available on the CoCounsel application. Advertisement “Thomson Reuters is redefining the way legal work is done by delivering a generative AI-based toolkit to enable attorneys to quickly gather deeper insights and deliver a better work product,” said David Wong, chief product officer at Thomson Reuters. “AI-Assisted Research on Westlaw Precision and CoCounsel Core provide the most comprehensive set of generative AI skills that attorneys can use across their research and workflow.” “Thomson Reuters is well positioned to deliver high-quality AI results because it has the largest, most up-to-date, and trustworthy legal research system in the world,” said Andrew Bedigian, counsel at Larson LLP. “The fact that AI-Assisted Research relies exclusively on Thomson Reuters vetted database should provide lawyers with confidence that the answer AI-Assisted Research is generating in response to attorney questions is going to be well supported.” LexisNexis Legal & Professional on 14 November announced the launch of two new generative AI services: Lexis Snapshot summaries, plus new gen AI capability within its Lexis Create document drafting tool. Snapshot summarises complaint filings for civil cases across the U.S. Federal District Court. It provides insights including the nature of the case, plaintiff and defendant information, alleged harm, and requested remedies. Lexis Create, meanwhile, now integrates directly with generative AI platform Lexis+ AI, meaning that users can leverage gen AI to help them with drafting documents in Microsoft Word. “We’ve seen unprecedented demand for Lexis+ AI, and early usage results reinforce how transformative LexisNexis generative AI technology is for our customers’ work,” said Sean Fitzpatrick, CEO of LexisNexis North America, UK, and Ireland. “We’re rapidly introducing generative AI capabilities across our entire legal product portfolio to accelerate our customers’ success and to deliver significant productivity, work quality, and value gains for their firms and institutions.” Greg Lambert, chief knowledge services officer at Jackson Walker said: “I have found the ability to prompt the legal research tool with a common language query to be extremely useful and the results have been very good. It gives me a great place to start.” To date, Lexis+ AI has been developed with commercial preview users from a number of global law firms, corporate legal departments, U.S. small law firms, and U.S. courts, however Lexis said this week that it plans to expand its commercial preview program to legal professionals in Canada, the UK, France, and Australia in 2024. In a further significant development, law school librarians and legal technology professors at all U.S. American Bar Association (ABA) accredited law schools will have access to Lexis+ AI. Contract automation provider Ontra this week announced the integration of OpenAI’s GPT-4 into its AI engine, Ontra Synapse. Synapse automates critical legal workflows for private markets firms. It combines industry-specific data with technology and human expertise. “Private markets firms are highly sophisticated and highly regulated. They demand responsible technology that evolves quickly and just works,” sai Eric Hawkins, Ontra’s SVP of Engineering. “Over the last several years, Ontra has developed proprietary AI models suited to a number of private markets legal applications. In the past year, we have been really impressed by OpenAI’s pace of innovation and the rate at which their models are improving. Building on GPT-4 with Ontra Synapse accelerates our ability to cover the breadth of legal contracts, freeing us up to focus our proprietary AI efforts on things like suggestions and recommendations that are only possible by building on our extensive repository of private markets data.” Leading legal automation platform Josef has officially launched gen AI compliance platform Josef Q after a six month proof of concept. The POC has involved the likes of Orrick, Wilson Sonsini’s SixFifty, Gunderson Dettmer, NYU and Cornell, and in-house teams at global corporates like Bupa, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Axel Springer, esports company Fnatic, and London fintech Liberis. Sam Flynn, COO and co-founder of Josef, says: “There is so much confusion out there. This proof of concept is unique, enabling Josef and our partners to learn from one another in an open environment. “We’ve spent six months learning how this transformative technology can actually deliver value today. The biggest opportunity that GenAI can help with? Clients and business don’t engage with complex but important legal and compliance content. This causes all sorts of problems, like junior lawyers spending up to 20% of their day answering FAQs, or businesses failing to comply with important regulations.” Global insurance giant Bupa’s first GenAI tool on Josef Q helps the marketing team understand regulatory requirements for health insurance advertising. Claire Nuske, head of legal operations, says that the tool won’t just save time because the legal team no longer has to answer FAQs. “It will also help ensure a smoother and more timely review process [for marketing materials]. This will help get us on the same page early on and help reduce the number of reviews a particular campaign needs to go through,” she said. And not gen AI but AI news of note, US legal prediction platform Pre/Dicta this week launched new capabilities, enabling legal teams to predict case outcomes across multiple types of motions and quantify case timelines. Pre/Dicta’s proprietary algorithms use artificial intelligence to uncover judicial patterns. We’re told that its predictions are 85% accurate for motions to dismiss across all 94 U.S. federal district courts. The newly released augmented capabilities provide insights into additional motions through AI data-profiling. These include the most consequential motions: summary judgment, class certification, and venue transfer. The platform contextualizes its motion analysis, comparing that with the judge’s decisions, as well as other judges within the same circuit and those with analogous biographical profiles. Pre/Dicta founder and former litigator Dan Rabinowitz said: “In the modern legal landscape, understanding the myriad of factors that influence judicial decision-making, and enabling AI to surface critical insights from billions of patterns, is a crucial advantage in any case.”",

    "title": "Legal Tech Startups See Strong Funding Despite European Tech Slump",
    "originLink": "https://sifted.eu/articles/legal-tech-startups-to-watch",
    "originBody": "Funding for legal tech startups hasn’t seen the kind of slump that’s hit European tech as a whole in 2023. The sector has raised $583m so far this year, according to Dealroom — falling by just a third on figures across the whole of 2022. Across European tech, those numbers have dropped by nearly half. Buoyed by the rapid rise of AI — which has seen many legal tech startups look to offer companies huge time and cost savings by streamlining laborious legal processes like drafting and reviewing documents — VCs have remained bullish. Advertisement But as we look towards 2024, which legal tech startups have VCs got their eyes on? Sifted spoke to Outward VC, Molten Ventures, Ventech and Cavalry Ventures to find out. Unsurprisingly, six out of the ten startups they nominated feature AI as part of their solution. D'Arcy Whelan, head of platform at Outward VC Outward VC is a London-based VC, which mostly backs fintech startups. Robin AI — UK Robin AI is a legal AI solution for finance, PE and M&A firms, which helps mid-market and enterprise companies save time with contract drafting and review. It's one of the early movers in this space to have gained significant traction, with in-house legal counsel in its core segments. Farillio — UK Farillio’s platform is designed to help SMEs access legal resources — like guides, videos and checklists — in an accessible and cost-effective way. Farillio is looking to partner with insurers, associations, telecoms and employee benefits schemes that hold the primary relationship with SME customers and who then embed Farillio in their offering. Hopkins — Germany Hopkins is a full-stack legal solution focusing on consumer rights — using algorithms to predict case outcomes and optimal negotiation strategies and providing a suite of tools to help lawyers. It operates in a highly fragmented space that is often plagued by poor customer service. There is a huge opportunity to become a dominant player in this space, capturing market share through high NPS and consumer trust. Beyond supporting individuals, Hopkins is also highly relevant for the growing demographic of the self-employed workforce. Martin Janicki, partner at Cavalry Ventures Cavalry Ventures is a Berlin-based VC, which mostly backs SaaS, fintech and cybersecurity startups. Henchman — Ghent Henchman offers AI-powered contract drafting software. The company connects to a law firm's repository of saved contracts and extracts all written clauses to make them seamlessly available to the lawyer via its co-pilot feature. Juro — UK London-based Juro provides an AI-enabled contract management solution. Customers can use its platform to manage contracts across their whole lifecycle, from drafting and reviewing to signing, tracking and storing. Its solution is aimed at companies’ general counsels and is also used by teams in domain-specific business functions such as HR or sales. LegalFly — Ghent LegalFly’s platform is a specialised legal AI co-pilot that helps lawyers review and understand contracts more quickly. The software also enables lawyers to generate new contract templates with much less effort and anonymise legal documents easily, so they can be shared without disclosing specific confidential content. Philip O’Reilly, head of venture operations at Molten Ventures Molten Ventures is a London-based, publicly listed VC and fund of funds. Orbital Witness — UK Orbital Witness focuses on automating the legal due diligence of property transactions. Its solution scrapes available data on property folios and uses machine learning together with proprietary risk models to produce diligence reports. The real estate market is one of the largest in the world but many legal workflows in this market are still relatively manual. As a result, completion of straightforward real estate transactions can take months. Orbital saves lawyers significant time, which not only speeds up property transactions but means lower fees for clients as well. RightHub — UK RightHub is an IP marketplace where consumers and producers can transact across a global IP network, and provides IP portfolio management services. The business raised a $15m seed round this year and as IP rights become even more important given the recent advances in AI, RightHub looks set to benefit from some industry tailwinds. Tero Mennander, general partner at Ventech Ventech is an early-stage Paris-based VC firm. IPRally — Finland IPRally is an AI-driven patent search and classification platform, which makes it easier for companies to find out if an invention has been made before, as well as understand the patent landscape. Advertisement Maigon — Sweden Maigon automates the legal document review process and helps its customers put more focus on strategic tasks rather than repetitive legal review routines. Maigon provides an AI contract review solution to screen agreements, answer legal questions and provide guidance for finalising contracts.",

    "originBody": "First AI item for lawyers approved by a regulatory agency, says bar official The guidelines are an ‘interim step’ as the technology develops The California Bar on Thursday approved new guidelines for lawyers using artificial intelligence, moving the state to the forefront on ethics guidance for using the technology in legal practice. “This would be, to my knowledge, the very first AI item that is specifically approved by a regulatory agency for lawyers,” Erika Doherty, program director for the bar’s Office of Professional Competence, said at a meeting of the California Bar’s Board of Trustees. “The benefit of that is that there is guidance available for lawyers as of right now,” she added. “The downside of that is that this is an evolving technology, and so it’s going to need to be continually updated.” The best practices guidance calls for lawyers to consider disclosing use of generative AI to their clients and to not charge hourly fees for time saved by using the tech tools. It also urges lawyers to ensure that humans are scrutinizing AI-generated outputs for inaccuracy and bias. The move marks an “interim step to provide guidance on this evolving technology while further rules and regulations are considered,” according to the professional conduct committee that drafted the guidance. The approved recommendations also include a call to work with state lawmakers and the California Supreme Court to reexamine the definition of unauthorized practice of law in light of generative AI. The technology has the potential to help close the access to justice gap, but “it could also create harm if self-represented individuals are relying on generative AI outputs that provide false information,” the professional conduct committee warned. Other state bars also are working on AI guidance. The Florida Bar’s ethics committee on Monday released a proposed opinion recommending that lawyers seek client consent before using AI systems if confidential information may be disclosed. The bar also called for oversight by human lawyers of the AI’s outputs, and addressed ethical billing practices by attorneys using generative AI. The Florida Bar proposed opinion is open for comment until January. — With assistance from Joyce Cutler Continue Reading To contact the reporter on this story: Isabel Gottlieb in New York at igottlieb@bloombergindustry.comTo contact the editors on this story: Chris Opfer at copfer@bloombergindustry.com, Alessandra Rafferty at arafferty@bloombergindustry.com Learn About Bloomberg Law AI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.

Altman said that it is something that needs to be taken seriously. Although it may be a challenge, it can still be managed. OpenAI's GPT-4 chatbot scored higher than most people who took a legal ethics exam required for prospective lawyers in nearly every state, according to a new study. The artificial intelligence software answered 74% of the questions correctly on a simulated Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam (MPRE), beating the estimated 68% average for human test takers nationwide, a report released on Thursday by LegalOn Technologies said. LegalOn Technologies sells AI software that reviews contracts, Reuters reported. \"Our study indicates that in the future it may be possible to develop AI to assist lawyers with ethical compliance and operate, where relevant, in alignment with lawyers’ professional responsibilities,\" the study authors wrote. MICROSOFT RESEARCHERS SAY GPT-4 SHOWS ‘SPARKS’ OF HUMAN-LEVEL PERFORMANCE FILE PHOTO: AI (Artificial Intelligence) letters and robot hand miniature in this illustration taken, June 23, 2023. (REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo / Reuters Photos) There is a growing body of research examining how AI will impact legal education and attorney licensure. An earlier study found that the previous version of GPT-4 earned passing but not stellar scores on law school final exams. Another more recent study found that GPT-4 can pass the bar exam. Earlier this month, researchers found that access to GPT-4 improved speed on legal writing assignments but didn’t bolster the quality of law students’ work. GPT-4 is generative AI tech released in March by startup OpenAI, a partner of Microsoft. It is a large multimodal model – meaning it can be fed both images and text to come up with answers – and reportedly \"exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.\" THOMSON REUTERS LAUNCHES GENERATIVE AI TOOLS FOR LEGAL RESEARCH Photo illustration showing ChatGPT and OpenAI research laboratory logo and inscription. (Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images / Getty Images) A spokesperson for the National Conference of Bar Examiners, which develops the MPRE, told Reuters it could not assess the study's claims that GPT-4 can pass its ethics test. \"The legal profession is always evolving in its use of technology, and will continue to do so,\" said National Conference spokesperson Sophie Martin. She added that \"attorneys have a unique set of skills that AI cannot currently match.\" YOUTUBE REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF AI-GENERATED CONTENT, ADDING LABELS CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman (R) arrives for an official State Dinner in honor of India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at the White House in Washington, DC, on June 22, 2023. (STEFANI REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images / Getty Images) Nearly every state except Wisconsin requires law students to pass the 60-multiple-choice MPRE before they are granted a license to practice. The test covers subjects including conflicts of interest, lawyer-client relationships and confidentiality. GPT-4 crushed the questions on conflict of interest, giving correct responses on 91% of those questions. It also scored 88% on questions about lawyer-client relationships. However, its answers on communications about legal services and safekeeping funds were less accurate, giving the correct response 71% and 72% of the time, respectively, Reuters reported. GOOGLE RELEASES ‘AI OPPORTUNITY AGENDA’ FOR POLICYMAKERS \"This research demonstrates for the first time that top-performing generative AI models can apply black-letter ethical rules as effectively as aspiring lawyers,\" the study said.

    "originBody": "METRO Legal Aid Society denounces union’s ‘antisemitic’ resolution amid ‘simmering’ internal turmoil By Social Links for Jorge Fitz-Gibbon Published Nov. 16, 2023, 12:14 p.m. ET MORE ON: ANTI-SEMITISM Columbia, Cooper Union among 7 schools under federal probe for antisemitism, Islamophobia: report ‘Doxxing truck’ blasts names and faces of Yale’s ‘leading antisemites’ near Ivy League campus The shameful nods to antisemitism from Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson IBM suspends ads on X after ads appeared next to pro-Nazi content: ‘Unacceptable situation’ A union representing Legal Aid Society lawyers has drafted a controversial resolution denouncing Israel’s “colonial apartheid occupation” of the Gaza Strip — which the non-profit swiftly slammed as “antisemitic.” The Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, part of Local 2325 of the United Auto Workers, is due to vote Friday on the resolution, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The three-page document, obtained by The Post, also opposes “any future military aid” to Israel and demands that the US cut ties with the Jewish state. However, the Legal Aid Society rejected the troubling resolution in a scathing rebuke. “The resolution is laden with coded antisemitic language and thinly veiled calls for the destruction of the State of Israel,” the firm said in a statement. “At a time when our attorneys and staff should be united in support of the people we serve, the resolution does not advance the legal interests of our clients, does not comport with our mission and values, and is divisive and hurtful,” the statement continued. 4 The Legal Aid Society on Thursday denounced an “antisemitic” resolution being considered by the firm’s union. Katie Orlinsky 4 The Oct. 7 sneak attack on Israel by radical Hamas terrorists has fueled a national divide in the US — and inside the Legal Aid Society, The Post has learned. AP The Legal Aid Society, which has “a longstanding policy against taking positions on international political events,” added that it “condemns any expression of antisemitism and will never support such a resolution.” The controversial resolution has already divided lawyers and staffers inside the non-profit — with one attorney this week sending colleagues a profanity-laced email criticizing those who support Israel’s retaliation following the surprise Oct. 7 attack by Hamas terrorists, which killed 1,200 people. “Being a public defender should inherently mean you’re against f—ing genocide,” lawyer Niteka Raina wrote in a ranting email to coworkers obtained by The Post. “But I guess legal aid is so desperate for attorneys the organization just lets anyone stay these days, oof. “Ya dumbf—k genocide supporters,” Raina comtinued. “The united states and israel are both settler-colonial entities and both shouldn’t f—ing exist, ya dips—ts.”” 4 Niteka Raina, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society, sent colleagues a profanity-laced email condemning those who support Israel. Raina and the union did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a separate statement, the Legal Aid Society said that Raina “sent this e-mail in her union capacity on a union mailing list,” and “strongly condemns any use of vitriolic, offensive and antisemitic language.” Meanwhile, others inside the non-profit legal services provider said the statement denouncing the pending union resolution doesn’t go far enough — and won’t quell the mounting tension. 4 A three-page resolution denouncing Israel is due to be voted on Friday by the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, the union for lefty lawyers at the public defender firm. “Antisemitism has been simmering under the surface at Legal Aid for some time,” one staffer, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Post. “The change after the events of Oct. 7 is that antisemitism hasn’t just risen to the surface but it has been blown out of the water with this resolution. “The question is, while management has made an outward statement, will they look inward and take concrete steps to address the issue at the firm?” FILED UNDER anti-semitism Israel war 2023 lawyers palestinians unions 11/16/23 WHAT TO SHOP NOW The best treats to pick up from Cheryl's Cookies for holiday gifting and entertaining in 2023 Crate & Barrel opened a new flagship store in NYC's Flatiron district, and we're *very* jazzed about it Celebrate the holidays with Harry & David gifts for everyone on your list Find the faux Christmas tree of your dreams — on sale ahead of Black Friday The best retailers with early Black Friday sales available *right now*, plus expert shopping tips TRENDING NOW ON NYPOST.COM THIS STORY HAS BEEN SHARED 23,322 TIMES. 23,322 Meet the American millionaire Marxists funding anti-Israel rallies THIS STORY HAS BEEN SHARED 18,245 TIMES. 18,245 Braves trade five, including former All-Star, to White Sox for reliever THIS STORY HAS BEEN SHARED 18,136 TIMES. 18,136 Carnival Cruise Line slaps Texas mom with lifetime ban after she brought CBD 'sleep tight' gummies on ship COLUMNISTS Steve Cuozzo Good riddance scooters — but e-bikes in NYC are about to get even worse Jennifer Gould NYC couple lists 'cottage in the sky' penthouse for $2.95M SEE ALL COLUMNISTS PAGE SIX STYLE NOW ON PAGE SIX SEE ALL VIDEO",
