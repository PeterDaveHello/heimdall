These factors have collectively served as a barrier to rapid adoption of new technologies, unlike other industries that have embraced innovation more readily. The complexity and volume of legal data The scope of data that legal professionals must navigate is vast, necessitating a data management solution that not only organizes this information but also interprets it. This complexity has historically deterred the use of technology because tools to organize and interpret it were simply unavailable. However, the natural language capabilities of generative artificial intelligence (AI) offer unprecedented advantages for distilling information and synthesizing actionable insights. The nature of legal work At its core, legal work demands meticulous attention to detail, extensive research and nuanced argumentation — tasks that are both intellectually rigorous and time-consuming. Generative AI has the potential to dramatically accelerate completion of these tasks without diluting quality. Workload distribution The traditional law firm hierarchy often results in a bottleneck in which senior partners oversee junior associates performing labor-intensive research and document drafting. Generative AI offers the potential to redistribute workloads in ways that can liberate junior associates to conduct more complex, value-added work. Evolving client expectations The market’s increasing demand for transparency and efficiency puts law firms under pressure to adapt. Generative AI, with its ability to simplify complex legal concepts and automate routine client-facing services, aligns with these new market demands and thereby makes possible greater accessibility and consumer engagement.

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF THE FLORIDA BAR Proposed Advisory Opinion 24-1 [DATE] The Florida Bar Board of Governors has directed the Board Review Committee on Professional Ethics to issue an opinion regarding lawyers’ use of generative artificial intelligence (“AI”). The release of ChatGPT-3 in November 2022 prompted wide-ranging debates regarding lawyers’ use of generative AI in the practice of law. While it is impossible to determine the impact generative AI will have on the legal profession, this opinion is intended to provide guidance to Florida Bar members regarding some of the ethical implications of these new programs. Generative AI are “deep-learning models” that compile data “to generate statistically probable outputs when prompted.” IBM, What is generative AI?, (April 20, 2023), https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI (last visited 11/09/2023). Generative AI can create original images, analyze documents, and draft briefs based on written prompts. Often, these programs rely on large language models. The datasets utilized by generative AI large language models can include billions of parameters making it virtually impossible to determine how a program came to a specific result. Tsedel Neeley, 8 Questions About Using AI Responsibly, Answered, Harv. Bus. Rev. (May 9, 2023). While generative AI may have the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of a lawyer’s practice, it can also pose a variety of ethical concerns. Among other pitfalls, lawyers are quickly learning that generative AI can “hallucinate” or create “inaccurate answers that sound convincing.” Matt Reynolds, vLex releases new generative AI legal assistant, A.B.A. J. (Oct. 17, 2023), https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/vlex-releases-new-generative-ai-legal-assistant (last visited 11/09/2023). In one particular incident, a federal judge sanctioned two unwary lawyers and their law firm following their use of false citations created by generative AI. Mata v. Avianca, 22-cv-1461, 2023 WL 4114965, at 17 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2023). Even so, the judge’s opinion explicitly acknowledges that “[t]echnological advances are commonplace and there is nothing inherently improper about using a reliable artificial intelligence tool for assistance.” Id. at 1. Due to these concerns, lawyers using generative AI must take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality of client information, develop policies for the reasonable oversight of generative AI use, ensure fees and costs are reasonable, and comply with applicable ethics and advertising regulations. Confidentiality A lawyer’s first responsibility when using generative AI should be the protection of the confidentiality of the client’s information as required by Rule 4-1.6 of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar. The ethical duty of confidentiality is broad in its scope and applies to all information learned during a client’s representation, regardless of its source. Rule 4-1.6, Comment. Absent the client’s informed consent or an exception permitting disclosure, a lawyer may not reveal the information. In practice, the most common exception is found in subdivision (c)(1), which permits disclosure to the extent reasonably necessary to “serve the client’s interest unless it is information the client specifically requires not to be disclosed[.]” Rule 4-1.6(c)(1). Nonetheless, it is recommended that a lawyer obtain the affected client’s informed consent prior to utilizing a third-party generative AI program if the utilization would involve the disclosure of any confidential information. Rule 4-1.6(e) also requires a lawyer to “make reasonable efforts to prevent the inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, information relating to the client’s representation.” Further, a lawyer’s duty of competence requires “an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with the use of technology[.]” Rule 4-1.1, Comment. When using a third-party generative AI program, lawyers must sufficiently understand the technology to satisfy their ethical obligations. For generative AI, this specifically includes knowledge of whether the program is “self-learning.” A generative AI that is “self-learning” continues to develop its responses as it receives additional inputs and adds those inputs to its existing parameters. Neeley, supra n. 2. Use of a “self-learning” generative AI raises the possibility that a client’s information may be stored within the program and revealed in response to future inquiries by third parties. Existing ethics opinions relating to cloud computing, electronic storage disposal, remote paralegal services, and metadata have addressed the duties of confidentiality and competence to prior technological innovations and are particularly instructive. In its discussion of cloud computing resources, Florida Ethics Opinion 12-3 cites to New York State Bar Ethics Opinion 842 and Iowa Ethics Opinion 11-01 to conclude that a lawyer should: Ensure that the provider has an obligation to preserve the confidentiality and security of information, that the obligation is enforceable, and that the provider will notify the lawyer in the event of a breach or service of process requiring the production of client information; Investigate the provider’s reputation, security measures, and policies, including any limitations on the provider’s liability; and Determine whether the provider retains information submitted by the lawyer before and after the discontinuation of services or asserts proprietary rights to the information. While the opinions were developed to address cloud computing, these recommendations are equally applicable to a lawyer’s use of third-party generative AI when dealing with confidential information. Florida Ethics Opinion 10-2 discusses the maintenance and disposition of electronic devices that contain storage media and provides that a lawyer’s duties extend from the lawyer’s initial receipt of the device through the device’s disposition, “including after it leaves the control of the lawyer.” Opinion 10-2 goes on to reference a lawyer’s duty of supervision and to express that this duty “extends not only to the lawyer’s own employees but over entities outside the lawyer’s firm with whom the lawyer contracts[.]” Id. Florida Ethics Opinion 07-2 notes that a lawyer should only allow an overseas paralegal provider access to “information necessary to complete the work for the particular client” and “should provide no access to information about other clients of the firm.” Additionally, while “[t]he requirement for informed consent from a client should be generally commensurate with the degree of risk involved[,]” including “whether a client would reasonably expect the lawyer or law firm to personally handle the matter and whether the non-lawyers will have more than a limited role in the provision of the services.” Id. Again, this guidance seems equally applicable to a lawyer’s use of generative AI. Finally, Florida Ethics Opinion 06-2 provides that a lawyer should take reasonable steps to safeguard the confidentiality of electronic communications, including the metadata attached to those communications, and that the recipient should not attempt to obtain metadata information that they know or reasonably should know is not intended for the recipient. In the event that the recipient inadvertently receives metadata information, the recipient must “promptly notify the sender,” as is required by Rule 4-4.4(b). Similarly, a lawyer using generative AI should take reasonable precautions to avoid the inadvertent disclosure of confidential information and should not attempt to access information previously provided to the generative AI by other lawyers. It should be noted that confidentiality concerns may be mitigated by use of an inhouse generative AI rather than an outside generative AI where the data is hosted and stored by a third-party. If the use of a generative AI program does not involve the disclosure of confidential information to a third-party, a lawyer is not required to obtain a client’s informed consent pursuant to Rule 4-1.6. Oversight of Generative AI While Rule 4-5.3(a) defines a nonlawyer assistant as a “a person,” many of the standards applicable to nonlawyer assistants provide useful guidance for a lawyer’s use of generative AI. First, just as a lawyer must make reasonable efforts to ensure that a law firm has policies to reasonably assure that the conduct of a nonlawyer assistant is compatible with the lawyer’s own professional obligations, a lawyer must do the same for generative AI. Lawyers who rely on generative AI for research, drafting, communication, and client intake risk many of the same perils as those who have relied on inexperienced or overconfident nonlawyer assistants. Second, a lawyer must always review the work product of a generative AI just as the lawyer must do so for the work of nonlawyer assistants such as paralegals. Lawyers are ultimately responsible for the work product that they create regardless of whether that work product was originally drafted or researched by a nonlawyer or generative AI. Functionally, this means a lawyer must verify the accuracy and sufficiency of all research performed by generative AI. The failure to do so can lead to violations of the lawyer’s duties of competence (Rule 4-1.1), avoidance of frivolous claims and contentions (Rule 4-3.1), candor to the tribunal (Rule 4-3.3), and truthfulness to others (Rule 4-4.1), in addition to sanctions that may be imposed by a tribunal against the lawyer and the lawyer’s client. Third, these duties apply to nonlawyers “both within and outside of the law firm.” ABA Comm. on Ethics and Prof’l Responsibility, Formal Op. 498 (2021); see Fla. Ethics Op. 07-2. The fact that a generative AI is managed and operated by a third-party does not obviate the need to ensure that its actions are consistent with the lawyer’s own professional and ethical obligations. Further, a lawyer should carefully consider what functions may ethically be delegated to generative AI. Existing ethics opinions have identified tasks that a lawyer may or may not delegate to nonlawyer assistants and are instructive. First and foremost, a lawyer may not delegate to generative AI any act that could constitute the practice of law such as the negotiation of claims or any other function that requires a lawyer’s personal judgment and participation. Florida Ethics Opinion 88-6 notes that, while nonlawyers may conduct the initial interview with a prospective client, they must: Clearly identify their nonlawyer status to the prospective client; Limit questions to the purpose of obtaining factual information from the prospective client; and Not offer any legal advice concerning the prospective client’s matter or the representation agreement and refer any legal questions back to the lawyer. This guidance is especially useful as law firms increasingly utilize website chatbots for client intake. While generative AI may make these interactions seem more personable, it presents additional risks, including that a prospective client relationship or even a lawyer-client relationship has been created without the lawyer’s knowledge. The Comment to Rule 4-1.18 (Duties to Prospective Client) explains what constitutes a consultation: A person becomes a prospective client by consulting with a lawyer about the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship with respect to a matter. Whether communications, including written, oral, or electronic communications, constitute a consultation depends on the circumstances. For example, a consultation is likely to have occurred if a lawyer, either in person or through the lawyer’s advertising in any medium, specifically requests or invites the submission of information about a potential representation without clear and reasonably understandable warnings and cautionary statements that limit the lawyer’s obligations, and a person provides information in response. In contrast, a consultation does not occur if a person provides information to a lawyer in response to advertising that merely describes the lawyer’s education, experience, areas of practice, and contact information, or provides legal information of general interest. A person who communicates information unilaterally to a lawyer, without any reasonable expectation that the lawyer is willing to discuss the possibility of forming a client-lawyer relationship, is not a “prospective client” within the meaning of subdivision (a). Similarly, the existence of a lawyer-client relationship traditionally depends on the subjective reasonable belief of the client regardless of the lawyer’s intent. Bartholomew v. Bartholomew, 611 So. 2d 85, 86 (Fla. 2d DCA 1992). For these reasons, a lawyer should be wary of utilizing an overly welcoming generative AI chatbot that may provide legal advice, fail to immediately identify itself as a chatbot, or fail to include clear and reasonably understandable disclaimers limiting the lawyer’s obligations. Just as with nonlawyer staff, a lawyer should not instruct or encourage a client to rely solely on the “work product” of generative AI, such as due diligence reports, without the lawyer’s own personal review of that work product. Legal Fees and Costs Rule 4-1.5(a) prohibits lawyers from charging, collecting, or agreeing to fees or costs that are illegal or clearly excessive while subdivision (b) provides a list of factors to consider when determining whether a fee or cost is reasonable. A lawyer must communicate the basis for fees and costs to a client and it is preferable that the lawyer do so in writing. Rule 4-1.5(e). Contingent fees and fees that are nonrefundable in any part must be explained in writing. Rule 4-1.5(e); Rule 4-1.5(f)(2). Regarding costs, a lawyer may only ethically charge a client for the actual costs incurred on the individual client’s behalf and must not duplicate charges that are already accounted for in the lawyer’s overhead. See The Florida Bar v. Carlon, 820 So. 2d 891, 899 (Fla. 2002) (lawyer sanctioned for violations including a $500.00 flat administrative charge to each client’s file); ABA Comm. on Ethics and Prof’l Responsibility, Formal Op. 93-379 (1993) (lawyer should only charge clients for costs that reasonably reflect the lawyer’s actual costs); Rule 4-1.5(h) (lawyers accepting payment via a credit plan may only charge the actual cost imposed on the transaction by the credit plan). Regarding fees, a lawyer may not ethically engage in any billing practices that duplicate charges or that falsely inflate the lawyer’s billable hours. Though generative AI programs may make a lawyer’s work more efficient, this increase in efficiency must not result in falsely inflated claims of time. In the alternative, lawyers may want to consider adopting contingent fee arrangements or flat billing rates for specific services so that the benefits of increased efficiency accrue to the lawyer and client alike. While a lawyer may separately itemize activities like paralegal research performed by nonlawyer personnel, the lawyer should not do so if those charges are already accounted for in the lawyer’s overhead. Fla. Ethics Op. 76-33 & 76-38, Consolidated. In the alternative, the lawyer may need to consider crediting the nonlawyer time against the lawyer’s own fees. Id. Florida Ethics Opinion 07-2 discusses the outsourcing of paralegal services in contingent fee matters and explains: The law firm may charge a client the actual cost of the overseas provider [of paralegal services], unless the charge would normally be covered as overhead. However, in a contingent fee case, it would be improper to charge separately for work that is usually otherwise accomplished by a client’s own attorney and incorporated into the standard fee paid to the attorney, even if that cost is paid to a third party provider. Additionally, a lawyer should have sufficient general knowledge to be capable of providing competent representation. See, e.g., Att’y Grievance Comm’n of Maryland v. Manger, 913 A.2d 1 (Md. 2006). “While it may be appropriate to charge a client for case-specific research or familiarization with a unique issue involved in a case, general education or background research should not be charged to the client.” Id. at 5. In the context of generative AI, these standards require a lawyer to inform a client, preferably in writing, of the lawyer’s intent to charge a client the actual cost of using generative AI. In all instances, the lawyer must ensure that the charges are reasonable and are not duplicative. If a lawyer is unable to determine the actual cost associated with a particular client’s matter, the lawyer may not ethically prorate the periodic charges of the generative AI and instead should account for those charges as overhead. Finally, while a lawyer may charge a client for the reasonable time spent for case-specific research and drafting when using generative AI, the lawyer should be careful not to charge for the time spent developing minimal competence in the use of generative AI. Lawyer Advertising The advertising rules in Subchapter 4-7 of the Rules Regulating The Florida Bar include prohibitions on misleading content and unduly manipulative or intrusive advertisements. Rule 4-7.13 prohibits a lawyer from engaging in advertising that is deceptive or inherently misleading. More specifically, subdivision (b) includes prohibitions on: (3) comparisons of lawyers or statements, words, or phrases that characterize a lawyer’s or law firm’s skills, experience, reputation, or record, unless the characterization is objectively verifiable; [and] …. (5) [use of] a voice or image that creates the erroneous impression that the person speaking or shown is the advertising lawyer or a lawyer or employee of the advertising firm unless the advertisement contains a clear and conspicuous disclaimer that the person is not an employee or member of the law firm[.] As noted above, a lawyer should be careful when using a generative AI chatbot for advertising and intake purposes as the lawyer will be ultimately responsible in the event the chatbot provides misleading information to prospective clients or communicates in a manner that is inappropriately intrusive or coercive. To avoid confusion, a lawyer should inform prospective clients that they are communicating with an AI program and not with a lawyer or law firm employee. Additionally, while many visitors to a lawyer’s website voluntarily seek information regarding the lawyer’s services, a lawyer should consider including screening questions that limit the chatbot’s communications if a person is already represented by another lawyer. Lawyers may advertise their use of generative AI but cannot claim their generative AI is superior to those used by other lawyers or law firms unless the lawyer’s claims are objectively verifiable. Whether a particular claim is capable of objective verification is a factual question that must be made on a case-by-case basis. Conclusion In sum, a lawyer may ethically utilize generative AI technologies but only to the extent that the lawyer can reasonably guarantee compliance with the lawyer’s ethical obligations. These obligations include the duties of confidentiality, avoidance of frivolous claims and contentions, candor to the tribunal, truthfulness in statements to others, avoidance of clearly excessive fees and costs, and compliance with restrictions on advertising for legal services. Lawyers should be cognizant that generative AI is still in its infancy and that these ethical concerns should not be treated as an exhaustive list. Rather, lawyers should continue to develop competency in their use of new technologies and the risks and benefits inherent in those technologies.

    "originLink": "https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/cleary-leader-confident-amid-law-firm-frothiness-ai-adoption",
    "originBody": "Cleary managing partner targets top 20 in revenue ranking Sees generative AI as leveling playing field for smaller firms Cleary Gottlieb’s leader wants the law firm to significantly boost its revenue without drastically growing its headcount or tinkering with its single-tier partner pay system. Michael Gerstenzang’s ambitious goal is to land Cleary among the Top 20 firms by gross revenue, a feat that would require a leap of roughly $500 million from last year. That would mean a 36% gain from last year, when Cleary ranked No. 30 among US firms in gross revenue. His push for revenue growth comes at a time when some firms are taking drastic steps to hire top talent, leading to a lateral partner market Gerstenzang described as experiencing “incredible frothiness.” “Within the last year you’ve had some eye-popping numbers,” Gerstenzang said in an interview, referring to compensation packages for partners jumping firms. “It’s a small subset of the firms involved and the individual partners involved where they are moving for truly staggering amounts of money.” The lateral market is “in the storyline of everyone’s head,” said Gerstenzang. “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Gerstenzang did not mention specific hires, but a trio of Kirkland & Ellis partners that joined Paul Weiss this summer reportedly could each earn upward of $20 million annually. The Wall Street firm is said to be considering creating a nonequity partner tier that would free up more cash, following similar moves by top firms such as Cravath, Swaine & Moore in recent years. Culture Not ‘Ruthless” Best known for its M&A work and high-end global antitrust practice, Cleary Gottlieb is among the country’s most profitable firms. Its partners earned $4.3 million on average in 2022, according to Am Law data. Gerstenzang, a private investment funds lawyer, has been Cleary’s managing partner since 2017. Michael Gerstenzang of Cleary Gottlieb The firm has 196 partners, all of whom share in its profits. The partner count is nearly double that of some exclusive firms, like Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz or Cravath, Swaine & Moore. They tally is similar to Manhattan’s Sullivan & Cromwell, Debevoise & Plimpton, and Milbank LLP. Many of its massive competitors operate under a different model, leveraging large ranks of nonequity partners. The equity partner rolls at Kirkland & Ellis and Latham & Watkins, two of the world’s largest firms, are more than twice that of Cleary. Kirkland and Latham also employ hundreds of nonequity partners. Those firms report higher profits per equity partner than Cleary, but they lag behind when it comes to all-partner compensation. The metric provides an average of what all lawyers with a partner title earn, providing a comparison across firms that have nonequity partners and those with equity-only tiers. Cleary ranks No. 9 in average compensation for all partners and No. 15 when ranked by profits per equity partner. The firm in 2020 opted against adopting a nonequity tier, Gerstenzang said. It’s a model adopted by some competitors in an attempt to better compensate their highest earners. Cleary decided its “culture” wasn’t prepared to be as “disciplined or ruthless” to manage out non-performing income partners, he said. It also had concerns a large non-equity tier could deteriorate its reputation for consistent, high quality work across its practices. Still, he said the financial data show “how successful managing a big pool of nonequity partners can be.” ”I want us to be higher in everything, but we also have to recognize there are different models,” he said. “I’m not that worried about the competition for talent given where we are today. We need to do better, we can do better.” Leveraging AI Gerstenzang is confident that AI will help him leverage a smaller pool of lawyers to compete with bigger firms. He’s been closely watching the advances of generative AI in law firms, he said, and Cleary is testing training models on the firm’s datasets. It launched a subsidiary technology and project development incubator, ClearyX, in 2020. “I was super worried that if you have $6 billion in revenue you have a lot of money to invest in technology,” he said. “Generative AI has made me worry about that much less. Because generative AI is—relatively speaking—inexpensive, and I don’t need to develop it myself.” Over time, generative AI will reduce the benefit of huge numbers of lawyers using “brute force” on projects, Gerstenzang said. He’s “hopeful” it also will help law firms move away from the billable hour, which he said often undervalues lawyers’ work for clients. “It will be beneficial for clients and law firms to shift toward value-based billing,” he said. “Generative AI is going to be helpful to move us toward that model.” Continue Reading To contact the reporter on this story: Roy Strom in Chicago at rstrom@bloomberglaw.com To contact the editors responsible for this story: Chris Opfer at copfer@bloombergindustry.com; John Hughes at jhughes@bloombergindustry.com; Alessandra Rafferty at arafferty@bloombergindustry.com Learn About Bloomberg Law AI-powered legal analytics, workflow tools and premium legal & business news.

    "title": "AI's Impact on the Legal Sector: Balancing Automation and Human Input",
    "originLink": "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231113923186/en/BrightHR-Explores-AI%E2%80%99s-Impact-on-the-Legal-Sector",
    "originBody": "BrightHR Explores AI’s Impact on the Legal Sector November 13, 2023 07:33 AM Eastern Standard Time MANCHESTER, England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As AI continues to evolve at an alarming rate, threatening to change the world of work as we know it, another development has made headlines. Luminance, a UK company specialising in AI for the legal profession, is set to launch a new tool that fully automates contract negotiation. “When implemented correctly, AI can help businesses streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer experience. So, the decision to embrace AI in the world of work is generally a positive one. ” Post this It aims to slash the time needed for legal professionals to pore over tedious and lengthy contract work. Demonstrations and tests have shown the tool can capably handle contract negotiations—even when pitching AI against each other in contesting contracts—in a matter of minutes. This raises the question: can AI replace legal ‘grunt work’? Many industries are already benefitting from using AI to replace their menial tasks. And now it seems the legal sector could be following suit… But the issue remains as to whether this sort of tech can be relied on completely. Alastair Brown, Chief Technology Officer at BrightHR, weighs in on the subject: “When implemented correctly, AI can help businesses streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer experience. So, the decision to embrace AI in the world of work is generally a positive one. “For instance, our AI-powered question and answer tool has given business’ the equivalent of over one million minutes of free advice in the last 12 months alone. And that equates to around four million saved in solicitors’ fees. It’s a brilliant tool to secure accurate, qualified information in response to those day-to-day questions that arise from business owners, and quickly—something that’s of vital importance in today’s fast-paced world that shows no signs of slowing. “Our decision to roll out AI is largely down to the fact that it frees our advisors up to spend more time on the emotive areas of the law that AI has not yet mastered the nuances of. Those high-risk topics, those situations fraught with emotion, require human experience to explore the vulnerabilities and interpretations and understanding of circumstances that AI might not yet be able to bring together. Speaking with an experienced advisor helps settle nerves, gives that reassurance that we’re acting in their best interest, and that our actions are empathic rather than solely data-driven. “We recognise our clients often want to speak to a real person, understanding of all these things. And that’s a notion mirrored by the findings of a recent study by The Conversation where respondents showed the most support for a 75% human to 25% AI decision-making collaboration, or a 50%-50% split, suggesting that there is absolutely a need for AI to play a part in the modern-day world of work—but this still must be supplemented by human input. “One recent case that highlights this is the New York lawyer with 30 years of experience who earlier this year, employed AI to perform legal research for a lawsuit against an airline. It was revealed that six of the cases cited to convince the judge to proceed with the case were in fact completely fabricated by ChatGPT. And just last month, hip hop group Fugees’ rapper accused his lawyer’s use of AI of tanking his case when several references made in the closing statement were incorrect. “Though Luminance tools have been trained using 150 million legal documents, and our own BrightLightning trained using over 50 years’ of employment law experience instead of public internet content like ChatGPT, these cases still serve a stark reminder of the complications that can arise. “This brings into consideration accountability. When humans make a mistake, there is generally accountability taken by that individual and perhaps their employer. But when we’re relying on machines for information, the question is: where does this accountability lie? This alone highlights the need for AI and human input to work in tandem, not least to provide a layer of accountability. “And let’s not forget the issues surrounding bias. All humans have some form of implicit bias, but we’re generally becoming increasingly more aware of this and the need to challenge it. AI, on the other hand, was recently determined to display stronger racial and gender bias than people in a recent report by Bloomberg. Why? Because AI is trained on data that is likely to be incomplete or biased. Whilst AI can dole out advice and information, it does not have the room for the consideration and interpretation that humans do. “Using AI-powered tools to obtain advice can be a real lifesaver when it comes to reducing stress and saving time. However, it's important to remember that when it comes to legal matters, it's always best to consult with a qualified professional to ensure accuracy, avoid any potential legal issues, and ensure the best outcome for your business. “So, will AI development mean legal roles are replaced by robots? Not likely. It’s more a case of roles evolving, as they always do with time. Just as machines have changed the face of manufacturing, there is now a need for human roles to manage them.” Contacts Alexandra Poole Alexandra.poole@brighthr.com 07977744418",

    "originBody": "Home |Insights |European Data Protection Supervisor Releases New Opinion on the EU’s Proposed AI Act Print PDF Link Share LinkedIn Twitter/X European Data Protection Supervisor Releases New Opinion on the EU’s Proposed AI Act Client Alert4 min read11.13.23 On October 24, 2023, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), which is the supervisory authority for the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies (EUIs), published a new opinion on the widely discussed proposal for an EU Regulation laying down harmonized rules on artificial intelligence (commonly known as the AI Act Proposal). Although the EDPS does not supervise the private sector, it plays an influential role in both the European and global regulatory community and this new opinion is, thus, a valuable addition to the current legislative debate. The AI Act Proposal was published by the European Commission in April 2021 with a view to establishing harmonized rules for AI within the EU. In short, the purpose of this AI Act is to regulate the development and use of AI-based systems, based on the risks they entail. The EDPS previously issued a joint opinion in collaboration with the European Data Protection Board (in June 2021). However, this new opinion is solely the EDPS’ initiative, and it aims to provide further recommendations to the EU co-legislators as the negotiations on the AI Act Proposal enter their final stage. The opinion focuses on a number of institutional, legal and technical aspects related to the role and tasks of the EDPS as future AI supervisor of the EUIs. Key takeaways: The EDPS supports the establishment of a legal framework for AI systems based on the EU values as enshrined in both the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights; The EDPS confirms the “red lines” set out in the earlier EDPB-EDPS joint opinion, stating that several uses of AI should be prohibited because they pose unacceptable risks to fundamental rights – including the use of AI for social scoring, categorizing individuals from biometrics, and individual risk assessments for law enforcement purposes; The new opinion also reiterates the view that national Data Protection Authorities should be designated as the national supervisory authorities, on account of their expertise in AI-related legislation. Simultaneously, the EDPS emphasizes the need for cooperation between these national authorities and other oversight authorities to ensure that AI systems are trustworthy, safe, and compliant with EU legislation in the field of their deployment; The EDPS stresses the need for clarity with regards to “high-risk AI systems” and regarding other notions, such as “provider” and “development”; The EDPS emphasizes that AI systems already in use at the date of applicability of the AI Act should not be exempted from its scope and should be required to comply with the AI Act requirements from its date of applicability; The EDPS welcomes its various proposed roles as notified body in the context of pre-market control (conformity assessment), market surveillance authority in the context of post-market control, and competent authority for the supervision of the development, provision or use of AI systems by EUIs; The EDPS emphasizes that the proposed AI Office, a new EU body that would support the harmonized application of the AI Act, must be independent if it is to strengthen enforcement in the EU and prevent providers of AI systems from engaging in ‘forum shopping’. It highlights the need to strengthen cooperation between the AI office and the EDPS in its role of AI supervisor. It expresses regret that it currently lacks voting rights on the AI Office’s management board, while national supervisory authorities have these voting rights; The EDPS recommends introducing the right to lodge a complaint before the competent supervisory authority, and to an effective judicial remedy against a decision of the authority before which a complaint has been brought (specifying the competences of the EDPS as a supervisory authority); and finally, The EDPS suggests providing, notably in case of the use of high-risk AI systems, the right to obtain human intervention and to contest the output of the decision-making, as well as a right to an explanation from the deployer of the AI system regarding any decisions significantly affecting the user. In short, with its recent opinion, the EDPS aims to provide more specific advice as to how its tasks, duties and powers set out in the AI Act could be further clarified, as well as further recommendations on how to ensure effective enforcement of the AI Act through a true “European approach”. We will continue to monitor the developments in this matter and keep you informed of any further updates. We would like to thank Arthur Focquet, Associate, for his contribution to this alert.
