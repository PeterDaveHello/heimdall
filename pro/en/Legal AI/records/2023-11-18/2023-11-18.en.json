Photo: Michael Nigro/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images Five groups providing public defender services in New York City are cracking down on speech about Palestine. Leadership at the groups are pushing back on statements or internal communications that reference the siege on Gaza, and at least one staffer has been forced to resign. Two of the organizations sent cease-and-desist letters to union shops considering resolutions calling for a ceasefire. Another group called staffers into meetings with human resources for using work channels to share links about Palestine and proposing to do fundraising for the Palestine Children’s Relief Fund in lieu of an annual holiday party. Management at several of the offices said statements on Gaza under consideration by their unions were jeopardizing funding. Pro-Israel activists launched a petition to defund the Bronx Defenders after its union issued a statement opposing Israel’s “genocidal intent in Gaza.” Public defender offices across the country are already severely underfunded. While most rely heavily on public funding, many also receive support from private institutions, including major law firms. Several firms have responded to criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza by rescinding job offers and threatening to curb recruiting efforts at law schools. On Thursday, ahead of the unionwide vote on a statement, the Legal Aid Society called a staff meeting. According to a partial recording of the meeting obtained by The Intercept, Chief Executive Officer Twyla Carter said the resolution’s language was antisemitic. Staff could vote how they wanted, she said, but she had an obligation to warn them about the impact on the organization’s work. Four law firms had already threatened to pull funding from the office over the resolution, Carter said. In discouraging union members to vote for the statement, she said, “I’m not trying to lose a dime.” Most Read Pentagon Won’t Say Where It’s Sending U.S. Troops — to Avoid Embarrassing Host Nations Ken Klippenstein Blowback: How Israel Went From Helping Create Hamas to Bombing It Mehdi Hasan, Dina Sayedahmed Biden’s Legacy Should Be Forever Haunted by the Names of Gaza’s Dead Children Jeremy Scahill A vote on the union resolution was halted by a court on Friday after members of the organizations, including union membership, sued. The union received the restraining order before it was over and could not tally the results. The suppression of speech at publicly funded legal defense agencies comes as governments and workplaces around the world have disciplined and fired staffers for criticizing Israel’s nonstop bombing of Gaza. Suppression of speech about Palestine has come in the form of bans on rallies and vigils, suspensions of student groups, doxxing and death threats, and the cancellation of television interviews with Palestinian commentators. “Unions must act where the U.S. government will not. I proudly support Palestinian liberation and self-determination.” The fight brewing in public defender offices escalated after recent union efforts to issue statements condemning the killing of Palestinian civilians. Since Hamas killed 1,200 Israelis last month, mostly civilians, Israel has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, one out of every 200 people. “Unions must act where the U.S. government will not,” said Sophia Gurulé, a staff attorney in the immigration practice at the Bronx Defenders and a member of the group’s union. “I proudly support Palestinian liberation and self-determination.” Stop the Count The legal fight revolved around a statement from the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys – UAW Local 2325, which covers more than 25 organizations, including the Bronx Defenders, Brooklyn Defender Services, Neighborhood Defender Service, and the Legal Aid Society of New York City. Staffers across the four offices, as well as the New York County Defender Services, which is not represented by the union, have been retaliated against, reprimanded, surveilled, and encouraged to oppose the union resolution. The staffers spoke to The Intercept on the condition of anonymity for fear of professional retaliation. In total, the five agencies provide legal and social services to more than 360,000 people each year. The resolution expresses solidarity with Palestinians, calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, and demands an end to Israel’s occupation, decrying apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. With a “yes” vote, the union would also oppose future military aid to Israel and endorse the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel. Join Our Newsletter Original reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. I'm in At the Legal Aid all-staff meeting on Thursday, Carter, the CEO, said the resolution was antisemitic. “These statements call for the elimination of the state of Israel and the annihilation of the Jewish people,” Carter said. “You don’t have to agree, but that’s how some of our colleagues feel, and some of our supporters.” “Accusing Israel of being an apartheid state and of genocide are all dog whistles for antisemitism,” she said. She suggested Jewish readers of the statement might see it the same way Black people would see pro-police sloganeering: “And, again, as a Black woman, my closest analogy is hearing how people talk about ‘blue lives matter’ or other things that land on me differently.” “Accusing Israel of being an apartheid state and of genocide are all dog whistles for antisemitism.” In a statement to The Intercept, the Legal Aid Society said it has a long-standing policy against taking positions on international political events and that it was focused on its mission to provide legal services to low-income New Yorkers. The organization said it rejected the union’s resolution, found it antisemitic, and hoped union members would vote against it: “The resolution is laden with coded antisemitic language and thinly veiled calls for the destruction of the State of Israel. At a time when our attorneys and staff should be united in support of the people we serve, the resolution does not advance the legal interests of our clients, does not comport with our mission and values, and is divisive and hurtful.” Several hours after the meeting on Thursday, attorneys at the Legal Aid Society of Nassau County sued in New York State Supreme Court to stop the vote, saying it posed an ethical dilemma for attorneys that would make it “impossible for them to properly do their job as Public Defenders.” On Friday, the court granted a temporary restraining order enjoining the vote. Voting had gotten underway at 9 a.m. and only 15 minutes were left on the clock when the injunction was issued. The tally never got underway. Cease-and-Desist Letters On October 18, two days before the union at Bronx Defenders issued a statement opposing Israel’s occupation, ethnic cleansing, and “genocidal intent in Gaza,” management at the group sent a cease-and-desist letter warning that it would enforce trademark rights against any use of the organization’s name in the forthcoming statement. On Wednesday, the Bronx Defenders issued its own statement distancing itself from the union. The group said its union’s statement did not recognize the humanity of Israelis and was not consistent with the values or mission of the Bronx Defenders. Bronx Defenders staffers also reported to the union that human resources informed them that their draft emails were in violation of policies on internal communications. Management later apologized and said they hadn’t intended to look at staffers’ drafts. (Asked for comment, the Bronx Defenders referred The Intercept to its Wednesday statement.) As staff at the Neighborhood Defender Services, a public defense group covering Harlem, considered putting out a union statement on Gaza in early November, they also received a cease-and-desist letter. The letter came attached to an email from managing director Alice Fontier, who said a public statement on Israel and Gaza fell outside the scope of the organization’s work. The attached letter, from an outside law firm, urged the union not to use Neighborhood Defender Services or any other trademarked nomenclature. Related Student Protests for Gaza Targeted by Pro-Israel Groups for Alleged Civil Rights Violations “We have seen the impact of a similar statement issued by Union members at the Bronx Defenders,” said the attached cease-and-desist letter. The letter noted that the petition to defund the Bronx Defenders had already gathered more than 1,500 signatures and was picked up by the New York Post, “which, unfortunately, is read widely by those in power in New York City government.” The city, the letter said, would soon be considering two major funding proposals for Neighborhood Defender Services. Neighborhood Defender Services’s Hermes Ortega Santana, who helped write the union’s draft statement, resigned on November 6 as union president after receiving the cease-and-desist letter. In his resignation letter, Santana said he was concerned that the statement would jeopardize the organization’s funding and its ability to serve clients, as well as ongoing contract negotiations. Policies against international political speech in work channels weren’t previously enforced around discussion of the war in Ukraine, participation with pro-Israel groups, or international migration issues, according to public defense staffers who spoke to The Intercept. Now, these policies are being enforced for the first time in the case of speech related to Palestine, staffers said. Several of the public defense group have a record of putting out statements on major political events, including police brutality such as the murder of George Floyd, the movement to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and former President Donald Trump’s “Muslim ban.” In the Legal Aid staff meeting Thursday ahead of the union vote, Carter referred to an organizational policy to “not talk about sociopolitical views or anything outside of our mission and our clients.” Correction: November 17, 2023, 11:32 p.m. ET This article previously stated that Lisa Ohta, who is the president of the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, was a plaintiff in a suit brought against the union.

    "title": "The transformative potential of generative AI in the legal profession",
    "originLink": "https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/the-power-and-potential-of-generative-ai",
    "originBody": "LegalNovember 16, 2023 The power and potential of generative AI Among the ELM Amplify 2023 sessions that generated the most interest among attendees was Empowering Legal Operations with Generative AI: Transforming the Future of Efficiency. This discussion, featuring Rose Brandolino, CTO and Client Technology Strategist at Microsoft, along with Vincent Venturella and Jeetu Gupta of ELM Solutions, helped participants understand the basics of generative AI (GAI). The presenters defined GAI and talked about how it can be a useful tool for legal operations professionals. They also discussed the inherent risks and challenges and how these can be addressed. Here’s a sampling of the insights shared during this informative session. The advent of GAI Artificial intelligence has been part of our lives for years. Since the creation of AI technology capable of beating humans at complex games more than two decades ago, progress has accelerated rapidly. More recently, out of that accelerated progress, GAI has arisen. GAI interfaces are simple, with images or text being generated in response to a prompt, while behind the scenes, the software does its best to “guess” what the user wants. It isn’t necessarily likely to choose the “most true” answer, but the most likely answer. These applications are trained on an enormous amount of information, with a cost of up to $5 million to train a single model. Inherent risk When asked by the presenters, there were many more attendees indicating that they have tried out GAI than those indicating they are actively using it. As it is still a new technology, this isn’t surprising. When users are ready, though, GAI can act as a smart and helpful partner, available 24x7, making your work more efficient and productive. However, there are risks and challenges associated with using GAI. The most well-known of these is hallucinations. They occur because the AI doesn’t have actual insight into the truth of the output it is creating, rather it is simply trying to predict the next work. This leads to instances like the one cited during the session, in which ChatGPT recommended a legal AI tool that doesn’t actually exist. General models of GAI – those trained on data of all types – can also suffer from the problem of degrading accuracy. These models can take in so much information that they are influenced even by information that is not correct. The more information they take in, the more errors can appear in their results due to incorrect data in their training. This is clearly an unacceptable risk in legal and many other contexts and is the reason why we are seeing more specific models emerging. These are purpose-built for particular subject areas, such as legal, and can avoid this type of degradation. Wolters Kluwer is currently working on applications for GAI that will include mitigations for these risks. Among other measures, we have instituted data privacy and transparency measures and are building specific models within a tightly controlled sandbox. GAI in the legal workplace Today’s GAI technology can be put to use on both the practice and business sides of law. The speakers agreed that legal operations professionals should expect to see GAI used to save time, create efficiencies, and simplify administrative work. Like the AI applications that came before, it can remove some of the less interesting aspects of legal ops work, allowing people to focus on the more creative aspects of their jobs. When used well, GAI can supercharge humans, summarizing and contextualizing large amounts of data quickly. However, it cannot replace people wholesale. Some work is still expected to be best executed by people. A Wolters Kluwer survey with Above the Law found: More than 80% of respondents agree that generative AI will create “transformative efficiencies” within legal research and other routine tasks. 62% believe it will separate successful from unsuccessful law firms within the next five years. Only 31% agree that generative AI will transform high-level legal work in job categories such as law firm partner or of counsel. Generative AI has arrived in the legal function and is positioned to make positive contributions to the work of legal ops professionals. Humans will still be needed to review, guide, and shape the output, however, so it does not represent a replacement for people. Those who leverage the technology well will be able to expedite their work and focus their time and attention on the most value-added tasks for their organizations. In short, learning to effectively use GAI will help legal professionals become even more successful.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights Companies DoNotPay Ltd Follow Nov 17 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday agreed to dismiss, for now, a lawsuit by a small Illinois law firm that accused artificial intelligence company DoNotPay of engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Chief U.S. District Judge Nancy Rosenstengel in East St. Louis, Illinois said in the decision that law firm MillerKing's claims are not sufficient to give it legal standing to sue DoNotPay in federal court.

MillerKing in March sued DoNotPay, which says on its website that it uses artificial intelligence to help consumers \"fight big corporations, protect your privacy, find hidden money, and beat bureaucracy.\" MillerKing, which has six attorneys who work in areas including personal injury, wrongful death and family law, claimed DoNotPay advertises and provides legal services without having a license to practice law.

Rosenstengel on Friday rejected MillerKing's argument that it is a \"direct competitor\" of DoNotPay. The judge concluded MillerKing did not adequately allege it has \"suffered a diversion of clients or reputational harm\" due to DoNotPay's actions and lacks standing to sue.

An outside lawyer representing MillerKing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \"We are thrilled,\" DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder told Reuters. \"It's proven what we believed from the very beginning, that there was no concrete harm,\" he said. DoNotPay faces another lawsuit alleging unauthorized practice of law, brought by Chicago-based law firm Edelson on behalf of a California man who claimed he used the company's service and got poor results. The California federal judge overseeing that case is weighing DoNotPay's bid to compel arbitration. The case is MillerKing LLC v.

    "originLink": "https://fortune.com/2023/11/17/lawyer-fired-after-chatgpt-use-is-sticking-with-ai-tools/",
    "originBody": "TECH ·A.I. A lawyer fired after citing ChatGPT-generated fake cases is sticking with AI tools: ‘There’s no point in being a naysayer’ BYSTEVE MOLLMAN ChatGPT can generate fake cases in seconds, and judges are not amused. GETTY Artificial intelligence will bring changes to many professions, including law. But it’s also claiming victims who trust too much in its capabilities. Among them is Zachariah Crabill, who was an overwhelmed rookie lawyer at a law firm in Colorado Springs when he gave in to the temptation of using ChatGPT in May. The AI chatbot helped him write a motion in seconds, saving him hours of work, as local radio station KRDO reported in June. But after he filed the document with a Colorado court, he realized that something was amiss: Several lawsuit citations generated by ChatGPT were made up. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is known to be confidently wrong, and in this case it simply created cases out of thin air that sounded convincing. Crabill did not check to make sure the cases were real before submitting his work. Crabill admitted his mistake to the judge, who reported him to statewide office, and in July the young attorney was fired from his job at Baker Law Group. In his statement to the court admitting his mistake, Crabill wrote, “I felt my lack of experience in legal research and writing, and consequently, my efficiency in this regard could be exponentially augmented to the benefit of my clients by expediting the time-intensive research portion of drafting.” Crabill isn’t the only lawyer to trust ChatGPT too much. In June, two lawyers were scolded and fined $5,000 by a federal judge in New York for submitting a legal brief that also cited nonexistent cases. In sanctions against Steven A. Schwartz and Peter LoDuca of Levidow, Levidow & Oberman, the judge wrote: “Technological advances are commonplace, and there is nothing inherently improper about using a reliable artificial intelligence tool for assistance. But existing rules impose a gatekeeping role on attorneys to ensure the accuracy of their filings.” “I did not comprehend that ChatGPT could fabricate cases,” Schwartz had earlier told the judge. But Crabill, for his part, isn’t giving up on AI tools, despite the traumatic experience. “I still use ChatGPT in my day-to-day, much like most people use Google on the job,” he told Business Insider. Indeed he has since started a company that provides legal services via AI. In a Washington Post piece published on Thursday, Crabill said he would likely use AI tools designed specifically for lawyers to aid in his writing and research. He added, “There’s no point in being a naysayer or being against something that is invariably going to become the way of the future.” Subscribe to the Eye on AI newsletter to stay abreast of how AI is shaping the future of business.

    "originBody": "Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email In brief On 9 November 2023, the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“Commissioner“) issued a statement on AI-supported data processing. The Commissioner’s main message is that the Swiss Data Protection Law is formulated in a technology-neutral manner and is, therefore, also directly applicable to AI-supported data processing. The Commissioner draws the attention of manufacturers and providers of AI applications to the legal obligation to ensure that the data subjects whose data is processed have the highest possible degree of digital self-determination as early as the developing and planning phase. Manufacturers and providers of AI applications must make the purpose, functionality and data sources of AI-based processing transparent. In the case of intelligent language models that communicate directly with users, users have a legal right to know whether they are talking to a machine and whether the data they enter is being processed to improve the self-learning programs or for other purposes. AI-supported data processing with high risks is permitted in principle under the Swiss Data Protection Law, but it requires appropriate measures to protect the potentially affected data subjects. Applications that aim to undermine privacy and digital self-determination are prohibited under the Swiss Data Protection Law. This refers in particular to AI-based data processing that can be observed in authoritarian states, such as comprehensive facial recognition in real time.

    "originBody": "GENERATIVE AI Dealing with contracts without humans is now a possibility with AI innovation Your algorithmic lawyer will see you now. 17 November 2023 Muhammad Zulhusni @ zul@hybrid.co All stories Bridging AI innovations and legal expertise. (Source – Shutterstock). Luminance’s AI innovation revolutionizes the legal industry with automated contract negotiations. AI transforms legal tasks into efficient processes through Luminance’s successful automation of contract negotiations. Is AI the future of routine legal work? We are witnessing a paradigm shift in how AI is being used across various industries. A recent breakthrough by AI firm Luminance has marked a significant milestone in integrating AI into the legal domain, showcasing AI’s ability to autonomously negotiate contracts, Luminance’s demonstration challenges traditional perceptions and signals the emergence of a new era in legal processes. This pioneering effort illustrates the potential of AI to transform complex, labor-intensive tasks, paving the way for more efficient, automated solutions in the legal field. This transformative initiative by Luminance involved its large language model (LLM), which has been meticulously trained on a staggering 150 million legal documents. Successfully automating a contract negotiation between two virtual entities, this UK-based company proudly presents this accomplishment as the first fully AI-driven contract negotiation. This breakthrough event serves as a compelling example of how industry-specific AI models, such as Luminance’s, are increasingly diverging from general-purpose models like ChatGPT to cater to specialized sector needs, and revolutionizing how industries like law use technology for efficiency and precision. READ NEXT Kids train AI fighters in new educational game Custom AI in various industries OpenAI, inching toward its goal of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), recently introduced a platform that allows users to craft their own custom versions of ChatGPT. This development extends the earlier ChatGPT plugins but now boasts enhanced functionalities. It targets regular ChatGPT users and enterprise customers who utilize a private version of ChatGPT for internal purposes. The new platform enables users to engage with existing custom GPTs, like those integrated with Canva for design creation or Zapier for task automation. It also offers the opportunity to build personalized chatbots without coding expertise. The intuitive nature of GPTs, that understand natural language, means that anyone with a concept and some guidelines can develop their AI tool. Custom GPT is making everything possible. (Generated entirely unironically by AI). OpenAI plans to launch a GPT store later this month, functioning similarly to an app store. This marketplace will allow users to explore and create custom GPTs and potentially monetize their creations. Customized models like Luminance’s offer the dual benefits of data privacy and specialized expertise, particularly valuable for businesses looking to automate specific tasks. Luminance focuses on legal contracts, aiming to reduce the hours lawyers spend on negotiations. The future of legal work with AI innovation Legal document review is notoriously labor-intensive, but LLMs like Luminance’s Autopilot can rapidly process and analyze vast amounts of data. Automating routine contract reviews, such as non-disclosure agreements, could save legal professionals time. Jaeger Glucina, Luminance’s chief of staff and managing director, told CNBC that Autopilot manages everyday negotiations, allowing lawyers to focus their creativity on more critical tasks rather than getting mired in routine work. She explained that the entire process, from opening a contract in Word to negotiating terms and sending it for electronic signature via DocuSign, can now be entirely managed by AI. This AI is not only legally trained but also attuned to the specific needs of the business. AI is saving lawyers a lot of time. (Source – X) How does Autopilot work? So, how does Autopilot work? The AI innovation plays a central role in a demonstration involving Luminance’s general counsel and the general counsel of ProSapient, a research firm. The lawyers’ photos are displayed on two monitors, but the AI actively analyzes and makes recommendations on a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). NDAs, known for their strict confidentiality requirements, often require extensive legal scrutiny. According to Glucina, these documents can delay business processes, affecting revenues and partnerships. By streamlining the NDA process, AI can significantly impact various business operations. READ NEXT Cube warehouse robots square up against humanoid designs Legal teams typically spend about 80% of their time reviewing and negotiating routine documents. Luminance’s software tackles this by initially marking contentious clauses in red. The AI then modifies these clauses to more suitable terms, logging the changes as the negotiation progresses. It also considers the company’s standard contract negotiation preferences. In one instance during the demonstration, the AI revised the NDA’s initial proposal of a six-year term down to three years. This change was under Luminance’s standard policy preferences. This adjustment demonstrates the AI’s capability to understand and apply specific organizational guidelines, showcasing its adaptability in real-world scenarios. Glucina highlights the advantage of using a specialized tool like Luminance Autopilot over more general-purpose platforms like OpenAI’s software. Tailored specifically for the legal industry, Luminance offers a more focused approach than general tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, and Anthropic’s Claude. Luminance’s Autopilot feature represents a significant advancement over its chatbot, ‘Ask Lumi,’ which launched earlier this year. While ‘Ask Lumi’ is the company’s first chatbot supported by legal-grade AI, allowing users to interact with contracts in Microsoft Word and get immediate AI responses, Autopilot takes this further. Has AI innovation just begun the long march to making lawyers redundant? Drawing on its experience with over 150 million legal documents, Luminance combines its proprietary AI technology and deep legal expertise. This extensive background positions it as a highly advanced legal Language Model from the company’s perspective. Luminance’s legal pre-trained transformer (LPT) technology, which stands apart from broader GPT technologies, is specifically trained on legally verified documents. This specialized training enables the LPT to generate content and analyze and comprehend content that third parties have created or edited. By combining generative and analytical capabilities, this AI technology is meticulously designed to maintain the highest standards of legal rigor. With Luminance’s chatbot technology, users can inquire about specific contract details within Microsoft Word, such as the contracting parties, jurisdiction, or assignability, and get instant responses. Furthermore, ‘Ask Lumi’ enhances efficiency across business departments by enabling non-legal teams to obtain answers to common queries, relieving the legal team of repetitive tasks. However, the capabilities of ‘Ask Lumi’ are just the beginning. Autopilot can function independently without human intervention, though human oversight is still integral. The software logs all AI-driven changes meticulously, ensuring transparency and accountability.

    "originBody": "Technology AI Update: A WaPo Deep Dive, AI Passes Legal Ethics Exam, Google’s AI Scam Suit This week in AI news. By ETHAN BEBERNESS onNovember 17, 2023 at 1:43 PMNovember 17, 2023 at 12:13 PM 2 Shares The Washington Post published a deep dive on how artificial intelligence has impacted the legal industry in recent years, noting that “the AI legal software market could grow from $1.3 billion in 2022 to upward of $8.7 billion by 2030.” The write-up draws on useful analysis from industry experts and attorneys alike. OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude 2 LLMs have both passed a simulation of the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) in a test conducted by researchers at AI contract review company LegalOn Technologies, Bob Ambrogi reports for Lawsites. The bots’ performance varied a bit by subject area, performing best on questions related to conflicts of interest and client relationships. Legaltech News has additional analysis. Google has launched a suit against several “online scammers” that have used the tech giant’s “logos in a scheme targeting the general public’s interest in artificial intelligence,” according to Axios. The news outlet reports that this may be the first action from a tech company operating at Google’s scale to combat “the growing number of AI-related online scams.” Legaltech News’ Ishra Marathe spoke with several attorneys about how they’ve navigated clients’ differing comfort levels with new technology, including AI. The core strategy involves maintaining clear communication with clients regarding the firm’s tech-related decisions and paying attention to the concerns clients raise. The interplay of humans and AI-powered legal technology “will unlock talent value in the billions” and significantly impact both how legal work is done and what in-house attorneys look for in a relationship with outside counsel, Ed Sohn of Factor and Jae Um of Six Parsecs predict in an article for Bloomberg Law. The biggest impact will be on what the authors call “core work” — the work that “arises in the normal course of business operations” such as contracting and product counseling.

Chances are — not much, beyond maybe walking and gurgling a word or two. For generative artificial intelligence (AI), the level of development after just one year is an entirely different story. The precocious innovation can already predict the 10-day weather forecast better than current gold-standard meteorological systems across nearly all (90%) of the 1,380 key metrics measured. And that’s just within one domain. The innovative technology is making accelerated strides across all kinds of ecosystems. From purpose-built products to service-as-software advances, this is the weekly pulse check on the top AI news and innovations PYMNTS has been tracking. ‘Magic Super Intelligence in the Sky’ Generative AI’s capabilities are advancing to the degree that many industry pioneers are returning to the initial sci-fi dream that spurred their interest in the AI field: developing artificial general intelligence (AGI), or software that matches human intelligence. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman shared on Monday (Nov. 13) that he plans to secure additional funding from Microsoft, which has already pledged $10 billion to his firm, to fund AGI development. “Magic intelligence in the sky. I think that’s what we’re about,” Altman said. Following the news, PYMNTS reported on how intelligence, even when encoded into a software tool, is a continuum, and how any future AGI systems will exist on that same continuum. But all the buzz about AI accelerationism has some industry groups worried. A group of more than 40 venture capital (VC) firms, including General Catalyst, Felicis Ventures, Bain Capital, IVP, Insight Partners and Lux Capita, on Tuesday (Nov. 14) signed voluntary commitments around how the startups they back should develop AI technology responsibly as the technology and the companies behind it continue to grow. Menlo Ventures, which is not among the commitment’s signatories, announced on Thursday (Nov. 16) that it had raised $1.35 billion to invest in AI. The VC-signed voluntary agreement is meant to demonstrate leadership from the private sector around controlling for AI’s risks, but it has sparked a debate among AI founders around the line between responsible development and regulatory capture. And it isn’t just the VC community. The National Retail Federation (NRF) also released on Monday its Principles for the Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Retail Sector, providing a framework for retailers to govern and strategically plan their use of AI. Tapping AI to Drive Personalization That’s because retailers, both online and brick-and-mortar, are increasingly turning to AI to make the experience better and more streamlined for their customers. In the midst of the holiday season, despite projections of weak consumer spending forecast amid an inventory glut, Macy’s announced Thursday that they have moved to implement AI to better adjust its inventory based on holiday demand. Elsewhere, Google on Thursday added personalized gift recommendations to its generative AI capabilities in Search. But it isn’t just retail where AI is having an impact. Airbnb on Tuesday announced its first acquisition as a public company — an AI startup called Gameplanner.ai. The news comes on the heels of Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky saying that AI will help turn Airbnb into the “ultimate travel agent” and “unlock opportunities we’ve never seen” during his company’s most recent earnings call. And leading music services are increasing their use of AI capabilities to offer more personalized experiences to drive consumer loyalty. For instance, Spotify and Google Cloud announced Thursday the expansion of their partnership, leveraging AI to drive engagement with the leading global music streaming platform. Beyond the marketplace, OpenAI is reportedly looking into ways to bring its popular generative AI ChatGPT chatbot into classrooms, exploring the educational applications of AI technology. Putting the AI in Legislation Thomson Reuters on Wednesday (Nov. 15) launched a series of initiatives aimed at transforming the legal profession through the use of generative AI. This comes as PYMNTS Intelligence in “The Confluence of Law and AI: An Inevitability Waiting to Happen,” a collaboration with AI-ID, finds that more than half of legal professionals are uncertain about the technology’s reliability, and nearly two in five do not trust it. Consumers of legal services are not entirely won over either, with 55% of clients and potential clients expressing serious concerns about the use of AI within the legal profession. Still, 62% of legal professionals believe that effective use of generative AI will differentiate successful firms from unsuccessful ones in as little as five years. An even higher share, 80%, agree that generative AI will introduce “transformative efficiencies” — a sentiment echoed by law firms and corporate legal departments. Those potential benefits — transformative across not just law but all sectors — are a part of why Chinese tech giant Alibaba reportedly said Thursday it will not spin off its cloud intelligence business amid the ongoing focus on AI. Elsewhere in the News Of course, the ongoing focus on AI doesn’t come without some growing pains. OpenAI is putting a hold on new signups for its ChatGPT Plus program, due to widespread demand putting a strain on the platform, the company said Tuesday, as tech companies increasingly rely on consumer subscriptions to boost profits. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also on Thursday took a proactive stance in protecting consumers from the potential dangers of artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning technology, unveiling the Voice Cloning Challenge and inviting submissions of ideas that can help prevent the misuse of AI technology for fraudulent and malicious purposes. In an unrelated announcement, Microsoft on Wednesday launched the public preview release of Azure AI Speech, technology that allows users to create talking avatar videos with text input and build real-time interactive bots using human images. And Amazon introduced on Wednesday an AI security solution designed to cater to the needs of small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that combines robotics, smart security and AI to enable customers to keep an eye on their business 24/7, even from home. But for AI’s widespread applications to be fully capitalized on, end-users need to be familiar with the technology. New PYMNTS Intelligence from “AI-Enabled Payments Enhance Customer Options,” a report by PYMNTS Intelligence and ACI Worldwide, found that there are significant differences across gender, generations and income levels when it comes to familiarity with AI. For example, a higher percentage of men — 46% — consider themselves very or extremely familiar with AI compared to 33% of women. Similarly, although the margin is smaller, a higher percentage of men (35%) than women (about 31%) acknowledge AI’s significant role in their daily personal activities.
