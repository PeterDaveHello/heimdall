    "originBody": "China: The world’s shopping cart How China took over the world’s online shopping carts Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein, Temu, and TikTok Shop are going global with big ambitions. Photography by Alejandra Rajal for Rest of World Photography by Alejandra Rajal for Rest of World By Viola Zhou, Caiwei Chen, Laís Martins and Ester Christine Natalia 14 November 2023 Translate EspañolPortuguês中文 (简体字)DeutschFrançais Sales at Yiheng Battery were stagnating in the fall of 2022. The company, based in the eastern Chinese city of Yiwu, had done good business for 30 years selling button cell batteries — used in watches and other small devices — to customers at its factory and on Chinese shopping platform 1688. But the Covid-19 pandemic had taken a toll. “The [Chinese] economy was not doing well, and people were not spending,” Huang Qianqian, whose parents own the factory, told Rest of World. That October, Huang, 28, quit her job at a tech company to help out the family business. Huang’s friends eventually told her about a new e-commerce platform, Temu, which had just launched in the U.S. Temu is owned by PDD Holdings, which also owns Pinduoduo, a Chinese online shopping app that is popular in China for its low prices and gamified features. Temu used similar tactics, but targeted American customers. Huang convinced her parents to give Temu a try. It could be an opportunity, she reasoned, to take the business international. “A lot of second-generation factory owners like me will seek to break new ground when they start to take over the family business,” she said. “Temu’s launch felt like just the right time.” Yiheng Battery joined the platform in December. Temu has caused a stir in Yiwu, which is famous for its sprawling wholesale markets. “Every time a platform rises to prominence, a large number of suppliers get rich here in Yiwu,” Huang said. “It used to be Amazon, [domestic e-commerce app] Taobao, and then Pinduoduo. Lately, a lot of people want to hop on the Temu train.” China has been “the world’s factory” for decades, with made-in-China goods reaching global consumers through foreign brands, shops, or sites like Amazon. And the country has had a vibrant domestic e-commerce sector, with companies like Alibaba and JD.com growing into juggernauts. But recently, Chinese-owned shopping platforms have begun looking beyond China’s borders. Temu joins ultrafast-fashion platform Shein and TikTok’s shopping feature TikTok Shop to herald a new, global era for Chinese e-commerce. Yao Kaifei, founder of e-commerce startup BrandAI, told Rest of World the country’s e-commerce sector is desperate to chuhai, or venture overseas. Sellers and platforms want to shed the reputation of selling cheap “made in China” gadgets, and make a name for themselves exporting whole brands and business models. By September 2023, roughly a year after its launch, Temu had more than 61 million monthly active users in the U.S., according to research company Data.ai. It now sells in 48 countries around the world. Shein is one of the world’s biggest fast-fashion companies and has branched out to selling other products, such as homewares and electronics. It has been the top-ranked shopping app on the Google Play store in 115 countries, according to Data.ai. TikTok Shop, meanwhile, has seen quick growth in Southeast Asia, and launched in the U.S. this September. The platforms have reshaped global e-commerce, both for customers and sellers. In Yiwu, Huang’s efforts to move her family business onto Temu have resulted in around 100 orders a day, although she said they make very little profit from the platform, owing to cutthroat pricing. In any case, she’s already eyeing her next venture: selling pet products on TikTok Shop. “I heard that a two- to three-person team running a TikTok Shop can easily make millions of yuan a year,” she said. “In the ’90s, [Chinese] manufacturers saw themselves as mere suppliers at the lower echelons of the value chain,” Yao said. But the sales channels provided by the new apps give them access to consumers almost anywhere, spawning global aspirations. “What was once unthinkable for Chinese sellers is now within reach.” Disposed AliExpress shipping bags. On November 11, 2009, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba launched a shopping festival that has since become the most important date for the country’s e-commerce sector: Singles Day, or Double 11. In its inaugural year, it brought $7.8 million in sales. That figure climbed year on year. By 2019, Singles Day was a star-studded event: Kim Kardashian shilled for Singles Day in a special livestream; Taylor Swift performed an evening concert in Shanghai before the big discounts kicked in at midnight. That year, Alibaba made its first billion dollars in sales in just one minute and eight seconds. Twenty-four hours later, the counter stood at $38.4 billion, another record. Then, trouble began. In 2020, the Chinese government started clamping down on the country’s tech sector. Alibaba founder Jack Ma had made comments about China’s financial regulations, drawing particular ire from officials. A series of strict citywide lockdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic were followed by a wobbly economic recovery. In 2022, Alibaba kept its Double 11 sales numbers secret for the first time. Lin Zhang, an associate professor at the University of New Hampshire who studies e-commerce, told Rest of World the saturation of the domestic market spurred an interest in reaching international markets. “They have the money. They have the experience. They know there is a gap out there in the international market,” Zhang said. “And it’s so tough domestically. So why don’t we go [overseas]?” Shein was an early mover in the chuhai ambition. Founded in 2008 in Nanjing, it exclusively targeted international customers from the start. Sales climbed through the 2010s, but it took the pandemic to make Shein go truly viral. The company’s social media strategy popularized #sheinhaul videos, in which creators sometimes tried on more than 100 items in one go. The app’s global sales surged from a reported $4 billion in 2019 to $23 billion in 2022. According to Juozas Kaziukėnas, founder of e-commerce analyst firm Marketplace Pulse, Shein’s strength is its ability to offer thousands of new items every day. It runs a flexible supply chain that sources from a vast network of Chinese apparel factories and quickly adjusts to customer sentiment. For customers, a key draw is Shein’s low prices. According to one analysis, Shein’s prices for women’s fashion products are on average 39% to 60% cheaper than those of H&M. Juliana Silva, a hospital psychologist from São Paulo, Brazil, told Rest of World she became a loyal Shein customer after seeing its Instagram ads for plus-size clothing. “It really annoys me when I go to [Brazilian department stores] Renner or Riachuelo, and I see a top that I know is the same or very similar to what Shein offers, but there it’s being sold at an outrageous price,” she said. In 2023, Shein launched an Amazon-like marketplace for Chinese and international sellers to stock products, including electronics, DIY tools, and appliances. When Temu launched in September 2022, it also drew people in with low prices. In February, it broadcast an ad during the Super Bowl encouraging viewers to “shop like a billionaire” and fill their virtual carts without having to worry about the cost. That weekend, Temu racked 426,000 app downloads in the U.S., according to digital analytics company Sensor Tower. “Globally you have an economic slowdown, so a lot of consumers are also spending less per platform,” Sharon Gai, the former head of global key accounts at Alibaba and author of Ecommerce Reimagined, told Rest of World. “When there’s a low-cost e-commerce platform that’s emerged out of nowhere, they are obviously going to like it.” “I got addicted from the games.” Like its Chinese sister app Pinduoduo, Temu also brought gamification to the shopping experience. Visitors to the platform can play a virtual farming game or feed virtual fish to win free items, with extra incentives if users keep coming back or invite their friends. “I got addicted from the games,” one American Temu shopper, 24-year-old care worker Maddie Young, told Rest of World. She earned freebies like a unicorn backpack and a coffee machine by playing Temu’s games and bought clothes for her three children. “Temu and Amazon are very similar, they sell some of the exact same things,” she said. “But Temu is cheaper and [has] free shipping.” Gai said the platforms had fortuitous timing, as they emerged just as online sales in China slowed: “Factories and sellers in China will bend to these low prices because this has been a tough year for them domestically.” She said manufacturers might accept lower margins initially, in the hope the platforms would bring increasing orders. Several Chinese sellers told Rest of World the platforms also made it easy for them to join. “Amazon and Taobao are like malls,” said Huang, from Yiheng Battery. “But Temu and Shein are like supermarkets. You supply unbranded products to the platform and let them take it from there.” This hands-off model is particularly attractive to businesses that have little experience marketing abroad. Lin Qianran, who runs a lighting company in the southern Chinese city of Zhongshan, said many traders in the area had joined Temu. Lin said her margins on Temu are about half those on Amazon, but Temu requires less effort. She also opened a store on Shein this year. “Their entry barrier is not as high as Amazon’s,” she said. Disposed shipping bags used to send orders from e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu. One day in 2021, Thesalonica Gita Pramesti Putri, a 28-year-old food stall co-owner in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta — who goes by Thesa — was scrolling through TikTok when she noticed something new. Between the typical videos of viral dances and comedy skits, there were livestreams of people trying to sell fashion and beauty products directly to viewers. TikTok Shop had launched in Indonesia in April 2021, amassing sales worth $2.5 billion within its first year and subsequently launching in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand. Thesa was intrigued: As a university student, she’d made money by drop-shipping fashion accessories, and she sensed an opportunity. Thesa and her fiancé started selling clothes made with traditional Indonesian fabrics and soon attracted buyers, especially after they paid to have their livestreams feature in users’ For You feeds. They have hired eight employees to sew clothes, host livestreams, and pack orders. This September, they made around 90 million rupiah ($5,730). This kind of social commerce was pioneered in China by Alibaba, which introduced shopping livestreams on its Taobao app in 2016. Livestream hosts hawk anything from makeup to laundry detergent, with some gaining huge followings and selling billions of dollars of products. One of China’s most famous e-commerce influencers, Austin Li, also known as the “Lipstick King,” once sold 15,000 lipsticks in five minutes. Livestream shopping has become a mainstay of Chinese e-commerce. On Douyin, TikTok’s Chinese sister app, consumers bought $208 billion worth of goods in 2022. TikTok Shop is trying to replicate this success outside of China, with an initial focus on Southeast Asia. In August, research firm Momentum Works reported that the app’s sales in the region were on track to grow from $4.4 billion in 2022 to a target value of $15 billion in 2023. But the livestream shopping model hasn’t worked everywhere. TikTok Shop launched in the U.K. in 2021 to a lukewarm reception that caused it to pause plans to roll out in Europe and the U.S. the following year. TikTok eventually expanded the shopping feature to the U.S. this September, hoping to turn its more than 150 million American users into regular shoppers. A TikTok influencer who posts under the name Coco Mocoe was among the first in the U.S. to use the feature, hawking a fluffy handheld microphone to her 1 million followers. The product sold out in a day. “China and the way that they use media is always a few years ahead of us,” she told Rest of World. The same month as the U.S. launch, however, TikTok Shop was dealt a significant blow: In a bid to protect local businesses, the Indonesian government announced it was going to ban social media apps from selling products. On October 3, Thesa received an email from TikTok announcing it was closing TikTok Shop in Indonesia. She would no longer be able to sell her clothes on the platform. “I was aghast,” she said. She has since started livestreaming on Shopee, a Singapore-headquartered e-commerce platform, but said her income has dropped by more than half. In response to questions about the ban, TikTok Indonesia referred Rest of World to a statement that said the company “will continue to cooperate with the relevant authorities on the path forward.” “China and the way that they use media is always a few years ahead of us.” Bhima Yudhistira Adhinegara, executive director of the Jakarta-based research institute Center of Economic and Law Studies, told Rest of World the government’s ban won’t have the effect it is hoping for. “E-commerce is not heavily regulated, so the impact of TikTok Shop closing is only partial,” he said. He pointed out that, like Thesa, most sellers just migrated to other platforms. Indonesia could be setting an example. In October, Malaysia’s government hinted it was considering a similar policy, as its communications and digital minister said he had received complaints from local stores about TikTok Shop and raised concerns about “predatory pricing.” Disposed storage bags from Temu. Elsewhere, competitors and regulators are also zoning in on the new generation of Chinese shopping platforms and their ultralow prices. Rafaella Torneri, who co-owns an online women’s clothing store called Guardaroba, based in São Paulo, told Rest of World her locally manufactured products were once priced competitively with other Brazilian brands, but Shein changed the game. “It used to be much easier for us,” she said. In August, the Brazilian government changed its regulations to increase taxes on imported packages valued below $50, which it said was aimed at foreign e-commerce platforms. In a statement to Rest of World, a PR representative for Shein in Brazil said the company welcomed the new tax program and that it had been subsidizing the increase in tariffs for its users. U.S. lawmakers have also been considering a change to import tariffs, accusing Shein and Temu of taking advantage of a rule that allows packages shipped individually to avoid tariffs, giving them an edge over businesses that ship by the container. A June report by a House of Representatives committee found that H&M and Gap paid $205 million and $700 million in import duties in 2022, respectively. Meanwhile, Shein and Temu paid nothing on the vast majority of their direct-to-customer shipments. In July, Shein’s executive chairman, Donald Tang, said U.S. tariff policy on imports valued under $800 needed “a complete makeover” to create a level playing field for retailers. In an emailed response to Rest of World, Shein said it is committed to respecting human rights, providing a safe and fair work environment for workers, and protecting intellectual property. TikTok referred Rest of World to its previous statements on TikTok Shop in the U.S. and Indonesia. Temu did not respond to a request for comment. The platforms’ low-price strategy also puts pressure on sellers. Zhang Zhouping, a cross-border e-commerce researcher at Hangzhou-based consultancy 100ec.cn, told Rest of World that platforms like Temu pose a dilemma for sellers: Lower your margins and enjoy higher sales, or be left out. “The lowest price always wins.” “The lowest price always wins,” Queenie Zhang, who runs a Shenzhen-based business selling home products across various platforms, told Rest of World. She joined Temu but soured on the experience and quit. “For a product that costs us $12.30 to make, [Temu] are offering to pay $11.30,” she wrote on social media in July. “We couldn’t accept that and could only give up selling this product.” It’s unclear how long Temu can keep its prices so low. In its bid to attract customers, the company also subsidizes shipping while spending aggressively on marketing. Chinese tech publication 36Kr estimated that Temu is losing $40 on every $100 earned in sales, citing sources familiar with the matter. During an earnings call in August, Liu Jun, vice president of finance for Temu’s parent company PDD Holdings, said Temu was still in its “learning phase” and was not yet focused on monetization. Gai, the former Alibaba executive, said Temu was using small, low-priced items to rapidly grow its user base, and that she expects the company will continue to scale back its free shipping policy. For now, this strategy continues to fuel astounding growth. As the Northern Hemisphere gears up for its winter holiday season, the platforms are battling for both customers’ and sellers’ attention by redoubling their focus on bargain prices. TikTok is offering to subsidize discounts of up to 50% to encourage sellers to participate in its Black Friday program, and Temu is advertising a holiday sales event that offers up to 90% discounts. Shein, meanwhile, launched an “11.11 shopping festival” — its own take on China’s Singles Day. “Self-control can wait, we’re having a self-care moment,” the company wrote on Instagram. 000000 packages have been shipped by AliExpress, Shein, TikTok Shop, and Temu since you started reading this article Enjoyed this story?

Petrina Josephine explained that prior to her big day, she ordered the fake teeth from Temu - the UK’s most downloaded app this year, pronounced tee-moo - in the hope that they would brighten and straighten up her smile. 3 A woman has revealed that she bought herself a pair of cheap clip-in veneers in the hope that she would wear them on her wedding dayCredit: TikTok/@petrinajosephine 3 However, Petrina Josephine was left horrified when she tried on the fake teethCredit: TikTok/@petrinajosephine 3 She described the veneers as 'horse teeth'Credit: TikTok/@petrinajosephine After all, you want to look and feel your best when you tie the knot, right? Well, unfortunately for Petrina, the cheap teeth didn’t look as stylish as she had hoped, and were certainly not suitable for her vows. Sharing the online order fail on social media, at the start of the clip, we saw the brunette beauty with her mouth closed, as she asked: “How bad can these pop on veneers from Temu be?” Seconds later, the bride-to-be shared a selfie, smiling, as she showed off her top set of clip-on veneers. To this, she wrote: “Never mind.” Petrina later penned: “It's giving horse girl.” While Petrina didn’t reveal how much she paid for her clip-in veneers, you can nab a pair for as cheap as 89p on Temu’s website. The TikTok clip, which was posted under the username @petrinajosephine, has clearly made many people chuckle, as it has quickly amassed 18,300 views.

One person said: “Nooooo.” To this, Petrina joked: “Wedding ready.” Another added: “That made me CRACK up. Thank you.” A third commented: “HAHAHAHAHAHA.” Meanwhile, someone else posted: “There’s supposed to be a wax mould with them, but they still don’t turn out good.” To this, Petrina replied: “I did end up realising that and was hopeful for a minute but like you said it also was a disaster.” But Petrina isn’t the only customer who has had a Temu fail. Following a Fabulous investigation into the toxic truth about the UK’s most downloaded shopping app, it appears that beneath Temu’s dirt-cheap prices and mind-boggling array of products lurks a growing sense of unease. The site has been dogged by negative reviews, claims of undelivered parcels, poor customer service and, most concerning of all, an “extremely high risk” of forced labour. Now, some critics are questioning if Temu — which means Team Up, Price Down — could, in fact, be toxic. Founded in September 2022 by Chinese e-commerce giant PDD Holdings, Temu advertises itself as an online marketplace connecting consumers with millions of sellers and brands, with “the mission to empower them to live their best lives”. Despite shrewd marketing and rock-bottom prices, the site suffers from some damning reviews. On TrustPilot, the app scores a fairly reasonable 3.5 stars out of five — but 31 per cent of users give it just one. The environmental impact of Temu’s suppliers is another cause for concern, while there are serious concerns regarding workers’ rights. In June, US lawmakers warned there was an “extremely high risk” products sold on the site had been made by forced labour. It’s feared the products are being made by Uyghur Muslim people, detained by the Chinese authorities since 2017 in what they say are “re-education” camps in Xinjiang.

    "title": "Baby Boomers Dominate Hot Housing Market, Squeezing Out Younger Buyers",
    "originLink": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/11/13/housing-market-boomer-buyers-mortgage-rates/",
    "originBody": "A sign announces the sale of a home in Wyndmoor, Pa., in June 2022. The housing market is still extremely tight even as mortgage rates rise. (Matt Rourke/AP) Listen 6 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save For the last 36 years, Rick and Laura Zinnick had a life in Nevada. But when their son and grandchildren decided to relocate to Oklahoma City, the Zinnicks decided to follow them, putting their four-bedroom house on one-third of an acre up for sale. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. The decision worked out well. That house sold for $480,000, giving the Zinnicks a windfall. They found a more manageable, one-story home in Oklahoma for $275,000 that was close to their family. And for the first time in their lives, they paid all cash, dodging soaring mortgage rates. “This move was meant for us,” said Laura Zinnick, 77. “I’m so glad we’ve been able to buy this house later in our life.” The housing market recession is already ending The Zinnicks aren’t alone: Older buyers are prevailing in America’s hot housing market. This year, the median age for a repeat buyer — someone who has bought a home before — was 58, according to data released Monday by the National Association of Realtors. That’s down just a smidgen from last year’s record of 59, but it’s up significantly from 36 years old in 1981, when NAR began conducting its survey. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Lately, grandparents have been edging out younger buyers who are struggling to get into the market for the first time. Nowadays, first-time buyers make up 32 percent of the market, well below an average of 38 percent since 1981, according to NAR. They’re also more likely to be in their mid-30s today, in contrast to their late 20s in the early 1980s. The result is yet another quirk of the post-coronavirus economy and, in particular, a housing market that has proved remarkably strong. As the Federal Reserve hoisted interest rates to 22-year highs, the widespread expectation was that a subsequent spike in mortgage rates would zap buyer demand. But even while the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage approaches 8 percent, the housing downturn was short-lived. And in the meantime, a new picture is emerging of the buyers who still find a way to get a house: They’re older, and because many of them sold a home before buying, they’re also wealthier. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “We are still talking about an incredibly difficult market for first-time buyers to enter, even if there’s slightly less competition,” said Jessica Lautz, the deputy chief economist at NAR. “If there’s a multi-offer situation, an all-cash buyer or someone who has a lot of equity is likely to win. And that person is going to be older.” A problem for the housing market: People won’t quit their cheap mortgages There are many reasons. For starters, older buyers are also likely to be selling a house, which provides them fresh cash. The typical home seller was 60 years old in 2023, according to NAR, the same as last year. And with so few homes available, sellers often go with the potential buyer making the most attractive offer — be it a large down payment, stellar credit or all cash. There, too, older buyers have a leg up. Michelle Singletary’s money milestones for every age Jennifer Dodds sees that dynamic in the Houston area, where the median sale price has jumped from about $275,000 to $325,000 in the past three years, according to Redfin. As a real estate agent working primarily with seniors, Dodds focuses on helping older buyers find their next homes, and she’s often scouring for one-story houses that work best for shoppers who are downsizing but aren’t yet looking to move into assisted-living centers or senior communities. (According to NAR, 70 percent of recent buyers did not have children under the age of 18 in their homes, the highest share recorded, and well above 42 percent in 1985.) Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Gone are the days of out-of-control bidding wars, which defined the market during the pandemic. But Dodds said there still can be a clear advantage for older buyers who have built up their wealth and income over decades and routinely emerge at the top of the pack. There’s a widening spending gap between retirees and younger adults “They have the appearance of being more stable,” Dodds said, “and a sense of them being more able to complete this purchase.” Share this article Share Earlier this year, Earlene Johnson and her husband, Donn, looked around their home of 35 years and decided it was too much work. The couple, both 76, decided to fast-track a move after Donn was diagnosed with cancer. So they packed up their two-story, four-bedroom home in Wildwood, Mo., and began looking for smaller options. Story continues below advertisement They quickly scooped a two-bedroom condo for roughly $170,000 in a neighborhood close to friends. They didn’t pay all cash but were able to show that selling their home would yield plenty of money in case their bank financing fell through. Shortly after, the Johnsons sold their old house for $520,000 — more than $20,000 over their asking price. Advertisement The quick turnaround meant the Johnsons shouldered two mortgages, one below 4 percent, and the other around 7 percent, for a little while. (“Oh, Lord, I try not to think about it,” Earlene Johnson said.) But once the sale on their old house went through, the Johnsons expected to wipe away their remaining debt on the condo, too. “We have two mortgages, but I think we’re going to be able to cover that and still have money left for cutting into some other credit,” Earlene Johnson said. (Donn died earlier this month.) Story continues below advertisement All the boomer buyers are keeping housing inventory — which wasn’t plentiful to begin with — even tighter. Tina Doyle is a Realtor focusing on seniors in the Ann Arbor, Mich., and metropolitan Detroit areas. In Washtenaw County, where Ann Arbor sits, there are only enough homes for sale to last a month and a half. That’s down 18 percent from last year, when supply was already super tight. Advertisement Doyle says there is less competition for homes in the area, in part because people in the middle of the market have pulled back. In many cases, those homeowners are sitting on houses with low mortgage rates, and they’d need a lot of motivation to give that up. That often leaves seniors and aspiring first-time buyers competing for similar types of homes — just a couple of bedrooms, not too much upkeep. Usually, there’s a clear winner. “It’s not a shift just with the seniors,” Doyle said. “It’s more of a shift in the rest of the market.” Share Comments",

    "title": "Why Temu's Cheap Prices Come at a Cost: Slow Deliveries, Unresponsive Service, and Poor Quality",
    "originLink": "https://www.thewindowsclub.com/why-is-temu-so-cheap-for-shopping",
    "originBody": "Download Windows Speedup Tool to fix errors and make PC run faster Temu is probably one of the cheapest e-commerce stores in the world. However, there has been a lot of speculation as to how they can sell at such a low rate. In this post, we will try to decipher why Temu is so cheap for shopping. Why is Temu so cheap? Following are the various reasons why Temu is so cheap. No Middleman Temu’s partnership Smart Marketing Temu’s dynamic pricing algorithm Incur strategic losses Negotiation capabilities due to purchasing power Strategic use of Temu coupons Let us talk about them in detail. 1] No Middleman One of the reasons why Temu can offer such an affordable price is that it has eliminated all the middlemen, and the only communication that’s prevalent is between the seller and the customer. Due to this, any charges that the middleman would have taken will not be added to the final price of the product. Not just that, it also offers a transparent and efficient shopping experience. 2] Temu’s partnership You can just cut the middleman and call it a day. There are a lot of shenanigans involved in the whole process that Temu has streamlined and made cost-effective. Temu guarantees that anything purchased on its website is pretty secure as it is PCI-certified, which is the highest level of payment link security you can have. You can also use PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay to transact on Temu. They have also partnered with some logistics company that ensures that your product is delivered on time. Because of all this, they have been able to cut down a few corners. 3] Smart Marketing One of the things a lot of brands struggle with is marketing. Temu has been able to do this in a very smart and cost-effective manner. They have two programs- Temu Affiliant and Temu Popular games. Here, one can share the app with their acquaintances and make a commission out of it. Not just you, but the friend with whom you have shared the link will also get a 50% discount on their friend order. 4] Temu’s dynamic pricing algorithm Temu has been able to control the cost of the items because of the fact that they use a dynamic pricing algorithm. This enables Temu to study many factors, such as supply and demand of a particular product, market rate, and requirement at this point in time. Due to this, Temu can ensure competitive pricing, especially during a certain period. So, if you are an avid shopper, Temu will seem a lot more cheaper to you if you can wait for a little longer. 5] Incur strategic losses Temu’s willingness to incur losses by lowering the prices for a certain period by lowering the price and making up for it, in the long run, enables it to grab the market so quickly. As per reports from Wired, up until now, Temu losses somewhere around $30 per order as it is trying to capture the market. That’s not a bad thing for users. 6] Negotiation capabilities due to purchasing power Because Temu has an enormous fan base and can purchase goods in bulk, it can negotiate with the vendors to get the lowest price. This is not a privilege that all e-commerce websites can enjoy, and most certainly not the new one. Lowering the price allowed Temu to increase its sales, and because of this, it can maintain that low price. 7] Strategic use of Temu coupons Temu has used the coupon codes quite strategically. It encourages users to do bulk orders, so if you buy something that costs $100, you will get $40 off $150 in your next order. And this cycle continues. These were some of the reasons why Temu has been so successfully able to sell at low prices and gain customers. Read: How to stop annoying Temu ads everywhere? Why does Temu give free stuff?
