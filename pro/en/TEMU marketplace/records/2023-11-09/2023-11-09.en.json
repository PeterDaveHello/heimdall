Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian Online shopping Shop like a billionaire? I bought six items from Temu – the app that’s sweeping the world Amid the cost of living crisis, China’s answer to Amazon is proving wildly popular, with more than 100m app downloads this year. But are the items any good? Hilary Osborne @hilaryosborne Thu 9 Nov 2023 05.00 EST T he adverts may be following you around the internet. Some are for practical things: reusable sandwich wrappers, rechargeable torches, T-shirts. The rest are far less practical: plush toys shaped like cups of bubble tea, teaspoons shaped like shovels, plastic covers for TV remote controls. What unites them all is that, on the face of it, they cost next to nothing. At a time when even your local poundshop has put up its prices, the Chinese online marketplace Temu – pronounced tee-moo – seems to offer every low- to mid-priced consumer item you could ever need. Its “£1 or less” section goes on for pages and pages. Its success has been swift: it is currently the most downloaded app in the UK and US and has had more than 100m downloads in the US and Europe since January. The idea of shipping items – many of which we don’t need – halfway around the world does not feel very environmentally friendly, but it is clearly attracting consumers. “We are in a cost of living crisis and people are looking for anything to save a bit of money,” says Miya Knights, the publisher of Retail Technology magazine and the co-author of a book about Amazon. “Everyone likes a bargain and Temu ticks those boxes.” The website promises you can “shop like a billionaire”; while it’s unclear whether Elon Musk and friends buy many sets of 89p insoles, it offers those of us with less cash the chance to spend without breaking the bank. On the face of it, you could get a new dress and shoes for just over a fiver, throw in a faux crocodile-skin handbag for another 58p and have the whole lot delivered to your door free of charge. But it’s not that straightforward, as I found out when I went shopping. I placed two orders on the site – this is what I bought. Lip balms fit for a doll’s house: £2.24 Don’t be fooled … tiny lip balms. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian Imagine a pot of Vaseline then halve it, then halve it again and again until it’s about the size of your thumb. This is what the components of the lip balm set I bought look like in real life. They are tiny. It reminded me of those stories of people who order things on eBay and find themselves with doll’s house furniture. If you read the one-star reviews for the product, you will be warned of its size. But here is a Temu trick: those reviews exist, but are hard to find. The “low rating” button is at the end of a list of filters, so on many pages it doesn’t appear until you press a drop-down arrow. And it is greyed out – as if you can’t click on it. It seems designed to put you off digging too deep. If you do, you will find the warnings: “ABSOLUTELY NOT SOOO SMALLL NOOOO,” and: “Absolutely tiny don’t be fooled by the picture.” Across the site, you are given the impression that everything has a four- or five-star rating. However, sometimes the ratings that appear under the goods are for the retailer, not the item. A dragon T-shirt, for example, appears to get a 4.5 rating based on more than 1,700 reviews, even though there are only two reviews for the product itself, one of which is two stars because the fabric “is like poor-quality sports material” and “it’s poorly cut. A bad fit”. It feels like bad reviews are being disguised. When contacted by the Guardian, Temu admitted that it was “aware of this issue as well. We believe it results in poor user experience for consumers” and said it would be resolving the problem within weeks. Like the rest of my shopping, the lip balms arrived in a plain grey bag with no padding or bubble wrap to protect them, nor any pretty wrapping. “They’ve stripped everything back,” says Knights. “You are not getting any of the bells and whistles that you might with independent retailers.” Socks that make your legs look like a chicken’s: £1.78 ‘They are not great quality – there is a little thread loose and what looks like a bit of a run.’ Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian There are only 15 pairs left, I am told, and a little egg-timer icon adds to the sense that my chance to own these “Funky chicken leg print calf socks” is running out. (Three days later, there are 12 left – clearly, they are not flying off the shelves.) Across the site are messages saying items are “just bought”, “almost sold out” or “just added to cart”. There is always a suggestion that deals have a time limit. There are also holiday deals and offers linked to events, such as the day before New Zealand took on South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final, when items were marked with a “rugby game deals” banner. How legal are these tactics to put pressure on you to spend? Rob Jefferies, an expert in consumer law at Blake Morgan, says that these kind of claims are OK “if they really do have 10 in stock and they are not going to get it back for a couple of months”, but otherwise might fall foul of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Temu says that the stock information it displays is accurate. However, it does keep a “shallower inventory compared to traditional supply chains”, which “allows us to respond more nimbly to market changes”. When the socks arrive, they are not great quality – there is a little thread loose and what looks like a bit of a run – but that is not really a surprise, given the price. Matt Piner, the head of custom retail solutions at GlobalData, says that customers understand and accept poor quality because of the low prices. “It’s an opportunity to treat yourself, but not spend much at all,” he says. “If it doesn’t last very long, then at least you haven’t wasted a lot of money.” Two other pairs of socks I add to my basket later are much better quality. Weird, and with no care instructions or labels, but better quality. “My expectation was low,” says Priscilla, 29, another Temu user. She bought trainers, a small steam iron and a laundry basket after her friend sent her a discount link. “I spent less than £20, so even if it didn’t arrive it would be OK.” It did arrive, but the trainers were too small “and the laundry basket tore after I had used it a couple of times”. Six reusable straws that aren’t the ones in the picture: £3.48 Beware the true cost … the price displayed in search results may just be the baseline cost. Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The Guardian Sometimes the price displayed in search results is the baseline cost for the item, while the picture shows the top-of-the-range item. So, you may think a range of multicoloured metal drinking straws looks good for £3.48, but when you click through you will find that this is the price for silver ones; for those that caught your eye, you will need to shell out £4.38. It may not even be the same product. Search for a mini printer and you will get the impression that you can buy one for less than £3, but click on a listing and you will come to learn that this is the cost of the paper – the pink printer is £19.99. This practice doesn’t seem to break the rules against “bait and switch” – where a consumer is enticed with a low-priced item and then told it is unavailable – but it is very frustrating. Temu said: “If any merchant is found to be using misleading tactics, the problematic product will be delisted.” The printer and the straws were still listed in the same way at the time of publication. I wanted to stop shopping after I added the straws, the lip balms and the socks to my basket. But despite messages across the site advertising “free shipping”, there is a hidden minimum spend – which was £10 in my case. Temu says, confusingly: “We offer free shipping for all orders and there isn’t a single scenario where we charge consumers a shipping fee. However, we do have a minimum order amount requirement for some consumers.” This is easy to miss when you first visit. It is also very opaque. I got to the checkout only to be told there was not enough in my basket to qualify for free shipping. Presumably, Temu is relying on people being emotionally invested in their choices by this point and willing to add to their order to get to the required figure. An unofficial case for Pokémon cards: £6.49 Like many virtual and real marketplaces, Temu has its share of traders selling unlicensed items based on popular brands such as Pokémon and Minecraft. The listings can make for fun reading – one seller is offering an “adorable penguin plush toy” which is the spitting image of the Pokémon Piplup, another “the lovely frog stuffed animals hand puppet”, which is clearly modelled on the Muppets’ Kermit the Frog. The copyright infringement isn’t limited to big companies. Small artists have reported seeing their designs on items for sale on the site. In the US, it has been reported that sellers on Amazon have had their listings ripped off by Temu’s retailers. Temu says it does “consistently prioritise and champion the respect and protection of intellectual property rights” and that it will take legal action against any sellers violating those rights. It also says that its protection of brands “is far superior” to its peers. You have probably noticed that all of the price points are odd. Piner says that these are designed to grab our attention. We might scroll past a shirt for £1.99, but pause if it’s £1.74. “It’s a matter of how do you stand out, how do you get people to stop?” he says. A monstera-shaped spoon that might usually sell for £2.99 to £14: £1.25 ‘Which slotted spoon to pick feels like a lottery.’ Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian There are hundreds of things shaped like cheese plants on the site, including slotted spoons. It is impossible to tell if all of these spoons are the same – they look to be, but are listed at a range of prices below £3, and the original prices being claimed vary even more widely, from £2.99 to £7.99. Every listing I have seen on Temu suggests that the item is being sold at a discount from a considerably higher original price. The UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) calls these higher prices “reference prices” and has rules that say they must reflect how much the item is generally sold for. Jefferies says if the ASA challenged a seller, the seller would have to prove that the items had previously sold at that price. Temu says that its sellers list products in different countries at the same time: “The ‘original price’ is typically set based on the prevailing market conditions and the merchant’s grasp of the competitive scene. Price discrepancies might occur due to shifts in the market or if the primary country targeted during the listing differs.” Back to the spoons. Choosing which to order is difficult: are they all the same? Do I go for the cheapest, or will a slightly more expensive one prove better? It feels like a lottery. The spoon arrives with a label describing it as a “jungle” spoon and saying it is designed by Elinor Portnoy. On the face of it, this makes it the same one that John Lewis is selling for £14 from a company called Ototo. When contacted by the Guardian, Portnoy said that Ototo has the distribution rights for the product. However, she added: “In general, when products are manufactured in China, the factory or agent, which has the original computer-aided design, plastic injection mould and technical capability, can produce as many items as they wish, or alternatively share the original design with other manufacturers and suppliers. Legally, small companies with small leverage can’t do much. Intellectual property protection laws in China are subject to the Chinese legal system.” She continued: “If this is the case for the spoon bought on Temu, then at least they gave me credit on the label. The real pain is that often these copies are reduced in quality (that explains the very competitive price, too), which really hurts the original brand’s reputation and floods the market, as well as lowers the product’s perceived value.” Ototo did not respond to requests for comment. Cuddly toy: £4.59 Decisions, decisions … which cuddly toy to pick? Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian In the style of The Generation Game, I ended with a cuddly toy. I went for one that appears to be based on the cartoon We Bare Bears – possibly another copyright infringement. For my final purchase, I could have had a cuddly loaf of bread, a fluffy tardigrade or a suggestively shot bike chain cleaner that looks remarkably like a penis. But I didn’t buy these, despite Temu’s best efforts. Nonetheless, once I had placed my order, I was followed around the internet by Temu ads – and it seemed the products displayed were among the weirdest-looking on the site. Piner says Temu’s attempt to increase its reach means listing unusual items. “They are trying to stand out and go viral,” he says. “Some of their products are very much about catching the eye. If you’re scrolling down a page and there’s one of them in the advert, you stop. Even if you are not going to buy it, you might click through to find out more and then you’re in their ecosystem, you’re in their shop and they can sell you something else.” Temu got into trouble with the ASA recently, which upheld complaints about the “sexual” imagery in several of its adverts, one of which appeared to feature a child in a bikini posing in an adult way. I wonder if the bike chain cleaner ad will go the same way. Temu says it is “drawing inspiration from established websites in the UK to enhance our product design”, which will hopefully lead to a better experience for consumers. Until it does, shopping on Temu will feel more like playing a lucky dip than being a billionaire.

    "originBody": "Talking Points Talking Points: Are Temu and Shein's fashion deals too good to be true? By Esme Murphy, Liz Christy November 8, 2023 / 6:18 PM CST / CBS Minnesota Talking Points Preview: Nov. 8, 2023 Talking Points Preview: Nov. 8, 2023 03:54 MINNEAPOLIS — One survey says consumers will spend on average $985 dollars on holiday items this year. But with inflation and interest rates high, low prices are a huge draw, and no one has lower prices than two relatively new retail giants Temu and Shein. Tonight in Talking Points, Esme Murphy learns more about the companies and finds out if the low prices are for real. And what about quality? Talking Points: Are Temu and Shein's fashion deals too good to be true? (part 1) 05:27 Originating from China, both Shein and Temu face questions about their business practices including allegations of forced labor. Murphy spoke with Tracy Perlman, an executive producer at WCCO, about her experience as a Shein customer. Perlman was attracted by the convivence of the online shopping app, but says returning a product was her biggest problem. \"I'll buy four or five items, and need to return two of them. And it's just not worth it for me to go to the post office. So I leave them in the bag,\" said Perlman, \"I end up donating them or giving them to friends.\" Perlman isn't alone in her frustrations over returning products. Shein currently has an \"F\" rating from The Better Business Bureau. Meanwhile, its rival Temu has a passing grade with a \"C-.\" Talking Points: Are Temu and Shein's fashion deals too good to be true? (part 2) 07:56 Bao Vang, the Vice President of Communications for the BBB of Minnesota and North Dakota, cites a lack of response by the companies in explaining the grade they received. She also noted the types of complaints they see from customers. \"We're seeing are delayed products and services, bad customer service,\" said Vang, \"meaning there just are the businesses willing to work with the consumer when they see a delay in their product, or not a product at all, or a product that is not as advertised when it shows up to the door.\" These online rivals are competing for your eyes with aggressive promotions on your social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Maha Abouelenein, Managing Director of Digital and Savvy, says they want to claim their stake in the U.S. market. \"I think both of these companies have been very aggressive in trying to take a bite out of the U.S. market apple,\" said Abouelenein. \"(They) really capitalize on consumer behavior, which focuses on shopping online, and they're trying to go in by being affordable or cheaper. And they're really trying to make a dent in the market, and they're they're coming out aggressively in their marketing and in their campaigns.\" Murphy spoke with George John, a leading marketing professor with the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, about how these two giants have succeeded in getting their names out, and whether their business models succeed. \"You cannot turn on your phone without seeing another ad for downloading the app,\" said John. \"Think of them as the successors to Zara and H&M who invented this notion of fast fashion. Which means that they turn over their styles, and what they have to offer several times a year, these people turn over their styles and what they have to offer a couple of times a month. So they've ratcheted that velocity up. And what they're trying to do is to have incredibly low prices, which they accomplish by beating up on the small suppliers.\" Talking Points: Are Temu and Shein's fashion deals too good to be true? (part 3) 08:42 We reached out to Temu and Shein about the allegations. Murphy spoke with a representative of Temu: How can Temu make items that are so cheap? Temu can achieve competitively priced products by connecting consumers directly with cost-efficient producers. By eliminating multiple middlemen and shipping directly from factories to consumers, customers benefit from wholesale prices from the source. Transportation and warehousing are among the biggest costs in retail, costs that consumers end up paying for. With a direct-from-factory model, Temu reduces the number of times products must be shipped and stored and the substantial cost savings are passed onto consumers in the form of lower prices. Additionally, when tens of thousands of consumers combine their purchases, they create bulk shipments. This volume makes what would be high shipping costs for individual items much more economical. Consequently, the gross profit from these products covers the shipping costs, allowing the merchants on our platform to maintain a fair margin. Does Temu stand behind the quality of its products? As an online marketplace, Temu connects consumers with third-party sellers that list and sell their products through our platform. Temu works closely with our merchants to offer quality merchandise to our millions of consumers. If any issues with quality arise, customers can promptly contact our customer service team, which will investigate each concern swiftly and comprehensively. Customers can shop with full peace of mind on Temu with our purchase protection program, which ensures buyers are refunded if their orders don't match the item descriptions or photos, the products arrived damaged, or couldn't be delivered, arrived lateor were lost in transit. Temu has one of the industry's most generous return polices with a 90-day window for customers to seek refunds for items. Customers can seek help by contacting our 24/7 customer service through our website or app. For more information on the Purchase Protection Program. How do you return something to Temu? If an item is eligible for return and refund, you may return it within the return window of 90 days after the day of purchase. You can make a return by following these steps: I. Go to your Temu account on Temu.com or on the app to request a refund. If you do not have a Temu account, please click on \"Save your Order\" in your Temu order email to make a return. II. Find the relevant order in \"Your Orders\" and click on the \"Return/Refund\" button. III. Select the item(s) you would like to return and the reason for the return. Depending on the reason you selected, you may be required to provide further information related to the order. After you provide the required information, click the \"Next Step\" button to proceed. IV. If there is no need to return your item, then your final step is simply to select your refund method. You may choose to receive your refund as a Temu credit balance or be credited back via your original payment method. Make your selection and click \"Submit\". V. If you need to return your item(s), you will have the option to choose your return and refund methods. After you submit the request, we will provide you with a return label so that you can return the item(s). Return shipping is free on your first return for every order within 90 days from the date of purchase. VI. After placing all the return items in one package, please print and tape the return label we provided onto the outside of the package. Send your package back from the nearest USPS/UPS location and you're done! VII. You can check the refund status of your item(s) on your order details page or through Temu's SMS/Email/Push notifications. For more details on returns, please visit our customer service and support center at https://www.temu.com/return-and-refund-policy.html. How quickly do you get something if you buy it on Temu? Typically 7-15 business days, but customers have reported receiving orders in fewer than 5 days. Temu is constantly improving on delivery times. You can also see the expected delivery window on the Temu website and app. How quickly is the money returned to your credit card if you return something? Depending on your financial institution, refunds can take 5-14 business days (up to 30 days) to be credited to your original payment account. You can also choose to accept Temu credits instead of a refund to the original payment method. Refunds to Temu credits are faster than your original payment method. Temu and Shein are rivals, but consumers may lump them together – what would you say to consumers who might be confused about that? First and foremost, Temu is not a fast fashion company like Shein. Right from the start, Temu began as a comprehensive e-commerce platform that encompasses a vast range of product categories. While we do offer a selection of clothing, our primary strength lies in daily necessities. We stock millions of items, ensuring we cater to nearly every facet of a consumer's life. In total, Temu carries 30 major product categories, spanning over 250 sub-categories. This includes everything from apparel to pet supplies and home improvement tools. We understand that it's easy to compare Temu with Shein due to its similar prices in the clothing category; however, our business models and target consumers are very different. Temu's model is a pure marketplace platform with all third-party independent sellers. Temu does not initiate production or own any brands. Fast fashion companies release thousands of fashion designs daily under their own brands. They contract with factories to produce garments that are sold under their own brand names. This contract manufacturing is key for \"fast fashion\" business models and does not describe Temu at all. Are the allegations of copyright infringement and abusive labor practices (including child labor) that have been alleged against Shein also true for Temu? Though Temu is a young company with just a year under our belt, we've always prioritized following the rules and regulations. Our commitment to full compliance has been unwavering since inception and underpins all of our business activities. In terms of our approach to copyright infringement, Temu is a marketplace where third-party sellers offer their products directly to consumers. Each product listing on our platform is created and managed by these independent merchants. Within Temu, we've set up a specialized system dedicated to the protection of intellectual property rights and an associated reporting structure. These systems act as swift, responsive mechanisms to address any intellectual property infringement claims made by rights holders or consumers. We take immediate and robust actions to rectify any such issues. When we receive reports of infringement, we promptly investigate each case and take appropriate actions, from removing product listings and images to terminating vendor accounts. Depending on their level of infringement, merchants can be permanently banned from our platform. When they are terminated or banned, their merchandise listings will be removed as well. On the issue of labor, before setting up their stores and listing products on Temu, every seller has to sign an agreement. This Third Party Code of Conduct stands as a pledge to maintain lawful and compliant business operations, and adhere strictly to the legal standards and regulations of their specific markets. The Code mandates that anyone doing business with Temu must strictly comply with all regulatory standards and compliance requirements. The use of forced, penal, or child labor is strictly prohibited. Employment by all our merchants and suppliers must be strictly voluntary. They shall respect the freedom of association and workers' rights to collectively bargain. Temu's merchants, suppliers, and other third parties must pay their employees and contractors on time and must comply with all applicable local wage and hours laws. Our current standards and practices are no different from those of major U.S. e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, eBay, and Etsy. Temu says it is based in Boston, but isn't it true that Temu is owned by the Chinese-based company TDD Holdings which is based in the Cayman Islands? Temu launched in the US as an online marketplace and is headquartered in Boston, MA. Temu is part of the Nasdaq-listed e-commerce group, PDD Holdings Inc. American consumers have been warned of allegations that TikTok may be using our information and even spying on behalf of the Chinese government – should Temu consumers be worried about that? At Temu, we prioritize the protection of privacy and are transparent about our data practices. As part of Nasdaq-listed PDD Holdings Inc., an e-commerce group with a market capitalization of $140 billion, we are subject to extensive regulatory and supervisory oversight. We collect information with a clear and singular purpose: to provide and continually enhance our products and services for our users. When disclosing data collection practices, we adhere to the principle of maximum disclosure. If there's a possibility that data will be collected in any given scenario, we disclose it. This is in line with the requirements for developers set by application marketplaces like Apple's App Store. However, when it comes to the actual collection and use of data, we follow the principle of minimality, meaning we only collect and use data necessary for specific, justified scenarios. Data of Temu U.S. users will be stored by default in the infrastructure of Microsoft Azure or a similar cloud service provider in the U.S. Temu vendors appear to be from all over the world, should American consumers be worried about the security of their personal information? Consumers can shop with peace of midn on Temu, which is a TrustedSite Certified Secure Site that follows the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) when handling card data by encrypting data in storage and transmission. Temu does not sell customer data and does not share payment information with our merchants or partners. In addition, Temu works with major payment networks with their own security and authentication protocols for added protection, including Visa Secure, MasterCard ID Check, American Express SafeKey, Discover ProtectBuy, and JCB J/Secure. That said, we are aware of scam websites that have been impersonating Temu to defraud customers who thought they were shopping on Temu. Temu sued 20 scam sites in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on Oct. 30 for running phishing and online fraud schemes while posing as Temu. We will take swift legal action to defend our rights and shield our customers from such malicious and unlawful activities. We also advise customers to only download apps from Apple's App Store and Google Play Store, and not to click on suspicious links on social media. Also just found out that BBB rates Temu a C-. Is there a response to that? Temu has been actively engaged with BBB to respond to concerns raised by consumers. On Temu's C- rating by the BBB,please note that the length of time a business is in operation holds significant weightage in the calculation of the rating. Temu began operations in September 2022, or just over a year ago. For context, Shein, an online retailer that is often compared with Temu and has a much longer operating history, is rated F by the BBB. We'd also like to point out that Temu's BBB customer review rating of 2.57/5 should also be considered in relation to its industry peers and not in isolation to give your viewers the necessary context. Temu's customer review rating is higher than Amazon (1.16), eBay (1.08) and Walmart (1.08), three companies with a much longer track record of operations. In terms of the number of customer complaints, Temu's 1,159 cases compares with Amazon's 16,895 complaints, eBay with 5,214 and 4,021 for Walmart in the past 12 months. In other words, Amazon has more than 14 times the number of complaints compared to Temu, while eBay has more than 4 times and Walmart more than 3 times more complaints versus Temu. Temu has a 100% response rate and resolved all complaints. In addition, Temu has a 3.3 star rating on Trustpilot, which is also higher than the ratings for eBay, Etsy, and Amazon. A representative of Shein also responded to Murphy's questions: How can Shein make clothes that are so cheap? Does Shein stand behind the quality of its products? Unlike the traditional supply-driven model, SHEIN's on-demand model addresses customer preferences more accurately and efficiently. Our digitalized supply chain enables us to address the mismatch between customer demand and merchandise supply. It entails testing new products by launching them in small initial batches of 100 to 200 items and evaluating customer feedback in real time. We then restock products that are in demand, ensuring our customers get what they want, when they want it and at the price they deserve. How do you return something to Shein? How quickly is the money returned to your credit card if you return something? Details about SHEIN's returns policy and process can be found here. TEMU and Shein are rivals, but consumers may lump them together – what would you say to consumers who might be confused about that? SHEIN's on-demand business model and our relationships with small and medium sized suppliers allow us to respond to customer preferences with precision and speed in a way that sets us apart from other companies. This agility enables us to continue providing accessible, affordable and individualized fashion and lifestyle choices at prices that our customers love. SHEIN is laser focused on being customer-first and delivering the best shopping experience for our customers. Are the allegations of frequent copyright infringement and abusive labor practices (including child labor) true? SHEIN takes all claims of infringement seriously. It is not our intent to infringe anyone's valid intellectual property and it is not our business model to do so. SHEIN suppliers and Marketplace sellers are required to comply with company policy and certify their products do not infringe third-party IP. We continue to invest in and improve our product review process. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously, and we are committed to respecting human rights and adhering to local laws in each and every market we operate in. Our third-party suppliers must adhere to a strict code of conduct that is aligned to the International Labour Organizations core conventions. In April, we announced that SHEIN will invest $70mil over the next five years to empower our ecosystem of third-party manufacturing suppliers, and the workers within. Through this recently announced additional $55mil investment, which builds upon SHEIN's previous $15mil investment in the Supplier Community Empowerment Program (SCEP) announced in December 2022, we will provide upskilling initiatives for workers, facilities enhancements, investments in new technologies, and services for the communities within the supplier ecosystem. Shein is obviously a privately held company that originated in China, American consumers have been warned of allegations that TikTok may be using our information and even spying on behalf of the Chinese government – should Shein consumers be worried about that? Data security and privacy are top priorities at SHEIN.

    "originBody": "Home / Today's Market / SPECIAL REPORT 5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Before They Skyrocket WISH Stock: ContextLogic Surges 20% as It Explores Strategic Alternatives Can efforts to reduce expenses and operate efficiently turn things around at ContextLogic? 19h ago · November 8, 2023 By Thomas Yeung and InvestorPlace Earnings Advertisement ContextLogic (WISH) stock rose more than 20% post Q3 earnings release The company reported a 52% drop in year-over-year revenue. ContextLogic’s board is exploring strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com ContextLogic (NASDAQ:WISH), the owner of the Wish.com e-commerce website, saw its stock surge more than 20% on Wednesday after management announced the board was exploring a range of strategic alternatives for the business. Though actual Q3 revenues of $60 million beat Wall Street expectations by 4.6%, these sales figures represented a steep 52% decrease from last year’s Q3 revenue of $125 million. This year-over-year downturn was experienced across different fronts of the company, including Core Marketplace revenues, Product Boost revenues, and Logistics revenues, all of which reported significant declines. Losses per share of $3.35 missed analyst estimates for a loss of $3.31. Wish.com has struggled in recent months after a considerable exodus of users. Rivals like Pinduoduo (NYSE:PDD)-owned Temu have taken market share. InvestorPlace.com’s Terel Miles notes that ContextLogic is also quickly running out of cash. However, shares of ContextLogic are surging as markets digested news of the company’s intention to “explore a range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” Free cash flow was reduced from -$100 million in the third quarter of 2022 to -$86 million, and management also struck a cautiously positive tone about performance. “We closed the third quarter with revenue in-line with our expectations and adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our guidance,” said Wish CEO Joe Yan. Despite the decrease in revenues and an operational loss, Yan highlighted the company’s efforts towards “efficiency and expense discipline.” Looking forward, ContextLogic is predicting a Q4 revenue in the range of $50 million to $60 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss in the range of $55 million to $65 million. Sales figures represent between a 51% to 59% decline from prior-year levels. It remains to be seen whether management’s strategic reviews and proposed initiatives will steer the company toward better performance and stronger returns in the coming quarters.

    "title": "The Pros and Cons of Temu: Affordable Shopping with Hidden Caveats",
    "originLink": "https://gillettnews.com/business/the-rise-of-temu-affordable-shopping-or-hidden-caveats/214167/",
    "originBody": "Since its launch earlier this year, Temu, the Chinese online marketplace, has gained unprecedented popularity, becoming the most downloaded app in both the UK and US. With over 100 million downloads in Europe and the US since January, Temu has captivated consumers with its extensive range of low- to mid-priced goods. At a time when cost-saving measures are at the forefront of consumers’ minds, Temu offers a vast selection of products that are seemingly affordable. However, upon closer inspection, shoppers are discovering hidden caveats that challenge the notion of snagging a bargain. Upon browsing Temu’s website, users are lured by the “£1 or less” section, where a multitude of everyday items are available at incredibly low prices. From fashion accessories to household products, the options seem endless. The appeal of shopping like a billionaire without breaking the bank is undeniably enticing. However, the reality is not as straightforward as it initially appears. To understand the potential pitfalls of shopping on Temu, let’s delve into the customer experience. Take the example of a user who purchased a lip balm set. Expecting a standard-sized product, they were astounded to receive minuscule lip balms that resembled dollhouse accessories. It quickly became apparent that the size of the product was not accurately conveyed on the website, as evidenced by buried and hard-to-find low-rating reviews. Temu’s filtering system, with the “low rating” button conveniently hidden from view, seemed designed to discourage users from uncovering critical reviews. This lack of transparency extends beyond product sizes. Ratings on the website sometimes misrepresent the quality of the items, with reviews for the retailer rather than the specific product. Customers can be misled by inflated ratings, only to discover subpar quality or misleading descriptions upon their purchases’ arrival. Temu has acknowledged this issue, promising to resolve it promptly to enhance the user experience. Furthermore, the shopping experience itself is stripped of the usual flourishes. Packages arrive in plain grey bags, devoid of any protective padding or wrapping. Temu has focused on providing affordable products, but it seems to have neglected the added bonuses that independent retailers often offer. While Temu’s appeal lies in the affordability of its products, it is crucial for consumers to be aware of potential drawbacks. The allure of low prices can sometimes blind customers to the compromises they may have to make, such as lesser quality or unimpressive packaging. However, for those who understand the trade-offs and are willing to accept them, Temu can still be a valuable shopping platform. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q: Is Temu a reliable online marketplace? A: Temu has gained immense popularity and boasts millions of downloads since its launch. However, customers should be aware of potential drawbacks such as misrepresented ratings and subpar product quality. Q: Are the products on Temu really as affordable as they seem? A: Temu offers a wide range of low-priced items, but customers should exercise caution and carefully review product descriptions, customer reviews, and ratings before making a purchase. Q: Does Temu offer a satisfactory shopping experience? A: While Temu focuses on affordability, it may lack the added extras and personalized touches customers receive from independent retailers. Packages from Temu may arrive with minimal packaging or protective padding. Q: Is Temu environmentally friendly? A: Temu’s business model involves shipping items globally, which raises concerns about its environmental impact. Customers should consider the sustainability implications of ordering nonessential items from overseas.
