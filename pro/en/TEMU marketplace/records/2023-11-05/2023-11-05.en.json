Molly often uses her social media channels to share her hauls, reviews and more “just for fun”. 6 Temu is an online marketplace which sells clothes, perfume and homewareCredit: tiktok/@reviewsbymolly 6 Molly found a dupe for Black OpiumCredit: tiktok/@reviewsbymolly 6 The Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume costs a whopping £104 elsewhereCredit: Boots - Marc Jacobs And in one such video, she produced a package from Temu, a shopping app that has ultra-cheap products. Cutting the plastic wrapper off, she first produced a dupe for Yves Saint Laurent’s Black Opium, which costs £77 from Boots. Named Blvck Opens, she removed the dupe out of its packaging to reveal the bottle is almost exactly the same as the original. This set her back just £5.18. She then revealed she’d found a dupe for Marc Jacob’s £104 Daisy Ever So Fresh Eau de Parfum. Called Little Daisy, the bottle of the dupe was exactly the same once again and cost just £10 on the Temu app. And the third dupe was for Carolina Herrera’s Good Girl Eau de Parfum, which usually costs £60 from Boots. The Cool Girl dupe had the exact same bottle as well and cost her £5.45, making it a cheaper alternative.

People were quick to comment as one person asked: “Smell and last the same?” TikTok user @reviewsbymolly replied: “Smell is super similar in all of them, but no, I don’t think they last quite as long as the name brands”. There’s been much talk about whether Temu is a legitimate brand as the online megastore is squaring up to Amazon. The marketplace offers just about any product you can think of for ultra-low prices While Temu’s prices are cheap, many new customers can actually get products for free through the retailer's promotional campaigns. The website is legitimate in that customers usually get what they order, but there are some hang ups. Goods can take weeks before they reach your doorstep and according to the Better Business Bureau, an American non-profit, most complaints from Temu customers are over the long shipping times, low-quality items, and poor customer service.
