In Japan and South Korea, Temu has overtaken Shein by staying at the top of shopping app rankings in those locations for a longer period of time, according to data.ai analysis shared with CNBC. Temu is backed by Nasdaq-listed Chinese tech giant PDD Holdings, which also owns China-based e-commerce app Pinduoduo. A package from Temu is seen in front of a screen with the Temu logo. (Photo by Nikos Pekiaridis/NurPhoto via Getty Images) NurphotoNurphotoGetty Images Chinese low-cost retailer Temu is dominating app stores in Japan and South Korea in its category, dethroning rival Shein after its successful expansion in Western markets. \"Temu has rapidly expanded its footprint beyond the U.S. and into a number of international geographies and we believe is now available in 40+ countries ... where we continue to see opportunities for growth in the quarters ahead,\" said Goldman Sachs in an Oct. 4 report. The investment firm estimated that Temu, which is owned by PDD Holdings, \"now generates more than $1 billion of [monthly transaction value]\" and expects \"continued growth into second half 2023.\" Its rival Shein was estimated to be on track to hit $30 billion in transaction value in 2022, according to media reports. Temu has overtaken Shein in Japan and South Korea by staying at the top of shopping app rankings in those locations for a longer period of time, according to data.ai analysis shared with CNBC. Since its July launch in Japan to Nov. 2, \"Temu has ranked #1 by daily iOS & Google Play shopping app downloads in Japan for 101 days out of 124 days,\" said the app analytics and data company. By comparison, Shein spent just 17 days topping the two app stores in the same period in Japan. Temu was the fastest to reach four million downloads in Japan, taking around 121 days, compared to Shein which took 155 days, according to data.ai. Japanese marketplace Mercari took 427 days and Amazon 660 days, the data showed. Similarly, in South Korea, Temu ranked No. 1 by daily iOS & Google Play shopping app downloads for 65 days out of 93 days from Aug. 1 to Nov. 2, overtaking Alibaba 's AliExpress (25 days) while Shein ranks among the top 5. Among the top shopping apps in South Korea, Temu was the fastest to reach 2 million downloads at around 88 days. Shein took 382 days while AliExpress took 366 days to hit the same milestone. Temu and Shein's rivalry extend outside the e-commerce space to the courtroom. Shein sued Temu in December over intellectual-property infringement while Temu accused Shein in July of threatening and forcing manufacturers into exclusivity agreements. But recent documents showed that both parties have applied to end their lawsuits against each other. Temu's rise Temu is backed by Nasdaq-listed Chinese tech giant PDD Holdings, which also owns China-based e-commerce app Pinduoduo. Launched in the U.S. in September 2022, Temu was PDD's first major push overseas and quickly found success among budget-conscious consumers. In just a few weeks, the Chinese ecommerce app rose to the top of app stores and subsequently expanded rapidly across countries such as Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the U.K. Headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, the Chinese online retailer focuses on selling made-in-China goods, from fashion to household products, at low prices to overseas consumers. Similarly, Shein relies on contracted manufacturers, mostly in China, to design, produce and ship its low-priced products. Temu made its foray into Asia through Japan and South Korea in July. It then entered the Philippines on Aug. 26 before launching in Malaysia on Sept. 8. WATCH NOW VIDEO16:23 How fast-growing e-commerce app Temu makes money from $10 smartwatches \"We believe the main reason for [PDD's] 131% year-on-year growth in transaction service revenues and 135% year-on-year growth in cost of goods sold in second quarter 2023 was related to fast ramp of Temu performance,\" Citi analysts said in a Aug. 29 report. The platform has been expanding rapidly since its launch by leveraging its parent company's strength in supply chain and marketing. \"Much of PDD's incremental investment dollars have been deployed to make Temu happen,\" said Bernstein analysts in a Sept. 15 report, adding that Temu's multi-million Super Bowl advertisement \"solidified Temu's mind share for a number of its target customers.\" \"We believe that Temu's rapid rise in popularity was supported by the company's elevated marketing investments, its low prices and focus on promotions, and to the success of its referral campaigns,\" said Berstein's analysts. The analysts said they expect to see \"an increase in the number of active users and order volume\" in Temu contributing to non-U.S. transaction value and \"increasingly contributing to growth from here.\" In June, the U.S. House Select Committee alleged that Shein and Temu violated import tariff law by importing goods into the U.S. without paying import duties or making shipments subject to human rights reviews.

    "originLink": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/temu-vs-amazon-which-shopping-site-is-best-for-your-buying-needs/",
    "originBody": "business Why you can trust ZDNET ZDNET independently tests and researches products to bring you our best recommendations and advice. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Our process Home Business E-Commerce Temu vs. Amazon: Which shopping site is best for your buying needs? Temu or Amazon? The holidays are approaching and sales are popping up everywhere. Our buying guide helps you decide what products -- and when -- you should purchase from one site or the other. Written by Jada Jones, Associate Editor Nov. 9, 2023 at 11:12 a.m. PT Jada Jones/ZDNET If you're even a casual online shopping fan, chances are you've placed plenty of orders on Amazon. If you're downright obsessive about online shopping, you're likely familiar with Temu, a digital marketplace for low-priced goods. Also: Is Temu legit? What to know before you place an order If you've paid close attention, you've noticed that some products on Amazon are also on Temu. And if you're a savvy shopper preparing to order holiday gifts, you may be wondering: which online marketplace is the best? Here are some guidelines to consider when deciding whether to buy something from Amazon or Temu. You should buy from Temu if... Screenshot by Jada Jones/ZDNET 1. You're looking for tech accessories Many people have smartphones, headphones, laptops, and smartwatches in their daily use rotation. Many people like to personalize those products with cases, stickers, wristlets, phone stands, and other accessories. Also: 5 tech gadgets I never leave home without If you like changing up your phone case or smartwatch band frequently, buying multiple Otterbox phone cases or Apple-branded Apple Watch bands can be a pricey luxury. Although you should invest in at least one sturdy case or accessory, experimenting with colorful accessories can be a fun way to express yourself through your devices. Most people go to Amazon to find a wider assortment of accessories than they'd find in the tech department of big box stores, such as Walmart, Target, or Best Buy. But Temu has an even wider assortment of tech accessories than Amazon. Also: The best early Black Friday deals under $100 You can find all kinds of tech accessories on Temu, and sometimes you'll see the same accessories advertised on Amazon. However, on Temu, you'll find them for much cheaper. You must purchase at least $10 worth of items (that's about four iPhone cases, based on Temu pricing), and then you're guaranteed free shipping. I bought cases for my iPhone 14, MacBook Air, and AirPods Pro on Temu and have only been unhappy with two of the nine iPhone cases I purchased. Temu has more cases that protect the bezels around the iPhone camera, an area that tends to go unprotected in most Amazon iPhone cases. My favorite iPhone 14 and AirPods Pro (2nd gen) cases I bought from Temu. Jada Jones/ZDNET There are thousands of AirPods Pro cases to choose from on Temu, ranging from clear cases and cases with cute characters to cases that look like miniature Vaseline containers. My colleague, David Gewirtz, bought a few non-tech products from Temu and was pleasantly surprised with what he received. David offers some buying tips as well, so be sure to check out his article. I would not recommend any charging stations or cords from Temu for Apple devices. I like to stick to accessories that don't charge or interfere with my phone or AirPods' batteries because I don't want to risk damaging them with faulty charging accessories. There may be third-party chargers on Temu that won't damage your device's battery, but I don't like to risk it. Also: The best early Black Friday Apple deals 2023 If you purchase third-party Lighting or USB-C charging cables, or MagSafe 3-in-1 charging stations, you should ensure they have a \"Made for Apple\" label. This label means the manufacturer went the extra mile to ensure their third-party charging accessories are certified by Apple and safe for your devices. You can search Apple's database for which brands manufacture accessories that received a \"Made for Apple\" label. You can also peruse ZDNET's best USB-C chargers list, which includes cables certified by Apple. If you have an Android phone, you should check your phone's charging standards, which you can find online on your smartphone manufacturer's official device spec sheet. Most Android phones use the USB-PD charging standard, so most third-party chargers should work fine as long as their wattage is compatible with your smartphone. 2. You can wait a few weeks for your items Many of the items on Temu come from China, meaning that US shoppers will have to wait about 10 days from purchase to receive their Temu packages. Sometimes, the items will come sooner; other times, they will appear on your doorstep at the last minute. So, if you're pinched for time, I wouldn't recommend buying from Temu. Also: 5 ways Google can help you score deals this holiday season I'll give you a scenario: a few months ago, someone stole my iPhone 11. Unsurprisingly, I went to the Apple store to buy a replacement. I was desperate for a case on my new phone, but I couldn't wait 10 days for the phone cases I bought from Temu later that day. So, I rush-shipped a case from Amazon to have some protection on my phone until my cases from Temu came in. I got my Otterbox from Amazon in two days, but I don't plan on buying any more cases from anywhere other than Temu. 3. You want to experiment with \"dupes\" Temu has many lookalike products, or \"dupes\", on its platform. However, if you see people online reviewing \"AirPods Max from Temu\", they may look like AirPods Max, but the seller cannot advertise them as real AirPods Max. Most of the products you see on Temu that resemble authentic, name-brand tech products are not legitimate. When I reviewed some HP and Lenovo products from Temu in June, an HP representative told me the company could not verify whether the HP products on Temu were \"from an authorized reseller or are authentic HP devices.\" Also: I bought 4 brand-name tech gadgets on Temu for work. Here's how it went Since that time, all the devices Temu advertised as HP products are no longer available on the site. That said, some tech products on Temu will work with your devices. The \"AirPods Max\" you see on Temu may connect to your devices and sound decent, but you'll miss out on many of the features real ones deliver, and they may not offer you much longevity. So, if you're OK with trying your luck on Temu dupes and want a pair of \"AirPods Max\" for only $11, Temu is your place. SHOP AT TEMU Temu Temu is an online megastore offering items from car accessories to small kitchen appliances and everything in between. View at Temu You should buy from Amazon if... Screenshot by Jada Jones/ZDNET 1. You're a last-minute gift-giver If you have an Amazon Prime account (these days, who doesn't?), your items are eligible for same-day, one-day, and two-day shipping. If you're buying a last-minute gift for a friend's birthday or anniversary, your best bet -- aside from visiting a physical store -- is ordering from Amazon with Prime shipping. Also: The 10 best tech gifts of 2023 Still, even without a Prime membership, Amazon boasts faster shipping times. All Amazon customers can expect most items to arrive in four to five business days. So, even if you're a week away from giving your gift, you'll get it faster from Amazon than from Temu. However, if you're not a Prime member, you'll have to purchase at least $35 worth of products to quality for Amazon's free shipping. 2. You're looking for reliable tech If you want to buy a reputable piece of tech, choose Amazon. Amazon is a reliable seller whether you're buying refurbished or brand-new tech. Amazon has a comprehensive open-box policy, and Amazon Renewed products are tested, inspected, and given a rating and price based on their condition. For example, a brand-new 2022 13-inch MacBook Air with an M2 chip, 10-core GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB SSD costs $1,299 at Apple. Also: Every holiday return policy from Amazon, Walmart, Target, and more compared The same laptop from Amazon Renewed is $979 and in excellent condition, meaning the screen has no scratches, and the body has no signs of significant cosmetic damage. The refurbished MacBook Air also comes with the same accessories as a brand-new MacBook Air. Brand-new tech often goes on sale at Amazon, and refurbished tech can be returned and refunded within 90 days of purchase. 3. You want easier returns Most items on Amazon can be returned within 30 days of receipt. Although Temu has a forgiving 90-day return policy, it's much more convenient to return items to Amazon. Also: Amazon's holiday gift to you: Extended returns signal start of shopping season You can return items purchased from Amazon at an Amazon Hub locker in your area, or you can drop your returned items off at your nearest UPS Store, Kohl's, Whole Foods, Staples, or Amazon Store. You don't have to worry about printing labels or shipping boxes, as Amazon will provide you with a QR code to present to the attendant at the return location. After you scan the QR code, you give your items to the attendant, and you should receive a refund soon after. SHOP AT AMAZON Amazon Amazon is an online marketplace that offers fast shipping and low prices to subscribers. View at Amazon ZDNET's Buying Advice The bottom line: if you're looking for legitimate, name-brand products, consult Amazon. But in the tech accessories department, Temu holds the crown. Recently, people took to TikTok to accuse Temu of stealing their payment information after finding their bank accounts drained of funds. Amazon, meanwhile, has had its fair share of payment scams. I've never encountered these issues, probably because I've never supplied any online retailer with my debit card information. Also: How to use Apple Pay in stores and online I recommend never using your debit card when completing transactions online. Instead, you can buy a Visa or Amazon gift card, load money onto it, and use that. Or, you can use Apple Pay or PayPal on Temu, which are less likely to be hacked. I recommend using Apple Pay or PayPal on any online store you buy from if the gift card method isn't viable. Apple Pay doesn't store your card information on Apple's servers, and PayPal offers $0 liability for items charged to your bank account that you didn't purchase. It's complicated for bad actors to hack a gift card, and should they succeed, they can't access the funds in your bank accounts. Happy shopping!

    "title": "Chinese e-commerce platform Temu fights back against scam sites to protect consumers",
    "originLink": "https://technode.com/2023/11/10/temu-takes-legal-action-against-scam-sites-to-safeguard-consumers/",
    "originBody": "Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNodeâs Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. Temu, the e-commerce platform celebrated for its cut-rate prices, has launched a legal offensive against fraudsters who masquerade as the company. These imposters lure customers into downloading bogus apps that infest devices with malware and pilfer personal data, according to lawsuits filed in the US in the past two weeks. Boston-based Temu, operating under its legal name Whaleco, has filed suit against seven websites accused of deceptively prompting visitors to download a counterfeit app. The aim, the lawsuit claims, is to snatch personal details from Whalecoâs clients, slip malware onto their devices, or hack into them. This legal move, initiated on November 7 in a U.S. court, comes on the heels of Temuâs earlier legal action against twenty websites for trademark violation and orchestrating internet phishing scams to defraud consumers. âFraudsters are posing as Temu on fake apps and websites to scam consumers. This not only damages our reputation but also hurts consumers who were deceived into believing they were engaging with genuine Temu platforms,â said a Temu spokesman.â We will take swift legal action to defend our rights and shield our customers from such malicious and unlawful activities.â In the year since Temu launched in the US, it has soared in popularity, propelled in part by its âShop Like A Billionaireâ Super Bowl commercial. Now, the e-commerce contender has broadened its reach, serving customers in 48 countries, from the UK to Malaysia. Sensor Tower data reveals that Temu broke into the global top 10 most downloaded apps list in the second quarter of 2023, surpassing both its rival Shein and the American titan Amazon in downloads. Further, a data.ai analysis reported by CNBC shows that Temu has outstripped Shein in Japan and South Korea, clinching the top spot in shopping app rankings over an extended stretch. Wendy Chen, a GAM Investments senior investment analyst, points to Temuâs innovative âfully entrusted business modelâ as the engine of its meteoric rise. This model blends direct retail sales with a marketplace for third-party vendors, drawing on the strengths of both. Temu streamlines its operations by sourcing directly from manufacturers, who are tasked merely with shipping to Temuâs global warehouses. The company then takes the reins, overseeing customer acquisition, pricing, logistics, and customer service. This strategy affords Temu the quality control, timely delivery, and customer satisfaction of a first-party model, while it still benefits from the extensive selection and scalability of a third-party model. By connecting factories directly with consumers, Temu not only slashes middlemen expenses but also sidesteps the hazards of overstocking, Chen explains. According to a recent report by Chinese tech media outlet 36 Kr, the US market, the first destination Temu entered, currently contributes 60% of the platformâs overall sales. The same report stated that the platformâs third quarter sales surpassed $5 billion, and the extraordinary pace of growth may allow Temu to exceed its annual GMV target of $15 billion this year. âWe are in a cost-of-living crisis and people are looking for anything to save a bit of money,â Miya Knights, the publisher of Retail Technology magazine, told the Guardian. âEveryone likes a bargain and Temu ticks those boxes.â To be sure, Temuâs popularity has come at a price, with a small group of scammers capitalizing on the companyâs reputation to launch phishing schemes and install malware, according to its lawsuit. Critics have also accused Temu of intrusive data practices, allegations that Temu has sought to dispel by prominently listing the permissions that it seeks from users. In its latest lawsuit, Temu accuses websites such as Dltemuapp.com and temudl.net of mimicking Temuâs domain name and describes them as primarily designed to lure consumers into making purchases or to mislead unsuspecting consumers. âBogus websites like these serve as a platform for various cybercrimes. They could be used to extract sensitive and financial information from duped consumers. They could be used to install malware on peopleâs sites (and/or those of their employers) to steal information or install viruses and serve as leverage for large ransoms,â Temu said in its lawsuit. âIn any of these scenarios, the results would be devastatingâand the harm irreparableâto (Temu) and the public alike,â according to the lawsuit. Meanwhile, Temu has intensified efforts to warn consumers about fake Temu promotions and scams. The company has also advised users of the importance of downloading the official Temu app from the Apple Store and Google Play Store, which have stringent vetting controls.

    "originBody": "âEveryone likes a bargain and Temu ticks those boxesâ â¦ Hilary Osborne with items sheâs ordered from Temu. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian Online shopping Shop like a billionaire? I bought six items from Temu â the app thatâs sweeping the world Amid the cost of living crisis, Chinaâs answer to Amazon is proving wildly popular, with more than 100m app downloads this year. But are the items any good? Hilary Osborne @hilaryosborne Thu 9 Nov 2023 05.00 EST T he adverts may be following you around the internet. Some are for practical things: reusable sandwich wrappers, rechargeable torches, T-shirts. The rest are far less practical: plush toys shaped like cups of bubble tea, teaspoons shaped like shovels, plastic covers for TV remote controls. What unites them all is that, on the face of it, they cost next to nothing. At a time when even your local poundshop has put up its prices, the Chinese online marketplace Temu â pronounced tee-moo â seems to offer every low- to mid-priced consumer item you could ever need. Its âÂ£1 or lessâ section goes on for pages and pages. Its success has been swift: it is currently the most downloaded app in the UK and US and has had more than 100m downloads in the US and Europe since January. The idea of shipping items â many of which we donât need â halfway around the world does not feel very environmentally friendly, but it is clearly attracting consumers. âWe are in a cost of living crisis and people are looking for anything to save a bit of money,â says Miya Knights, the publisher of Retail Technology magazine and the co-author of a book about Amazon. âEveryone likes a bargain and Temu ticks those boxes.â The website promises you can âshop like a billionaireâ; while itâs unclear whether Elon Musk and friends buy many sets of 89p insoles, it offers those of us with less cash the chance to spend without breaking the bank. On the face of it, you could get a new dress and shoes for just over a fiver, throw in a faux crocodile-skin handbag for another 58p and have the whole lot delivered to your door free of charge. But itâs not that straightforward, as I found out when I went shopping. I placed two orders on the site â this is what I bought. Lip balms fit for a dollâs house: Â£2.24 Donât be fooled â¦ tiny lip balms. Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian Imagine a pot of Vaseline then halve it, then halve it again and again until itâs about the size of your thumb. This is what the components of the lip balm set I bought look like in real life. They are tiny. It reminded me of those stories of people who order things on eBay and find themselves with dollâs house furniture. If you read the one-star reviews for the product, you will be warned of its size. But here is a Temu trick: those reviews exist, but are hard to find. The âlow ratingâ button is at the end of a list of filters, so on many pages it doesnât appear until you press a drop-down arrow. And it is greyed out â as if you canât click on it. It seems designed to put you off digging too deep. If you do, you will find the warnings: âABSOLUTELY NOT SOOO SMALLL NOOOO,â and: âAbsolutely tiny donât be fooled by the picture.â Across the site, you are given the impression that everything has a four- or five-star rating. However, sometimes the ratings that appear under the goods are for the retailer, not the item. A dragon T-shirt, for example, appears to get a 4.5 rating based on more than 1,700 reviews, even though there are only two reviews for the product itself, one of which is two stars because the fabric âis like poor-quality sports materialâ and âitâs poorly cut. A bad fitâ. It feels like bad reviews are being disguised. When contacted by the Guardian, Temu admitted that it was âaware of this issue as well. We believe it results in poor user experience for consumersâ and said it would be resolving the problem within weeks. Like the rest of my shopping, the lip balms arrived in a plain grey bag with no padding or bubble wrap to protect them, nor any pretty wrapping. âTheyâve stripped everything back,â says Knights. âYou are not getting any of the bells and whistles that you might with independent retailers.â Socks that make your legs look like a chickenâs: Â£1.78 âThey are not great quality â there is a little thread loose and what looks like a bit of a run.â Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian There are only 15 pairs left, I am told, and a little egg-timer icon adds to the sense that my chance to own these âFunky chicken leg print calf socksâ is running out. (Three days later, there are 12 left â clearly, they are not flying off the shelves.) Across the site are messages saying items are âjust boughtâ, âalmost sold outâ or âjust added to cartâ. There is always a suggestion that deals have a time limit. There are also holiday deals and offers linked to events, such as the day before New Zealand took on South Africa in the Rugby World Cup final, when items were marked with a ârugby game dealsâ banner. How legal are these tactics to put pressure on you to spend? Rob Jefferies, an expert in consumer law at Blake Morgan, says that these kind of claims are OK âif they really do have 10 in stock and they are not going to get it back for a couple of monthsâ, but otherwise might fall foul of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Temu says that the stock information it displays is accurate. However, it does keep a âshallower inventory compared to traditional supply chainsâ, which âallows us to respond more nimbly to market changesâ. When the socks arrive, they are not great quality â there is a little thread loose and what looks like a bit of a run â but that is not really a surprise, given the price. Matt Piner, the head of custom retail solutions at GlobalData, says that customers understand and accept poor quality because of the low prices. âItâs an opportunity to treat yourself, but not spend much at all,â he says. âIf it doesnât last very long, then at least you havenât wasted a lot of money.â Two other pairs of socks I add to my basket later are much better quality. Weird, and with no care instructions or labels, but better quality. âMy expectation was low,â says Priscilla, 29, another Temu user. She bought trainers, a small steam iron and a laundry basket after her friend sent her a discount link. âI spent less than Â£20, so even if it didnât arrive it would be OK.â It did arrive, but the trainers were too small âand the laundry basket tore after I had used it a couple of timesâ. Six reusable straws that arenât the ones in the picture: Â£3.48 Beware the true cost â¦ the price displayed in search results may just be the baseline cost. Photograph: Sonja Horsman/The Guardian Sometimes the price displayed in search results is the baseline cost for the item, while the picture shows the top-of-the-range item. So, you may think a range of multicoloured metal drinking straws looks good for Â£3.48, but when you click through you will find that this is the price for silver ones; for those that caught your eye, you will need to shell out Â£4.38. It may not even be the same product. Search for a mini printer and you will get the impression that you can buy one for less than Â£3, but click on a listing and you will come to learn that this is the cost of the paper â the pink printer is Â£19.99. This practice doesnât seem to break the rules against âbait and switchâ â where a consumer is enticed with a low-priced item and then told it is unavailable â but it is very frustrating. Temu said: âIf any merchant is found to be using misleading tactics, the problematic product will be delisted.â The printer and the straws were still listed in the same way at the time of publication. I wanted to stop shopping after I added the straws, the lip balms and the socks to my basket. But despite messages across the site advertising âfree shippingâ, there is a hidden minimum spend â which was Â£10 in my case. Temu says, confusingly: âWe offer free shipping for all orders and there isnât a single scenario where we charge consumers a shipping fee. However, we do have a minimum order amount requirement for some consumers.â This is easy to miss when you first visit. It is also very opaque. I got to the checkout only to be told there was not enough in my basket to qualify for free shipping. Presumably, Temu is relying on people being emotionally invested in their choices by this point and willing to add to their order to get to the required figure. An unofficial case for PokÃ©mon cards: Â£6.49 Like many virtual and real marketplaces, Temu has its share of traders selling unlicensed items based on popular brands such as PokÃ©mon and Minecraft. The listings can make for fun reading â one seller is offering an âadorable penguin plush toyâ which is the spitting image of the PokÃ©mon Piplup, another âthe lovely frog stuffed animals hand puppetâ, which is clearly modelled on the Muppetsâ Kermit the Frog. The copyright infringement isnât limited to big companies. Small artists have reported seeing their designs on items for sale on the site. In the US, it has been reported that sellers on Amazon have had their listings ripped off by Temuâs retailers. Temu says it does âconsistently prioritise and champion the respect and protection of intellectual property rightsâ and that it will take legal action against any sellers violating those rights. It also says that its protection of brands âis far superiorâ to its peers. You have probably noticed that all of the price points are odd. Piner says that these are designed to grab our attention. We might scroll past a shirt for Â£1.99, but pause if itâs Â£1.74. âItâs a matter of how do you stand out, how do you get people to stop?â he says. A monstera-shaped spoon that might usually sell for Â£2.99 to Â£14: Â£1.25 âWhich slotted spoon to pick feels like a lottery.â Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian There are hundreds of things shaped like cheese plants on the site, including slotted spoons. It is impossible to tell if all of these spoons are the same â they look to be, but are listed at a range of prices below Â£3, and the original prices being claimed vary even more widely, from Â£2.99 to Â£7.99. Every listing I have seen on Temu suggests that the item is being sold at a discount from a considerably higher original price. The UKâs Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) calls these higher prices âreference pricesâ and has rules that say they must reflect how much the item is generally sold for. Jefferies says if the ASA challenged a seller, the seller would have to prove that the items had previously sold at that price. Temu says that its sellers list products in different countries at the same time: âThe âoriginal priceâ is typically set based on the prevailing market conditions and the merchantâs grasp of the competitive scene. Price discrepancies might occur due to shifts in the market or if the primary country targeted during the listing differs.â Back to the spoons. Choosing which to order is difficult: are they all the same? Do I go for the cheapest, or will a slightly more expensive one prove better? It feels like a lottery. The spoon arrives with a label describing it as a âjungleâ spoon and saying it is designed by Elinor Portnoy. On the face of it, this makes it the same one that John Lewis is selling for Â£14 from a company called Ototo. When contacted by the Guardian, Portnoy said that Ototo has the distribution rights for the product. However, she added: âIn general, when products are manufactured in China, the factory or agent, which has the original computer-aided design, plastic injection mould and technical capability, can produce as many items as they wish, or alternatively share the original design with other manufacturers and suppliers. Legally, small companies with small leverage canât do much. Intellectual property protection laws in China are subject to the Chinese legal system.â She continued: âIf this is the case for the spoon bought on Temu, then at least they gave me credit on the label. The real pain is that often these copies are reduced in quality (that explains the very competitive price, too), which really hurts the original brandâs reputation and floods the market, as well as lowers the productâs perceived value.â Ototo said that the spoon is âmost probably made from cheap plastic that is not safe to use in contact with foodâ. Cuddly toy: Â£4.59 Decisions, decisions â¦ which cuddly toy to pick? Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian In the style of The Generation Game, I ended with a cuddly toy. I went for one that appears to be based on the cartoon We Bare Bears â possibly another copyright infringement. For my final purchase, I could have had a cuddly loaf of bread, a fluffy tardigrade or a suggestively shot bike chain cleaner that looks remarkably like a penis. But I didnât buy these, despite Temuâs best efforts. Nonetheless, once I had placed my order, I was followed around the internet by Temu ads â and it seemed the products displayed were among the weirdest-looking on the site. Piner says Temuâs attempt to increase its reach means listing unusual items. âThey are trying to stand out and go viral,â he says. âSome of their products are very much about catching the eye. If youâre scrolling down a page and thereâs one of them in the advert, you stop. Even if you are not going to buy it, you might click through to find out more and then youâre in their ecosystem, youâre in their shop and they can sell you something else.â Temu got into trouble with the ASA recently, which upheld complaints about the âsexualâ imagery in several of its adverts, one of which appeared to feature a child in a bikini posing in an adult way. I wonder if the bike chain cleaner ad will go the same way. Temu says it is âdrawing inspiration from established websites in the UK to enhance our product designâ, which will hopefully lead to a better experience for consumers. Until it does, shopping on Temu will feel more like playing a lucky dip than being a billionaire. This article was amended on 9 November 2023 to add a comment from Ototo that was received post-publication.

    "title": "Temu Files Lawsuit Over Counterfeiting in Efforts to Protect Reputation in US Market",
    "originLink": "https://www.thefashionlaw.com/temu-claims-counterfeiting-in-new-lawsuit-amid-rapid-u-s-growth/",
    "originBody": "Image: Temu Fashion Temu Claims Counterfeiting, Cybersquatting in New Lawsuit November 9, 2023 - By TFL Image: Temu Luxury brands and sportswear giants are not the only consumer goods brands that are being plagued by counterfeiting and other unauthorized uses of their well-known trademarks. Ultra-fast fashion giant Temu claims in a new lawsuit that it is struggling with counterfeiting and cybersquatting. According to the counterfeiting, cybersquatting, unfair competition, and false designation of origin complaint that it lodged with a federal court in Illinois late last month, Whaleco, Inc. (d/b/a âTemuâ) alleges that a group of defendants â identified by domains, such as temuapp.biz, temucouponcodes.com, boujeecoupons.com, etc. â are making use of the Temu brand name to dupe consumers into believing that it is affiliated with an array of âfake apps and websitesâ amid its eye-watering growth in the U.S. market. Setting the stage in the new complaint, Temu asserts that since it began operating in the U.S. in September 2022, its online marketplace â which offers up heavily discounted goods, including cosmetics, appliances, and electronics, that are mostly shipped to consumers directly from China â âhas become extremely successful,â nabbing the title of âthe number one downloaded shopping app in the U.S.â At the same time, Temu asserts that its TEMU trademark âhas been widely promoted throughout the globe, including within the U.S.,â with âconsumers, potential consumers, and other members of the public not only associat[ing] its marketplace with exceptional quality, style, and affordable prices, but also recogniz[ing] the marketplace in the United States originates exclusively with Temu.â Against that background, Boston-headquartered Temu claims that the defendants are engaging in a scheme to piggyback on its brand by way of apps and websites that are ânot authentic Temu sites,â as well as âunauthorized coupons and promotions.â In particular, a number of the defendants own and operate infringing domains that use the TEMU mark in their domain names without authorization in order to âcreate a false association with Temu and deceive consumers.â The remaining defendants â such as those behind domains like fabioduque.com, grabcodesnow.com, couponsky.net, greatparcelswiss.com, and drywink.com â âutilize the TEMU marks to create a false association with and trade on the goodwill of the TEMU marks, and to deceive consumers into believing the sites are legitimately associated with or providing services for Temu.â They do so, according to Temu, by âadvertising, marketing, distribution, offering for sale, and selling counterfeit apps or unauthorized coupons and promotions.â All the while, the defendants âgo to great lengths to conceal their true identities, registering domain names using privacy shields, and failing to publish contact information on their websites.â With the foregoing in mind, Temu accuses the defendants of violating the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, and engaging in federal trademark counterfeiting and infringement, and unfair competition and false designation of origin. It is seeking injunctive relief, including an order requiring the relevant domain registrars âto place the infringing domains and infringing websites on hold and lock them for the pendency of this litigation.â Temu is also seeking monetary damages â either âactual damages as a result of the defendantsâ acts of infringement and other unlawful conduct alleged herein,â or in the alternative, statutory damages of $100,000.00 for âeach and every use of the Temu mark counterfeited by each defendantâ and maximum statutory damages for violations of the anti-cybersquatting provisions of the Lanham Act in an amount not less than $100,000 for each of the infringing domains and infringing websites. TLDR: âFraudsters are posing as Temu on fake apps and websites to scam consumers. This not only damages our reputation but also hurts consumers who have been deceived into believing that they were engaging with genuine Temu platforms,â a Temu spokesperson told TFL in connection with the lawsuit, noting that âevery year scammers get more aggressive, and the rise of retail fraudsters and copycats [continues to] plague the e-commerce world.â THE BIGGER PICTURE: The lawsuit comes as Temu continues to make waves in the U.S. market, overtaking its closest rival Shein, which it filed an anti-competition lawsuit against earlier this year, as the most downloaded app in the U.S. for the first three quarters of 2023. No small market for Temu (or Shein for that matter), sales in the U.S. were responsible for 60 percent of Temuâs revenue, which reached $5 billion in the third quarter, according to SCMP, which recently reported that as of September, Temuâs had caught up with Shein in terms of sales in the U.S. The same report revealed that Temu had spent more than $300 million on advertising this August in furtherance of its efforts to bolster its rapid stateside growth. The case is Whaleco, Inc. v. temuapp.biz, et al., 1:23-cv-15424 (N.D. Ill.)",

    "originBody": "Bloomberg Amazon Allies With Meta For Shopping Via Instagram, Facebook Read full article 3 Spencer Soper and Aisha Counts Thu, November 9, 2023 at 2:27 PM ESTÂ·2 min read (Bloomberg) -- Two of techâs largest players, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., are testing a feature that lets shoppers buy Amazon products directly from ads on Instagram and Facebook. Most Read from Bloomberg Rockstar Plans to Announce Much Anticipated âGrand Theft Auto VIâ Worldâs Biggest Bank Forced to Trade Via USB Stick After Hack New âCall of Dutyâ Draws Harsh Reviews After Rushed Development Saudis Find a Bottomless Money Pit in Lucid Worldâs Largest Bank Hit By Ransomware Gang Linked to Boeing, Ion Attacks The initiative, which involves asking consumers to link their Amazon accounts to their social-media profiles, could make Meta more attractive to advertisers and let Amazon attract more shoppers from outside its web store. The unprecedented partnership between the two companies also could help them fend off challenges from TikTok, which has launched a US e-commerce marketplace, as well as such Chinese upstarts and Temu and Shein. US shoppers will see real-time pricing, delivery estimates and product details on select Amazon ads running on Facebook and Instagram, according to an Amazon spokesperson. âFor the first time, customers will be able to shop Amazonâs Facebook and Instagram ads and check out with Amazon without leaving the social-media app,â the spokesperson said. Meta declined to comment and referred questions to Amazon. It wasnât immediately clear how widespread the new initiative is, but some Instagram ads already urge users to âshop with Amazonâ and take them to a product page and purchase button. Maurice Rahmey, whose company helps brands advertise on Meta and Google, posted a video of the opt-in feature on LinkedIn. âThis partnership could be a massive revenue opportunity for Meta, Amazon and, most importantly, advertisers,â he said in his post. Amazon has been working to better target customers outside of its main app and marketplace. The company rolled out âBuy with Primeâ last year as a way to generate logistics revenue from transactions made on other websites and enhance the value of Prime memberships. Story continues Meta has struggled to make inroads in e-commerce. The company abandoned its Instagram shop tab, which let users find shoppable content on their feeds, and shut down live shopping features for Facebook and Instagram. For its part, Amazon has long appealed to mission shoppers who know what theyâre looking for, but is less adept at helping consumers discover products. In 2021 Apple Inc. made changes to its privacy polices that let users choose not to be tracked by advertisers. This severely limited ad targeting on iOS devices, costing Meta an estimated $10 billion in advertising revenue last year. Since then Meta has been looking for ways to boost the accuracy of its ad targeting using artificial intelligence. Shopping apps and social-media sites tend to be silos that donât cooperate with one another, according to Juozas Kaziukenas, the founder and chief executive officer of Marketplace Pulse, which monitors online sales. But he says the partnership between Amazon and Facebook shows how their strengths can be complementary. âShoppers get more relevant ads and a faster checkout experience, Amazon gets more shopping volume,â he wrote in a post about the agreement.

Deadline to file a claim: TBD Proof of Purchase Required: No Potential Individual Reward: TBD Total Settlement Amount: TBD States Involved Abraham JewettNovember 9, 2023 Category: Legal News Follow Article (Photo Credit: Freer/Shutterstock) Temu data class action lawsuit overview: Who: A group of consumers filed a class action lawsuit against Whaleco Inc., doing business as Temu, and PDD Holdings Inc., formerly known as Pinduoduo Inc. Why: Consumers claim Temu, a Chinese-owned online shopping platform, collects more data from its users than is necessary and in a greater amount than what it discloses. Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in Illinois federal court. Online shopping platform Temu collects data from its users beyond what is necessary and in a greater amount than is disclosed, a new class action lawsuit alleges. A group of Temu users argue experts concluded Temu âpurposefully and intentionallyâ loaded tools into its app that âexecute virulent and dangerous malware and spyware activities on user devices.â âAccording to these experts, Temu collects user data beyond what is necessary for an online shopping app, including biometric information and data from users of the app,â the class action states. Temu users want to represent a nationwide class and Illinois, California and Virginia subclasses of consumers who have used the platform. Experts found Temu conceals alleged privacy violations, class action says Experts determined Temu has âgone to great lengthsâ to conceal alleged privacy violations from its users so it can continue to steal their data, the class action alleges. Temu users argue the alleged privacy violations are especially concerning given Temu is a Chinese-owned company, meaning the data it collects is âultimately available to individuals and entities in China.â âUnder Chinese law, in turn, such user data possessed by, controlled by or accessible to individuals and entities in China may be demanded by the government at any time,â the Temu class action lawsuit states. Temu users claim the company is guilty of unjust enrichment and violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 and a variety of state laws. The plaintiffs demand a jury trial and request declaratory and injunctive relief along with an award of compensatory, statutory and punitive damages for themselves and all class members. Temu disputed a separate complaint last month filed by rival online marketplace Shein; the complaint claimed Temu used thousands of copyrighted images as promotional photos on its website. Have you used Temu? Let us know in the comments. The plaintiffs are represented by Steve W. Berman and Jeannie Evans of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP and Douglas G. Smith of Aurelius Law Group LLC. The Temu data class action lawsuit is Ziboukh, et al. v. Whaleco Inc. d/b/a Temu, et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-15653, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Donât Miss Out!

Friday, November 10, 2023 9:47 AM UTC Related Stories Amazon to Shut Down Two Style Stores, Shifts Focus Back Online NFT: Meta terminates support for NFTs on Facebook, Instagram Meta threatens to block news access on IG, Facebook if 'Online News Act' is adopted in Canada Meta Platforms Inc. signed a deal with Amazon Inc. so users can shop on the e-commerce site via Facebook and Instagram. This means that people do not have to leave social media platforms to buy something from Amazon because they can just do it directly without moving to another app. As per CNBC, Meta does not want users to step out of Facebook or Instagram when they suddenly want to shop on Amazon. To prevent them from leaving, the tech company led by Mark Zuckerberg teamed up with the popular e-commerce firm. New Shopping Feature on Metaâs Social Media Brands The company launched a new function that will allow Facebook and Instagram users to link their accounts to Amazon. Once connected, people can easily and more conveniently purchase anything by simply clicking on the promotions that will show up on their feeds. Through its collaboration with Amazon, it will also be easier for Meta Platforms to allow merchants to sell merchandise on its Facebook and IG. The selling will be simpler too because sellers do not have to set up separate storefronts to start the trade since Amazon is already linked. âFor the first time, customers will be able to shop Amazonâs Facebook and Instagram ads and check out with Amazon without leaving the social media apps,â the spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement. âCustomers in the U.S. will see real-time pricing, Prime eligibility, delivery estimates, and product details on select Amazon product ads on Facebook and Instagram as part of the new experience.â Giving E-Commerce Business a Boost Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that this new deal also presented an unmatched tie-up between Amazon and Meta. This is because the two companies may also compete better with TikTok which has its marketplace within the app. Lastly, the partners may also challenge Shein and Temu who are currently leading the e-commerce marketplace sector.
