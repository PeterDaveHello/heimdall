    "originBody": "Temu files lawsuit against 20 domains as it ramps up trademark protection By Rachel Douglass 2 hours ago BUSINESS Credits: Image from Temu pressroom E-commerce marketplace Temu, hailed as the newest direct competitor to Shein, has said that it has filed a series of lawsuits against website domains that are “unlawfully doing business on its behalf”. The company made the complaint against 20 website domains with the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, in which it claimed that those accused are “using its protected trademarks to create domain names, counterfeit apps, look-a-like online marketplaces, fake coupon codes and other false promotions” in a bid to “mislead customers”. The lawsuit comes in regards to sites such as temuapp.biz, temucouponcodes.com and temudeals.store, each one Temu said have infringed on its trademark and are using its name without a licence to “create a false association” and “deceive customers”. It further stated that the websites are creating unfair competition, while adding that it has allegedly been the subject of “defamatory sponsored ads”. Temu said that when customers purchase from counterfeit Temu sites and end up not receiving their orders or experiencing inadequate customer service, it has a negative impact on the company, which further noted that it was already the recipient of comments and complaints regarding such instances. Temu was established in September 2022 as the “sister company” of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, launching as a multi-segment marketplace that could attribute its success to low prices, discounts and free shipping. The company currently resides in Dublin, Ireland, where it moved its headquarters to in May 2023, alongside other tech giants such as Apple, Meta and Google.

    "originLink": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/special/contributor-content/2023/11/15/understanding-the-data-practices-of-temu-the-worlds-hottest-shopping-app/71597879007/",
    "originBody": "CONTRIBUTOR CONTENT Understanding The Data Practices of Temu, The World’s Hottest Shopping App Kyle RussellContributor As digital shopping becomes increasingly intertwined with our daily lives, understanding how e-commerce apps handle our data is more crucial than ever. Here, we take a look at Temu, a rising star in the online marketplace that has been gaining popularity in Germany, and how it handles user data to ensure transparency and maintain user trust. Here's what you need to know about how Temu treats your personal information. Temu's Approach to Data Collection Temu's philosophy is straightforward: collect data for the sole purpose of delivering and enhancing your shopping experience. Temu actually gathers less user information than other consumer apps, focusing only on what's necessary to process and improve its service. This means that while other apps may reach into your contacts or keep tabs on your location, Temu stays out of those areas entirely. A Closer Look at the Data Temu Collects Here are the categories of data that Temu collects and their purpose, according to its data disclosure on the Apple App Store: Purchases & Financial info: Temu requires this information to process and fulfill orders. Location data: Temu asks for access to location permissions only in the Middle East to make it easier for users to fill in their shipping addresses. Precise location capabilities are crucial for delivery addresses in the Middle East due to its lack of a comprehensive address system. Contact info: In addition to order fulfillment, such data is needed to create an account. This refers to the contact info of the user, not the address book. User content: Such data allow users to upload photos, leave a review, search for items with an image, contact customer service, etc. Temu uses the phone operating system’s built-in photo picker to choose and upload images and does not request permission to read the photo gallery. Search history: Such data refers to users’ searches on Temu, which help the app offer a more personalized experience by recommending products or services that may be of interest for the user. Identifier & Diagnostics & Usage data: Most, if not all apps routinely collect such data to identify an account or device, analyze/locate app crash issues and continuously improve services. Temu and App Permissions With concerns about data security on the rise, Temu has openly shared how it handles app permissions. In essence, the app minimizes permission requests. To make it easy for users to see the permissions it requires, Temu makes the permissions available in the app settings or on their permission disclosure webpage. Application permissions are safeguards put in place by your phone's operating system (like Android or iOS) to control what apps can and can't do. They're like protective gates that ensure apps only access the features or data they absolutely need, and that the user is aware of and has agreed to. For example, apps may need permission to access your location, use your camera, etc. When the user installs or uses certain features of an app, it might ask for specific permissions. If the user agrees, the app can use that feature or data. If the user declines, it can't. Temu is dedicated to maintaining transparency and minimizing the use of permissions within the application. Even when Temu uses the photos to leave a review, search for items, and so forth, Temu will not obtain system permissions directly. Instead, Temu uses the built-in camera or photo picker of the user's device. This means that users are always in control, and the application can never access their photos, camera, or microphone without their explicit permission. Temu's approach enhances the security of users. Addressing Misconceptions Some have raised alarms about Temu's potential for intrusive data practices. However, these concerns often stem from misunderstandings. For instance, Temu doesn't use your phone's location services unless it's absolutely necessary for functionality, like in the Middle East where address systems are less structured. Temu's privacy policy clearly explains the use of unique identifiers like IMEI or MAC addresses, which are standard for most devices and apps. These are used simply to identify your device for a better user experience. Temu stands with users in the quest for privacy and data security, adhering to industry standards but opting for a more user-focused approach. By collecting less data and avoiding unnecessary system permissions, Temu demonstrates its commitment to user privacy and security. For those interested in the specifics, Temu's full privacy policy is readily available on its website, offering in-depth insights into its data practices. Remember, informed choices are the cornerstone of data security in the digital age, and Temu is here to ensure your shopping experience is safe and personalized.

    "originBody": "OPINION California's Newsom lays bare who really has his heart and it's not who you think Why do Democrat leaders from Gavin Newsom to Joe Biden keep favoring this country's interests over our own? By Scott Brown Fox News Published November 16, 2023 5:00am EST Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Gavin Newsom admits he is cleaning San Francisco ahead of APEC: 'It's true' The Rubin Report host Dave Rubin joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the timing of Gov. Newsom's cleanup and why he believes he is more concerned about the optics. NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! When California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom, admitted that clean-up efforts in San Francisco this week were a consequence of \"fancy leaders coming into town,\" he did more than say the quiet part out loud. Newsom showed the true winner of his policy goals, and it’s not the 40 million Californians or citizens in the country he harbors ambitions of leading as president. It’s Xi Jinping, president of the People's Republic of China, who sat down with President Joe Biden at Wednesday’s highly anticipated Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. Whether intended or not, from the Biden White House and trickling downward to like-minded governors, anti-competitive decisions from left-wing politicians are kneecapping American innovators and supercharging Chinese ambitions in their quest for global dominance. SAN FRANCISCO BUSINESS OWNER ROASTS NEWSOM FOR CLEANING UP CITY FOR WORLD LEADERS: 'HE DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT US Take the tech sector. This fall alone, departments within the Biden administration are pursuing high-profile lawsuits against Google and Amazon, two of America’s home-grown success stories. Newsom has signed legislation targeting both companies, despite California’s role as the incubator of technology that changed the world. Should the government prevail, the result could be the break-up of Amazon or Google. The Amazon case is being led by Lina Khan, an Elizabeth Warren protege and chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), who rose to prominence with an academic paper targeting the online marketplace. California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks alongside other local officials and local officials at the opening of a recently completed Clean California beautification project. (California Governor Gavin Newsom YouTube channel) Meanwhile, the Chinese tech industry is exploding. Earlier this year, four of the five most downloaded apps in the United States were Chinese-based. TikTok grabs the most headlines, but Temu, an online marketplace and rival to Amazon, emerged as the most downloaded app in the U.S. earlier this year. Temu has faced bipartisan congressional scrutiny, with the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party issuing a scathing report earlier this year concluding the company relied on slave labor for production on a \"regular basis.\" Temu, along with Shein, another popular Chinese app that focuses on fashion apparel, have faced allegations of producing goods in Xinjiang, the west region where Chinese authorities have overseen brutal crackdowns on Uyghur Muslims. THE MOUNTING EVIDENCE BIDEN GOT RICH FROM DICTATORS LIKE CHINA'S XI Yet with its bargain basement prices on cheap goods, Temu’s presence grew tenfold during its first few months in the U.S. Last November, Shein accounted for half of all American sales among fast fashion competitors. Their respective market shares are poised to grow as companies like Amazon face existential threats from its own government. Video Or consider energy. Green extremists like Biden and Newsom have made their disdain for American oil and gas abundantly clear. Earlier in his term, the Biden administration had issued the fewest federal oil leases since World War Two, while Newsom signed a law forcing all new cars to be electric in his state by 2035. Here’s the problem: mass-scale production of EVs requires lithium-ion for the batteries. China dominates the market for minerals that make up EV batteries, especially the lithium-ion battery. In 2021, China produced 75 percent of the world’s lithium-ion batteries, compared with 7 percent for the U.S., according to the International Energy Agency. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION More than 75 percent of the world’s cobalt, another critical component for EVs, comes from Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where China exerts control and again relies on slave labor. Video The Biden-Xi sit-down this week is not likely to yield long-term policy consequences, but it’s no mystery that Beijing already considers itself an equal of the U.S. At the recent Central Financial Work Conference, they announced plans to \"accelerate building a financial powerhouse.\" The question should be why our elected officials are making it easier to achieve that objective. From spy balloons to breaching the email accounts of cabinet officials to siding with Russia in their war against Ukraine: Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party should be seen as detrimental to the interests of the United States. To be sure, this is not to suggest that Biden, Newsom or any other politician is purposefully undermining American interests to boost our greatest rival. But it is undeniable that their policies are having that effect. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Yes, it is infuriating that it took a visit from Xi for Newsom to lift a finger to clean up California. The New York Times described San Francisco as having, \"the air this week of teenagers frantically cleaning up after a house party with their parents on the way home.\" After months of inaction, the open-air drug markets, filth and homeless encampments vanished overnight. After the circus around this week’s meeting leaves town, the real anger should be directed at liberal policy agendas that are forcing American innovators to take a backseat to their Chinese competitors, and the long-term implications for our citizens.

    "originBody": "By Matthieu Guinebault Translated by Nicola Mira Published today Nov 15, 2023 Reading time access_time 3 minutes Download Print Text size aA+ aA- OECD investigates Shein in France By Matthieu Guinebault Translated by Nicola Mira Published today Nov 15, 2023 After a referral by French MPs, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has started an enquiry into the social and environmental practices of Chinese apparel group Shein on the French market, notably in terms of its corporate social responsibility (CSR). The enquiry is being conducted in France, and the parties involved will be attending a number of hearings in the coming months. Shutterstock French Socialist MPs made their application on June 20, submitting it to OECD's National Contact Point (NCP) in France. After confirming that the referral was formally acceptable, the latter stated that it held a first meeting with Shein’s representatives on September 6. “NCP notes that the evidence in support of the referral provided by the complainants is sufficiently detailed to lead to an initial assessment,” said OECD in a press release issued on November 14, adding that “NCP will subsequently take into consideration the response that [Shein] may wish to submit.” Contacted by FashionNetwork.com, the Chinese group said that “Shein responded quickly, and met with NCP after we were approached in July. It added that “we have cooperated and we will continue to cooperate fully to answer any questions NCP may have.” Ethical, environmental, legal questions The French MPs’ referral raised eight issues, starting with whether Shein respects local law in producing and selling its products in France (including labour law), and whether its activity meets duty of vigilance requirements. The other issues regard respect for human rights and appropriate working conditions, Shein’s due diligence with regards to its subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors, and whether Shein’s business practices negatively impact the environment and consumer health. “We believe (...) that the manufacturing and supply chain practices adopted by Shein for the products it commercialises in France do not respect human rights, the environment, or consumers’ interests,” said the group of French Socialist and allied MPs in a statement released on November 14, in which they defined Shein as the epitome of “hard fast fashion.” DR The statement mentioned the fact that Shein introduces 8,000 extremely low-priced new items on its website every day. “Every day, thousands of Chinese workers have to endure brutally long working hours to meet this kind of demand,” the statement said, also mentioning the lasting environmental impact of Shein's business practices. Reactions to the OECD’s investigation of Shein were quick to follow. Yann Rivoallan, president of the French Ready-to-wear Federation, has welcomed the enquiry. “It is time to assess whether this company really complies with international regulations and French law,” he stated on social media, adding that “Shein must comply with international regulations. The ultra-fast fashion sector as a whole must abide by French law.” Targeting Shein Shein is currently in the regulators’ cross-hairs in other countries besides France. In the USA, where Shein has buried the hatchet with its compatriot Temu, regulators have accused the group (and Temu too) of exploiting a customs loophole to import huge quantities of products into the country, while circumventing tax and human rights laws (as reported by FashionNetwork.com). Shutterstock Shein started out as an online retailer. NGOs quickly found that it exploited a network of small Chinese apparel factories whose output had always catered to the local market (as reported by FashionNetwork.com). Shein’s strategy focused on limited production runs, keeping close tabs on trends in order to minimise unsold inventory. Over time, Shein expanded its scope and turned into a marketplace, attracting third-party vendors through its sustained site traffic. Helped by rising inflation, Shein soon began to export its ultra-budget products to the West. In November 2022, Bloomberg estimated that Shein had already captured a 50% share of the US fast-fashion market, overtaking H&M and Zara, although Temu reportedly leapfrogged Shein in the USA recently. In Europe, Shein is already said to rank second among cross-border fashion e-tailers, slotting in between Zalando and Vinted. Copyright © 2023 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved.

    "title": "Why Temu Offers Cheap Prices: Exploring the Factors Behind its Affordable Marketplace",
    "originLink": "https://www.dailydot.com/news/why-is-temu-so-cheap/",
    "originBody": "Skip to content Tech Internet Culture Streaming IRL Trending Video Originals About About Us Contact Jobs Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ethics Policy Newsletter Tech Internet Culture Streaming IRL Trending Video Originals About About Us Contact Jobs Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ethics Policy Newsletter Newsletter yanishevska/ShutterStock (Licensed) Why is Temu so cheap? Temu minimizes costs and offers remarkably low prices via a lean supply chain—but at what cost? Kahron Spearman Trending Posted on Nov 15, 2023 E-commerce has forever changed how we shop. Now and then, a new platform emerges, challenging the online shopping status quo. Enter Temu, the Chinese-owned digital marketplace that has rapidly become a favorite among online shoppers for its low prices. One of the questions asked most about the retailer is, “Why is Temu so cheap?” Let’s dig into that very question. Why is Temu so cheap? Here’s one reason A core aspect of Temu’s business approach is its direct connection between customers and suppliers. Unlike many e-commerce sites, which hold inventories and work with intermediaries, Temu is a facilitator. This model eliminates the additional mark-ups and costs that can increase consumer prices. By ensuring a lean supply chain where buyers can directly access sellers, Temu minimizes costs and offers remarkably low prices. The Influence of Pinduoduo It’s essential also to understand the influence of Pinduoduo, the sister e-commerce platform owned by Temu’s parent company, PDD Holdings. Pinduoduo’s success in the Chinese market, with revenues surpassing $18 billion in 2022, has provided Temu with insights and lessons on how to run a digital marketplace efficiently. Leveraging the strategies and operational know-how of a company with a solid track record in the e-commerce space is invaluable. But there have been significant issues regarding security. Per a CNBC report, “malware in Pinduoduo was found to leverage specific vulnerabilities for Android phones, allowing the app to bypass user security permissions, access private messages, modify settings, view data from other apps and prevent uninstallation.” @jwflorida is temu a scam? – BBB ISSUES WARNING OVER TEMU APP #temureview #tenuapp #news ♬ original sound – jwflorida Google even called it an “identified malicious app” and asking people to uninstall the app, which is heavy-handed in its asks of security-related privileges—which Temu does not require. It’s all been enough for the U.S. government to take notice, as evinced by a brief released in April 2023 warning of “the challenges posed by Chinese ‘fast fashion’ platforms, including exploitation of trade loopholes; concerns about production processes, sourcing relationships, product safety, and use of forced labor; and violations of intellectual property rights.” The de minimis loophole One of the most significant factors contributing to Temu’s affordable pricing structure is its strategic use of the de minimis provision. This U.S. policy allows imports under $800 to enter the country without duties, taxes, fees, or extensive inspections. By operating under this loophole, Temu can offer products to U.S. consumers at reduced prices. It bypasses many of the fees that other international sellers might incur, giving it a unique advantage in the market. Product Selection and Quality Control While Temu boasts a vast range of products, there’s a notable variance in quality. Products can range from excellent value for the money to incredibly cheap and with unsurprisingly lower quality to match. Temu’s product sourcing is diverse, with some items being absolute steals and others more akin to what you might find in a dollar store. This broad spectrum allows for a wide pricing range, but the lowest-priced items might need better quality and should be investigated thoroughly. However, Temu does offer an extended 90-day return policy for its products, per a USA Today article reviewing the site. Environmental and ethical Concerns With prices so low, questions naturally arise about the ethical production of items. While Temu’s Third Party Code of Conduct strictly opposes forced labor, there are concerns about the platform’s ability to ensure all sellers adhere to these guidelines. Critics argue that with affordable products, there are potential compromises in production standards, be it environmental, ethical, or labor practices. One TikToker, going under the name @thelegalpreneur, alleges that Temu ultimately hurts small businesses. @thelegalpreneur Why you should NOT be shopping on Temu. This site and similar ones hurt small businesses more fhan anything. #greenscreen #temu #boycott #shopsmall #buylocal ♬ original sound – Legalpreneur Data collection and consumer trust Cheap prices often come at a different kind of cost, as the Daily Dot has reported on in the past. Data collection is a crucial part of Temu’s operations, as it is with many e-commerce platforms. While Temu has policies to protect user data, consumers need to be aware of the types of information they’re sharing and how it’s being used. Trust is a currency in the digital age, and while Temu offers financial savings, users should always prioritize their online security and privacy. The final verdict Shopping on Temu offers fantastic deals, but it’s essential to approach it with a discerning eye. Just as with any online platform, there are risks and rewards. The allure of low prices is undoubtedly tempting, but understanding why these prices are so low provides a clearer picture of the trade-offs involved. As Temu continues its rapid ascent in the e-commerce world, only time will tell if its pricing model is sustainable in the long term or if adjustments will be necessary to maintain its momentum. You might wonder why is Temu so cheap as you’re reviewing prices, but then you also might be reminded of the maxim “You get what you pay for” and the saying “Buyer beware.” Share this article *First Published: Nov 15, 2023, 2:33 pm CST Kahron Spearman Kahron Spearman is the community manager for the Daily Dot and Nautilus magazine.
