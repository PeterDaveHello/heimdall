Temu is a bargain lover’s paradise. Known for its tagline “shop like a billionaire” and steep discounts for items from replacement toothbrush heads to kitchenware and sneakers, it has expanded to 47 countries and has 120 million monthly users globally. In Australia, Temu has had an average of 7.68 million monthly visits, topping the Wesfarmers and Woolworths-owned marketplaces since its launch in March. Both ASX giants are still grappling with their e-commerce assets. The category is dominated by leader Amazon at 50 million average monthly visits over the same period. According to exclusive data provided to The Australian Financial Review by Similarweb, Temu debuted with significant growth in Australia as it spent up on acquiring customers, but there are indications of a slowdown emerging. In October, the platform had a notable decline in both visits and unique users, which fell 41 per cent and 45 per cent month-on-month respectively. But shoppers are seeking out more discounts than ever before, placing Temu in good stead to retain customers, and returning users have increased rapidly, helping to reduce its cost per customer acquisition. In May, its percentage of returning users was 32 per cent and that jumped to 75 per cent by October, Similarweb data shows. Pay-per-click advertising fell over the past few months. That is when the advertiser pays a fee each time one of their ads is clicked, generating a visit. Pay-per-click spending peaked in July at about $21.5 million, Similarweb said, but by October it fell to $5.6 million. Despite this, Temu was still the third-largest spender among the major Australian marketplaces. Jarden head of research Ben Gilbert predicted the rise of the value shopper would create opportunities for aggressive players like Amazon and Temu. He estimates the pair are set to achieve over $5.5 billion of gross merchandise value in 2024. Mr Gilbert said Amazon and Temu had taken considerable market share from rivals Wesfarmers-backed Catch, Kogan, the Woolworths-owed MyDeal and even eBay given their scale, investment and range expansion. “We continue to believe the Amazon threat is underappreciated,” he underlined. US giant Amazon has been expanding its footprint in Australia helping to buttress its lead with a $70 million-plus investment in its newly opened Perth fulfilment centre. At 20,000 square metres, it doubled its local capacity. Amazon’s second robotics fulfilment centre in Melbourne was revealed in August, and will span 209,000 square metres across four levels, targeting completion in 2025. This is slightly larger than the equivalent Sydney site, which cost the company around $500 million. Morgan Stanley observed “great potential” for Temu to add further market share in Australia and New Zealand given e-commerce penetration at just under 20 per cent. “In Australia, the macro backdrop remains challenging for consumers spending as cost-of-living pressures escalate, which could result in consumption downgrade and offer opportunities for Temu,” the broker said. They also noted that Temu’s low prices seem attractive to users from all income brackets in a US sample – not just the lowest-income cohort – which may apply in Australia. How does Temu work? Similar to China’s Pinduoduo, which is also owned by Temu parent PDD Holdings, the Temu app offers users shopping side-by-side with electronic games such as Fishland. Users watch in-game ads, and to advance they must refer friends and complete tasks for rewards, increasing app engagement. There is also an influencer program. Merchants on Temu are responsible only for production, listing and shipping their items to warehouses designed by Temu in China. Temu does everything else, from setting prices, sales and marketing, and fulfilment. Morgan Stanley said this accelerates customer trust. Most orders qualify for free shipping and returns, and credit is offered if orders arrive outside the estimated delivery time. Its 30-day price adjustment policy is attractive to shoppers. There are no commissions, service or marketing fees to help attract merchants. MST Marquee head of consumer research Craig Woolford said there was still novelty value in shopping on Temu given its price point, and while many websites encourage gaming to boost engagement, such usage tends to fade over time unless there is a compelling value proposition.
