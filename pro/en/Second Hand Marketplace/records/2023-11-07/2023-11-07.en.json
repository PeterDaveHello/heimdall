Facebook News 6 November 2023 Cheryl KingLeave a Comment on How has Facebook’s “Marketplace” feature influenced second-hand economies? How has Facebook’s “Marketplace” feature influenced second-hand economies? Facebook, the social media giant that has revolutionized the way we connect and share information, has also made a significant impact on the world of second-hand economies through its “Marketplace” feature. Launched in 2016, Marketplace has quickly become a popular platform for buying and selling used items within local communities. This article explores the influence of Facebook’s Marketplace on second-hand economies and its implications for both buyers and sellers. What is Facebook Marketplace? Facebook Marketplace is an online platform where users can buy and sell a wide range of used items, including clothing, electronics, furniture, and more. It allows individuals to connect with potential buyers or sellers within their local area, making transactions more convenient and efficient. Increased accessibility and reach One of the key ways in which Facebook Marketplace has influenced second-hand economies is increasing accessibility and reach. With over 2.8 billion monthly active users, Facebook provides a massive audience for sellers to showcase their items. This wider reach allows sellers to connect with potential buyers who may not have been aware of their offerings otherwise. Convenience and ease of use Another significant impact of Facebook Marketplace is the convenience and ease of use it offers to both buyers and sellers. The platform is integrated into the Facebook app, making it easily accessible to users without the need for additional downloads or registrations. Sellers can quickly list their items with descriptions, photos, and prices, while buyers can easily browse through a wide range of options and connect with sellers directly through Facebook Messenger. FAQ: 1. Is Facebook Marketplace available worldwide? Yes, Facebook Marketplace is available in many countries around the world. However, its availability may vary depending on your location. 2. Are there any fees for using Facebook Marketplace? For individual users, Facebook Marketplace is free to use. However, certain businesses may be subject to fees for listing their products. 3. Is it safe to buy and sell on Facebook Marketplace? While Facebook has implemented measures to enhance safety and security, it is always important to exercise caution when buying or selling on any online platform. It is recommended to meet in public places, use secure payment methods, and thoroughly research the buyer or seller before making a transaction. In conclusion, Facebook’s Marketplace feature has had a significant influence on second-hand economies increasing accessibility, reach, convenience, and ease of use. As more users embrace this platform, it is likely to continue shaping the way we engage in buying and selling used items within our local communities.",

    "originBody": "I’m selling my entire life on Vinted – I’m addicted and can’t stop In tough economic times, many people are turning to re-selling apps to declutter, make extra cash, and save sending clothes to landfill Personal stylist Lisa Talbot has added Vinted to her services (Photo: Lisa Talbot.com/AKP Branding Stories) By Chloe Hamilton November 7, 2023 6:00 am(Updated 7:52 am) The man at Zara Zubeidi’s local post office in Surrey knows her by name, such is the frequency with which she drops off a Vinted parcel. In fact, when we talk, she’s just about to set off in the pouring rain to make yet another delivery. “He often thinks I’m making clothing returns so I have to explain to him that I am selling and not an online shopping addict,” she jokes. Just last month, the 33-year-old freelance journalist and assistant TV producer made £647 from selling clothes on the pre-loved online marketplace that was co-founded by Milda Mitkute and Justas Janauskus in Lithuania in 2008 as a way for fashion-mad Mitkute to sell her unwanted clothes. The rags to riches app launched in the UK in 2014 and has sky-rocketed in popularity as eco-conscious, cash-strapped shoppers increasingly turn to second-hand fashion. The app version of the site was downloaded 3.8 million times in April 2023. Although October was a particularly bumper month for Zebeidi (who sells under the name “zz1990”), due to selling a friend’s clothes and taking a cut, she turns a healthy profit most months. “I’ve made an average of £439 per month since January,” she says. “I helped sell another friend’s wardrobe earlier this year and made £800 as I was able to keep 50 per cent of the profit.” Vinted itself has strict rules on selling that is deemed to be “commercial”. This could include sellers that make large volume transactions (either the number of transactions or the amount of revenue earned); selling a large number of brand-new items; selling the same items in different colours or sizes; selling items that you have purchased not for your own use but with the intent to resell them; and sales intended to generate a regular source of income or profit. When approached for comment, Vinted explained it has measures in place which detect potential commercial sellers. The company was, however, unable to reveal what those measures were. Zara Zubeidi loves using Vinted to make money to supplement her income (Photo: supplied) Certainly, they don’t seem to have stopped Zubeidi from making a lot of money. “If I’m working from home, I’ll use my lunch break to take pictures and upload items – the process is quick and easy,” she says. “I regularly attend warehouse sales and pick up branded stock for cheap. In one case, a dress I picked up, that is still retailing for £228 online, I bought for £25 just because it had a deodorant mark on the front. I wiped off the deodorant and sold it for £70.” Zubeidi has learned to upload new items just before payday as the week afterwards is usually the busiest for buyers and she keeps an eye out for viral trends that may prove popular. “I sold a couple of the viral faux leather khaki Molly Mae jackets earlier this year for £20-£30 profit each.” She used to sell on Depop – another preloved online marketplace that launched in 2011 – but says she doesn’t get much interest on there now. She suspects this is due to the selling fee Depop charges (10 per cent on every sale) causing sellers to move to Vinted, which charges nothing. “It’s interesting because Depop looks so much slicker as an app.” Zubeidi isn’t alone in selling big on Vinted. Nottingham-based 25-year-old Caitlin Good (username: goodcaitlin), who started selling items in lockdown as a way of decluttering, now has 237 listings on her page and uploads items daily to keep her profile active. She also advertises her page on Vinted Facebook groups to drive more traffic and promote the things she is trying to sell – anything and everything from Jack Wills hoodies and Hollister jumpers to a sweet but curious ceramic mushroom mug (never used and in its original box.) “I tend to sell five items a week but with Christmas coming I’m selling more than 10 a week. Sometimes I bring in £50 a week whereas in others it can be £80- £100”. Good puts any money she makes towards more items to sell on Vinted. “I will browse charity shops and buy some items in bulk off Facebook marketplace,” she says. “It’s extremely hard to keep up with sales. At the moment I have two or three items going out daily and I’m always promoting my page. I tend to class it as my 5-9pm job [ie. a second job that begins after your primary day job ends]. “I’m consistently on my phone but you have to work hard for the sales so I put the effort in.” Good admits that what started as a lockdown necessity is now something of an addiction. “I’ve invested so much time into it, I have a whole room dedicated to things.” Related Article LIFESTYLE How to help victims of war in Gaza Read More Not all of Vinted’s big sellers funnel their money back into stock, though. Leah Borromeo, is one of many parents using Vinted to flog children’s clothes that are outgrown at the speed of light. The 44-year-old from London started selling on Vinted three years ago following the birth of her child. She now uses the app to sell their old clothes, with just under 500 items for sale from high-end brands such as Mini Rodini, The Animals Observatory, and Stella McCartney. She typically has £200-£400 sitting in her Vinted account at any one time and, while this sometimes goes on picking up other items on Vinted, or on activity days and hot chocolates, most of the time it goes into her child’s savings account. “Depending on whether we’ve had a growth spurt or not, I will either list items piecemeal or, as I did the other day, in a small job lot,” she explains, adding that she has become a savvy salesperson. “Your views go up if you post every day and at different times of the day. I tend to use the morning light to photograph items and then list them when I get a spare minute, for example walking to lunch or waiting for a bus.” While Borromeo makes it sound easy, for some, selling on Vinted – sifting through old belongings, photographing them in an aesthetic way, writing up an appropriate listing, deciding on a price, and uploading it all to the app – sounds like a lot of hard work. For those people, Lisa Talbot, 54, is on hand to help. The personal stylist from Maidenhead offers a personal shopping service and now includes Vinted as part of her offering, scouring the site for bargains for her sustainability-minded clients. But, as well as shopping for her clients, Talbot will also sell their unwanted items. “I price according to brand, quality, and season to ensure the best price is made for a client and also the customer gets a great garment for a good price,” she explains. “On average, a client makes £200, depending on items and brands. One client made £1,000 for items we removed from her wardrobe.” Talbot’s preloved selling service includes photographing, listing, and delivering the parcels to the post office or parcel drop off meaning her clients simply have to decide what to sell. Is her house not full of other people’s old clobber? Seemingly not. “I have an office where the items are kept, either in a box or hung on a rail after steaming.” She also uses a spreadsheet to keep track of her clients’ sales and is careful to keep them separate from any personal transactions – she is, after all, a Vinted fan herself. “I (originally) used it for myself, buying and selling items I no longer love and the more clients I spoke to, it became apparent I could incorporate this into my business.” While selling hundreds of items on Vinted may seem, to the uninitiated, like a very demanding hobby (more a full time job in its own right), it would appear that for some the payoff is worth it: indeed this rags to riches app really can bring in the cash at a time when many families are looking for a little bit of extra financial help to ease tight times.",

Where to buy Taylor Swift tickets Taylor Swift setlist - The Eras Tour setlist Buy Taylor Swift 1989 (Taylor's Version) Taylor Swift fans have had a rough couple of months. In fact, I'd argue they've endured a Great War this year. They've fought, battled, and scrapped with one another to get tickets to the UK portion of Tay-Tay's Eras Tour, which is finally coming to this side of the world next year. For the first time, the Anti-Hero will be bringing her triumphant and powerful Eras Tour to Great Britain (as well as greater Europe). And, after a long wait, tickets were (finally) officially released on June 18, 2023 through a couple of official online retailers. At the time, fans could only grab tickets from Ticketmaster and AXS - but it was the beginning of a Cruel Summer for dedicated fans who had some rotten luck. But, as with any war, there were some casualties. Not everyone could get their own tickets. Buying tickets wasn't as simple as just logging into the ticket websites and purchasing them; fans could only get tickets if they signed up to buy a slot on specific dates by pre-registering ahead of time. And that's before they managed to get through the endless Ticketmaster queues to face enormous prices - with many hopefuls being left with Sweet Nothing in the process. And things are beginning to escalate within the Swifties community, as Taylor recently announced the re-release of her next classic album: 1989 (Taylor's Version). At the time of writing, Taylor Swift's UK and European shows seem to have sold out - but that does not mean fans have been Marooned without any hope. There is still a way to get The 1 ticket they need (okay, I'm not proud of that one). By utilising some Vigilante S**t, fans can grab tickets to UK and European Eras Tour dates right now, even though they're all sold out. There are even some front-row tickets available at London's Wembley Stadium, but act fast.

There are also other (more expensive) tickets on offer that include front-row standing tickets for some of the star's biggest shows throughout the UK - including at London's Wembley Stadium (where she is playing six times across 2024).

And many of these dates still have some front-row slots available on these sites. There is a catch with these tickets, though. As they are resale, their prices are being set by the people who originally bought the tickets. This means their prices could vary wildly from the original list prices. Making them far more expensive than usual. However, fans should note their purchases are verified and protected by the reseller websites. We recommend using viagogo or Vivid Seats to find your perfect Taylor Swift tour tickets, but there are even more resale websites you can pilfer for the experience.

Taylor Swift setlist - The Eras Tour setlist Taylor Swift constantly changes her Eras Tour setlist as she continues to venture through the USA, so her definitive setlist has not yet been confirmed. And Taylor herself even berated fans for trying to figure out which songs would be played when. While playing in Arlington, Texas, Taylor told her fans: \"One thing we said about the Eras Tour: you think you can just go online, you think you can just scroll and know the setlist?
