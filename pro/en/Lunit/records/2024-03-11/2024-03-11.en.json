Lunit will supply its Lunit INSIGHT CXR for chest abnormality detection and Lunit INSIGHT MMG for mammography analysis to the Chung Shan Medical University in Taiwan and Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore, respectively. Chung Shan Medical University to Pioneer AI in Lung Cancer Detection Continue Reading (from left to right) Lunit's AI-powered chest X-ray analysis solution \"Lunit INSIGHT CXR\" and Lunit's AI solution for mammography analysis \"Lunit INSIGHT MMG\" Under the newly inked supply contract, Lunit will collaborate with the prestigious Chung Shan Medical University (CSMU), Taiwan's leading medical university. This collaboration holds the potential to revolutionize Taiwan's national lung cancer screening program. Compared to Taiwan's current screening program, which relies on low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT) for screening high-risk individuals such as smokers or those with a family history of lung cancer, CSMU aims to validate Lunit INSIGHT CXR for potential integration into the national cancer screening program. The goal is to assess its ability to detect individuals more accurately and efficiently, potentially expanding the screening to a broader group beyond high-risk individuals. This approach could significantly advance Taiwan's efforts to enhance early detection and improve outcomes in lung cancer screening. Gleneagles Hospital Singapore Chooses Lunit for Enhanced Breast Cancer Screening In a parallel move, Lunit is set to deliver its AI-powered mammography analysis solution, Lunit INSIGHT MMG, to Gleneagles Hospital in Singapore, a prominent private healthcare facility within the IHH group. Gleneagles plans to enhance screening accuracy and operational efficiency by seamlessly integrating Lunit's cutting-edge technology into its breast screening workflow. Gleneagles Hospital, part of Southeast Asia's largest medical group, IHH, is a leading private healthcare provider in the region. Recognized with the Singapore Quality Class certification, the hospital offers extensive clinical facilities with 221 beds, emphasizing its commitment to exceptional standards in healthcare. \"As demand for cutting-edge medical services continues to rise across East and Southeast Asia, Lunit is proud to spearhead the advancement of AI-powered solutions for cancer diagnostics in the region,\" said Brandon Suh, CEO of Lunit. \"Our strategic partnerships with Chung Shan Medical University and Gleneagles Hospital Singapore strengthen our presence and open new opportunities across the market. We believe that these contracts will pave the way for innovative approaches to cancer detection, ultimately improving patient outcomes in areas where they are most crucial.\" About Lunit Founded in 2013, Lunit is a deep learning-based medical AI company on a mission to conquer cancer.

    "originBody": "이미지 확대 [Courtesy of Lunit] SEOUL -- \"Lunit INSIGHT MMG,\" a solution specializing in detecting breast cancer created by South Korea's medical artificial intelligence company Lunit, was adopted by a Singaporean hospital run by Southeast Asia's largest medical group IHH Healthcare. Starting with the contract with the healthcare group, which manages more than 20 hospitals in Southeast Asia, Lunit aims to expand its presence into other hospitals operated by IHH. The adoption of Lunit INSIGHT MMG can increase work efficiency by replacing human experts, who are prone to making mistakes. This AI-based solution utilizes software to compare and analyze X-rays and medical images of breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. When the solution detects an anomaly, human supervisors are notified, prompting additional tests for the patient. Lunit INSIGHT MMG has been successfully deployed overseas, including Taiwan and Saudi Arabia. According to Lunit's datasets containing the analysis of 55,579 Swedish women who had received screening tests for breast cancer using Lunit INSIGHT MMG, the collaboration between a human doctor and the AI solution demonstrated a higher cancer detection rate (CDR) compared to the teamwork of two human workers. The solution's CDR stood at 4.3 per 1,000 people who received breast cancer screening, while the CDR by two human workers was 4.1. Lunit said on March 11 that Lunit INSIGHT MMG will be provided to IHH Healthcare's Gleneagles Hospital Singapore. Gleneagles has 221 available beds. IHH Healthcare manages over 20 hospitals across Malaysia, Hong Kong, India, and China. \"As demand for cutting-edge medical services continues to rise across East and Southeast Asia, Lunit is proud to spearhead the advancement of AI-powered solutions for cancer diagnostics in the region,\" Lunit CEO Brandon Suh said in a statement. Data released by market research firm MarketsandMarkets showed that the global diagnostic imaging market is projected to reach $35 billion by 2026. Meanwhile, Lunit also signed an agreement with Taiwan's Chung Shan Medical University to supply \"Lunit INSIGHT CXR,\" another solution designed to detect chest conditions, including lung cancer.
