    "originBody": "I Ran My Own 'ChatGPT' and Here’s How to Do It — A Journey into customised LLM, part 1 of N Benjamin Cham · Follow 8 min read · 8 hours ago -- Image Credits: Unsplash Introduction The fusion of Artificial Intelligence with our daily lives is no longer just science fiction; it’s a rapidly unfolding reality. My latest endeavour? Running my own ChatGPT on my computer and devices. This project isn’t just a technical challenge; it’s a step towards understanding the future of Large Language Models (LLM), and share with you my journey to develop meaningful AI products using LLM. Why Run My Own ChatGPT? The Empowerment of Customisation The motivation to run my own LLMs was driven by the allure of customisation and control. Having the ability to tweak and tailor the AI to specific needs could open a new realm of possibilities. Whether it’s fine-tuning responses, integrating unique knowledge, or experimenting with language models, this setup offered a playground for personalised AI development. This level of customisation not only enhances the user experience but also paves the way for innovations that are finely aligned with individual or business-specific requirements. The Privacy and Security Edge Data breaches and privacy concerns are increasingly common, hence running LLMs on private machines (or cloud instances alike) could offer a significant advantage. By hosting the model on private machines, I bypassed the need to send data to remote servers, mitigating the risks associated with data interception or misuse. This setup ensures that sensitive information, whether it’s personal conversations or proprietary data, remains confined within my own setups. The Step-by-Step Guide Selection of LLM Model from the open-sourced. Why LLaMA? We hear alot about the OpenAI large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, GPT-4 or their remarkable ability to tackle difficult questions.However, the GPTs LLMs are not open-sourced (as of writing on November 2023), making them impossible to reverse engineer and and hinders efforts to replicate their capabilities. This is where LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) developed by Meta AI, comes in as a game-changing open-source alternative. LLaMA 2 offers a versatile range of models, including variants with 7, 13, 33, and 65 billion parameters. These models are adept at various tasks, including text generation, translation, question answering, code generation, and summarisation. Echoing the conversational finesse of ChatGPT, LLaMA excels in recognising conversational nuances, adapting to shifts in context, and crafting responses with a distinctly human touch. This makes it an invaluable tool for diverse applications. Moreover, some studies claims that LLaMA 2 may outshine ChatGPT in safety and performance metrics, marking a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence.” Comparison between LLaMA versus GPT-3 To understand better where LLaMA stands, we make a comparison with GPT-3 using the findings published by Meta-AI. Performance comparison for ‘Zero-Shot Performance on Common Sense Reasoning Tasks’ Drilling into the detailed comparison for ‘Zero-Shot Performance on Common Sense Reasoning Tasks’ where Zero-shot performance refers to the model’s ability to understand and respond to tasks it has not been specifically trained for, using its general understanding and reasoning capabilities. In the context of common sense reasoning tasks, this would involve responding accurately to queries requiring basic logical or societal understanding without prior specific training or examples. In the table above, you can see that the LLaMA model, despite having only 7B parameters — a size 25 times smaller than GPT-3 — manages to perform remarkably close to GPT-3 in various metrics. Impressively, when scaled up to just 33B parameters, LLaMA surpasses the performance of GPT-3, which has a much larger parameter count of 175B, across all measured benchmarks. Below is a brief description of each of the benchmarks used for your appreciation. BooIQ: A benchmark for question-answering that tests a model’s ability to understand and respond to boolean (yes/no) questions based on a given passage. Higher scores indicate better performance. PIQA (Physical Interaction Question Answering): Evaluates a model’s understanding of physical interactions in the world, requiring reasoning about everyday physical scenarios. Higher scores are better. SIQA (Social Interaction Question Answering): Focuses on testing social commonsense intelligence, particularly reasoning about people’s actions and their social implications. Higher scores indicate better comprehension of social contexts. HellaSwag: A challenge dataset for evaluating commonsense natural language inference (NLI). It’s designed to be particularly challenging for state-of-the-art models, though trivial for humans. Higher scores are better as they indicate greater accuracy in understanding commonsense scenarios. WinoGrande: A dataset for natural language understanding focused on common sense reasoning. It’s based on the Winograd Schema Challenge but scaled up. Higher scores indicate better performance. ARC-e (AI2 Reasoning Challenge Easy): Consists of grade-school level, multiple-choice science questions, testing a model’s basic scientific knowledge and reasoning. Higher scores indicate better understanding of elementary science concepts. ARC-c (AI2 Reasoning Challenge Challenge): Similar to ARC-e but includes more challenging science questions. Higher scores indicate a more advanced understanding of scientific concepts and reasoning. OBQA (Open Book Question Answering): Tests a model’s ability to answer open-domain questions using both its internal knowledge and an external “book” or source of information. Higher scores reflect better performance in integrating and utilising external information. Performance comparison for ‘Massive Multitask Language Understanding’ MMLU, stands for “Massive Multitask Language Understanding”, is a benchmark designed to evaluate the language understanding capabilities of AI models across a diverse range of subjects and difficulty levels. The key aspects of MMLU includes: Breadth of Topics: MMLU encompasses 57 distinct tasks covering a wide array of topics. Depth of Knowledge: The benchmark tests not just surface-level knowledge but also deep understanding, with tasks varying from basic to advanced levels. Multitask Evaluation: MMLU assesses the model’s ability to handle multiple tasks, gauging its versatility and adaptability in understanding and reasoning. Measuring Comprehensive Knowledge: To score highly on MMLU, a model must demonstrate not just factual knowledge but also proficiency in problem-solving and reasoning across the various tasks. Credits: Meta-AI (LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models) In the comparison of LLaMA and GPT-3 using the MMLU benchmark (refer to the table above), the distinct difference in model sizes is evident. GPT-3, with its substantial 175B parameters, is markedly larger than any LLaMA variant. This extensive size enables GPT-3 to store and process an immense breadth of information, an advantage in the MMLU benchmark that demands proficiency across a diverse array of knowledge areas and complex reasoning tasks. Despite this, LLaMA, with only 13B parameters, demonstrates exceptional performance, surpassing GPT-3 in the assessed topics and tasks. This highlights LLaMA’s efficiency and capability in handling such comprehensive language understanding challenges, even with a significantly smaller parameter count Overcoming Technical Challenges, Llama.cpp is a game-changer. Running Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 on standard personal computers is challenging. Running these models need a lot of computing power and need high-end GPUs, which most people don’t have access to, making it even more challenging. However, the advent of Llama.cpp revolutionised this landscape, enabling the open-source community to run their own LLMs on commodity hardware. Llama.cpp, developed by Georgi Gerganov, represents a significant advancement in the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs).

    "originBody": "Altcoins Will Cardano’s Hoskinson and Sam Altman pair up soon? 3min Read Charles Hoskinson tweets to Sam Altman, asking him to collaborate on a project. Victor Olanrewaju Journalist Posted: November 19, 2023 Share this article Share Tweet Charles Hoskinson reached out to Sam Altman for a project. ADA’s price increased after the tweet. Cardano’s [ADA] founder Charles Hoskinson has openly asked the embattled former CEO of OpenAI Sam Altman to join him in a project. Hoskinson acknowledged Altman’s expertise may come in handy in building a decentralized LLM for the Cardano blockchain. Sam @sama since you have some free time now. If you are interested in doing a decentralized LLM, then hit me up. Would be a fun Cardano Partnerchain — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) November 18, 2023 LLM is an acronym for Large Language Models. It is described as an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) model developed to train and recognize different human languages. A decentralized LLM is an AI model that leverages blockchain technology for improved security and transparency for a project. A quick job offer for the man Hoskinson’s request was born out of the fact that Altman may have free time on his hands. This is majorly because of his firing that took place recently, as AMBCrypto reported. Besides, that Cardano has been wrestling the top spot for development activity with Polkadot [DOT] for a while. Should Altman agree to the proposal, then the project might cement its position as the leader as per the metric. AMBCrypto considered evaluating the state of Cardano’s development activity. Using Santiment’s on-chain data, the analysis revealed that there has been a slight drop in the metric. The development activity measures the dedication developers have toward upgrades on a network. An increase in the metric suggests a surge in the number of new features shipped. On the other hand, a decrease implies a decline in the rate of network polishing. However, the fall in development activity does not take away the fact that Cardano has some major milestones during the week. Source: Santiment Bullish for ADA, but a low chance for Cardano Another metric worthy of consideration is the Weighted Sentiment, which shows whether the crowd is bullish or bearish on a project. In the last seven days, Cardano’s Weighted Sentiment had moved from 0.218 to 1.529. This increase implies that the market has switched from a pessimistic view to an optimistic one. This thought process was also evident in ADA’s price action. At press time, ADA’s price was $0.37. The spike was a result of a 6.60% 24-hour increase. But are traders still bullish on ADA? Well, indications from the Funding Rate seem to think so. At the time of writing, the Funding Rate was 0.01%. Funding rates tell if open positions in the derivatives market tilt toward the upside or if traders are projecting a downtrend. Since the Funding Rate was not negative, it means traders have more positions predicting another hike for ADA. Meanwhile, Hoskinson’s call to Altman may not yield anything positive yet. Source: Santiment Realistic or not, here’s ADA’s market cap in DOT’s terms This inference is due to the complicated circumstances around the revered OpenAI co-founder. At press time, employees of the AI firm have asked the company’s board to reinstate him. The board has been considering it, according to CNN Business. Should OpenAI recall Altman, and he agrees, it may become difficult for Hoskinson to get his way. Victor Olanrewaju Victor is a full-time journalist at AMBCrypto.

    "originBody": "Features Navigating the Trail of History and Vision Through Intellectual Quills Published 14 hours ago on 2023/11/19 By Thilina Walpola Share Tweet Review of ‘Sri Lanka @ 75’ By Sarath Wijesinghe President’s Counsel (LLM International Law (UCL)), former Ambassador to UAE and Israel, President of the Lanka Ambassador’s Forum United Kingdom, Solicitor England and Wales, and Suchithra Withanage (LLM (UK) (LLM (UK) MBA (UK, Reading) LLB (Hons) (UK)) MCIArb (UK) MBCS (UK) MCMI (UK) ACIPR (UK) ‘Sri Lanka @ 75: Perils of Complacency in a Fragile Nation,’ penned by President’s Counsel Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya, is a highly educative publication, teeming with profound insights and visionary discernments. In this compilation, Dr. Jayasuriya navigates the labyrinthine corridors of Sri Lanka’s history, celebrating the undulating tapestry of triumphs and tribulations, and beckoning forth an evocative exploration of its future, summoned through the resonant voices of erudite luminaries hailing from diverse fields. The book is dedicated to two diplomatic luminaries who have left a resounding impact on the annals of Sri Lankan history. Hon. D.S. Senanayake, often hailed as the “Father of the Nation,” represents a beacon of statesmanship, whose devotion to the cause of self-rule was instrumental in guiding Sri Lanka towards emancipation from the clutches of colonial subjugation. His perspicacity in comprehending the intricate fabric of Sri Lanka’s ethnic and cultural diversity paved the way for the nation’s unity and independence. Beyond the mantle of Sri Lanka’s inaugural Prime Minister, he remains a symbol of unity, foresight, and statesmanship, an exemplar for future generations to emulate. The book also extends its tribute to H.E. Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the inaugural female President of Sri Lanka, a pioneering figure in the nation’s political panorama. Her tenure, characterized by a remarkable ability to bridge the chasms of ethnicity and politics, served as a beacon of reconciliation and unity in a post-conflict Sri Lanka. Her ceaseless endeavors in nurturing peace, justice, and socio-economic development, resonate as a testament to her commitment to her homeland, leaving a significant imprint on Sri Lankan politics, and earning commendation both domestically and internationally. Dr. Dushani Weerakoon’s incisive analysis of the nation’s economic development since its inception in 1948 within these pages, replete with invaluable statistics and insights, adds gravitas to the volume. The discerning assessment by the Chief Guest at the book’s inauguration, Hon. Eran Wickremaratne, further underscores the eloquence and significance of the discourse contained therein, affirming its pertinence to the audience. Dr. Harsha Aturupane’s meticulous scrutiny of Sri Lanka’s educational system from 1948 to 2023, while acknowledging its merits, draws attention to its evident shortcomings, beckoning a much-needed reevaluation of this critical facet of national development. In addition, the essays penned by Dr. Lalani Rajapaksa and Dr. Narada Warnasuriya on the nation’s healthcare sector unearth the challenges posed by drug shortages and inefficiencies stemming from mismanagement. These pressing concerns warrant due consideration by academics and professionals. The comprehensive exploration of Sri Lanka’s legal system and legal education, as elucidated by Emeritus Professor Savitri Goonesekere, heralds a pertinent discussion in contemporary times. The Lanka Ambassadors’ Forum United Kingdom’s commitment to facilitating this discourse in its forthcoming volume stands as a commendable initiative, underscoring the importance of soliciting intellectual and professional input to fortify the nation’s legal framework. The work of Emeritus Prof. M. Sornarajah on constitutionalism and Dr. Nirmala Chandrahasan’s engrossing exposition on the struggles of the Tamil community for equality offer multifaceted perspectives on historical injustices, governmental involvement, and the ensuing tumultuous period in the nation’s history as well. Furthermore, Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy’s illuminating treatise on the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and its repercussions for the nation’s economy imparts valuable knowledge from a seasoned veteran in the field. In a similar vein, Emeritus Professor Amal Jayawardane’s masterpiece on foreign policy bears the weight of contemporary relevance, deserving expansion to navigate the currents of Sri Lanka’s evolving socio-political landscape, to illuminate the path for professionals, academics, and policymakers. Dr. Dayanath Jayasuriya himself unfurls a profound banner of reflection upon religion, law, and the constitution in his article, inviting contemplation and discourse. Shanti Jayasuriya’s treatise on the ‘Status of Women in Sri Lanka’ augments this symphony of contemplation with her own musings on equality, being the lady behind the success of Dr. Dayanath’s endeavors. It must also be noted that Kavinda Rathnapala and Malik Cader contribute holistic narratives that delve into the recent turbulence in the political sphere and the intricacies of the stock market, evoking introspection on matters of immediate concern. In its entirety, Dr. Jayasuriya’s compilation of academia reflects a masterstroke in intellectual pursuit, and a beckoning call for collective educational upliftment of the country. Dr. Dayanath is a frequent contributor to the academic volumes published by the Lanka Ambassadors’ Forum – United Kingdom, and is poised to be honored with a prestigious award by the Forum in January 2014. We wish him all success and salute the relentless endeavors of this assembly of intellects, ardent in their service to the realm of ideas and contemplations, who have uplifted the scholastic spirit of intellectuals and academics alike.

Features Parliament and the question of sovereignty Published 14 hours ago on 2023/11/19 By Thilina Walpola By Uditha Devapriya Conversations lay down the foundation for consensus, they provoke discussion and enable debate. One Text Initiative’s (OTI) session on strengthening parliamentary fiscal sovereignty through the Committee System, held last Thursday, October 16, at Water’s Edge, opened such a debate and discussion. While it’s still hard to think of consensus over matters like fiscal sovereignty, the issue remains relevant enough. At its core is whether Parliament should take up responsibility for the country’s economy and resist capture by the Executive. The Committee system is one of many systems if not the main such through which one can enhance Parliamentary autonomy. Indeed, it may be the best. Debates over Executive accountability and Parliamentary sovereignty rest on the concept of separation of powers. Formulated by Montesquieu, but practised in some form long before his theorisation, it lies at the heart of political debates in Sri Lanka. To what extent in Sri Lanka’s Legislature sovereign and to what extent has it been captured by the Executive? Are binaries between these two arms arbitrary or valid? The OTI session asked these questions, and though it didn’t answer all of them, it left much room for reflection. Given that we are in the middle of an economic crunch, I think it behoves us to look at the issue from not one or two but as many perspectives as possible. This is especially so since the Legislature represents a midway point between the other two arms of the State: unlike the Judiciary, it is an elected body, and unlike the Executive, it does not concentrate power or confer it on a select group of people. Depending on who is in power, the Parliament can epitomise the best or worst of both worlds. Its barometer is the confidence of the public. If it loses that, it loses its raison d’etre. And there is no greater gauge of public confidence than the economy. This is why fiscal sovereignty is so important. The One Text Initiative session began with a presentation by Dr Nishan de Mel. Citing the Constitution, Dr de Mel observed, correctly, that Parliament has outsourced its powers, particularly over financial matters, to third parties. He traced this issue to three distinct but interrelated problems: an informational (lack of awareness among parliamentarians and, by extension, the public), a behavioural (subverted incentives stemming from Executive capture of Parliament), and a structural (lack of ability and knowledge, expertise, and experience) one. These three problems have made it possible for external players to not just subvert but also take over the Parliament’s functions. De Mel’s concerns are valid, and I believe they have a profound bearing on the current IMF programme. Though I remain a critic of IMF policies and prescription, I do admit that long before other think-tanks, de Mel pointed out that Sri Lanka should draw up its own reform programme before going to the IMF. At a forum organised by the Chamber of Commerce in December 2021 – a month or two before the economic crisis hit the country – he bluntly observed that “You do not get the credit officer to write the plan.” At the heart of this issue is a lack or crisis of credibility – a potential fourth pillar de Mel could have included in his presentation – both in terms of the public’s perception of the Legislature and in terms of the international community’s dealings with that not-so august body. Yet instead of forcing Parliament to become more accountable to the people in economic matters, this lack of credibility has actually fuelled its tendency to outsource or “farm out” – de Mel’s words – to external institutions. The whole point of parliamentary sovereignty is its accountability to the people. This is especially so given that the Legislature is the most representative body of the State, giving space to both the majority and minority. There is no point having a Parliament if economic matters are decided by other parties, particularly those outside the country. The Parliament itself has Committees which look into these matters, which probe them, which reinforce bipartisanship. But rather than strengthening them, we have become content in resorting to those other institutions. We are confronted with two dilemmas here. On the one hand, the Parliament reflects a composition which has not changed since 2020. It no longer reflects the popular will it once indubitably had. Moreover, it has displayed gross incompetence in economic matters. I am not thinking only in terms of policy here, but also in terms of optics, a fitting example of which would be the recent fiasco involving Professor Ranjith Bandara. That lack of credibility has fed into a crisis of confidence within the Legislature, which in turn has compelled the ruling party to rely on what third parties rather than the Opposition says on economic policy issues. On the other hand, the government is using its engagement with third parties, the IMF in particular, to justify its continued hold on power. In that sense, it isn’t just Executive capture of the Legislature which we should talk about or be worried about, it’s also Legislative capture of the Executive. The nexus between these two institutions has grown over the last few decades, though recent developments, like the Supreme Court ruling on MP Naseer Ahamed, has gone some way in restoring accountability to Parliament. Yet we cannot deny that, in terms of financial matters and fiscal sovereignty, the Legislature’s own incompetence has made Executive overreach easy: a point that almost all MPs who spoke at the OTI session, including Harsha de Silva and Charitha Herath, noted. That raises a crucial question: if the Parliament of its own accord has become a handmaiden of the Executive, who else can we blame but the parliamentarians themselves? My own take here is that civil society in Sri Lanka, in Colombo, is much too concerned with how the Executive has intruded into the Legislature to think about how the Legislature has ingratiated itself before the Executive and external parties. We should prevent too much overlap between these institutions, but we must also realise that overlaps of this sort are a two-way street. In that sense Harsha de Silva’s polite riposte to de Mel’s presentation – that there is a rift between theory and practice – seems apt, if not valid. Accordingly, if fiscal or economic sovereignty has eroded in here, it is not because powerful forces have usurped it from less powerful ones, but because the less powerful have ceded it to the more powerful. The fault, as Shakespeare once wrote, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves.

Continue Reading Features “CRUSH THE EXISTENCE OF VERMIN” Published 14 hours ago on 2023/11/19 By Thilina Walpola DONALD TRUMP GOES FULL HITLER ON CAMPAIGN TRAIL by Vijaya Chandrasoma Much has been written about Trump’s election to the presidency in 2016; his ignorant, incompetent, criminal administration between 2016 and 2020; his Big Lie about a perfectly fair election being “stolen” from him; his fraudulent, criminal and seditious behavior since his defeat that has seen him convicted on fraud and rape, arrested and on bail on four indictments and 91 felony charges. More has been written about the debasement of the Republican Party, once the Party of Family Values and the Rule of Law, into the authoritarian Party of Trump, with complete disregard for truth, decency, justice, the constitution and the Rule of Law. It is a party which has amazingly all but nominated a twice-impeached former president and a convicted criminal as its candidate for the 2024 presidency. The Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), Ronna McDaniel, said that the RNC will back Trump for the 2024 presidency even as a convicted felon! Interestingly, Ronna McDaniel is a niece of Utah Senator and 2012 Republican nominee for the presidency, Mitt Romney. At a recent speech announcing his retirement from the Senate in 2025, Romney condemned Trump as a “Demagogue”, saying, “It is pretty clear that the Party is inclined to a populist demagogue message”. Previous Trump lawyer, Ty Cobb said last Tuesday at an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, “Trump’s behavior diminishes not only himself but also the United States of America”. What is emerging of the plans of Trump and his allies if he is elected president in 2024 (he is currently leading President Biden 49% to 45% in recent national polls) are truly terrifying. And these plans are not based on reports from the “fake news media”; they are openly, loudly and proudly ranted by Trump himself during his recent campaign tirades, cheered on by his supporters. These plans include: Revenge against political opponents, with the weaponization of the FBI, the Department of Justice and Law Enforcement. Trump went full Hitler during a Veteran’s Day campaign speech last Monday: “We pledge to you that we will root out the communists, Marxists, Fascists and the radical left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, lie, steal and cheat on elections, and will do anything possible, whether legally or illegally, to destroy America and the American Dream.” He added: “The threat from outside forces is far less sinister, dangerous and grave than the threat from within. Despite the hatred and anger of the Radical Left Lunatics who want to destroy our country, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”. The particular use of the word “vermin” is most significant. Historian, John Meacham said that “Trump is lifting rhetoric from Hitler and the Third Reich. Because to call your opponents vermin, to dehumanize them, is to not only open the door, but to walk through the door towards the most ghastly kinds of crimes”. And we all saw where that door led to at the Nazi concentration camps. In his last will and testament, signed shortly before his suicide, Hitler wrote that the true meaning of his prophecy of 1939 was to “exterminate the vermin throughout Europe”. Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, responded, “Those who try to make these assertions are clearly snowflakes suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, and their entire existence will be crushed when President Trump returns to the White House”. “Entire existence of vermin” crushed, exterminated, baked, gassed – distinctions without a difference. At least they are honest about their intentions. President Biden assailed Trump’s disgusting rhetoric. “It echoes language you heard in Nazi Germany in the 1930s”. He also recalled a past comment when Trump said that immigrants “were poisoning the blood of our country”. Our “Country of Immigrants” has always been proudly awash with the blood, pure and impure, of immigrants. Never forget the words engraved on the Statue of Liberty, “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore”. Those huddled masses, that wretched refuse, they were all immigrants, not vermin. As are the teeming masses huddled on our southern border, yearning to breathe free. They are not, as Trump has often derided them, rapists and murderers. They are human beings, immigrants, certainly not vermin. So when Trump calls immigrants and leftists vermin, he doesn’t mean “them”, he means “you”. When people tell you who they are and what they are going to do, believe them. White House Staff of a second Trump administration. Another terrifying prospect of a second Trump term from 2025 would be the fawning devotion, the unquestioning loyalty of the people he will employ in the highest and lowest posts in his administration. In 2016, most of his top officials were “yes men”, loyalists who were happy to obey his every command, however unconstitutional, even criminal. But there were a few who did push against Trump’s worst instincts. People like former Defense Secretary James Mattis, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, former Chief of Staff John Kelly, to name just three, who were summarily fired because “they were not loyal enough”, or resigned because they were sick of working for a treasonous criminal. Or as former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, also fired by Trump, said, “a f…ing moron”. In 2025, however, with the guard-rails removed, the entirety of the Trump administration, including his cabinet and senior diplomats, will be composed of 110% Trump loyalists. A bunch of white supremacist rabble drawn from the radical red, QAnon, Christian, white supremacist politicians of the Party of Trump, backed by the domestic terrorist cults of the KKK, the Proud Boys and the Oathkeepers. Trump has already stated that he plans to purge the government of at least 50,000 employees, “with a particular focus on corrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus”. He would institute a massive overhaul of federal workers, replacing them with an installation of loyalists. “With you at my side, we will demolish the Deep State, we will expel the political class that hates our country”. Demolish, expel, exterminate – again, distinctions without a difference. Immigration Trump has pledged to “immediately stop the invasion of our southern border” and end illegal immigration. Travel Bans “In my second term, we’re going to expand each and every one of those bans because we have no choice. We aren’t bringing anyone in from Gaza, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, or Libya or anywhere else that threatens our security”. Tests for anyone trying to enter the United States “I will implement (the) strong idea of logical screening of all immigrants. If you sympathize with Jihadists, you are not getting in. We don’t want you. You’re fired”. In the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel, he will put in place “ideological screening”, for immigrants to identify those “dangerous lunatics, haters, bigots and maniacs and those who empathize with radical Islamic terrorists and extremists”. In addition to banning many from entering, Trump is vowing a historic removal of immigrants. “We will begin the largest domestic deportation operation in American history”, vowing to implement a “massive deportation blitz”, including rounding up undocumented and legal immigrants and “concentrating” on detaining them in sprawling “camps” while they wait to be “expelled”. Concentrating, camps, expel – doesn’t take much imagination to work out the meanings of those words, does it? Family Separations. Trump is threatening to restart his policy of family separations at the border, taking children away by force from the arms of their parents. Some of the families so separated during Trump’s first term have never been reunited. “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come. We did family separations (during his first term), a lot of people didn’t come. It stopped people coming by the hundreds of thousands because when they hear family separation, they say, well, we better not”. Boasting about the benefits of separating children from their parents – that is the epitome of cruelty. Foreign Policy. Trump continues to threaten the withdrawal of the United States from NATO, the longest peacetime military alliance in history, unless they pay their fair share for their collective defense. Trump claims that “even before I am inaugurated, (in January 2025), I will have settled the war between Russia and Ukraine”, including the “endless flow of American treasure to Ukraine”. Sure, he will. He will simply end the war by encouraging his mentor, Putin, to illegally annex Ukraine, a sovereign, independent nation. And he will support Putin in his future invasions of the old Soviet Union countries, now sovereign nations under the aegis of NATO. There are many other changes for the worse which can be expected if Trump wins a second term. These changes, basically culture wars, have little to do with issues that affect the American people. Issues like the economy, jobs and income inequality, inflation, healthcare and the social safety net, gun violence, voting rights, LGBTQ and transgender rights, women’s reproductive freedom, climate change and pollution, etc. Instead, Trump and the Republican Party are more concerned about delaying the cases of 91 felony charges against Trump till after the November 2024 election; pardons for the rioters convicted of federal offenses for their participation in the January 6, 2021 insurrection; self-pardons of Trump, his family and cronies in all past, present and future crimes. Trump plans to dismantle the Department of Education, with the federal government exerting more power on public schools and colleges, where the main thrust of educational policies would be an emphasis on Christianity, denial of history, banning of “restricted” books and “schools that will teach students to love their country, not to hate their country as they are taught right now”. Trump’s policy to combat endemic gun violence in schools would be to encourage schools employing veterans, retired police officers and trained gun owners as armed guards, and permit teachers to carry concealed weapons. According to him, “as everyone knows, having more guns is the only certain answer to reduce gun violence.” Just last Tuesday, a Republican Senator challenged a witness, during a hearing, for a fist fight on the Senate floor. On the same day, former Speaker McCarthy elbowed a fellow Republican Senator who had voted against him in the election for the Speakership weeks ago, with a clean blow to the kidneys on the hallowed hallways of the Capitol. Encounters inappropriate even in Junior High School yards rather than in the “highest deliberative body in the world”. The Republican Party, from Trump downwards (or is it upwards?) is out of control, having shed their collective sense of shame faster and with less embarrassment than a stripper sheds her bikini. Trump would also encourage police officers to use violence to deter crime. In a recent speech, he said he would authorize police officers to shoot suspected shoplifters caught in the act. “Very simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store”. Especially if you are black, you will be shot solely on suspicion, no arrest, no trial, just capital punishment for stealing a pack of cigarettes. On the other hand, you can make $2 billion on an illegal real estate deal with the Saudis with impunity. Especially if you are white, and the president’s son-in-law. Trump Justice, in a nutshell These are a few reasons that will gladden the hearts of Trump supporters and Make America Great Again, AGAIN. There are more, too lengthy to add to this already prolix essay. Fortunately, I’ll be long dead, having shuffled off this mortal coil, grieving the tragedy that, for the first time in the history of the greatest democracy in the world, we will be leaving our children and our grandchildren with a future fraught with danger: If Trump wins the White House in 2024.

Of the 154 applications received and interviewed 33 applicants (20 females and 13 males) had been selected and invited to attend the final three-day workshop which commenced last Monday (13). M.J.F. Rinoosiya, the first female head of SLBC’s Muslim Service said that it is on air from 8AM to 11:30AM and again between 8PM and 9PM and is extremely popular among the Muslim community in Sri Lanka and added that “the responses we receive from around the country is proof of its popularity” She said that at present there was a dearth of youthful voices as it was over three decades ago that the Muslim Service last engaged artistes. SLBC’s Director Training Lalani Wickramaraja said that the Muslim Service was one of the most profitable services of SLBC and added that the audience changed her view that males dominated the Muslim society. The workshop was facilitated by SCOPE (Strengthening Social Cohesion and Peace in Sri Lanka) together with the European Union, Deutsche Zusammenarbeit (German Cooperation) and Deutsche Gesellschaft fùr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Gmbh. Media Development Specialist and Director of the Foundation for Advancing Critical Thinking in South Asia (FACTS) Dr. M.C.

    "originBody": "Microsoft Azure Unveils Models as a Service (MaaS) for Llama 2 Microsoft Azure new AI launch at Microsoft Ignite Akhil Kumar · Follow Published in ILLUMINATION’S MIRROR · 4 min read · 13 hours ago -- In an exciting announcement, Microsoft Azure is proud to introduce the upcoming preview of Models as a Service (MaaS), a groundbreaking initiative offering pay-as-you-go (PayGo) inference APIs and hosted fine-tuning for Llama 2 in the Azure AI model catalog. This expansion of our collaboration with Meta marks a significant step towards providing cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) through MaaS in Azure AI Studio. Photo by Matthew Manuel on Unsplash Simplifying Access to Llama 2 with PayGo Inference APIs MaaS aims to simplify the experience for Generative AI developers working with LLMs like Llama 2. Accessing Llama 2 as an API becomes seamless, and the introduction of PayGo inference APIs, billed based on token usage, reduces the entry barrier for developers. This allows for effortless exploration of the model in the playground or integration with preferred LLM tools such as prompt flow, Semantic Kernel, or LangChain, enabling the development of innovative LLM applications. Hosted Fine-Tuning for Personalized Models A standout feature of MaaS is the ability to fine-tune Llama 2 with custom data, enhancing the model’s understanding of specific domains or problem spaces. Hosted fine-tuning not only boosts prediction accuracy but also comes at a more accessible price point. This feature caters to developers seeking personalized models without compromising on cost-effectiveness. Content Moderation and Responsible AI Practices Ensuring responsible AI practices, Llama 2 inference APIs in Azure AI come equipped with built-in content moderation. This layered approach aligns with Microsoft’s commitment to providing ethical and responsible AI solutions. By incorporating content filtering systems, we aim to detect and prevent the output of potentially harmful content, fostering a secure environment for Generative AI developers. Making Azure the Preferred Platform for Generative AI Azure AI strives to be the preferred platform for developing Generative AI applications. MaaS reinforces this commitment by providing seamless access to cutting-edge LLMs like Llama 2. By eliminating the need for dedicated virtual machines with high-end GPUs, MaaS ensures that cost and GPU availability do not hinder the development and deployment of Generative AI models. Getting Started with Models as a Service on Azure For those eager to explore Models as a Service on Azure, the process is straightforward. If you’re new to Azure AI Studio, follow a simple guide to familiarize yourself and create your first project. Open the model catalog in AI Studio, filter by the Meta collection, or click on the MaaS announcement card to view models. Select the Llama-2–70b-chat model, deploy it using the PayGo deployment option, and subscribe to the offer. Within seconds, you’ll find yourself in the Playground, ready to explore and customize the model. Developing LLM Apps with Prompt Flow Once the Llama 2 model is deployed, streamline the development of AI apps using prompt flow. Utilize the Open Source LLM Tool within prompt flow to seamlessly integrate Llama 2 models into your projects. Configure the tool to use your deployed Llama 2 endpoint, supporting both completion and chat API types, and customize parameters to match your project’s requirements. Customize Llama 2 with Hosted Fine-Tuning Fine-tuning large language models like Llama 2 is a common practice among developers and data scientists. Hosted fine-tuning, supported on Llama 2–7b, Llama 2–13b, and Llama 2–70b models, simplifies this process. By adopting a pay-as-you-go approach, developers only pay for the actual training time required, reducing costs and latency. Fine-tuned models can be seamlessly deployed and integrated with leading LLM tools for enhanced AI capabilities. Building Responsibly with Content Safety Content safety is a paramount consideration in Generative AI development. The content filtering system integrated into Llama 2 inference APIs ensures a responsible approach to AI. By running both prompts and completions through an ensemble of classification models, harmful content is detected and action is taken accordingly. This content safety feature aligns with Microsoft’s commitment to providing a secure and ethical AI environment. John Montgomery, Corporate Vice President, Azure AI Platform at Microsoft, expressed excitement about the launch, stating, “With Models as a Service (MaaS) on Azure AI, we’re showing our commitment to giving developers the best in AI technology. We’ve collaborated with Meta to bring Llama 2 to Azure AI Studio through MaaS, making the best frontier and open language models more accessible and adaptable.” Conclusion The upcoming preview of Models as a Service (MaaS) is a pivotal step in democratizing AI. PayGo Inference APIs and hosted fine-tuning capabilities for state-of-the-art models like Llama 2 aim to significantly reduce barriers to adoption. Microsoft Azure continues to empower every organization, developer, and data scientist to harness the power of generative AI, regardless of skill level or organizational size. As we unveil these new capabilities, we eagerly anticipate the innovative applications and solutions that the developer community will build on the Azure AI platform.",
