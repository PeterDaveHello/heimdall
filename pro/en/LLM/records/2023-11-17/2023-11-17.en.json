This architecture is the only solution in the world that enables artificial intelligence (AI) technologists to design a unified data architecture that delivers the performance of a super computing-class parallel file system coupled with the ease of application and research access to standard NFS. “Overcoming Performance Bottlenecks With a Network File System in Solid State Drives” Post this For AI strategies to succeed, organizations need the ability to scale to a massive number of GPUs, as well as the flexibility to access local and distributed data silos. Additionally, they need the ability to leverage data regardless of the hardware or cloud infrastructure on which it currently resides, as well as the security controls to uphold data governance policies. The magnitude of these requirements is particularly critical in the development of LLMs, which often necessitate utilizing hundreds of billions of parameters, tens of thousands of GPUs, and hundreds of petabytes of diverse types of unstructured data. Hammerspace’s announcement unveils the proven architecture uniquely delivering the performance, ease of deployment, and standards-based software and hardware support required to meet the unique requirements of LLM data pipelines and data storage. Hammerspace Ultra High-Performance File System AI architects and technologists may need to take advantage of existing networks, storage hardware, and compute clusters while strategically adding new infrastructure as their AI operations grow. Hammerspace unifies the entire data pipeline into a single, parallel global file system that integrates existing infrastructure and data with new datasets and resources as they are added. The parallel file system architecture is critical for training AI as countless processes or nodes need to access the same data simultaneously. Hammerspace delivers efficient and concurrent data access, reduces workflow bottlenecks, and improves overall system utilization of the client servers, GPUs, network, and data storage nodes. Hammerspace Standards-Based Software Approach The Hammerspace parallel file system client is an NFS4.2 client built into Linux, leveraging Hammerspace’s contribution of FlexFiles into the Linux distribution. This approach uniquely enables existing standard Linux client servers to achieve direct, high-performance access to data via Hammerspace’s software. The use of a standard NAS interface empowers researchers and applications to easily access data over the widely adopted NFS protocol and enables the ability to tap into the larger user and vendor communities that are troubleshooting, updating and improving a standards-based environment. Hammerspace on Commodity Hardware Hammerspace provides a software-defined data platform compatible with any standards-based hardware such as white box Linux servers, Open Compute Project (OCP) hardware, Supermicro, etc. This allows organizations to better leverage their existing hardware investment and benefit from cost-effective infrastructure at scale. Hammerspace Streamlined Data Pipelines The Hammerspace architecture creates a unified, high-performance global data environment that provides concurrent and continuous execution of all phases of LLM training and inference workloads. Hammerspace is unique in its ability to break down data silos, seamlessly accessing training data scattered across diverse data center and cloud storage systems from any vendor or location. By leveraging training data wherever it might be stored, Hammerspace streamlines AI workloads by minimizing the need to copy and move files into a consolidated new repository. This approach reduces overhead, as well as the risk of introducing errors and inaccuracies in LLMs. At the application level, data is accessed through a standard NFS file interface to ensure direct access to files in the standard format applications are typically designed for. Hammerspace High-Speed Data Path Hammerspace reduces network transmissions and data hops at every point possible within the data path. This approach ensures near 100 percent utilization of the available infrastructure while delivering a streamlined high-bandwidth, low-latency data path between applications, compute, and data storage nodes. More detail about the innovation and benefits can be found in the IEEE article, “Overcoming Performance Bottlenecks With a Network File System in Solid State Drives” by David Flynn and Thomas Coughlin. Hammerspace Fault-Tolerant Design LLM environments are massive, complex systems with extensive power and infrastructure. These AI systems often rely on continuously updating models based on new data. Hammerspace is capable of operating at peak performance through a system outage, allowing AI technologies to focus less on recovery from power, network, or system failures and more on persistence through those failures. Hammerspace Objective-Based Data Placement Hammerspace software decouples the file system layer from the storage layer, enabling independent scaling of I/O and IOPS at the data layer. Extremely high-performance NVMe storage can co-exist with lower cost, lower performing, and geographically distributed storage tiers – including the cloud – in a global data environment. Data orchestration between tiers and/or locations is controlled transparently as a background operation based on objective-based policies. These software objectives enable powerful automation to ensure data is automatically placed on the nodes, delivering the required performance when in use. When not in use, data can remain in high-performance storage nodes or be automatically placed in a more efficient location to reduce storage costs on inactive data. This approach ensures data is always available to saturate GPUs and network capacities when needed. Integrated machine learning (ML) capabilities within the Hammerspace architecture will begin to place related data sets in high-performance, local NVMe storage when the first file from the data set is accessed. “The most powerful AI initiatives will incorporate data from everywhere,” said David Flynn, Hammerspace Founder and CEO. “A high-performance data environment is critical to the success of initial AI model training. But even more important, it provides the ability to orchestrate the data from multiple sources for continuous learning. Hammerspace has set the gold standard for AI architectures at scale.” Learn More White Paper: Revolutionize Your AI Workloads with Hammerspace eBook: Unstructured Data Management for Dummies, Hammerspace Special Edition Solution Page: Hammerspace for Artificial Intelligence Podcast: Best Practices in Building AI Data Pipelines with David Flynn Podcast: Making the Potential of pNFS a Reality with Trond Myklebust Press Kit Images About Hammerspace Hammerspace is the data orchestration system that unlocks innovation and opportunity within unstructured data.

Developed by AI researchers at Patronus AI and 15 financial industry domain experts, FinanceBench is a high quality, large-scale set of 10,000 question and answer pairs based on publicly available financial documents like SEC 10Ks, SEC 10Qs, SEC 8Ks, earnings reports, and earnings call transcripts. It is presented as a first line of evaluation for LLMs on financial questions, with more advanced tests to be released in the future. Initial analysis by Patronus AI shows that state-of-the-art LLM retrieval systems fail spectacularly on a sample set of questions from FinanceBench. GPT-4 Turbo with a retrieval system fails 81% of the time Llama 2 with a retrieval system fails 81% of the time Patronus AI also evaluated LLMs with long context windows, noting that they perform better but are less practical for use in a production setting. In particular, GPT-4 Turbo with long context fails 21% of the time Anthropic's Claude-2 with long context fails 24% of the time Patronus AI notes that LLM retrieval systems are commonly used by enterprises today for multiple reasons. LLMs with long context windows are not only much slower and more expensive to use, but the context windows are still not large enough to support long documents typically used by analysts. \"While LLMs show promise in analyzing mass volumes of financial data, most models out in the market need a lot of refinement and steering to work properly,\" Anand Kannappan, CEO and co-founder, Patronus AI. \"And based on our specific evaluation of GPT-4 Turbo and other models, the margin of error is just too big for financial applications.\" \"Analysts are spending valuable time creating prompt test sets to evaluate LLM retrieval systems and manually inspecting outputs to identify hallucinations,\" Rebecca Qian, CTO and co-founder, Patronus AI. \"And there exist no benchmarks that can help identify exactly where LLMs fail in real world financial use cases. This is precisely why we developed FinanceBench.\" The new benchmark spans several LLM capabilities in finance: Numerical reasoning: Finance metrics requiring numerical calculations, e.g. EBITDA, PE ratio, CAGR. Information retrieval: Specific details extracted directly from the documents. Logical reasoning: Questions involving financial recommendations, which require interpretation and a degree of subjectivity. World knowledge: Basic accounting and finance questions that analysts are familiar with. As a part of this release, customers can now evaluate their LLM system against FinanceBench on the Patronus AI platform. The platform can also detect hallucinations and other unexpected LLM behavior on financial questions in a scalable way. Several financial services companies are piloting Patronus AI in the coming months. About Patronus AI Patronus AI is the first automated evaluation and security platform that helps companies use large language models (LLMs) confidently. The company was founded by machine learning experts Anand Kannappan and Rebecca Qian, formerly of Meta AI and Meta Reality Labs. For more information, please visit https://www.patronus.ai/.

    "originBody": "Corporate News Transcom and SiloGen reshaping CX through a specialized LLM November 16, 2023 Sam Heggie-Collins Transcom, a global leader in digital Customer Experience (CX) solutions and Silo AI, one of Europe’s largest private AI labs, are proud to announce a strategic partnership to build a specialized large language model (LLM) for CX. Leveraging technology from Silo AI’s product arm SiloGen, the specialized LLM aims to improve customer service and keep related costs down while ensuring data privacy and security, making it especially interesting for European companies. “At Transcom, we believe AI will revolutionize our industry. With this partnership, we’re on the barricades, able to provide a superhuman customer experience. We’ve been offering AI solutions for a long time, but with SiloGen’s game changing specialized LLM, we’ll make life easier for our agents, our clients, and their customers alike”, says Jonas Dahlberg, President & CEO, Transcom. The specialized LLM will be the foundation of the entire CX journey. It will empower the development of tailored AI solutions, including augmented agent assistance tools, tailored conversational AI, voice and chatbots, as well as conversational analytics for service and product insights. The benefits range from accelerated service automation to expedited agent proficiency, ultimately resulting in improved productivity, service availability, first contact resolution, and, most importantly, customer satisfaction. While using generic and readily LLMs might be simple it is neither effective nor efficient. Fine-tuning specialized LLMs for specialized tasks offer vast possibilities for control, alignment and efficiency, as well as performance. With a fine-tuned LLM it is possible to control what data the model is trained on and how that data is processed. Giving the LLM detailed insight on a company’s users, processes and products enables alignment with a company’s values and ways of working. This will, for example, create bots fully versed in the messaging and brand of a company, making it feel fully a part of a service instead of an addition. “We’re honoured to be a trusted partner for Transcom in their endeavour to provide best-in-class customer experience for their clients. Our values in terms of building human-centric technologies align perfectly and provide a foundation for a successful collaboration. Customer experience is such an important differentiator for companies, and we see tremendous potential for leveraging language models in order to help for instance customer service agents find the correct information in a timely manner to satisfy their customers. I believe the customer service LLM that we are building together will lead the way for many companies to follow”, says Peter Sarlin, CEO and co-founder of Silo AI. Transcom Transcom provides digitally enhanced customer experience (CX) services to some of the world’s most ambitious brands. More than 300 clients globally, including disruptive e-commerce players, category redefining fintechs, and technology legends rely on us for on-, off-, and nearshoring services. Transcom’s over 30,000 employees work in over 90 contact centres and work-at-home networks across 28 countries, creating brilliant experiences in customer care, sales, content moderation and backoffice services. We help our clients drive their brands forward, customer satisfaction up and operating costs down.

    "originBody": "Galileo Claims GPT-4 Excels in Multitasking with Minimal Hallucinations Among LLMs Arooj Ahmed 11/17/2023 10:55:00 AM Galileo is a San Francisco based company that helps other companies build fine Large Language Model (LLM) apps. Galileo made a hallucination index that researches about different LLMs and shows which of them hallucinate when faced with multiple tasks at once. Hallucinating is a recurring problem observed in LLMs that result in inaccurate and baseless results. After the research conducted by Galileo, it was found that ChatGPT-4 hallucinates the least when it has to work on multiple tasks. Galileo worked on different LLMs including Meta’s Llama, but it was soon revealed that many well known LLMs also cannot perform their tasks accurately without hallucinating. This keeps many enterprises from developing LLMs because they cannot work efficiently, especially in healthcare. Open AI’s GPT-4 was the only one that performed well when given tasks. Identifying LLM Hallucination– How Galileo Checked the Performance of LLMs? Many enterprises use AI and LLMs for their businesses. But when it comes to production, LLMs aren’t always reliable because sometimes their results aren’t 100%. It is because LLMs work according to the data they are given, and not if the information is factual or accurate. When generative AIs are being developed, there are a lot of things that need to be considered like is it for general use or is it a ChatBot for enterprises? Companies use benchmarks to monitor LLMs performance, but there is no saying when they will hallucinate. To tackle this problem, co-founder of Galileo, Atindriyo Sanyal, chose 11 LLMs of all sizes and capacities and checked the performance of each of them one by one. He asked those LLMs general questions using TruthfulQA and TriviaQA to monitor their hallucination. Galileo used its Correctness and Context Adherence metrics because they make it easy for engineers and data scientists to easily find out at what point LLMs are hallucinating. The metrics were focused on logic-based mistakes made by those LLMs. Correctness Score of LLMs by Galileo After QnA with LLMs, Galileo came to a conclusion about those LLMs with a correctness score. The LLM with the highest score was GPT-4 (0613) with a 0.77 score. GPT-3.5 Turbo(1106) was just behind with 0.74 score. GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct and GPT-3.5 Turbo(0613) both had 0.70 correctness score. After the GPT versions came Meta’s Llama-2-70b with 0.65 score. Mosaic’s ML’s MPT-7b Instruct had a 0.40 score. For information retrieval, GPT-4(0613) still came at the top with a 0.76 score. Zephyr-7b, a model by Hugging Face, surpassed LLama in this category with 0.71 score. Llama had 0.69 score. The LLM that needed the most improvement and had the lowest points of 0.58 was Mosaic ML’s MPT-7b. UAE’s Falcon 40-b lies just above it with 0.60. GPT-4(0163) was at the top for correctly generating long forms of texts like essays, articles etc. It has a score of 0.83. Llama came in second with 0.82 correctness score. These two models were the least to hallucinate when given multiple tasks. MPT-7b was the last with 0.53 score. With Correctness Comes a Cost As much as reliable ChatGPT-4 seems to be, there is still a factor that makes it less appealing to many–its pricing plan. GPT-4(0613) isn’t free to users but GPT 3.5 also serves almost the same as GPT-4 when it comes to being least hallucinated. There are also other alternatives like LLama-2-70b which is also good in its performance. Plus, it is free of cost. Read next: AI's Data Dilemma Shows Less Can Be More Facebook Twitter",
