E-commerce giant JD.com, video gaming powerhouse NetEase and food delivery market leader Meituan are among a number of Big Tech companies that have started hiring HarmonyOS app developers, according to online career sites Maimai and liepin.com. Beijing-based Meituan, for example, is actively recruiting for a number of such roles, including HarmonyOS infrastructure engineer. The on-demand local services provider is offering a monthly salary of between 40,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan (US$5,492 and US$8,238) for app developers “with HarmonyOS experience” and those who can “work on research and development projects based on incumbent [technological] infrastructure”. JD.com and NetEase, meanwhile, are looking for developers purportedly for specific apps designed for Huawei’s smartphones, according to the two job sites. HarmonyOS, the self-developed mobile operating system of Huawei Technologies, was designed to run on multiple devices to rival Google’s widely adopted Android platform. Photo: Shutterstock The recruitment drive of these major internet firms bolsters Huawei’s strategy to widen the adoption of HarmonyOS as an alternative ecosystem on the mainland, as set out by company founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei this year to counter the impact of US sanctions. More than 700 million devices currently run on HarmonyOS, with more than 2.2 million third-party developers creating apps for the platform, according to Richard Yu Chengdong, chief executive of Huawei’s consumer business group and chairman of its Intelligent Automotive Solution business unit, at the company’s annual developer conference in August. Yu said the next iteration of Huawei’s mobile platform, HarmonyOS Next, will involve removing support for Android-based apps on all the company’s devices installed with that new operating system. The company is expected to launch a developer preview version of its Next system in the first quarter of next year. HarmonyOS debuted as an alternative operating system for Huawei in August 2019, three months after the firm was added to Washington’s Entity List. Under this trade blacklist, Huawei is barred from buying software, chips and other technologies from US suppliers – including Google apps and services – without Washington’s approval. Xiaomi launches new home-grown OS, as Huawei moves further from Android Google’s Android remains the most popular mobile operating system worldwide, commanding a roughly 70 per cent market share as of September, according to data service StatCounter. Huawei’s confidence with its alternative ecosystem strategy on the mainland received a big boost in late August, when the company surprised the smartphone industry with the launch of the Mate 60 Pro smartphone – its first 5G handset since the Mate 40 series was released in October 2020. That was followed around a week later by presales for its top-of-the-line Mate 60 Pro+ smartphone. The Shenzhen-based company’s 5G comeback generated a strong outpouring of public support, as netizens on domestic social media hailed the new 5G handsets and their advanced made-in-China chip as symbolic of the country’s victory in defying tough US sanctions. Huawei, on the back of its popular Mate 60 Pro, became mainland China’s fastest-growing smartphone vendor in the third quarter, when the company recorded 37 per cent year-on-year growth, according to an October report by tech consultancy Counterpoint Research. 2",

While results are mixed with the arrows (largely) pointing in the right direction, an air of caution permeates the sector. Among investors’ concerns are: signal-loss (read, “the death of the cookie“), disruption in the dynamics of the ad tech supply chain (i.e. intensifying competition), plus an overall softening of the media market — albeit this issue faces the entire industry. Now, let’s look at the report cards of the leading media-trading platforms among them to gauge the pulse of the marketplace. Last week, The Trade Desk posted Q3 revenues of $493 million, an increase of 25% year-on-year, with the demand-side platform trumpeting support for its cookie-replacement tool UID 2.0 and OpenPath, its flagship effort to garner more efficient media-pricing. The DSP further issued guidance of 22% growth for the closing quarter of the calendar year, but while Q3’s numbers are impressive, the DSP’s stock was down as much as 30% in the 24 hours after it disclosed the latest numbers. Related Insights Navigating Economic Instability ‘Mid, single digit growth is back’: ad spending’s new normal looks strikingly familiar Read More This was primarily on the back of it warning of a “transitory cautiousness around certain advertisers.” The slowdown was attributed to macro-economic conditions with The Trade Desk not the only member of this cohort to concede that not all arrows are pointing up and to the right. According to one source, who requested anonymity, “TTD’s stock was previously priced on ‘perfect’ market conditions, this is just a correction.” Elsewhere, Magnite the largest independent supply-side platform, posted Q3 revenue of $150.1 million, a rise of 3% year-on-year, with its guidance for the closing quarter of the year between $158 million and $162 million. According to Magnite CEO, “It’s worth noting that our guidance reflects some uncertainty in the macro environment, in particular, the potential impact from the Mideast [sic] conflict.” Last week also saw fellow SSP PubMatic post $63.7 million in revenue for the same period, compared to $64.5 million in the same period 12 months prior, a further indication of a widespread softening of the advertising market in 2023. Similarly, the prior week saw Criteo, which posted Q3 revenue of $469 million, up 5%, note that its sales team “were not seeing an early start to the holiday season” in terms of advertisers’ willingness to buy media, according to CEO Meghan Clarken. Amid such heightened competition, it is worth pondering whether this will further intensify competition from the respective disintermediation initiatives from SSPs, and DSPs alike. One industry analyst, who requested anonymity as they were not cleared to speak with the press, observed how any such competition between the likes of Magnite’s ClearLine, or PubMatic’s Activate would likely lead to a compression in revenue. Related Insights The Programmatic Publisher How The Trade Desk’s new sub-floor bidding tactic will affect SSPs, publishers Read More “New entrants or more agencies/publishers looking to in-house DSPs, is likely to result in lower take-rates,” they noted, citing how some companies are willing to significantly drop take-rates to get ahead in the CTV market where a land grab is underway. Another green shoot of hope for such companies is the retail media sector, one where Criteo — which generated less than 50% of its revenue from (cookie-dependent) ad retargeting for the first time in Q3 — has placed the majority of its bets. However, this adjustment will similarly lead to a reduction in its revenue from take-rates, as Criteo’s large-scale retail clients move to “a SaaS-like fee structure,” an issue that is likely to impact revenue forecasts for the early part of 2024. Albeit, this is a temporary transition that will enable longer-term spending on its retail media platform, according to Criteo’s leadership. All this comes as ad tech companies, both buy- and sell-side, prepare to grapple with the oncoming implications of Google starting to sunset the third-party cookie in its Chrome web browser from January — and projected to be completed by the close of the year — with the leadership of all companies acknowledging challenges given the oncoming “uncertainty.” Given the note of caution struck amid the (usually bountiful) Q4 calendar period, it’s probably worth betting that things will likely get a bit leaner before they get better for the entire ad tech sector.

Don’t Bet on It by Mitchell Kleinhandler Tel Aviv, Israel skyline on the Mediterranean. Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Whatever your political views are, it’s hard to deny Israel’s oversized impact on the global tech industry. There is hardly a significant technology in computing, automation, productivity, robotics, cybersecurity, data storage, telecommunications, digital imaging, and water technology that does not owe something of its existence to Israeli tech. As an early-stage tech investor with a stake in multiple Israeli companies, I’ve become intimately acquainted with the so-called “startup nation.” And I can say, Israel’s achievements really are a technology tour de force. Israel’s critics have sought to isolate it from the world economy through initiatives like the BDS movement. But, despite support for BDS from college campuses and outspoken influencers like Roger Waters, Israel’s economy has been unstoppable for at least a decade, boasting an annual GDP growth rate as high as 6.9% in 2021. There are more than 100 Israeli companies listed on the US stock exchanges, representing a collective 150 billion dollars in market cap. (Only the USA, Canada, and China have more). And, even amidst a dry season of venture capital and internal political discord, Israeli startups raised over $5 billion through Q3, 2023. Not bad, for a country of just under 10 million people. Then, on October 7, Hamas achieved in a day what years of grassroots campaigning could not. The Tel Aviv stock exchange suffered double-digit declines. The shekel is at an 8-year low. Investment and M&A deals that looked like a sure thing a few weeks ago are now frozen. Amidst a call-up of 360,000 reservists, tech companies have lost 10-25% of their workforce, including founders. Those staff who remain struggle to perform through home displacement, shock and anxiety, childcare woes, and incessant rocket barrages from Gaza. Over the past couple of weeks, I have spoken regularly with the founders of my portfolio companies, as well as with venture investors in the USA and Israel. The problems are very real. A survey by the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) revealed that 70% of Israel’s tech firms now face operating difficulties. 40% of those worry about cash flow, as investment opportunities vanished overnight. Large Israeli tech companies typically have it better, with fully-staffed offices in New York or Silicon Valley and relatively large coffers. For early-stage startups, however, this is an existential fight closely mirroring that of Israel itself. Is this the beginning of the end for Israel’s vaunted tech machine? I wouldn’t bet on it. Israelis personify resilience. And this unfortunate war has, at least for the time being, centered and united the country like nothing else could. Within hours of the attacks, tech founders and others had set up facilities where thousands of volunteers packed supplies for soldiers. Reservists at my portfolio companies and others are answering emails when they have downtime in the field. Other staff are stepping up to take over duties of the missing. Volunteers with needed skills are contributing their time and talents, free of charge, to shorthanded companies—sometimes even to competitors. Some startups have hired temporary developers from Ukraine, whose own conflict eliminated their jobs and provided a pool of talented, moderately priced labor. The IIA launched a $25 million dollar emergency fund to help cash-strapped startups weather the storm. At least one new fund was established specifically to invest in early-stage Israeli tech ventures. Another was announced specifically to support startups from the southern region, affected most by Hamas’ attack. 500 global VCs signed a statement affirming their support for Israel and its tech ecosystem. And the Israeli government itself is covering up to 75% of reservists’ salaries and 22% of affected companies’ fixed expenses, freeing up funds for cash-strapped startups to hire temps. There is a real chance of this war becoming a regional or even a global conflict. Even if not, it may yet drag on for months and require the continued participation of reservists indefinitely. It’s hard to say right now what the outcome will be—will the war lead to regime change in Gaza, or merely a ceasefire and restoration of the previous status quo? How will Israel’s unpreparedness affect the confidence of global investors? Will deals get back on track, or will VCs reconsider what acceptable risk looks like? Will valuations agreed upon before the war remain the same when the dust settles? Most of this will probably remain unclear for some time to come. It seems far from obvious that the current crisis will help restart the long-dormant peace process, or instill any fresh hope for lasting co-existence. Risk will probably continue to hound Israeli tech for years to come. But Israel survived multiple past wars, crippling inflation in the 1980s, two brutal intifadas, the COVID pandemic, and the economic correction of 2022, and bounced back stronger each time. The Israelis I have spoken to are wounded and worried, but almost universally feel that the country will come out of this, stronger than ever. Israelis and Palestinians alike face unspeakable tragedy and dark days ahead. But what is clear is this—while the Israeli tech ecosystem is certainly down, it is far from out.

    "originBody": "China China's high-tech manufacturing loans raise fears of wave of cheap exports By Don Durfee, Kevin Yao and Eduardo Baptista November 12, 202311:09 PM UTCUpdated 10 hours ago [1/2]An employee works on the production line of a semiconductor chip company in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China February 28, 2023. China Daily via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. CHINA OUT./File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights BEIJING, Nov 13 (Reuters) - China's leaders, determined to upgrade manufacturing, are steering money toward makers of high-tech products, from semiconductors to EVs, raising fears that overcapacity will fuel a new wave of cheap exports. Lending data from China's central bank offers a glimpse of government priorities: as of the end of September, outstanding loans to the troubled property sector fell 0.2% year-on-year but lending to the manufacturing sector jumped 38.2%. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Economists caution that this wave of investment differs in key respects from an earlier capital investment surge that, among other effects, inflated China's solar panel industry, triggered a trade fight and put scores of companies out of business. But the trend has alarmed some key trading partners, particularly in Europe where an investigation into Chinese EV subsidies is underway. \"There is lower consumption in China right now but you have massive overcapacity that is being pushed out to the world, including in batteries, solar and chemicals,\" said Jens Eskelund, president of the European Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Advertisement · Scroll to continue \"Europe and China are like two trains that are going to collide,\" Eskelund said, referring to trade. China's industrial policy will be on the agenda at this week's meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in San Francisco, where Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to meet U.S. President Joe Biden. Under Xi, China has sought to make itself an advanced manufacturing powerhouse for high-end goods for the world, including EVs, wind turbines, aerospace components and advanced semiconductors. Critics say the push has come at the expense of another need - to get China to consume more and export less, a structural shift many economists see as key to preserving high levels of growth. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Reuters Graphics ADVANCED SECTORS Policymakers have struggled with overcapacity before. Stimulus following the 2007-2008 global financial crisis triggered a boom in steel, solar and other areas, but also generated growth that ultimately helped absorb much of that new production, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. This time, the government's focus is narrower, targeting high-tech and \"advanced manufacturing\", a goal laid out in 2021 in the 14th five-year plan. \"China has adopted a strategy to shift investment spending from the real estate sector into manufacturing, which will drive up capacity further. Rather than boosting goods absorption via surging construction, China is opting to drive up the capacity of goods-producing industries,\" said Neumann. \"Global markets, unfortunately, are not in a position to absorb the additional capacity.\" Another difference from previous episodes of overcapacity: the sums are smaller. The headline growth rate for financing into manufacturing is likely close to 18%, said Tao Wang, chief China economist at UBS, because the other major source of financing for companies - bonds - is down sharply, meaning a more modest combined increase. And overall investment growth in Chinese manufacturing has been slowing as producers respond to a weak market. \"Orders and profits are down and they tend to react to that,\" said Wang. Still, investment in high-tech manufacturing outpaces the rest of the sector. It grew 11.3% in the first nine months of 2023 year-on-year, compared with 6.3% for overall manufacturing investment, according to data from China's National Bureau of Statistics. Reuters Graphics A Reuters review of more than 100 publicly available policy documents and state media reports found that dozens of provincial and municipal governments are increasing the proportion of government loans directed to green development, advanced manufacturing and strategic industries. For example, Guangdong province has increased lending to both high-tech and advanced manufacturing by about 45%, state media reported. During the first half of 2023, outstanding loans to the high-tech manufacturing sector in the eastern province of Shandong jumped 67%. By the end of September, Dongguan, a southern manufacturing city of 7.5 million people, had a total outstanding loan balance to high-tech companies of 246 billion yuan ($33.7 billion), about a fifth of its economy. OVERCAPACITY Signs of excess capacity are appearing. Forecasts indicate China will soon be able to meet all global demand for lithium-ion batteries, said Duo Fu, vice president of Rystad Energy. Similarly, its automakers, including EV producers, had the capacity to produce 43 million cars a year at the end of 2022, with plants operating at just 54.5% capacity, China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) data show. Unfortunately, sluggish economic growth and stunted consumption limits what can be purchased domestically. After decades of prioritising supply, household consumption accounted for only 38% of gross domestic product in 2021 - even before the harshest COVID-19 lockdowns - compared with 68% for the U.S. and 55% the world average, World Bank data showed. China's household spending as a proportion of GDP lags that of most other countries. In some ways, the race to invest in advanced sectors is helpful for China, said Lu Zhengwei, chief economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai. \"Generally speaking, I think the investment in the new sectors is healthy and will support the sectors’ long-term development. They are investing while seeing overcapacity, which drives technological development.\" For the global economy, Chinese production could help curb inflation. \"Far from losing global export market shares, Chinese produces may gain competitiveness,\" said Neumann. \"In turn, this could raise disinflationary pressures in global goods markets, helping to curtail inflation.\" Neither point will mitigate trade tensions, particularly as many countries push plans to favour domestic high-tech industries. \"Over the long term, we need to have an adjustment process,\" said a Chinese government trade adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"We should let market forces eliminate some firms.\" ($1 = 7.2921 Chinese yuan renminbi) Additional reporting by Siyi Liu; Graphics by Kripa Jayaram; Editing by Robert Birsel Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Cate Lawrence 5 hours ago Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Share Send email Copy link Over the last year, numerous investors have mentioned Armenia as a place to watch, particularly for European startups looking for advice on how to scale to North America. With a population of around 3 million (less than the population of Berlin), the smaller domestic market leads many startups to expand into the US to support their growth quickly. What's more, if you dig beneath the surface, you find an innovation-fostering ecosystem of collaboration where early-stage founders can often draw on the advice of later-stage, successful business leaders as part of the community. A culture of collaboration Image of Yerevan via Levon Vardanyan. I spoke with Alex Pavlov, Partner at early-stage tech VC, RTP Global. He shared with me how many large companies with Armenian founders — such as Picsart and ServiceTitan are fuelling the next generation of Armenian startups: \"The culture of sharing and helping is extremely strong in Armenia., Even when the people are leaving Armenia, they always come back, they share.\" The founders have created the rails. And those rails are used by the companies that follow to launch their businesses in the US. Everything from 'how do I start a company, who are my advisors, who are my investors, who will support me on the legal side?'\" From 2020 to 2022, investments in Armenian startups reached $48 million. Last year’s investments were $21 million. Some of Armenia's most successful startups ServiceTitan ServiceTitan is a scaleup founded in 2012 that developed a platform to streamline operations, improve customer service, and drive growth for customers with plumbing, HVAC, and electrical services businesses. It's raised $1.1 billion in funding and achieved unicorn status — Armenia's other unicorn is the online photo and video editing app company Picsart, which reached a valuation of over $1 billion after its most recent funding round in 2021. Krisp Krisp is an AI-powered software solution that removes background noise through noise, voice, and echo Cancellation. Headquartered in California, the company has raised $17.5 million in funding. Podcastle Podcastle is an AI-powered audio content creation hub. It empowers podcasters, bloggers, journalists, educators, and content marketers to transform text into audio, edit seamlessly, and achieve professional-grade sound in seconds. Founded in 2020, it has over 10,000 users and has raised $8.8 million.

They want to help and prosper.\" As in many smaller regions, early startup employees will likely become investors and founders in their own right in the coming years. BigStory VC was founded by Krisp, PicsArt, and 10Web co-founders. There's also a concentration of investors dedicated to US and Armenian companies. For example, SmartGate VC is a US-Armenian venture capital company focused on Pre-Seed investments in AI. The company has invested in over 18 companies since 2018. Other local investment companies include Hive Ventures and Granatus Ventures. Startup-supportive infrastructure and international relations In Armenia, the government is proactive in supporting tech entrepreneurship, with tech startups receiving attractive tax incentives (0 percent income tax, 10 percent flat payroll tax). The country has a strong history of scientific innovation. The city of Yerevan was one of the five top scientific research centres in the former USSR. \"And what is now called AI, which was called machine learning. Before that was called statistical modelling, which was something that people were actively doing there in the 1960s.\" shared Pavlov, noting: \"Combine a scientific foundation with a startup culture, and you have something outstanding.\" The migration path between Armenia talent and the US is highly advantageous for trade relations. For example, in 2018, Armenian Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan led a delegation of government officials to ServiceTitan's California headquarters to meet with US government representatives. It resulted in investment agreements between the two countries worth $30.5 million. The country is home to the Microsoft Innovation Center Armenia, Nvidia Scientific Research Center, and engineering offices of companies like Synopsys, National Instruments, Oracle, VMWare, Cisco, Mentor Graphics, Teamviewer, and D-Link. Armenia is also building the next generation of innovators through a free after-school education program called TUMO. Modular learning labs for afterschool education. Image via TUMO.

Business partners working together on new project.Luis AlvarezDigitalvisionGetty Images Plenty of major tech companies have been under fire in the last year for their surprise layoff announcements, return-to-office battles and a skepticism about whether the Big Tech dream job is still alive. Even so, they remain some of the top companies where employees feel happiest with their pay. That's according to the latest rankings from Comparably, the employee reviews site, which measured worker sentiment from August 2022 to August 2023 through a series of questions. Workday, the HR tech company, takes the No. 1 spot where workers felt happiest with their pay, according to the analysis. Not only do employees feel they're paid competitively in the market, but they also said they felt paid fairly in comparison with their colleagues. \"Fairness is a meaningfully contributing variable to how somebody feels about their employer,\" says Chad Herring, the chief human resources officer at ZoomInfo, Comparably's parent company. Overall, Herring points out, many tech companies, and especially cybersecurity firms, scored highly on the compensation analysis. These are the top 15 companies where workers are happiest with their pay: Workday Boston Consulting Group Uber Adobe Calix Proofpoint Instacart Chegg Palo Alto Networks SAP AT&T Experian Meta Google Squarespace The top three companies where people feel they're paid well — Workday, Boston Consulting Group and Uber — also have some of the happiest workers in general, according to Comparably data, which considers compensation as well as factors like work-life balance, alignment with company values, holistic benefits and others. Meta and Google fell from their 2022 spots (when they were ranked No. 3 and No. 5, respectively), but they remain in the top 15 companies where workers are satisfied with their pay. While workers may feel satisfied with their compensation there, the two tech giants did not fall into the top 100 companies with the happiest workers overall. Workers at the top 100 companies with good pay scored their satisfaction at 87.5 on a 100-point scale, compared with the overall average score of 63.5 across Comparably data. Employees expressed their sentiments by answering questions such as: Do you believe you're paid fairly? How often do you get a raise? Are you satisfied with your benefits? Does your company give annual bonuses? If applicable, are you satisfied with your stock or equity? Herring says companies that not only pay well but are transparent about their pay scales across the organization rank highly on the Comparably list this year. Many are headquartered in California, which enacted a salary range law in January 2023, which applies to employers with 15 or more workers and at least one in California. And organizations that have valued salary transparency and pay equity for years now are pulling ahead. Herring notes companies like Workday, Adobe and AT&T signed the White House Equal Pay Pledge in 2016 to commit to better hiring, promotion, and pay policies to close the racial and gender wage gaps. These companies were \"focusing on salary transparency and doing gender and race pay equity analysis long before it was legally required,\" Herring says. \"I do think that has a positive impact for employees on how they feel about their employer.\" He hopes more businesses commit to pay transparency and equitable pay practices: \"I do think it's a meaningful causal contributor to how employees feel about their company,\" he says. \"Employees overwhelmingly respond to employers being proactive about those elements of their business. So my suggestion would be, for any company that's wondering, 'Should I do it even though I don't have to?'

    "originBody": "15 SOCIAL BUZZ Microsoft employees were temporarily blocked from using OpenAI’s ChatGPT. (Image by Shutterstock) Testing error restricts Microsoft employees from using OpenAI By Aaron Raj13 November, 2023 Microsoft employees were blocked from using OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT. An error in testing accidentally caused it, said Microsoft. OpenAI’s Sam Altman tweeted the rumors of ChatGPT retaliation untrue. It’s been almost a year since OpenAI’s ChatGPT started trending globally. Despite its global success, among both analystss and enterprises, the generative AI chatbot has been raising some eyebrows, especially when it comes to data security. Given that the AI chatbot works on information available, organizations started getting worried when their employees fed the tool with company information to get tasks done. This resulted in some organizations banning their employees from using ChatGPT at work. As time went by, more organizations, especially those dealing with sensitive data, started limiting employee usage of the AI chatbot. CHATGPT NOW CAPABLE OF VOICE CONVERSATIONS Aaron Raj27 September, 2023 In fact, Samsung was one of the first few enterprises to ban its employees from using ChatGPT. The ban occurred after the company discovered that staff had uploaded sensitive code to the platform. It is important to note that any data that is uploaded into ChatGPT will become publicly accessible. Apart from Samsung, banks and a few other regulated industries have either banned or limited the use of ChatGPT or any other AI tool at work. However, given the need to use AI at work, companies are now developing their own AI tools or working with tech companies that enable them to use AI more securely. OpenAI itself realized the need for enterprises to have a more secure platform. As such, the company unveiled its Enterprise version, which is supposed to prioritize the security and privacy of customers using it. Microsoft has invested heavily on OpenAI. (Image by Shutterstock). Microsoft and OpenAI For Microsoft, OpenAI’s innovations enabled it to improve its search engine, Bing, as well as develop other use cases. While the competition in the AI search engine field and other use cases remains high, Microsoft tends to have the upper hand, especially since it owns ChatGPT as well. Since the release of ChatGPT, Microsoft has increased its investment in the company and is the exclusive cloud provider of Open AI. Microsoft invested around US$10 billion in the company, with OpenAI using Azure to train all of its models. IS CHATGPT ENABLING COLLABORATIVE DECISION-MAKING OR MERELY HOBSON’S CHOICE? Aaron Raj29 September, 2023 At OpenAI’s first DevDay Conference last week, Microsoft chairman and CEO Satya Nadella made a surprise appearance during OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s keynote to deliver a powerful message. “Our job number one is to build the best systems, so you can build the best models and deliver those to developers. We’re excited about the latest announcements from OpenAI’s first DevDay event and want to highlight the opportunities it presents for all AI builders,” commented Nadella. Altman echoed the sentiment of a strong and productive partnership with Microsoft. “I think we have the best partnership in tech,” Altman told Nadella onstage. “Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. And to me, ultimately, AI is only going to be useful if it truly does empower… it’s about being able to get the benefits of AI broadly disseminated to everyone,” Nadella said. A temporary glitch? A few days after the big conference, CNBC reported that for a brief time on November 9th, Microsoft employees were not allowed to use ChatGPT at work, due to “security reasons.” Citing an internal website, CNBC stated that Microsoft had updated its employees that the block was due to security and data concerns and that a number of AI tools were no longer available for employees to use. CNBC also viewed a screenshot that showed that ChatGPT couldn’t be accessed on corporate devices. Microsoft blocked and unblocked ChatGPT for employees. Microsoft informed CNBC that the ChatGPT blockage was a mistake that resulted from a test of systems for large language models. It added that services were restored once the error was identified. “As we have said previously, we encourage employees and customers to use services like Bing Chat Enterprise and ChatGPT Enterprise that come with greater levels of privacy and security protections,” the company said. Microsoft and OpenAI continue to work together on developing the technology. So, when the block happened, many users were quick to voice their concerns on social media about the potential impact it could have on both companies. Soon enough, the rumor mill started and social media started seeing baseless claims being made about the incident. This was also why Altman was quick to tweet that “the rumors that OpenAI are blocking Microsoft 365 in retaliation are completely unfounded.” Altman was quick to crush the rumors. While this remains very likely true, the rumor mill will probably continue to grind the story down, because the idea of billion-dollar companies behaving like an old married couple is a much better – and more fundamentally pleasing – story than one of technological error during testing. If it happens again though, observers will be justified in drawing more significant conclusions.
