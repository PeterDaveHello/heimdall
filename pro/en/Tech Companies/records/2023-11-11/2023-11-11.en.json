By Sarah Chakales Published: Nov. 11, 2023 at 12:56 AM UTC|Updated: 12 hours ago RICHMOND, Va. (WWBT) - With less than a year before the next US presidential election, there is growing concern about using artificial intelligence in campaign ads. “I’ve just been monitoring developments with artificial intelligence, and especially the boom this year with generative AI and the challenges that it poses, as well as with our focus on campaigns and elections, realizing that this is going to be a major threat,” said Carah Ong Whaley, the Academic Program Officer at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. Ong Whaley has a background in nuclear weapons technology and teaches a class on the impact of artificial intelligence on politics and elections at UVA. “There’s actually quite a bit of parallels in terms of the development of the nuclear weapons industrial complex, and now the development of artificial intelligence,” said Ong Whaley. The use of AI has increased significantly in recent years, allowing voices and images to be manipulated to the extent that it is often difficult to tell what is real and what is fake. Florida Governor and Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis drew criticism over the summer for showing A.I.-generated images of President Donald Trump hugging Dr. Anthony Fauci. “This practice of using artificial intelligence, most recently displayed by Governor DeSantis, I think, is inappropriate,” said Rich Anderson, Chair of the Republican Party of Virginia. “It does beg for regulation of some sort.” Facebook and Instagram’s parent company, Meta, says it will start requiring political ads to disclose if they used artificial intelligence beginning sometime next year. For those that do, a label will be attached to the video to alert viewers. Google and Microsoft are also working to increase transparency on their platforms by adding labels and watermarks to AI-generated content. There are also efforts within the federal government to try and regulate AI-generated deep fakes in political ads before the 2024 election. The Federal Election Commission is looking into it. President Joe Biden issued an executive order to encourage responsible development of AI last week, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are debating legislation. “I think we could do a lot more to require all ads disclose who generated the audio, video, or imagery and and to make clear, for example, if it’s coming from a foreign actor or a domestic actor and not just a requirement of political campaigns,” said Ong Whaley. “I don’t think that AI ought to play any role in politics by any Republican, Democrat, Independent or any other party because politics is real,” said Anderson. While Meta and others plan to label political ads that use AI, it is unclear what criteria they will use to vet them. Without federal regulation, other manipulated videos can circulate across social media platforms unchecked, potentially influencing voters and impacting future elections. “We’ve got to get a grip on this, and at the front end,” added Anderson.

Sparkz Incorporated, an electric vehicle battery manufacturer, is hoping to take over the old space in on Aerojet Road. \"I think it could be huge,\" Tallie Miller said. \"I'm looking forward to it. Post-pandemic, things have had to build, instead of, you know, there no steady state at work, so people are coming back.\" Miller has worked in the area since 1984 and has seen the change since Aerojet left in 2016. \"It's changed quite a bit even since Mather closed,\" Miller said. \"There were a lot of people here, including military, so a lot of differences.\" Claudia Barrientos at nearby Mr. Tequila would welcome some new faces in the area. \"We have the happy hour, we have specials every day, so it will be a big impact on our business,\" she said. Barrientos and her co-owner, Jorge Gama, see themselves as a family-friendly establishment. \"People are excited,\" Gama said. \"People want to come out and see what we've got. We've got the pool tables.\" However, bringing more technology jobs and young professionals could help inject more life into the area. \"I think it depends on the time,\" Barrientos said. \"There's a lot of people that come with their children earlier.\" The company hopes to bring over 1,000 long-term jobs and hopes to build 1.5 million square feet of office space. While it is a risk, scale production could begin by 2025, helping build Sacramento's reputation as a zero-emission vehicle hub. Sparkz Interactive CEO Sanjiv Malhotra told the Sacramento Business Journal that this would be the first U.S. factory to make EV battery components.

    "originBody": "The Briefing uber/lyft How Stock Comp Dampens Tech Returns By Martin Peers martin@theinformation.c­om Profile and archive → Follow Martin on TwitterNov. 10, 2023 3:30 PM PST Photo: Photo via Shutterstock. It’s been a good week for shareholders in Uber, the ride-hailing giant, which reported solid third-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Investors seemed to have anticipated the report: The stock had been rallying for a couple of weeks. By the time the market closed on Friday, Uber was at $51.58, up 27% since late October and at its highest point since mid-2021. Uber now has a market capitalization of nearly $106 billion. You know what, though? Longtime shareholders might still feel they could have done better. Uber’s stock price could be above $60 right now if the company had not handed out a bunch of shares to employees and others. Since the company went public in 2019, the number of shares outstanding has grown 22% from 1.695 billion to 2.06 billion. Imagine your spouse giving a portion of your joint equity in your house to a friend. If the house went up in value, you wouldn’t get as much when it’s sold as you would have otherwise. You wouldn’t be happy. Yet it’s longstanding practice for tech companies to issue stock to employees as part of their compensation. Of course, our analogy isn’t really fair. Your spouse’s friend likely hasn’t done anything to improve your house’s value, but employees are crucial to helping build a firm, particularly when it’s young. Rewarding them, and motivating them, makes a lot of sense. But it’s also worth recognizing the true cost of stock compensation for long-term public shareholders.",

    "originBody": "The Humane Ai Pin in action. Silicon Valley’s Big, Bold Sci-Fi Bet on the Device That Comes After the Smartphone Humane, a company started by two former Apple employees, says its new artificial intelligence pin can stop all the scrolling. Can it live up to the hype? The Humane Ai Pin in action. Credit... Share full article 526 By Erin Griffith, Tripp Mickle and Photographs and Videos by Kelsey McClellan Reporting from San Francisco Published Nov. 9, 2023 Updated Nov. 10, 2023 Inside a former horse stable in the San Francisco neighborhood of SoMa, a wave of gentle chirps emerged from small, blinking devices pinned to the chests of employees at a start-up called Humane. It was just weeks before the start-up’s gadget, the Ai Pin, would be revealed to the world — a culmination of five years, $240 million in funding, 25 patents, a steady drumbeat of hype and partnerships with a list of top tech companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft and Salesforce. Their mission? No less than liberating the world from its smartphone addiction. The solution? More technology. Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, Humane’s husband-and-wife founders, envision a future with less dependency on the screens that their former employer, Apple, made ubiquitous. Artificial intelligence “can create an experience that allows the computer to essentially take a back seat,” Mr. Chaudhri said. They’re billing the pin as the first artificially intelligent device. It can be controlled by speaking aloud, tapping a touch pad or projecting a laser display onto the palm of a hand. In an instant, the device’s virtual assistant can send a text message, play a song, snap a photo, make a call or translate a real-time conversation into another language. The system relies on A.I. to help answer questions (“What’s the best way to load the dishwasher?”) and can summarize incoming messages with the simple command: “Catch me up.” Video The device promises to keep users from getting pulled into their screens. Credit Credit... The technology is a step forward from Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant. It can follow a conversation from one question to the next, without needing explicit context. It’s also capable of editing a single word in a dictated message, rather than requiring the user to correct an error by repeating the text from beginning to end, as other systems do. And it does it from a gadget that’s reminiscent of the badges worn in Star Trek. Video The pin can make phone calls, and give its wearer a summary of all the communication they’ve received. To tech insiders, it’s a moonshot. To outsiders, it’s a sci-fi fantasy. At Humane, there’s deep anxiety about the weeks ahead. The tech industry has a large graveyard of wearable products that have failed to catch on. Humane will begin shipping the pins next year. It expects to sell around 100,000 pins, which will cost $699 and require a $24 monthly subscription, in the first year. (Apple sold 381,000 iPods in the year after its 2001 launch.) For the start-up to succeed, people will need to learn a new operating system, called Cosmos, and be open to getting new phone numbers for the device. (The pin comes with its own wireless plan.) They’ll need to dictate rather than type texts and trade a camera that zooms for wide-angle photos. They’ll need to be patient because certain features, like object recognition and videos, won’t be available initially. And the pin can sometimes be buggy, as it was during some of the company’s demos for The New York Times. Image The device is one of several wearable A.I bets that OpenAI’s Sam Altman has made. Image Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, said in an interview that he expected A.I. to be “a huge part” of how we interact with computers. He has invested in Humane as well as another A.I. company, Rewind AI, that plans to make a necklace that will record what people say and hear. He’s also discussed teaming up with Jony Ive, Apple’s former chief designer, to create an A.I. gadget with a similar ambition to Humane. Humane has the advantage of being the first of those A.I.-focused devices to become available, but Mr. Altman said in an interview that was no guarantee of success. “That will be up to customers to decide,” he said. “Maybe it’s a bridge too far,” he said, “or maybe people are like, ‘This is much better than my phone.’” Plenty of technology that looked like a sure bet ends up selling for 90 percent off at Best Buy, he added. iPhone Guilt Image Bethany Bongiorno and Imran Chaudhri met when both worked at Apple. Ms. Bongiorno, 40, and Mr. Chaudhri, 50, have a marriage of contrasts. He shaves his head bald and speaks with the soft, calm voice of a yogi. She sweeps her long blond hair over one shoulder and has the enthusiasm of a team captain. They both dress in Jobsian black. They met at Apple in 2008. Mr. Chaudhri was working on its human interface, defining the swipes and drags that control iPhones. Ms. Bongiorno was a program manager for the iPhone and iPad. They worked together until they left Apple in late 2016. A Buddhist monk named Brother Spirit led them to Humane. Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno had developed concepts for two A.I. products: a women’s health device and the pin. Brother Spirit, whom they met through their acupuncturist, recommended that they share the ideas with his friend, Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce. Sitting beneath a palm tree on a cliff above the ocean at Mr. Benioff’s Hawaiian home in 2018, they explained both devices. “This one,” Mr. Benioff said, pointing at the Ai Pin, as dolphins breached the surf below, “is huge.” “It’s going to be a massive company,” he added. Humane’s goal was to replicate the usefulness of the iPhone without any of the components that make us all addicted — the dopamine hit of dragging to refresh a Facebook feed or swiping to see a new TikTok video. They experimented in secret with hardware components and built a virtual assistant, like Siri or Alexa, working with customized language models based, in part, on OpenAI’s offerings. The device’s most sci-fi element — the laser that projects a text menu onto a hand — started inside a box the size of a matchbook. It took three years to miniaturize it to be smaller than the size of a golf tee. Humane established a company culture that borrowed from Apple, including its secretiveness. During its experimentation phase, the start-up created intrigue by announcing high profile investors like Mr. Altman and making grandiose — if vague — public statements about building “the next shift between humans and computing.” Humane also retained Apple’s obsession with design details, from its device’s curved corners and compostable white packaging to the Japanese-style toilets at the company’s stark office. Image The Humane office in San Francisco. But Humane departed from Apple’s rigid and demanding culture in certain ways. The company encouraged staff to work together, question plans and speak up. José Benitez Cong, a longtime Apple executive who considered himself retired, joined Humane, in part, for redemption. Mr. Benitez Cong said he was “disgusted” by what the iPhone had done to society, noting his son could mimic a swiping motion at the age of 1. “This could be something that could help me get over my guilt of working on the iPhone,” Mr. Benitez Cong said. Holding the Light Video To change the display, users make a pinching motion. A haunting whoosh filled the room, and two dozen Humane employees, seated around a long white table, carefully concentrated on the sound. It was just before the Ai Pin’s release, and they were evaluating its rings and beeps. The pin’s “personic” speaker (a company portmanteau of “personal” and “sonic”) is critical, since many of its features rely on verbal and audio cues. Mr. Chaudhri praised the “assuredness” of one chirp noise and Ms. Bongiorno complimented the “more physical” sounds for the pin’s laser. “It feels like you’re actually holding the light,” she marveled. Less assuring: That whoosh, which plays when sending a text message. “It feels ominous,” Ms. Bongiorno said. Others around the table said it sounded like a ghost, or as if you made a mistake, almost. Someone thought it was a Halloween joke. Ms. Bongiorno wanted the sound for sending a text to feel as satisfying as the trash-can sound on one of Apple’s older operating systems. “Like ‘thunk,’” she said. The device is arriving at a time when excitement and skepticism for A.I. hit new highs each week. Industry researchers are warning of the technology’s existential risk and regulators are eager to crack down on it. Yet investors are eagerly pouring cash into A.I. start-ups. Before Humane even released a product, its backers had valued it at $850 million. The company has tried to promote a message of trust and transparency, despite spending most of its existence working in secret. Humane’s Ai Pins have what the company calls a “trust light” that blinks when the device is recording. (A user must tap the pin to “wake” it.) Humane said it did not sell user data to third parties or use it in training its A.I. models. In the months leading up to its introduction, Humane has fanned the anticipation. In April, Mr. Chaudhri showed off the pin’s laser projector during a TED Talk. (People later accused him of faking the demo, he said, but he assured that it was real.) In September, in an echo of Apple’s fashion-friendly launch of its Watch, the supermodel Naomi Campbell wore Humane’s pin — barely noticeable without knowing to look for it — on a gray Coperni blazer on the runway at Paris Fashion Week. Image Naomi Campbell wearing the Ai Pin at the Coperni Womenswear show in Paris. Credit... Francois Durand/Getty Images A.I. App Store Humane’s supporters have a pat way of dismissing skepticism about its prospects — they invoke the first iPod. That clunky, awkward device had just one use, playing songs, but it laid the groundwork for the real revolution, smartphones. Similarly, Humane envisions an entire ecosystem of companies building features for its operating system — an A.I. version of Apple’s App Store. Image Cases for the pin. Image Humane’s white compostable packaging recalls Apple’s. But first, raisins. In a demo at Humane’s office of a feature that will be rolled out in a future version of the product, a software designer picked up a chocolate chip cookie and tapped the pin on his left breast. As it whirred to life with a beep, he asked, “How much sugar is in this?” “I’m sorry; couldn’t look up the amount of sugar in oatmeal raisin cookie,” the virtual assistant said. Mr. Chaudhri shrugged off the mistake. “To be fair, I have trouble with the difference between a chocolate chip cookie and an oatmeal raisin.” Video The company says object recognition technology will be available in a future version of the device. Humane’s ambition to disrupt the smartphone is audacious, creative and even irrational; the kind of thing Silicon Valley is supposed to be known for, but, which critics bemoan, in recent years has turned into incremental frivolities, like selfie apps and robot pizza trucks. But even after months of wearing their Ai Pins all day, Humane’s founders can’t fully detach from their screens. “Are we using our smartphones less?” Mr. Chaudhri asked. “We’re using them differently.” Erin Griffith covers tech companies, start-ups and the culture of Silicon Valley from San Francisco.

Experts call this chatbot behavior “hallucination.” Rishi Sunak, the prime minister of Britain, hosted dozens of government leaders, tech executives and other experts as part of the A.I. Safety Summit he organized to discuss the dangers of the technology. President Biden signed a far-reaching executive order on A.I. that imposes new rules on companies and directs federal agencies to begin putting guardrails around the technology. The Age of A.I. The F.D.A. has approved many new medical products that use A.I., but doctors remain skeptical of these tools. A nonprofit led by a respected computer scientist is trying to democratize A.I. by building a freely available alternative to those offered by the likes of Google and OpenAI. OpenAI now lets outside businesses and independent developers tweak what its chatbot does. A new paper says that can lead to trouble. Advances in A.I. are offering new ways for bad actors to misappropriate online content of children. That is posing new risks for parents posting about their children on social media. Researchers at Anthropic asked roughly 1,000 Americans to write rules for their chatbot. The results could be a model for future kinds of A.I. governance. Leading A.I. researchers are transforming chatbots into a new kind of autonomous system called an A.I. agent that can play games, query websites, schedule meetings and build bar charts.

Zlevor of Vedder Price - The 21st Century Banker Friday, November 10, 2023 Related Practices & Jurisdictions Financial Institutions & Banking Communications, Media & Internet Consumer Protection All Federal Print Mail Download i On November 7, 2023, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) proposed a rule that would allow the CFPB to supervise certain large nonbank companies that provide consumer financial services such as digital wallets and payment applications. If enacted, it would subject large technology companies handling more than five million payment transactions per year—such as Apple, Meta and Alphabet—to CFPB supervisory examinations for the first time. Under the proposed rule, these large nonbank companies would have to adhere to certain funds transfer, privacy and other federal consumer financial protection laws, including protections against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices. The CFPB believes that imposing consistent consumer protection laws among large technology companies and depository institutions will help level the playing field, promote competition and protect consumers’ privacy rights. The proposed rule seeks to promote competition by requiring that firms which offer transaction accounts—such as checking accounts, credit cards and digital wallets—give consumers access to their personal financial data so they can more easily share such data with another provider. It would also prohibit companies that receive such personal data from using it for anything other than the financial services product being offered to consumers. Large technology companies would thus not be allowed to use this personal data for targeted advertising, sell such data to brokers or hold onto personal data indefinitely. The proposed rule is part of the CFPB’s efforts to monitor the shift to “open banking” in the United States and oversee large technology companies as they enter consumer financial markets—blurring the traditional line between banking activities and commercial activities. Earlier this year, the CFPB published a report asserting that large technology companies have had a negative impact on competition and innovation in the mobile payment industry. In connection with this report, the CFPB requested information from such companies on their use of sensitive personal data (available here). The CFPB has indicated that it believes that the current lack of regulatory oversight or scrutiny of large technology and payments companies exposes consumers to risk since such companies are not subject to the same consumer financial protection laws as banks and credit unions. Last year, the CFPB also issued an interpretive ruling which provided that technology companies that market financial products using behavioral targeting techniques must comply with federal consumer financial protection laws (available here). According to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, “Federal and state law enforcers can and should hold these firms accountable if they break the law.” Comments on the proposed rule (available here) must be received by the CFPB on or before January 8, 2024. © 2023 Vedder Price Current Legal Analysis California’s Indoor Heat Illness Prevention Standard: Cal/OSHA Standards Board Publishes New Modifications by: Karen Tynan , Theodore G.
