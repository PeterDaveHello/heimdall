The tech industry has seen more than 240,000 jobs lost in 2023, a total that’s already 50% higher than last year and growing. Earlier this year, mass workforce reductions were driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups across many sectors also announced cutbacks through the first half of the year. And while tech layoffs slowed down in the summer and fall, it appears that cuts are ramping up yet again. Many economists have cautioned against fears of a recession, which would seem like a reason for optimism. But the momentum for a tech sector rebound has been slow to build, resulting in tech companies continuing to cut back on their workforces and pivot from a growth mindset to one based on efficiency in the face of stubborn market conditions. But tracking these layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder of the deeply human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles could evolve from here. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here.

    "originBody": "Yahoo Finance Big Tech, flush with cash, doesn't want to buy your media company Read full article 25 Hamza Shaban ·Senior Reporter Fri, November 10, 2023 at 5:45 AM EST·3 min read This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The ingredients for a headline-grabbing media deal are laid out neatly on the table. Wall Street has punished entertainment stocks. New entrants have stiffened competition. Growth has slowed as audiences are inundated with options, inviting consolidation in a maturing industry. Meanwhile, trillion-dollar tech giants are swimming in improbable piles of cash. So, is a blockbuster acquisition right around the corner? To former Disney exec Kevin Mayer, the answer is no. At least not when it comes to big deals involving the tech giants whose growth-centric, engineering focus may clash with the culture of storytelling creatives that populate Hollywood. \"Those cultural mismatches make buyers nervous,\" Mayer said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference earlier this week. But the sheer scale of these tech giants relative to prospective media buyers makes this speculation hard to tamp down. Apple (AAPL), for instance, which touts a market cap of nearly $3 trillion, hoards a cash pile of about $162.1 billion, according to its latest earnings report, a figure roughly equal to the market cap of iconic names like Disney (DIS). Bob Iger, CEO of The Walt Disney Company, walks with Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc., as they attend the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 6, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images) Microsoft (MSFT), according to its most recent quarterly report, holds more than $143 billion in cash and short-term investments — about as much as the market cap of Verizon (VZ). The sprawl and financial might of tech companies can also work against them. With elevated antitrust concerns in Washington and around state houses, regulatory issues are another obstacle to potential media deals. \"Whenever these big digital companies do almost anything, the regulatory scrutiny is massive,\" said Mayer, who was also previously the CEO of TikTok. Moreover, the history of corporate America is littered with ill-fitting conglomerates, suggesting any cultural dissonance between tech and media isn't the only thing keeping these tie-ups on ice. Story continues The failed $85 billion marriage between AT&T (T) and Time Warner, for example, screams out as a cautionary tale. Just four years after closing on its acquisition of a global media powerhouse, AT&T spun out the reconstituted WarnerMedia. The great boardroom chronicler James Stewart called the breakup \"a strategic miscalculation unrivaled in corporate history.\" The merger continues to ripple through the media world today. Discovery acquired WarnerMedia in its own turbulent mega-merger that's still being ironed out. Still, the current media moment is one that appears ripe for more industry-defining deals in the years ahead. In Mayer's view, competition in the media industry and the costly, overlapping infrastructures will likely prompt dealmaking. Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger has said he is contemplating selling off media assets — ABC is reportedly in the mix. Paramount (PARA) and Starz have also been widely discussed as potential acquisition targets for a buyer on the hunt for bigger audiences and the content that brings them. Mayer is also advising Iger as Disney sorts through its options for its crown jewel sports network, ESPN, which is reportedly exploring a financial partnership with major sports leagues. Disney last week said it would take full ownership of Hulu, handing over almost $9 billion to Comcast. In 2019, the company spent more than $70 billion for 21st Century Fox’s film and television studios. David Zaslav, the head of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), is in the game too, saying during the company's earnings call this week that it’s in a position to spend more on potential acquisitions. Perhaps the tech giants, clutching their coins and watching from a safe distance, know that buying a media company creates more problems than they're worth.

      "Big tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft are unlikely to make significant acquisitions in the media industry due to cultural differences and regulatory concerns.",
      "The massive cash reserves of these companies make speculation about potential acquisitions difficult to suppress, but the history of failed mergers and incompatible conglomerates serves as a warning.",
      "However, industry experts believe that the current media landscape is conducive to industry-defining deals driven by competition and the need for streamlined infrastructures. Key players like Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are considering selling assets or pursuing acquisitions while it's possible that tech giants may leave media industry challenges to be resolved internally."

Advertisement Advertisement Students protest in front of Tech, demand NU divest from companies with ties to Israel Sonya Dymova/The Daily Northwestern Student protesters lay in front of the Technological Institute Thursday morning. Students walking to and from class stepped around or over the protesters, while some stopped to observe or film the event. Samantha Powers, Senior Staffer November 10, 2023 Content warning: This article contains mentions of violence and photographs of fake blood. About 25 students gathered in front of the Technological Institute Thursday morning demanding Northwestern divest from organizations supporting the Israeli military in its ongoing war with Hamas. Students lay across the walkway into the building wearing blood-red paint on their clothing, holding signs and participating in call-and-response chants. For about two hours, chants like “our tuition is funding genocide” and “our board of trustees should not profit on war” filled the air at the protest hosted by Students for Justice in Palestine. Several members of NU’s Board of Trustees have served as executives at companies that supply arms to Israel, including Boeing and General Dynamics. “We should not work with companies that sell arms to places like Israel and other aggressors,” one masked chant leader, who did not identify themself, said to the crowd. In the month since the militant group Hamas launched a surprise attack against Israel Oct. 7, the Israeli military has responded with a continuous bombardment, blockade and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip. More than 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, while more than 1,400 Israelis were killed in the initial attack with at least 240 taken hostage, according to Israeli and Palestinian authorities Bienen sophomore Alex Neuser participated in the protest to show solidarity for the cause of Palestinian freedom, he said. Neuser, a member of Fossil Free NU, said they see a connection between the club and SJP, citing settler colonialism as one of the main drivers of climate change. Neuser said he has learned through Fossil Free NU about the University’s financial interests. “This is a university where we all come here to learn, and it’s kind of clear to me that the University is operated as an investment firm first and an educational place of learning second,” Neuser said. Gallery • 7 Photos Sonya Dymova/The Daily Northwestern As people walked in and out of the Technological Institute, protesters chanted: “You can go to class, Palestinians cannot” and “You can go home, Palestinians cannot.” Representatives from the University’s event support team were also present. The representatives said they attended the protest to make sure the protesters were safe and other students were able to go to classes in Tech without disruption. Most students walked around the protesters, but some stepped over them and others stopped to observe or film them. Chiao-Wei Hsu, a graduate student in computer science, stopped to film the protest. He said he plans to post the video to his Facebook. He said he empathizes with Palestinians because he’s from Taiwan, a small island that has been governed independently of China since 1949. With tensions on the rise, Taiwan is currently edging toward territorial conflict with China, which views the country as part of its territory. “I don’t have a specific position on this issue because it’s really, really complicated,” he said. “I just hope everything is going to settle down quickly and without more bloodshed. I really hope for more peace for the world.” SJP held a walkout calling for similar divestment goals on Oct. 26, two weeks after both SJP and a group of Jewish students organized separate vigils to mourn lives lost in the war. Hundreds of NU students and Evanston residents also held one of many rallies around the world calling for a ceasefire in Gaza Saturday, and a rally in downtown Evanston the following day organized by local Jewish and Israeli communities called for the release of hostages taken by Hamas. Protesters on Thursday called out University President Michael Schill by name in their chants. Schill and other University administrators released a statement to the NU community on Saturday saying it would not tolerate “violence, intimidation, threats, Islamophobia or antisemitism.” “We can be passionate about our beliefs while also being compassionate to those with whom we disagree,” the statement read. SJP has also criticized two statements released by Schill last month stating that the University would not take an official stance on the war. Jillian Dudley, a Communication freshman who stopped to watch the protest, said she supports the idea of a ceasefire and hopes to join SJP. Dudley said amid stress and fear about the conflict, she feels hopeful that protests happening across the country will have an impact. “I think what they’re doing here, especially at this huge institution, is really going to be very impactful,” she said. “It shows that students do have a voice and they should be heard.” Email: samanthapowers2026@u.northwestern.edu Twitter: @SQPowers04 Related Stories: — Hundreds call for Gaza ceasefire, divestment from Israeli military at Saturday rally Evanston protesters call for Gaza ceasefire, divestment from Israel — Northwestern Students for Justice in Palestine leads walkout — Chicago-area Jewish communities call for hostage release in Evanston demonstration Evanston Jewish rally calls for release of Hamas hostages 0 Alex Neuser Board of Trustees Boeing Chiao-Wei Hsu China Fossil Free NU Gaza Strip General Dynamics Hamas Israel Jillian Dudley Palestine Students for Justice in Palestine Taiwan Technological Institute More to Discover More in Campus Double duty: From The New Yorker to WBEZ, Medill professors balance teaching and reporting Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker talks economics of transportation infrastructure NU cancels full-day bargaining session with graduate workers Pritzker professor files federal age discrimination lawsuit against NU ASG Senate passes legislation moving presidential elections to Winter Quarter “I’m First” week honors first-generation students, staff and faculty More in Latest Stories Rapid Recap: Northwestern 92, UIC 86 (OT) News Quiz: Northwestern Football, Day of the Dead, Northwestern College Democrats Football: Key injuries loom large in upcoming Northwestern-Wisconsin matchup Volleyball: Northwestern falls in four sets to No. 1 Nebraska Football: What to Watch For: Northwestern seeks first away win of the season in Madison Early plans to fortify Evanston’s battered shoreline set to finish in 2024 More in Top Stories Football: Former Northwestern captain, Super Bowl XLI champion Matt Ulrich dies at 41 Crawford: The double displacement of an Indo-Caribbean American City Council discusses lead pipe replacement, proposed water rate increase Protesters call for Schakowsky to support ceasefire, end U.S. aid to Israel ‘A reflection of my life story’: Local teen poet inspires with performances, new novel Some Evanston shops see ‘disconcerting’ sales slump ahead of holiday shopping season The Daily Northwestern About Contact Editorial Board Former Daily Editors Join The Daily Awards Students Publishing Company Ads Advertise Classifieds More Donate Today’s Paper Print Archives Connect Comment policy Terms of Use Location: 1999 Campus Drive, Evanston, IL, 60201 The Daily Northwestern Friday, Nov. 10, 2023 Facebook Instagram X SoundCloud YouTube RSS Feed NEWS Arts & Entertainment On Campus Around Town Multimedia Opinion Division I Athletics MORE Awards Editorial Board Former Daily Editors Print Issue S.P.C SUPPORT Advertise Donate Join The Daily The Daily Northwestern Friday, Nov. 10, 2023 Facebook Instagram X SoundCloud YouTube RSS Feed NEWS Arts & Entertainment On Campus Around Town Multimedia Opinion Division I Athletics MORE Advertise Donate Editorial Board Join The Daily Print Issue S.P.C The Daily Northwestern • © 2023 The Daily Northwestern • FLEX Pro WordPress Theme by SNO • Log in Close Close Modal Window",

    "title": "Tech Giants Gain More Control as Physical Media Declines, Experts Warn",
    "originLink": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/reinventing-history-experts-warn-end-physical-media-tech-giants-greater-control",
    "originBody": "Media Published November 10, 2023 6:00am EST ‘Reinventing history’: Experts warn the end of physical media will give tech giants even greater control Experts say a future ruled by streaming and digital content poses a serious threat of censorship Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Nikolas Lanum FOXBusiness close video Bipartisan efforts needed to thwart Big Tech censorship: Darrell Issa California Rep-elect Darrell Issa evaluates the relationship between the government and Big Tech on 'The Evening Edit.' Retailers are slowly moving away from physical media to pursue ventures in the digital space and experts warn this shift could lead to significant tech censorship, allowing streaming giants the power to have greater control over history and culture. Barna William Donovan, a professor and the director of M.A. in Communication and Public Relations at Saint Peter's University, said he does believe the move towards streaming content and the elimination of physical media poses \"a serious threat\" of censorship and could be a danger to our culture. American consumers spend approximately eight hours daily with digital media, roughly double the time spent with traditional physical formats. The towards digital media in the country began in 2018 and has been growing ever since, according to Statista. Currently, when people \"buy\" digital content, they do not actually own the film or song in the same way they would own physical VHS tapes, DVDs, or CDs. When a user pays for a digital download, legally, the content producers have the right to limit access to said content or remove it outright. ‘SOCIAL DILEMMA’ STAR SAYS META LAWSUIT WILL HAVE 'LASTING IMPACT' COMPARES FACEBOOK TO BIG TOBACCO As retailers move towards a digital future, experts warn that an end to physical media could allow tech companies to have greater control over culture and content. (iStock/CyberGuy.com / iStock) \"Until now, many people simply worried about whether or not their digitally purchased content might disappear if they cancel their subscription to the streaming service,\" Donovan said. \"Unfortunately, not many people have considered a much more insidious threat posed to our culture by the push to eliminate the ownership of physical media.\" Given the current state of media ownership, Donovan said it is not unreasonable to assume a movie studio or record company could take away access if they find themselves in the \"crosshairs\" of the culture wars.\" Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media at Carnegie Mellon University, said one of the reasons for this move is that it is more costly for a company to create and distribute a physical copy versus a digital one. He noted that a move to digital can also benefit the consumer in terms of cost. While many companies rely on a subscription-based model for digital content, often, these services are heavily discounted or even free to the consumer because of ad support. Digital content also allows for much quicker updates that provide transparency to a customer, such as a newspaper, which can instantly offer up retractions or editor's notes. GOOGLE FACING $6 BILLION LAWSUIT OVER INFORMATION RELATED TO 'NFL SUNDAY TICKET' DEAL A man flips through digital media content from various streaming platforms. (iStock / iStock) Lightman suggested that there could be greater future experimentations on the interplay between physical and digital media, which has already been integrated into the automobile industry with vehicle software updates. Despite these potential benefits, Lightman expressed concern about how companies may choose to deal with content deemed damaging to their bottom line. He said this could have larger implications for how history is recorded if the content is altered or removed. \"It's going to be written about by the people that have censored it,\" he said. A more measured approach, he suggested, could be an instance where a company has the original content but puts a note stating it no longer reflects the company's value, and they are merely leaving it up for historical value. Lightman surmised that the way companies adapt to these issues would be a balancing act where industry leaders need to stress that the messaging of old content does not reflect current reality or values in society, but understanding how it was portrayed needs to be understood, chronicles and accessed by the people living today. \"You have to have pretty good faith in society and advocates for your brand to go out and tell the story that your company is racist, misogynistic, narcissistic, all of these sorts of things, but this is how the information and content was captured or portrayed at this period of time for historical quotient,\" he added.

((Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) / Getty Images) Noting recent examples, such as Warner Brothers' cancelation of Pepe Le Pew cartoons, outcries against the \"nonconsensual\" kiss of Snow White, or the publishers of Roald Dahl books censoring themselves, Donovan said it is \"perfectly realistic\" to imagine content taken away or edited by the owners to appease \"the latest throng of protesters throwing temper tantrums on social media.\" Kaitlin Puccio, a lawyer and ethicist with a background in entertainment, also expressed concern about the recent trend in publishers releasing newly edited versions of classic books. When other people control how we consume media, they effectively control what we consume,\" Puccio, who also works as a teaching associate at Columbia and a guest lecturer at NYU Law, said. \"If I own physical copies of books and keep them in a personal library in my home, it is highly unlikely that someone is going to decide to dispossess me of half of them for murky reasons. If that entire library consists of ebooks rather than physical books, it is much more likely that I could lose access to half of my collection,\" she added. Some retailers have announced plans to move away from physical media in the coming years. NETFLIX OFFICIALLY TERMINATES DVD RENTAL SERVICE WITH FINAL MAILINGS: 'END OF AN ERA' Best Buy will stop selling physical DVDs and Blu-rays in early 2024. (Reuters Photos) In October, Best Buy confirmed that it will end the sale of Blu-rays and DVDs in early 2024, both in and online. The retailer will maintain the sale of physical copies of video games for now. In a statement to WCCO, Best Buy said: \"To state the obvious, the way we watch movies and TV shows is much different today than it was decades ago. Making this change gives us more space and opportunity to bring customers new and innovative tech for them to explore, discover and enjoy.\" A month earlier, Netflix shuttered its red envelope service, ending the DVD-by-mail service that put the company on the radar. Highlighting recent state lawsuits against Meta, Puccio said it is easy to imagine consumers pushing tech companies to impose an automatic cutoff for hours spent on their platform. However, she said this move would strip people's \"autonomy\" to determine how much media they consume and what media they consume. THE END OF FREE RIDES: HOW NETFLIX IS TACKLING ACCOUNT SHARING Netflix red envelopes carrying DVDs arranged on a desk in Queens, New York. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) \"If I find a video interesting and want to find a video that presents the other side of the argument, Meta, for example, might determine that I've spent enough time consuming media that day and prevent me from watching more videos--which ultimately prevents me from hearing the opposing argument that I sought to hear,\" she said. According to Donovan, the recent explosion of AI could also lead to an even more \"repugnant\" form of censorship and \"cultural vandalism.\" He imagines a future where Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh come on the screen in \"Gone With the Wind\" only to say and do different things in a new \"non-offensive\" film version. \"AI, you realize, had changed the film, and its original version is, just like the title of the movie, gone forever,\" he added. The move towards a fully digital landscape has also had an impact on the gaming industry. MICROSOFT'S XBOX DEVELOPING GENERATIVE AI TOOLS FOR GAME CREATORS close video Stream-flation: Average streaming service is raising prices 25% Needham & Company senior media and internet analyst Laura Martin discusses Netflix's wild trading range ahead of earnings on 'Making Money.' Mithrie Gaming News Editor-in-Chief Mazen Turkmani noted that platforms like X-box, Nintendo, and PlayStation are all making concerted efforts to preserve older games, highlighting classic games' broad appeal and historical significance. However, a growing preference for digital games over physical releases has raised eyebrows. Digital games often have higher prices than their physical counterparts and are not able to resell them, a factor which, in part, can be attributed to tax laws associated with digital goods in various jurisdictions. Turkmani also emphasized a broadening imperative to revisit and reevaluate media content, a trend the global #MeToo movement underscored. \"This newfound consciousness might lead to changes or even removal of certain elements from Western games,\" he said. \"It's reminiscent of how censorship is prevalent in countries like China, where content is frequently altered to align with the nation's values and regulations.\" While there are \"undeniable advantages\" to digital media, such as convenience and accessibility, concerns about tech censorship, longevity and content integrity continue to proliferate in the industry, according to Turkmani.

    "originBody": "OPINIONCOMMENTARY Bay Area Voice: U.S. tech firms must rethink their relationships with China Chinese law requires companies located there provide security access to source code and other sensitive data if demanded HAYWARD, CA – JULY 20: First grade teacher Lori Suydam types on her keyboard during an online class session with 14 students at Park Elementary School on Monday, July 20, 2020, in Hayward, Calif. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) By ANDREW J GROTTO November 9, 2023 at 3:13 p.m. Loading your audio article Microsoft’s disclosure over the summer of a Chinese espionage campaign that used forged credentials to break into U.S. government agencies and businesses is a reminder that China has sophisticated cyber capabilities and is willing to use them. But this is more than just having a product with vulnerable code. If companies have business operations in China — as many of America’s largest and most influential tech companies do — they may be unwitting accomplices to China’s surveillance operations, according to a new report published by the American Security Project. Yet this remains absent from discussions of risk in many technology firms’ public financial statements. It is a curious omission, because the risks are high: Chinese law requires that companies located there provide the Chinese Communist Party’s security services with access to source code and other sensitive data if demanded. Chinese law also requires that security researchers — including those working for tech companies — share vulnerabilities in computer code with the government first. Ten years ago, then-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked classified documents purporting to show that American tech companies were required under U.S. law to furnish information about foreigners to the U.S. intelligence community. In the painful aftermath of the leaks, American tech companies faced such grave reputational harm that many of them reported the risks as material in their financial disclosures. They also fought hard for — and won — the right to be more transparent with their customers and the broader public about how often the U.S. intelligence community required them to cooperate. If U.S. surveillance posed such a grave risk to the business fortunes of American tech companies, surely China’s must as well. To be sure, there is a world of difference between the American legal framework for intelligence operations and China’s. Ours is embedded in a democracy, with limits prescribed by law and subject to layers of oversight by all three branches of government. We openly debate the contours of this framework, as Congress is doing now with respect to the surveillance authorities authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. China gives security services carte blanche to pursue their investigations and operations, with no known limits. The risks of Chinese cyber operations do not stop at a company’s financial bottom line. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has warned that “China almost certainly is capable of launching cyber-attacks that could disrupt critical infrastructure services” in the United States, including rail systems and oil and gas pipelines. Here in California, for example, a Chinese cyber-espionage campaign targeted the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which provides water to 19 million Californians. Now, it is true that many U.S. tech companies’ relations with China are complex. China is a huge market with a long history of making foreign companies build a business footprint in the country in order to sell there. It also has an enormously talented tech workforce that tech companies want to tap into by basing some of their operations in China.

At a minimum, it is time for tech companies to be more transparent about their business operations in China and how they manage risks. They could publish aggregate statistics on the volume of surveillance requests from China, and if the Chinese government prohibits such disclosure, the companies should say so publicly. It is time that Congress asks American tech giants to explain how they assess and address these risks. Andrew J.

    "title": "Experts Call for More Fundamental Changes to Combat AI Election Misinformation",
    "originLink": "https://time.com/6333288/tech-companies-ai-misinformation/",
    "originBody": "By Will Henshall November 9, 2023 9:22 AM EST Meta announced Wednesday (Nov. 8) that it would require labels for political ads that have been digitally altered, using AI or other technology, in ways that could be misleading. The announcement comes a day after Microsoft announced it was also taking a number of steps to protect elections, including offering tools to watermark AI-generated content and deploying a “Campaign Success Team” to advise political campaigns on AI, cybersecurity, and other related issues. Next year will be the most significant year for elections so far this century, with the U.S., India, the U.K., Mexico, Indonesia, and Taiwan all headed to the polls. Although many are concerned about the impact deepfakes and misinformation could have on elections, many experts stress the evidence for their impacts on elections so far is limited at best. Experts welcome the measures taken by tech companies to defend election integrity but say more fundamental changes to political systems will be required to tackle misinformation. How AI could impact elections Tech companies have come under scrutiny after the role they played in previous elections. A report published in 2021 by online advocacy group Avaaz found that by waiting until the month bnefore the U.S. presidential election in 2020 to change its algorithms, Meta allowed misinformation to spread on its platform. Meta has also been criticized for promoting content that questioned the validity of the 2022 Brazilian election and for amplifying content that may have contributed to human rights violations perpetrated against Myanmar’s Rohingya ethnic group. In recent years, AI development has progressed rapidly. Generative AI—which allows users to generate text, audio, and video—emerged from obscurity with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Generative AI has already been used multiple times in U.S. political advertisements, although in each case it was understood that AI had been used. In April, the Republican Party released an AI-generated ad meant to show what might happen if President Joe Biden were reelected. In June, an X campaign account for Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor of Florida and presidential candidate, posted a video that included AI-generated images of former President Donald Trump embracing Dr. Anthony Fauci. A poll published in November found that 58% of U.S. adults are concerned AI could increase the spread of false information during the 2024 presidential election. Read More: Federal AI Regulation Draws Nearer However, studies consistently find that misinformation has not measurably changed the outcomes of previous U.S. elections, says Andreas Jungherr, a professor of political science at the University of Bamberg in Germany, who notes that academics from other disciplines, such as media studies and psychology tend to give more credence to the impacts of misinformation on elections. For example, a paper published in Nature in 2023 found “no evidence of a meaningful relationship between exposure to the Russian foreign influence campaign [in 2016] and changes in attitudes, polarization, or voting behavior.” Often people overestimate the effects of misinformation because they overestimate both how easy it is to change people’s views on charged issues such as voting behavior and how capable misinformation-enabling technologies such as AI are, says Jungherr. While the chances that a piece of AI-generated misinformation could influence public opinion enough to sway elections are very low, AI could still have pernicious effects on elections and politics more broadly in the future, says Elizabeth Seger, a researcher at the Centre for the Governance of AI, a research organization based in the U.K. In the future, highly-personalized AI-enabled targeting coupled with extremely persuasive AI agents could be used to carry out mass persuasion campaigns. And in 2024, the mere existence of deepfakes could erode people’s trust in key information sources, says Seger. This has already happened. In 2019, an allegation that a video of Ali Bongo, then the president of Gabon, was a fake was used to justify an attempted coup. Later that year, the impact of a suspected video of a Malaysian cabinet minister engaged in a sexual act with a political aide was neutered by claims that the video was altered by AI. “A risk that is often overlooked, that is much more likely to take place this election cycle, isn't that generative AI will be used to produce deepfakes that trick people into thinking candidate so and so did some terrible thing,” says Seger. “But that the very existence of these technologies are used to undermine the value of evidence and undermine trust in key information streams.” Election protection So far governments have taken limited measures to mitigate the impact of AI on elections. In the U.S., a bill was introduced in Congress in May that would require political ads that use AI-generated images or video to carry a disclaimer. In August, the Federal Election Commission requested input on whether it should amend the regulation that prohibits political ads from misrepresenting other candidates or political parties to include deliberately deceptive AI, but has yet to take action. Tech companies, wary of the reputational damage sustained by Meta for its role in the 2020 election, are starting to take action. In July, the White House secured voluntary commitments aimed at ensuring AI systems are safe and trustworthy from seven leading AI companies, including Meta and Microsoft. One of the commitments was to develop and deploy provenance or watermarking techniques for AI-generated visual and audio content. Eight more companies signed on to the commitments in September. Meta and Microsoft’s moves this week follow an announcement from Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, that it would require visible disclosures on political ads that contain synthetically-generated content that inauthentically depicts real people or events. Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor, a professor and researcher, respectively at Princeton University, have argued more capable AI won't worsen the misinformation problem because misleading content is already relatively easy to produce and anyone who wants to produce it can already do so. Rather, misinformation is best tackled by content moderation by social media sites and other digital platforms. Watermarking and provenance measures by AI developers are likely to be ineffective because malicious actors can easily access AI models that have been openly published, such as Meta’s Llama 2, says Jungherr. “I would argue that this is an attempt by these companies to avoid negative coverage,” he says. “I'm not necessarily sure that they expect that these tools will shift an election.” Disclosures on political ads may face similar issues, says Sacha Altay, a researcher in the Digital Democracy Lab at the University of Zurich. “I think it's good that political ads have to disclose when they use generative AI,” says Altay. “The only thing is that maybe the bad actors who want to abuse generative AI will probably not disclose it, so I'm not exactly sure how they will enforce it.” “In the end, I think it almost comes down to how politicians use the information ecosystem to gain power or to gain followers to gain votes, even if they lie and spread misinformation,” says Altay. “I don't think there's any quick fix.”",

    "originBody": "More tech job layoffs announced at Google, Amazon, and Snap By LaMonica Peters Published November 9, 2023 11:10PM Technology KTVU FOX 2 More tech job layoffs announced at Google, Amazon, and Snap Some major tech companies announced another round of job cuts on Thursday. Google, Amazon and Snap are among the companies continuing to downsize. Neither Google nor Amazon disclosed how many jobs were being cut this time. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. - Some major tech companies announced another round of job cuts on Thursday. Google, Amazon and Snap are among the companies continuing to downsize. Analysts we spoke with say these companies are simply evaluating their bottom line and this round of layoffs is most likely connected to an uncertain economic outlook. \"The data that’s come out has shown that the tech industry has been laying off people really pretty aggressively,\" said Ian Sherr, a Tech Reporter and Analyst. Google, Amazon, Snap and Zillow say they’re making more cuts to their workforce. Neither Google nor Amazon disclosed how many jobs were being cut this time. Sherr says the cuts are most likely continuing fallout from the pandemic. \"The economy has shifted a lot over those last four years. We’ve seen inflation come up, now we’ve seen it start coming down. We’ve seen interest rates going up, all of these types of things. So, it is somewhat part of the natural cycle to see layoffs in some companies,\" Sherr said. Amazon’s most recent layoffs will affect employees in Europe, Latin America and North America. This is also the fifth round of job cuts for Google since September and the 3rd round of cuts for its parent company, Alphabet. \"The nine-county Bay Area lost almost 17,000 jobs last month, which was the worst monthly job loss we saw Omicron hit in late 2020 and early 2021,\" said Abby Raisz, from the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. Both Snap and Zillow are also cutting about two dozen jobs from their workforce. Raisz says interest rates are at a 22-year high and companies will continue to make cost-cutting decisions. \"Still, many companies are making decisions around these high interest rates which, of course, keeps the economy growing more slowly and reduces companies' need to hire more people or retain people,\" Raisz said. Sherr also says that some layoffs aren’t always related to economic issues. He sometimes says companies may have a division or project that’s no longer viable, so they decide to cut those jobs.
