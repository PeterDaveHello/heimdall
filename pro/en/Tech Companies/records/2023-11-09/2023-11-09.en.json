The tech industry has seen more than 240,000 jobs lost in 2023, a total that’s already 50% higher than last year and growing. Earlier this year, mass workforce reductions were driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups across many sectors also announced cutbacks through the first half of the year. And while tech layoffs slowed down in the summer and fall, it appears that cuts are ramping up yet again. Many economists have cautioned against fears of a recession, which would seem like a reason for optimism. But the momentum for a tech sector rebound has been slow to build, resulting in tech companies continuing to cut back on their workforces and pivot from a growth mindset to one based on efficiency in the face of stubborn market conditions. But tracking these layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. Unfortunately, it also serves as a reminder of the deeply human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles could evolve from here. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here.

As the traditional thinking goes, because they’re so risk-averse and lack business training, physicians are not well suited to a high-growth, venture-backed startup environment. Many of the physicians I know have heard these ideas so much that they’ve internalized them. Byron Crowe, an academic hospitalist, told me that physicians who want to move into business must work “very intentionally” to become businesspeople and most lack the confidence to make the leap. advertisement But as an investor in digital health, I’d argue that there’s nothing that inherently should stop a doctor from becoming a startup CEO. In fact, I’m ready to make the opposite bet. Digital health is still a nascent category, but there’s an increasing number of success stories of physicians-turned-founders to point to. Some of these have practiced for years, while others took the leap shortly after medical school. Take Doximity, one of the few health-tech companies in the public markets. It was co-founded by a physician, Nate Gross. And Teladoc, one of the early telemedicine companies, was co-founded by a physician back in 2002. In health tech, many of the current most promising “unicorns,” (that is, the companies with a valuation of over $1 billion), have physicians either as a co-founder or at the helm, including Viz.AI (Chris Mansi), Cityblock (Toyin Ajayi), Carbon Health (Caesar Djavaherian), and Aledade (Farzad Mostashari). Furthermore, one of the industry’s biggest exits — One Medical, which sold to Amazon for $3.9 billion — was founded by a physician, Tom Lee. After he stepped down to start another company, he brought in another doctor, Amir Dan Rubin, to run things. And One Medical’s big acquisition, Iora Health, was also founded by a physician. And the list goes on. advertisement Related: These three doctors are going the startup route early in their careers To borrow an analogy from a prominent physician turned investor — Venrock’s Bob Kocher — becoming a founder is kind of like having a child. Nothing prepares you for it before you do it; you just have to take the plunge and learn as you go. And doctors, of course, are great at learning. They may even have a few advantages up their sleeve versus other founder backgrounds, which Kocher readily acknowledges. In Kocher’s view, physicians who really understand the patient population that the company is serving add immense value, such as geriatric medicine specialists working in Medicare Advantage or obstetricians founding women’s health companies. They will also likely have a deep understanding of the clinical workflow, which is often a black box for those who haven’t practiced. And then there are more tactical benefits with a physician founder being involved in a care delivery startup, as that person can manage the entity that employs physicians to administer care. Many investors in my network actively seek out physicians to start companies. Eric Epstein, a health-tech investor with Santé Ventures, believes that doctors have an edge because they understand their customers. And getting that “founder/market fit” right is absolutely critical, he believes, or there’s very little hope of getting to what’s called “product/market fit.” Product/market fit, or “PMF” in industry terms, refers to the degree that a product satisfies market demand. Without that, a company will struggle. Another secret weapon for physician founders, according to Epstein, is that they can better navigate health care organizations, including large hospitals, which are often laggards in adopting new technology. Because physicians know the culture of medicine, they have a richer understanding of who the real stakeholders and buyers are. And it helps them avoid going down months-long rabbit holes where they’re talking to the wrong people. That often includes chief innovation officers, who are not typically the ones making the buying decisions at a large health system or payer. Then there’s the fact that many clinicians innately trust one another more than a slick MBA when it comes to new products or solutions. There may also be more indirect cultural factors at play. Being a physician can be “scrappy work,” according to physician-turned-investor Brenton Fargnoli, given that there’s often different teams and stakeholders to work with that change in real-time. Startups are similarly designed, and those who join early will have to adapt to quickly growing teams that frequently fluctuate based on the company’s stage.

Privacy Policy Similarly, Shivdev Rao, founder of the medical AI company Abridge, notes that while doctors follow evidence-based guidelines, they sometimes must pivot quickly if the standard path isn’t working. Sometimes a diagnosis is about an idea that has to be proven out, or it’s the end result of a process of elimination. Being able to recognize that early enough and change direction as needed is actually a sign of a good physician, but also a good founder. To be sure, there are also plenty of examples where physicians have started companies and not been successful. One missing piece, in my view, is the lack of training and education around the business side of medicine (except, of course, for the small but growing cohort of M.D./MBAs). I often see physicians who think that it’s enough for a startup to solve an unmet clinical need. But even solutions to significant unmet clinical needs can’t help patients without marketing and sales. There are also important considerations for health investors to consider around whether the business is truly venture-backable. That is, will it really drive an outsize return? Not all companies are built for this kind of trajectory, perhaps because the customer isn’t willing to pay or the market opportunity is too small. There are increasingly solutions for this education gap. Dozens of social communities have sprouted up in recent years for physicians interested in entrepreneurship, including the Society of Physician Entrepreneurs, Doctorpreneurs, Physician Side Gigs. I also recently started a Slack group for physicians interested in entrepreneurship — Clinicians Who VC — alongside Jonathan Slotkin of Contigo Health and Vive Collective physician-turned-investor Rebecca Mitchell. Hundreds of physicians joined in the first few weeks, which is an indication of the interest in startups and entrepreneurship. I’m also seeing physicians in my network who are choosing to spend time during their fellowship year working at a health-tech startup versus in a traditional research role. UCSF’s Anjali Thakkar, for instance, joined a company started by two fellow physicians and entrepreneurs for a year in order to immerse herself in product development. I’m also buoyed by the emergence of programs like Stanford’s Biodesign, which teams medical students up with MBAs and technologists to test out and ship new products. Related: A doctor-entrepreneur’s guide to socially responsible capitalism Arlen Meyer at the Society of Physician Entrepreneurs believes that we need to go a step further and redefine what entrepreneurship means to physicians. Even if a doctor is employed by a health system or health plan, rather than serving as CEO of their own high-growth startup, they can still bring innovative thinking to their role. As an example, some physician executives adapted quickly to offer telemedicine options to patients in the early innings of the pandemic. And there are reasons to learn about the business side of medicine — where money flows and why it flows, versus focusing purely on care, particularly as the system gets overloaded with cost and patients are increasingly on the hook. I’d like to push forward a new narrative. Physicians aren’t innately bad businesspeople. In fact, this kind of career might self-select for a disproportionate number of founders. Medicine used to be a career path that talented, young people chose in large part because it was more entrepreneurial than other fields. Rather than working for a large employer, many physicians would have the opportunity to open their own practice. Nowadays, in part driven by the trend toward consolidation, most physicians are employed by a hospital or corporation. More medical schools should include entrepreneurial tracks or opportunities for those who want to start businesses or be part of one. For many doctors, that entrepreneurial itch is still there. And that’s a good thing. With rising rates of burnout and massive labor shortages across the various specialties, we need to be figuring out ways to “scale” care. And technology, which opens up opportunities to provide asynchronous and remote care, could be a key part of the solution. As more doctors move into this space, digital health should be willing to welcome them with open arms.

The decision would extend to customers, either directly or through partners, in China, including Hong Kong and Macau, effective December 3, a spokesman said in a statement to the Post on Wednesday. The business decision was made due to the “increasing cost” of operating in the region, the spokesman added. The company did not provide further details. It followed similar moves since last year by other American tech firms, from Microsoft’s career-networking platform LinkedIn to cloud-based software provider Salesforce, to scale down their operations in China, as they grapple with a weaker economic outlook, as well as tightened data-security and cross-border data-processing requirements in the country. A view of Shenzhen, southern China. Photo: SCMP/ Martin Chan China implemented the Data Security Law in September 2021. Built upon cybersecurity laws, the new rules limit the ways data can be processed, stress the need to safeguard national security and interests, and make the protection of data security a national security priority. Those regulations have increased compliance costs and added operational challenges for both multinational tech companies and smaller local firms. Besides American tech companies, some consulting and investigation firms have also recently pulled out of China. They include US tech research firm Forrester, which closed its China office earlier this year. Three US and British due-diligence companies, including Nardello and the Risk Advisory Group, also exited Hong Kong this year or were winding down their operations in China, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal in October. As more US firms leave China, Beijing is trying to turn a friendlier face to foreign investors. The Cyberspace Administration of China in September proposed to relax the nation’s cross-border data-security controls by waiving security assessments for most business and personal activities involving sending Chinese data abroad. Under the new guidelines, exports of data generated by “trade, academic, cross-border manufacturing and marketing activities” would no longer be subject to a regulatory security assessment or personal information protection review. China will use machines for Data Security Law, scientist with policy role says Cloud Software, based in Florida, was formed in September 2022 after private equity firm Vista Equity Partners and Evergreen Coast Capital, an arm of investment firm Elliott Management, acquired Citrix and merged it with software company Tribico. As a result of the merger, Cloud Software announced earlier this year a workforce reduction of 15 per cent. Citrix, founded in 1989 and also based in Florida, specialises in cloud computing, virtualisation technology, virtual desktops and remote access technology. Citrix has previously partnered with large Chinese-owned companies such as JD.com, SAIC General Motors and China Euro Vehicle Technology, with sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong, according to its website. 8",

    "title": "UK communications watchdog issues guidance for social media platforms to protect children online",
    "originLink": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-67358369",
    "originBody": "Stop suggesting children as friends, social media firms told Published 2 hours ago Share IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES By Chris Vallance Technology reporter, BBC News Social media platforms should fight online grooming by not suggesting children as \"friends\" by default, the communications watchdog says. The warning is contained in Ofcom's first guidance for tech platforms on complying with the Online Safety Act. This covers how they should tackle illegal content, including child abuse online. Ofcom revealed figures suggesting that over one in ten 11-18 year olds have been sent naked or semi-naked images. This first draft code of practice published by Ofcom in its role enforcing the Online Safety Act covers activity such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), grooming and fraud. It wants to hear what tech platforms think of its plans. Much of the guidance targets grooming. The largest platforms are expected to change default settings so children aren't added to suggested friends lists, something that can be exploited by groomers. They should also ensure children's location information cannot be revealed in their profile or posts and prevent them receiving messages from people not in their contacts list. Depending on their size, type, and the risk they present platforms should also: Make sure moderation teams have the resources they need Make it easy to for people to make a complaint to the platform Remove accounts run by or on behalf of terrorist organisations Use keyword searches to find content linked to fraud such as stolen passwords Identify content containing the addresses of child abuse websites Search engines should not index websites previously identified as hosting child abuse material Search engine users should have a way to report \"search suggestions\" they believe are pointing them to illegal content. Ofcom will also require some platforms to use a technology called hash-matching to detect CSAM. This converts an image into numbers called a \"hash\", and compares that with a database of numbers generated by known CSAM images. If there is a match, then it means a known CSAM image has been found. The method is already widely used by social media and search engines, according to Professor Alan Woodward of Surrey University. \"I fear Ofcom are simply codifying mechanisms that are already in use. It's not surprising as research to date has found nothing more effective than what is in use already\", he told the BBC. Private messages But this hashing will not apply to private or encrypted messages. Ofcom stresses it is not - in this guidance - making any proposals that would break encryption. Powers in the bill that could, if certain conditions are met, be used to force private messaging apps such as iMessage, WhatsApp and Signal to scan messages for CSAM have been deeply controversial. These apps use end-to-end-encryption, which means even the tech firm cannot read the contents of the message. Some major apps have said they will not comply if asked to scan encrypted messages - arguing it would require them to weaken the privacy of their systems globally, and weaken the security of systems that protect users including children. Ofcom says those powers will not be consulted on until 2024 and are unlikely to come into force until around 2025. Some question whether it will ever be possible to enforce these powers in a way that preserves the privacy of encrypted communications. Asked in a BBC interview if those powers would ever be used, Ofcom's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said, \"it's hard to say right now, but there isn't a solution yet, a technology solution, that allows scanning to take place in encrypted environments without breaking the encryption.\" But she encouraged encrypted messaging companies to find ways to combat child abuse on their platforms. Great expectations The challenge facing Ofcom is significant. This first guidance is over 1,500 pages long. Over 100,000 services, many based outside the UK, may be subject to regulation. And government figures have suggested that 20,000 small business could need to comply. Asked if Ofcom had the resources it needed, Dame Melanie admitted it was a \"really big job\" but added \"we're absolutely up for the task. And we're really excited that we're launching today.\" It faces another challenge managing expectations from the public and from campaigners. Whatever Ofcom announces it may be criticised for being too hard on tech platforms or not hard enough, said Dame Melanie. \"It isn't the job of a regulator to be loved by everybody. That's impossible. \"And it's not what we ever aim for, but it is our job to be proportionate. And to make sure that what we require is evidenced and has been backed up by proper facts\", Dame Melanie added. And one expectation Ofcom is keen to dismiss is that harmful content should be reported directly to it - instead its task is to make sure the tech-firms have good systems for users to report illegal or harmful content to them. \"So this isn't like TV [complaints] where you can submit a complaint to Ofcom, and we will consider it as the regulator\", Dame Melanie said.

    "originBody": "RISING INDIA, TOXIC TECH How India tamed Twitter and set a global standard for online censorship By Karishma Mehrotra and Joseph Menn November 8, 2023 at 10:00 p.m. EST (Illustration by Shubhadeep Mukherjee for The Washington Post; Manish Swarup/AP; Imtiyaz Khan/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images; Altaf Qadri/AP) Listen 19 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save NEW DELHI — For years, a committee of executives from U.S. technology companies and Indian officials convened every two weeks in a government office to negotiate what could — and could not — be said on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. At the “69A meetings,” as the secretive gatherings were informally called, officials from India’s information, technology, security and intelligence agencies presented social media posts they wanted removed, citing threats to India’s sovereignty and national security, executives and officials who were present recalled. The tech representatives sometimes pushed back in the name of free speech. One company resisted the most: Twitter. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement But two years ago, these interactions took a fateful turn. Where officials had once asked for a handful of tweets to be removed at each meeting, they now insisted that entire accounts be taken down, and numbers were running in the hundreds. Executives who refused the government’s demands could now be jailed, their companies expelled from the Indian market. New regulations had been adopted that year to hold tech employees in India criminally liable for failing to comply with takedown requests, a provision that executives referred to as a “hostage provision.” After authorities dispatched anti-terrorism police to Twitter’s New Delhi office, Twitter whisked its top India executive out of the country, fearing his arrest, former company employees recounted. In the past two years, the Indian government has dramatically tightened its grip on American social media companies. Silicon Valley firms that were at times defiant are now far more accepting of Indian government dictates to censor material, in particular criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Skip to end of carousel The rise of Modi and his Hindu-first state arrow left arrow right India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi swept into power nearly a decade ago. Since then, he has repeatedly rallied voters in this vast democracy and entrenched his party’s power by exploiting differences between the Hindu majority and Muslim minority. Religious tensions have existed in India since independence in 1947, and Modi’s right-wing followers in his Bharatiya Janata Party and beyond turned to inflammatory rhetoric and violence against Muslims to secure support from Hindus. The BJP and affiliated Hindu nationalist groups have been in the global vanguard of using technology to advance political aims, tightening their grip with an ideology that imperils India’s traditional secularism and equality among religious faiths. Disinformation and divisive, often bigoted online posts and videos are rampant. Government censorship of critical views has been on the rise. Social media platforms and other Big Tech firms, protective of their position in one of the world’s largest markets, have often given Modi and his allies what they want. Despite concerns over repression and accelerating autocracy, the Biden administration has been actively courting Modi, hoping that India can help contain Chinese expansionism in the Indo-Pacific region. Canada’s explosive announcement on Sept. 18 that Indian government agents may have assassinated a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil underscores the uncomfortable choices the United States and other Western countries face in moving closer to Modi’s India. 1/6 End of carousel Indian officials say they have accomplished something long overdue: strengthening national laws to bring disobedient foreign companies to heel. This escalating censorship in the world’s largest democracy is part of a wider campaign by Modi and his Hindu nationalist allies to monopolize public discourse: tightening their grip on power, advancing their Hindu-first ideology and squeezing out critical and dissenting voices. American technology companies have increasingly fallen in line, fearing for their employees’ security and their profits. Among the Big Tech companies, the shift has been most notable at Twitter, once seen as Silicon Valley’s flag-bearer for resisting government pressure worldwide. A company that not long ago adopted the risky strategy of fighting government censorship in the Indian courts now consistently bends to official demands. It has repeatedly taken down posts critical of Modi and his administration and accounts belonging to journalists and the BJP’s political opponents. “The [stuff] that they’re doing in India should be freaking everybody out,” said a former U.S. Twitter policy staffer. In January, Twitter and YouTube complied with orders to remove links in India to a BBC documentary that faulted Modi, while chief minister of Gujarat state, for allowing the spread of intercommunal riots in 2002 that left more than 1,000 people dead, most of them Muslims. Citing a legal basis for the order, a senior adviser to the Broadcasting Ministry tweeted that the documentary was “hostile propaganda and anti-India garbage.” In October, Twitter, now renamed X, agreed in India to block the accounts of two U.S.-based groups, Hindus for Human Rights and the Indian American Muslim Council, both nonprofits advocating for pluralism and religious freedom in South Asia. Twitter became increasingly compliant under immense Indian government pressure even before Elon Musk bought the company just over a year ago. But after he did, Musk proved even less willing to contest takedown orders and discontinued transparency reports about how the company responded to them. In more than 50 interviews, current and former technology executives and Indian officials detailed how the government broke Twitter’s resistance through a raft of new regulations, a streamlined censorship process — and the coercive muscle of law enforcement agencies. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe such private interactions as well as the 69A committee meetings, which have not been previously reported in detail. (The name 69A refers to the section of the information technology law providing for government censorship.) Some executives wanted to share their concerns about how dire the situation has become and the industry’s complicity in the increasing censorship, while government officials wanted to highlight their success in reining in what they say are irresponsible companies. Digital and human rights advocates warn that India has perfected the use of regulations to stifle online dissent and already inspired governments in countries as varied as Nigeria and Myanmar to craft similar legal frameworks, at times with near-identical language. India’s success in taming internet companies has set off “regulatory contagion” across the world, according to Prateek Waghre, a policy director at India’s Internet Freedom Foundation. “India is steadily becoming a norm-shaping country,” said Neeti Biyani, a researcher at the Internet Society, a Virginia-based internet freedom advocacy organization. “Being the strongest economy in South Asia and one of the strongest emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific, it’s considered one of the first movers on new regulations.” Bangladesh, for example, adopted internet regulations in 2022 that were a “copycat” of India’s, Biyani said. Despite the huge size of China’s market, companies like Twitter and Facebook were forced to steer clear of the country because Beijing’s rules would have required them to spy on users. That left India as the largest potential growth market. Silicon Valley companies were already committed to doing business in India before the government began to tighten its regulations, and today say they have little choice but to obey if they want to remain there. “We are toeing the line, not antagonizing the government, knowing very well that this is a government that can come after you,” said an industry official. “All governments in India have been intolerant. But now, they are putting in place the mechanisms and measures. They are going about it in a systematic manner.” Neither Twitter nor Musk responded to written questions for this article. Silicon Valley companies once believed that “ideology trumped local law. They have been moved from that delusion,” said Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the deputy technology minister in the BJP government who oversees many of the new regulations, speaking in an interview. “The shift was really simple: We’ve defined the laws, defined the rules, and we have said there is zero tolerance to any noncompliance with the Indian law.” “You don’t like the law? Don’t operate in India,” Chandrasekhar added. “There is very little wiggle room.” The Information Technology Ministry did not respond to a list of subsequent questions for this article. Brewing trouble In 2018, Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and its chief executive at the time, flew to New Delhi for a visit that would foreshadow trouble to come. Clad in a black hoodie and beanie, the bearded billionaire posed for a photo with Indian anti-caste and feminist activists while holding a poster that read: “Smash Brahminical Patriarchy!” The picture went viral and incensed the Indian right wing, which viewed Dorsey as the archetype of an elite American trampling over traditional Indian culture. Many denounced Twitter as “racist,” and the company apologized on behalf of its chief executive. Twitter, Facebook and other U.S. companies were already grappling with how to moderate speech in India. They were seeing a deluge of anti-Muslim and other hateful posts by BJP leaders and their Hindu nationalist supporters, and on occasion the companies called out and pushed back against activity they considered abusive. Prominent BJP supporters accused Twitter of suppressing their online reach and denying them the blue check marks given to other high-profile individuals. The Modi administration began to ramp up censorship requests, and the 69A committee meetings grew longer, spilling into days, executives recalled. Often, officials simply called Twitter to demand takedowns, industry and government officials said. Records published by the Indian Parliament show that annual takedown requests for posts and accounts increased from 471 to 6,775 between 2014 and 2022, with those to Twitter soaring from 224 in 2018 to 3,417 in 2022. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Government demands to block entire accounts and topic hashtags also soared. Twitter’s transparency reports show that 77 accounts were suspended in the country in 2020. In 2021, there were nearly 1,400. (The company stopped publishing transparency reports after that.) One former IT Ministry official involved in the orders defended the blocking of accounts. “There are certain accounts that continue to spew venom,” he said. “I have to go by what content you have posted, how much of it is anti-India.” A defining moment In late 2020, hundreds of thousands of Indian farmers descended on New Delhi, demanding that Modi withdraw new laws that reduced crop subsidies and price supports and overhauled state-regulated agricultural markets. The farmers, drawn in large part from members of the Sikh religion in Punjab state, occupied highways for months. They brought food, tents, tractors and something unexpected: social media savvy. The protesters formed an “IT cell” and connected with the Punjabi and Sikh diaspora around the world. They waged a social media campaign that attracted support from NBA players, Greta Thunberg and Rihanna. The protest movement posed a rare — and unexpectedly serious — challenge to the BJP government. It was a “defining moment,” said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia policy director at Access Now, a digital rights group. “The government realized, ‘We need to cement our power in the tech sector,’” he said. “The digital authoritarian turn accelerated in 2021.” Soon, the censorship orders flooded in. Government officials, who argued that the farmers’ movement harbored ties to separatists seeking an independent Sikh country, saw any posts that could be linked to the secessionist movement as a clear “no-go zone,” a tech executive said. But the government’s net went far beyond that. Officials balked at posts critical of Modi and started to block journalists. Sandeep Singh, a freelance journalist who spent months following the farmers’ protest, recalled tracking dozens of Twitter accounts that were taken down. The farmers’ “IT cell” was silenced. So were a news magazine, a Sikh politician and a poet from Canada. “We were shocked to see the scale,” Singh said. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement While Twitter agreed to remove most of the accounts and posts flagged by the government, the company occasionally resisted. The Indian IT Ministry told Parliament that of 3,750 URLs ordered removed between August 2020 and December 2021, 167 were either left up by Twitter or taken down but restored. Share this article Share In a public statement, Twitter declared it would not take down accounts of journalists, activists and politicians because the orders were not “consistent with Indian law” or its own “principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression.” Twitter’s defiance infuriated the Indian officials, who accelerated the adoption of new rules that in part required social media companies to respond to takedown requests within set time periods, and to appoint a compliance manager, a grievance officer and a liaison with law enforcement, all based in India. The boiling point While the farmers’ protest raged in the spring of 2021, a devastating delta variant of the coronavirus swept through India, ultimately killing more than 200,000 people. As criticism of the government response swelled on social media, Modi officials issued waves of new takedown orders. In response, Twitter even removed straightforward commentary, such as the tweet: “Second wave of COVID-19 in India = @narendramodi made disaster. #ResignModi” When opposition leader Rahul Gandhi accused the prime minister of failing to distribute vaccines and shedding insincere “crocodile tears” about pandemic deaths, the speech set off a flood of anti-Modi and anti-government tweets with the hashtag “#crocodiletears.” In New Delhi, officials ordered Twitter to remove all posts with that hashtag and demanded that the company hand over information identifying users who tweeted it, two former employees recalled. After Twitter resisted, Indian officials claimed that the hashtag was being used by terrorists and later alleged it was being used to distribute pornography, the former employees said. Indeed, some posts with the #crocodiletears hashtag contained pornographic images. But a Twitter investigator found that some of the posts came from a location near a police building, and a Twitter team concluded that the government itself was planting the images to justify social media restrictions, the former employees recalled. Tensions between Twitter and the Modi administration reached a boiling point after the company labeled some BJP leaders’ posts as “manipulated media,” meaning they contained images that had been deceptively altered. An elite police force showed up outside Twitter’s New Delhi office in May 2021 with television cameras in tow. The promised raid, however, never materialized because the office was empty amid the pandemic. In a separate dispute, police in the BJP-ruled state of Uttar Pradesh summoned Twitter India’s managing director, Manish Maheshwari, for questioning over accusations that the platform showed a disputed map of India that did not reflect the country’s declared borders, according to internal company documents. Although Twitter lawyers staved that off, a subsequent police visit to his home and escalating anonymous threats made Twitter’s U.S.-based leadership conclude that it had become “very, very dangerous for him and his family,” a former company executive said. Twitter hurried Maheshwari out of India in mid-2021, and he has not returned. Maheshwari declined to comment for this article. In a tweet that May, Twitter highlighted “the use of intimidation tactics by the police” and said it was “concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve.” The IT Ministry hit back by calling Twitter’s noncompliance “an attempt to dictate its terms to the world’s largest democracy.” Skip to end of carousel What this series reveals arrow left arrow right Part 1: Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and its Hindu nationalist allies have built a massive propaganda machine, with tens of thousands of activists spreading disinformation and religiously divisive posts via WhatsApp. Parent company Meta says WhatsApp cannot monitor content, no matter how inflammatory. Part 2: Social media giants have been reluctant to police Indian content that violates their terms of service. After Facebook discovered a vast influence operation using fake accounts secretly operated by the Indian army, some company employees moved to shut it down, but executives in the New Delhi office stalled the action. Part 3: A new generation of Hindu vigilantes frequently stream their armed attacks against Muslims on platforms like YouTube and Facebook, amassing large followings and winning BJP protection. While rights activists have repeatedly flagged hateful influencers to social media companies, the accounts are rarely removed. Part 4: India orders internet shutdowns more than any other country, blacking out entire states for weeks and even months at a time. By pulling the plug, the government is able to stifle dissent, drown out negative news and obstruct journalists from doing independent reporting — often at a high economic cost. Part 5: The Indian government has dramatically increased the demands it makes of Silicon Valley firms to take down social media posts and accounts, in particular those critical of Modi and the BJP. Companies that once pushed back now routinely comply, and nowhere has the shift been more notable than at Twitter. More stories to come. 1/5 End of carousel But despite Twitter’s public rebuke of the Indian government, employees inside the company were growing concerned about how much it was bowing to the government’s censorship demands. At an annual presentation to the company’s leadership in 2021, Twitter’s communications team singled out India and delivered a warning about the global precedent the company was setting, according to a person familiar with the presentation. “The concern was that if we were beginning to make exceptions for a certain government, a whole host of other governments would come to us, and it would be difficult to explain why we could not do the same for them,” the person said. The ‘hostage provision’ As India’s new IT rules kicked in, the government told a Delhi court in summer 2021 that Twitter did not have local officers responsible for addressing grievances, coordinating with law enforcement and other tasks mandated by law, and thus had lost its “safe harbor” status, leaving it potentially liable for content deemed illegal. These local officers had to be based in India and could face penalties of five years in jail for failing to comply with government orders. The threat of arrest “shifts the calculus significantly” for corporate decision-making, said Waghre, of the Internet Freedom Foundation. “You can draw a line in the sand from when the IT rules 2021 went into effect. There was a sudden drop in reported instances of any sort of pushback.” Former Twitter and Facebook executives agreed, saying in interviews that they could not allow colleagues to be jailed. To meet the government mandate, Twitter hired Vinay Prakash — whose longest previous job had been as a political analyst for Chandrasekhar, then in Parliament and now the deputy IT minister in the BJP government — to be both grievance and compliance officer. Because of the sensitivity of the position — compliance officers typically have access to internal discussions about legal and human-resource issues as well as user information — Twitter had asked a Florida-based boutique research firm, Divine Intel, to conduct an independent appraisal and background check on Prakash. The firm raised concerns, according to two people familiar with the events. “Our assessment identified one applicant as high-risk/high-threat and we advised against hiring the individual due to the potential for undue influence from members of Parliament” and other issues, said a Divine Intel executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comply with the company’s secrecy policy. The executive said that despite these findings, the person was hired. Divine Intel did not identify Twitter as its client, saying only that it was a major U.S. tech company. But the people familiar with the episode said it was referring to the vetting of Prakash. Prakash did not respond to requests to comment for this article. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Last year, former Twitter head of security Peiter Zatko filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department alleging that around the time of the farmers’ protest, the Indian government “forced Twitter to hire specific individual(s) who were government agents.” In testimony before Congress, he said that the government agent was to secretly monitor how Twitter responded to political and public pressure and that the company had known about it. Zatko, who was fired in January 2022, never publicly named the employee he believed to be working for the Indian government. Twitter has denied Zatko’s allegations. Loss of appetite In July 2022, Twitter took the Indian government to court, suing over the continuing demands to censor tweets about the farmers’ protest. Twitter lost. A judge in Karnataka state sided with the government in June, ruling that posts it wanted censored were “anti-India & seditious … designed to incite violence.” Twitter appealed. But the company lost much of its appetite to challenge the government after Twitter was acquired a year ago by Musk, former employees said. “Twitter doesn’t have a choice but to obey local governments,” Musk said in June to Geeta Mohan, executive editor of the India Today news channel. “If we don’t obey local government law, then we will get shut down. The best we can do is really to hew close to the law in any given country, but it’s impossible for us to do more than that or we will be blocked and our people will be arrested.” Other U.S. companies also opted for a less confrontational approach. After the new IT law was adopted in 2021, for example, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai became one of the first tech leaders to say his company would adhere to it. “When you comply, you make more revenue. We gained from that,” said a former Google global affairs executive. Google spokeswoman Christa Muldoon said that the company examined removal requests to see if the content violated local laws, removing it for users in the relevant country, and that revenue was not a factor in decisions. The company reported that the number of items removed from all Google platforms in India soared from about 11,000 in 2019 to more than 23,000 in just the first half of 2023. Lokman Tsui, who oversaw Google’s free expression program in the Asia-Pacific region in the early 2010s, said the company began a global shift away from its “moral stance” in his region, notably in India, before this spread worldwide. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Doubling down Now, Indian officials say they want to tighten their regulations further. The “Digital India” bill being drafted is likely to weaken legal protections afforded to the companies for hosting content deemed illegal, according to Chandrasekhar. “There will no longer be blanket immunity” for social media companies that do not obey, he said. He added that online anonymity and safe harbor protections have been abused to spread harmful misinformation and hate speech. Other government officials, meanwhile, say it has become easier to make companies take down content because they have turned over many of the decisions to India-based staff, who focus more on complying with local laws and less on company policies. One former IT Ministry official praised the companies for becoming more “understanding” of the government’s perspective, noting that they increasingly comply with its orders. Just the prospect of further regulation is being used by the government to bend the tech companies to its will, according to Chima, of the Access Now digital rights group. “It’s not only the issue of what actually will get into the law,” he said. “It’s that legal threats are used as a form of negotiation, to get companies to do or not do certain things.” About this story Design by Anna Lefkowitz.

    "originBody": "The Air Shield Mini is small and light — just 5 centimeters wide and weighing the same as a AA battery. Air Shield Mini Redeem now The impacts of air pollution are a growing concern for health organizations and climate regulators. Traditional air purifiers are bulky, high maintenance, and use a lot of power. Two UK startups are using negative-ion tech to create what they say are portable air purifiers. This story is part of \"How Emerging Tech Is Changing Everything,\" a series exploring the transformative impact of tech innovations across industries. Advertisement Advertisement Air pollution is a global problem that has an enormous effect on well-being and longevity. Research from the World Health Organization found that 99% of the global population was breathing air containing high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. The pandemic prompted some countries to prioritize finding ways to alleviate and prevent air pollution, including encouraging people to wear face masks. The UK government has invested £42 million, or about $51.6 million, to fund research and innovation in this area through 2025. This increased attention from legislators has emboldened new startups to look at the problem in closer detail. And the technologies they're developing allow customers to analyze their environments at the molecular level. Personal air-cleaning devices are taking off Jay Vitale, the CEO of Air For Life, a company developing filterless, dual-ionization technology, has been focused on fighting air pollution for more than 15 years. Advertisement Advertisement \"The general attitude of the public after COVID has made people a lot more health-conscious, including more interest in air purifiers and also the effects of air quality and the impacts on health,\" he said. The company, based in Milton Keynes in the UK, has been developing its tech with a specific focus on helping people relieve symptoms from asthma and allergies, with the goal of reducing people's use of medication. The Air For Life technology creates \"human-friendly\" negative ions — which a study published in 2018 in the National Library of Medicine found eliminated impurities in the air and on surfaces — within an enclosed space. Vitale, a graduate of King's College London's medical school, said: \"When negative ions collide with any impurities in the air, such as pollutants, bacteria, viruses, and allergens, they attach to the impurity and destroy it or demobilize it at a molecular level, thus purifying the air and the surfaces inside an indoor space.\" This level of air-quality control is gaining popularity as large-scale pollution events such as smog and forest fires affect more people every year. Advertisement Advertisement \"The industry is shifting towards smart devices and smart technology, where people want to physically see the performance of a product which they are buying to improve their health with measurable indicators or statistics,\" Vitale said. Inspired by nature Negative ions can be found in high concentrations in sea air, in mountain air, and near waterfalls, places typically thought to have the cleanest air. Vitale said exposure to negative ions could increase serotonin levels in the brain, which would help alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression, as well as improve sleep quality. Vitale said these ions had also been found to be effective at destroying impurities as small as 0.001 microns, including viruses, and are reported to eliminate bad odors, dust, pet dander, and even mold. Traditional air purifiers, which use high-efficiency-particulate-absorbing filters or a combination of HEPA filters and ionizing technology, can filter impurities only up to 0.3 microns, so they don't account for all small bacteria or viruses. Apart from the difference in precision, Vitale said there's also the cost of replacing traditional filters, which his company's technology avoids. Instead, he said, his company's devices contain cartridges equipped with a UV light that can be replaced yearly. Advertisement Advertisement Each device has a built-in fan that draws air into the unit. The company says the technology works by passing air through a UV lamp that destroys contaminants as they pass through. At the same time, the UV light shines on the nanoparticle catalyst, which causes a reaction that releases negative ions. Clean air in your pocket Another new arrival in the air-purification market is a wearable air purifier called the Air Shield Mini. Launched in October and available to order now, the device is the brainchild of Christiaan Trahms, a 34-year-old tech entrepreneur. The product's 10-year development process was deeply personal for Trahms, who was born in South Africa and moved to London in 2008. He was horrified by the effect the city's air had on his health, he told Insider. \"I first noticed the taste of the air in the back of my throat and lungs and the impact it had on my breathing,\" Trahms said. \"But whenever I left and returned to London, I became aware of other effects — London's air was making me more irritable and more tired.\" Advertisement Advertisement Back then, the only machines capable of cleaning air effectively were immovable, industrial units. So Trahms wondered, \"What if you could take the ability to breathe clean air with you?\" He started to develop a portable purifier, and he recognized its market potential after the pandemic hit. The Air Shield Mini is small and light — just 5 centimeters wide and weighing the same as a AA battery. Trahms said the device emitted a constant stream of millions of negative ions, which bind to pollutants — or agglomerate — rather than destroy them. As a result of the process, you get larger clusters of particles that are now too heavy to remain airborne. They then fall to the ground or onto nearby surfaces, keeping them well away from the user. Trahms said the Air Shield Mini was powerful enough to generate a 3-foot-wide bubble of purified air around the wearer. The purifier is also silent, and its battery lasts 12 hours on a single charge, he said. The path forward There are still some regulatory issues around clean-air tech. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration began regulating air purifiers after the COVID-19 pandemic hit; its guidance on those devices is in flux. They remain unregulated in the UK, according to Nicola Carslaw, a professor of indoor-air chemistry at the University of York. Advertisement Advertisement \"Anyone buying such a device has to rely on information provided by the manufacturer to determine how efficiently it removes pollutants,\" she said. \"The devices tend to be tested under carefully controlled laboratory conditions rather than in a typical, occupied building. The issue of secondary pollutant formation is often not addressed, and advice on where an air-cleaning device should be placed for best results is often absent.\" Still, Trahms is optimistic. He said this sort of technology looked set to take off in a big way: \"Many people have become accustomed to it in the workplace and at home, and I think the time is right to give them the power to breathe better-quality air wherever they go.\" Sign up for notifications from Insider!

    "originBody": "HomeCarbon NewsClimate-Tech Startups Amass $7.6B in Q3, Setting New Record for VC Funding November 8, 2023 Updated: 9 hours Climate-Tech Startups Amass $7.6B in Q3, Setting New Record for VC Funding By Jennifer L ShareFacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedinEmailPrint Copy URL Climate-tech startups focusing on carbon and emissions technology garnered $7.6 billion in venture capital (VC) funding in the third quarter this year, surpassing the sector’s prior record by $1.8 billion and opposing the downturn trend in fundraising. The surge in climate-tech companies during the quarter was propelled by a series of large financing rounds supporting the construction of factories, aided by government incentives. The Spike in Carbon & Emissions Tech VC Funding According to PitchBook’s Q3 2023 Carbon & Emissions Tech Report, H2 Green Steel closed $1.6 billion in an early-stage round. The company uses hydrogen from renewable sources in making steel. Redwood Materials, a lithium battery recycling company, secured a $997.2 million in Series D round. Apart from strong VC deal value for both the manufacturing & chemicals and lithium battery recycling company categories, green mining also witnessed the highest ever quarter for VC value. It saw $394.9 million across eleven deals analyzed. Quarterly VC Funding in Carbon and Emissions Tech A major factor in the spike in deal value is various large deals in the vertical. Government assistance offers significantly more non-dilutive financial support for decarbonization firms compared to other sectors. This enables climate-tech experts to sidestep the fundraising challenges that have affected a large portion of the VC industry. The 1-year-old US Inflation Reduction Act has facilitated substantial advancements in areas such as green hydrogen, electric vehicle supply chains, direct air carbon (DAC) capture, and renewable electric grid infrastructure. What further drives the growth is automobile companies going full for electric vehicles. Highlighting this trend, a founder of an impact investor firm noted that: “There’s a natural, inevitable scale-up that’s coming from battery technology in response to an industry that’s fully embraced becoming completely electric.” RELATED: Battery Startups Attract Mega-Investments Most of the notable transactions completed in Q3 were aimed at facilitating the construction or establishment of new manufacturing facilities. Both the burgeoning sectors of green mining and energy efficiency for buildings experienced their most lucrative quarters for VC deal value. In contrast to sectors like SaaS and fintech, where investors have recalibrated their outlooks following the swift up-rounds of 2021, appraisals for decarbonization enterprises have maintained a relatively steady course. Pre-seed, seed, and late-stage companies have all reported increased median pre-money valuations in 2023 compared to the previous year. Here are the details as per Pitchbook data: Pre-seed and seed funding increased from $2.0 million to $2.3 million Early-stage VC funding decreased from $5.6 million to $4.1 million Late-stage VC funding increased from $9.2 million to $10.7 million Venture growth funding increased from $11.7 million to $14.5 million The Force Behind Climate-Tech Firms Defying VC Trend VCs are particularly enthusiastic about low-carbon mineral mining and DAC. This is driven by the growing demand for mineral resources and carbon removal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Notably, large companies like Amazon and JP Morgan have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in carbon dioxide removal credits. Other tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft also did the same support for CDR credits. Moreover, the recent allocation of $7 billion in federal funding for renewable hydrogen hubs across the United States revealed in mid-October, has sustained the inflow of federal funds. RELATED: US DOE’s $7B Clean Hydrogen Hub Grant: The 7 Chosen Ones This record-setting quarter comes after two lackluster quarters for climate-tech fundraising had raised concerns about a potential slowdown impacting green emerging technologies. Add to this the disruption caused by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, prompting companies to tap lenders for financing. Despite the broader VC fundraising slowdown, carbon and emissions startups seem undeterred in securing substantial funding as seen above. Median deal sizes in various stages, from pre-seed to venture growth, have all experienced increases in 2023 compared to the previous year. The impetus for climate-tech startups also stems from the escalating impact of climate change. According to climate experts, 2023 would be the hottest year since at least 1940. As what the founder of SecondMuse further said, the “changing climate is just getting more real for more people”. This is evidenced by the growing presence of family offices supporting climate-tech companies. Despite concerns of a slowdown, climate-tech startups surged in Q3, setting records in VC funding. The sector’s growth is driven by government support and a rising focus on carbon reduction technologies.

    "originBody": "News Unlocking Capital for Sustainability How tech companies can fund and scale climate projects in APAC Technology can play a crucial role in helping communities respond to climate-related issues. Google.org recently announced that it is committing another US$5 million to the AVPN's APAC Sustainability Seed Fund to support Asia-based non-profits to address key environmental challenges. Marija Ralic, Google.org lead, Google APAC speaking at the closing plenary of the Unlocking Capital for Sustainability event organised by Eco-Business. She said that investing in technology driven solutions for the long term is important for creating positive impacts. Image: Eco-Business https://eb.news/sqHUTq6XSL-A Copy Brought to you by: By Raja Aiman 5 minute read Nov. 9, 2023 As the world grapples with the impact of climate change – which saw catastrophic floods, devastating forest fires and brutal heat waves continue wreaking havoc across the planet this year – the need to help vulnerable communities worldwide to quickly adapt is now greater than ever. Google, through initiatives supported by its philanthropic arm – Google.org – has been funding artificial intelligence (AI) projects led by social impact organisations that are aimed at helping communities tackle not only climate-related but also medical and social issues. “It is important to engage these local communities and give them a voice, so that they can be part of the solution,” said Marija Ralic, Google.org lead, Google APAC, who was speaking at the closing plenary of the Unlocking Capital for Sustainability event, an annual summit focused on sustainable finance, held in September. “Often, the people who are closest to the problem know what the solutions are, and what works for them.” For instance, one key problem faced by the cotton farming communities in India is pest control. Up to 30 per cent of cotton crops are destroyed each year by pests such as the pink bollworm, leading to loss of yield and affecting the livelihoods of millions of rural households in India that depend on cotton farming. Most Indian cotton farmers are smallholders who lack the resources to adopt effective pest management systems. Mumbai-based not-for-profit organisation Wadhwani AI sought to find a solution. In 2019, Wadhwani AI received a US$2 million grant under Google’s AI for Social Good programme from Google.org to develop an app that uses AI to identify pests, recommend mitigation strategies and advise farmers on how to reduce pesticide use. “They needed more support, so our Google fellows worked with them full-time over six months to bring their solution to life,” said Ralic, referring to Google employees working within a pro bono capacity, to support Wadhwani AI with their initiative. The project has, so far, delivered promising results. “[Wadhwani AI] has helped smallholder farmers to reduce their use of expensive pesticides, safeguard their crops and improve their profit by over 20 per cent,” added Ralic. To further build on this positive impact, Wadhwani AI received an additional US$3.3 million grant from Google.org in 2022 as part of the AI for the Global Goals project, a US$25 million initiative specifically aimed at projects that use AI to accelerate progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “This grant allows them to partner with the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in India, so they can scale [their pest control solution] for billions of people in India,” Ralic said. Ralic added that Google.org also looks at whether projects helping underserved communities are both feasible and scalable. She noted that social impact organisations should have access to the local underserved communities to understand the challenges they are facing. Driving long-term sustainability solutions in APAC Asia Pacific is especially vulnerable to climate change. From 2008 to 2020, the region accounted for 80 per cent of the total global new displacements related to disasters, becoming the world’s most climate-vulnerable region in both slow-onset and sudden-onset events, according to a 2023 UNESCO report. “When we talk about an equitable transition, it means that everyone benefits from a shift to a cleaner economy, and it also means investing in communities most vulnerable to climate change,” said Kate Brandt, chief sustainability officer at Google, during her keynote speech at Unlocking Capital for Sustainability. Brandt announced that Google.org was committing another US$5 million to support the APAC Sustainability Seed Fund, which was launched last year by the Asian Venture Philanthropy Network (AVPN) in partnership with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The fund provides grants to non-profit organisations to fight climate change and drive sustainability in Asia Pacific (APAC). “The APAC region is diverse,” said Ralic, referring to how organisations in the region are at varying stages of technology know-how. Ralic added that Google.org is supporting these organisations through a two-pronged approach. The first approach is to support organisations’ innovative technology solutions, noted Ralic, highlighting that the APAC Sustainability Seed Fund allocated grant funding to 13 local organisations focused on sustainability solutions for vulnerable and underserved communities in Asia Pacific. The second approach is to help social impact organisations that are keen to leverage innovative technology but are unsure where to start and how to use it for their organisations. “We support them through capacity-building programmes so they can learn how to leverage AI technology to suit their purposes,” said Ralic. “It is really important that we keep supporting these organisations’ innovative solutions that, in the long term, will have a positive impact on local communities.” Forward-looking finance Blended finance, or the strategic use of public finance to mobilise private finance, can be an effective way to unlock funding for climate investments that are seen as too risky. Speaking at the closing plenary panel, Zia Nariman, senior investor officer and Asia Pacific Climate Lead, International Finance Cooperation, said that a significant amount of blended finance is needed. “We need to be judicious in the use of blended finance,” Nariman stressed. “It needs to play a role where we are pushing the envelope and supporting technologies that are currently not scalable or cost-competitive, like battery storage.” Another panellist, Leticia Guimarães, lead, carbon markets; climate hub, United Nations Development Programme, noted: “We need to understand the ecosystem of the different players [involved in blended finance] so we can better position each of them.” There is a need to better measure the impact of initiatives as not all of them bring immediate results, she added. Naina Subberwal Batra, chief executive officer of AVPN, noted that blended finance must take on a balanced role. “We can’t keep saying that philanthropy will take on the biggest burden just because it is the ‘catalytic capital available for the first loss,’” said Batra, referring to investments provided by an investor or grantmaker who agrees to bear first losses to incentivise the participation of co-investors that would not have otherwise entered the deal. While philanthropists can catalyse change, the actual scaling of it takes place through partnerships, said Ralic. She added that there is a need for both “risk-taking” philanthropy that supports bold, AI-driven solutions, as well as “patient” philanthropy. “For positive change to happen, it really takes time,” Ralic concluded. “We need to be comfortable with change. Sometimes that means we need to learn new things and unlearn some things.” Did you find this article useful? Join the EB Circle!
