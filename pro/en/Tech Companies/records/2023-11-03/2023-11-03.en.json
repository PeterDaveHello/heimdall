REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Companies Amazon.com Inc Follow Meta Platforms Inc Follow LONDON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said on Friday it had accepted commitments from tech companies Meta (META.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) to help protect fair competition on their retail platforms. The commitments from the U.S. tech giants mark the end of the Competition & Markets Authority's (CMA) investigation into Amazon Marketplace and Meta's use of advertising data. Amazon has committed to not use rival sellers' marketplace data to gain an unfair advantage, ensuring that third-party marketplace sellers can compete on a level-playing field, the CMA said.

While Meta signed commitments to prevent it from \"exploiting\" its advertising customers' data, resulting in competitors that advertise on its platforms having the ability to \"opt out\" of their data being used to improve Facebook Marketplace.

CMA in July had said that Amazon's offer to change the way it treats third-party sellers using its Marketplace platform addresses competition concerns in its preliminary view.

You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. 0 Nov 3, 2023,08:00am EDT Ariela Safira raised Real's first fundraising round before transitioning from a brick-and-mortar to a virtual business. COURTESY OF REAL Think this is nice? It’s a version of the weekly Under 30 newsletter and would be even better in your inbox. Shocked it’s already November? Us too. But in the spirit of a month known for being thankful, we’re highlighting the young entrepreneurs who have made giving back their M.O. Take Prepared, whose cofounders are on a mission to keep citizens safe. Michael Chime, 25, Dylan Gleicher, 25, and Neal Soni, 23, are building cloud-enabled technologies used by safety dispatch centers. The tech allows 911 callers to share video, photo and livestreams to better describe and act in moments of crisis. They just closed a $16 million Series A, which you can read about here. And they aren’t the only impact-driven company that’s seen success. In fact, the impact investing space is on the rise across the board. Angela Lee, a professor at Columbia Business School and the founder of investment fund 37 Angels, says the growing number of Millennial and Gen Z fund managers and LPs—part of generations who deeply care about many of these social issues—is igniting a wave of impact investments, rising more than 50% year over year. That rings true for Ariela Safira, a 2022 Under 30 Social Impact lister and the founder of Real, who has raised $53 million for her mental health app. Real started as a brick-and-mortar concept for those seeking group therapy, says Safira. But when Covid hit and upended those plans, she and her team pivoted to a digital model. A one-month Covid offering of free virtual therapy showed them a surprising void in the market. “That ended up teaching us, unexpectedly, that a unique take on digital care is far more preferred by people,” she says. “What people wanted was to join group therapy with their videos off and their names hidden… people would say, ‘I want to hear what this issue looks like for other people and I want a therapist to give me actionable tools to work through this issue. I just don't want anyone to know I'm here.’” That ignited Real’s move to a platform that offers daily mental health tools and practices—both for maintenance and crisis resolution—all backed by staff clinicians. The tech platform allows customers to use it at their preferred pace and create a daily habit of it. “A digital model will drive scale, will drive affordability, will drive early intervention,” she says. And, it drove investment dollars. Because while investors are increasingly interested in impact-investing, “what all investors are looking for is highly scalable businesses,” Lee says. “And tech companies, by definition, tend to be highly scalable.” Safira ensures that the IRL and the virtual versions of Real are entirely different businesses—with different risks, opportunities and types of investors. But the virtual version had greater growth potential: “The digital model is certainly one that is more favorable to fundraise against.” Want some more inspo? Take a look at last year’s Under 30 Social Impact list here. Until next week, Taylor Swift’s New Era: The Pop Star Becomes A Billionaire Billionaire (Taylor's Version): Rules, what rules? Music's new icon did it her way. MATT WINKELMEYER/GETTY IMAGES Under 30 alum Taylor Swift appeared on Forbes’ list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women this summer with a net worth of $360 million. Now, she’s reached billionaire status. Her Era’s tour, which kicked off in March, has already brought in $780 million in ticket sales and is on its way to becoming the highest-grossing tour of all time. Lister Lowdown -Solugen, a climate tech company founded by 2017 Under 30 listers Gaurab Chakrabati and Sean Hunt, announced a partnership with animal and human nutrition giant ADM this week. Since its founding in 2016, the unicorn startup has produced plant-based chemicals that can be used for everything from cleaning products to growing agriculture, significantly reducing carbon footprints for its clients and partners. Under the agreement, Solugen will build a new 500,000-square-foot biomanufacturing facility alongside ADM’s corn complex in Minnesota and employ ADM’s resources toward scaling and improving their products, such as personal care items and construction materials. -Under 30 Europe lister Sam Amrani’s newly launched geospatial intelligence company, Pass_by, acquired two other geospatial companies, Tamoco (of which Armani was a cofounder) and Olvin, last month for $50 million. Pass_by will leverage the other companies’ tools to scale its main product—historical and predictive data and analytics on global geography, including foot traffic in highly specific locations, that other businesses can purchase. Billionaire Thor Bjorgolfsson led the funding for the acquisition, along with other investments by Brainchild Ventures, Untapped Capital and actor Rob Lowe. -Women’s healthcare company Gameto, founded by 2023 Under 30 Healthcare lister Dina Radenkovic, released a study last month showing the efficacy of their fertility treatment. It was shown to require fewer injections and in less time than traditional In Vitro Fertilization (IVF): up to three days versus the typical 14 days. This study will aid the company in its expansion through various healthcare systems like Australia, Latin America, and eventually the U.S. Under 30 On-Air 2022 Under 30 Food & Drink lister Alexis Nikole Nelson (known as @BlackForager on Instagram and @alexisnikole on TikTok) has racked up nearly 6 million followers on social media by foraging for plants and berries around her home in Columbus, Ohio. Here’s how the comedic creator is racking up accolades—from an upcoming book to a James Beard award to a Jimmy Kimmel spot. Watch the full-mini doc below: Mental Health Minute Building a startup can be incredibly stressful. Somewhere between creating pitch decks, managing a team and trying to win over customers, founders might forget that they’re more than just a company. So how do you protect your peace and run a business? Take a minute to hear from our Under 30 listers about their personal journeys with mental health and how they keep sane. Up this week: Ed Gaussen, a 2023 Under 30 Healthcare lister and founder of Mantra Health, which provides mental health services to students at colleges including Penn State, MIT and Cornell University. The startup has raised $34 million in total funding. What’s one thing you do regularly for your mental wellbeing? I think that mental wellbeing is achieved through a combination of factors, but exercising is one I tend to be the most consistent with. Beyond the typical, known benefits of exercising, what I love the most about it is the ability to disconnect after spending hours of my day looking at a screen. There's also the social benefit of it which ties to mental wellbeing (I play a lot of tennis). How often does your business take a toll on your mental health? Pretty much every week. I regularly work on detaching my self-worth to the success of Mantra—but when you dedicate a certain level of time and passion to your work, that can be really hard. What’s your best advice for managing mental health as a founder? Do not disconnect from your support system and isolate. I don't network and make connections as much as I used to in my role as a VC, but there's a set group of friends and family members that I try to be very proactive in reaching out to and keeping in touch with. Make time in your day to reach out—I like to do this on my commute to work. What about as a leader? How do you encourage your teams to take charge of their wellbeing? One of our five values is to \"take care of yourself so you can care for others.” Those last two words are very important. We think that people doing all the right things to recharge their batteries outside of work allows them to show up at 100% for our university partners, patients, and providers. We try not to be overly prescriptive, but make sure to lead by example, celebrate people who live into that value and check in on each other. Do you think the entrepreneurial community does a satisfactory job at talking about mental health? What cultural norms still need to change? I've appreciated seeing an increasing amount of founders talking about their mental health—you see a lot of LinkedIn posts about it. The question often is who holds the founders accountable for this? I think board members and VCs have a role to play–some of them are hiring executive coaches in-house to support portfolio founders, which I commend.

More companies are prioritizing sustainability tech but face challenges implementing it November 02, 2023 With carbon reduction deadlines looming and regulations tightening, more businesses are adopting fast-evolving technologies to measure, monitor and manage their emissions and guide future sustainability decisions. Sustainability technologies will account for the biggest share of increased tech budgets for both occupiers and investors over the next three years, according to JLL’s survey of 1,000 companies. Over two thirds of occupiers say tech that helps them to manage and report on their sustainability progress is a top budget priority. Read more AI and the evolution of proptech September 12, 2023 How real estate is raising its data game May 30, 2023 Why disability access is a rising focus for companies December 16, 2022 Globally, 45% of occupiers and 62% of investors surveyed plan to adopt energy or emissions management tech in the coming year. Another 62% of investors are interested in tech that supports sustainability monitoring and reporting while evaluating climate risk in portfolio planning is an emerging area. “Tech is a critical enabler for companies to better understand how they’re doing in terms of their net zero goals through from flagging risks in their portfolio to monitoring their day-to-day operations,” says Ramya Ravichandar, Vice President, Technology Platforms - Smart & Sustainable Buildings at JLL. “There’s now a mature market to address companies’ sustainability reporting and management needs and ensure they can comply with incoming public disclosure regulations such as California’s new Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act.” Implementing tech successfully As more businesses invest in sustainability technologies across their real estate portfolio, they’re grappling with the practicalities of integrating them. One hurdle to the implementation of these technologies is that many businesses lack a concrete roadmap. “Successfully integrating these technologies into real estate is a challenge faced by companies in every industry,” says Yuehan Wang, Global Research Associate, Real Estate Technology at JLL. “Even large companies may lack a feasible technology strategy that addresses how to make procurement decisions, ensure the tech is correctly used by employees, and scale it across a portfolio.” The number of companies adopting data science and modelling tools, which are used to analyze occupancy, energy use and financial costs across buildings and locations, for example, jumped by 14% to 40% between 2020 and 2023, JLL’s survey shows. Yet a lack of standardized data across smart building systems remains a stumbling block for many businesses. To extract accurate insights about their real estate’s carbon footprint, companies need to merge information from various systems, from HVAC (heating, ventilation and cooling) to waste management. However, these systems are often siloed, making it difficult to integrate data, while companies may lack the tools or expertise to gather and analyze building data effectively. “The hardest problem for real estate to overcome is the many data silos that must be integrated for buildings to operate efficiently, especially when some buildings may be 50 or 60 years old with outdated systems,” says Ravichandar. Driving value from tech investments Companies might make up skillset gaps by increasing collaborations with external partners to deliver on their technology vision, a strategy adopted by over 60% of JLL survey respondents. However, to drive value from sustainability tech investments, companies need to clarify their objectives and how they will deliver on their targets, says Wang. “Businesses should define what they need to achieve with sustainability technology, set benchmarks for success, and understand which products on the market are best suited to their operations and goals,” she adds. Training is also paramount to ensure different teams correctly use and benefit from sustainability tech. “Sustainability tech has to reach everyone from the boiler room to the boardroom,” says Ravichandar. C-suite executives for example, will focus on net zero progress while landlords may concentrate on tenant satisfaction and facilities teams want more effective day-to-day operations. For companies that get it right, there are substantial boons to operating costs and environmental impact. Using JLL’s AI-powered platform Hank, which dynamically optimizes HVAC systems based on real-time user requirements, a leading UK investment management firm achieved an ROI of 708% and cut energy use by 59% in their 11,600 square meter office building. This reduced carbon emissions by up to 500 metric tons per year. Another company in financial services ran data analysis to identify energy-saving initiatives, using of data visualizations to support clearer reporting and better decision-making. These measures contributed to savings of US $664,158 in a single building that was flagged as having high energy consumption. Such measures can equally bring additional benefits through areas such as tenant wellbeing. “Sustainability is not stand-alone. Optimizing a building also positively impacts the employee experience and workforce health and wellbeing, creating opportunities for businesses to align multiple corporate objectives when they invest in sustainability,” says Wang. The role of AI Right now, AI is in its infancy in real estate, but as it continues to evolve, it will play an increasingly pivotal role in tackling the sizeable carbon footprint of real estate. Generative AI could catalyze the integration of sustainability technologies into both buildings and operational workflows, for example, by making these technologies more accessible through user-friendly interfaces that help people understand and engage with data insights. This could accelerate the critical smart building transformation that underpins more sustainable real estate. “In recent years, building owners have been experimenting with sensors, digital infrastructure and other smart tech. AI capabilities could bring about the tipping point by making it easier and more efficient to tap the benefits of these technologies,” says Wang. This, in turn, would have big implications for the speed and scope of real estate’s decarbonization. “Technology is, quite simply, core to real estate’s decarbonization,” says Ravichandar. “Today’s technology is already making a difference but as it develops and becomes integral to how buildings function, it will lower real estate’s emissions on a macro scale.” Looking for more insights?

Musk previously said that it is possible AI “goes wrong and destroys humanity.” According to its website, xAI seeks to “understand the true nature of the universe.” The company posted in August that it was hiring creators, teachers and curators. The team was asking for people to direct message “evidence of your most exceptional work.” While a lot of the company’s technology is still unknown to the public, it’s expected that it will likely resemble and compete with other AI technologies like OpenAI, Google and Amazon, which all have their own leading chatbot technologies that have become extremely popular with the public in the last year. According to a statement from the company, the team is comprised of alumni of other companies DeepMind, OpenAI, Google Research, Microsoft Research and Tesla. The statement said team members contributed to some of the “most widely used methods in the field” and have worked on and led the “development of some of the largest breakthroughs in the field.” Greg Yang, the co-founder of xAI, posted online that the technology he had been developing will be central “to taking AI to the next level.” For the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.

    "title": "Implications of Canada's New Digital Services Tax on Global Tech Giants and Market Relations",

    "originBody": "Skip to main content Experts Events Briefing Book Resources About Contact Support Fiscal Facts Twitter Facebook Topics TaxVox Blog Research & Commentary Laws & Proposals Model Estimates Statistics Features TaxVox: Business Taxes RSS The voices of Tax Policy Center's researchers and staff Renu Zaretsky November 3, 2023 O Canada! What Might Its Digital Services Tax Mean For Us? Last month, my husband ran the Detroit Free Press Marathon. During the race, runners left Detroit and crossed the Ambassador Bridge into Windsor in Ontario, Canada, traveled a few miles, and returned to the US through the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel. It’s a nice example of seamless international cooperation, which makes sense given the close relationship between Canada and the US. But our friendship is now under strain because of a tax. Canada plans to impose a 3 percent digital services tax (DST) on Jan. 1. Americans might not notice the DST as we scroll through apps or click “buy” online, but we would notice the trade war it might prompt. Over the past decade, absent a global agreement on how best to collect tax revenue from multinational tech firms, countries started planning or imposing DSTs, levies on revenue-generating activities conducted online. They often target large American firms like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Uber, and Airbnb. These US corporations often have subsidiaries headquartered in lower-tax jurisdictions but still do a lot of business within higher-tax countries’ borders. Those countries want to maximize their corporate tax revenue with DSTs. A global treaty brokered by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) would seek to replace all of these DSTs in 2025 with a more comprehensive set of corporate tax rules. Participating countries, including Canada, agreed in 2021 to a two-year OECD moratorium on DSTs until the treaty takes effect. This summer, the OECD extended its moratorium by one year. That’s one year too long for Canada. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada cannot wait, arguing the planned DST is in the country’s national interest. Canada’s Parliamentary Budget Office estimates its DST could raise CA$7.2 billion ($5.3 billion) over five years beginning in January. Since the tax is retroactive to 2022, big tech companies would start the year owing over $1 billion. The tax will apply to companies with at least €750 million ($793 million) in total revenue and Canadian digital services revenue exceeding CA$20 million ($13 million). Digital services revenue comes from online marketplace services, online advertising services, and other web-based activities. The cost of a DST will likely fall on consumers of those services. That could include Canadian sellers using Amazon’s online marketplace or Canadian businesses that advertise online. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce says that Canadians would also feel the DST in the form of higher prices for digital services like renting a movie or booking a vacation cottage. Some worry that by acting alone and moving ahead with its DST, Canada could put the global treaty effort at risk. And the US is still at work to make its inclusion in the OECD effort possible. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has already indicated that it is not ready to sign on to the framework this year. If negotiations take too long, other countries might join Canada and ignore the DST moratorium. There’s another problem. The US accounts for 73 percent of all of Canada’s exports. Aaron Wudrick, the director of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute’s Domestic Policy Program, notes that the Canadian government “seems willing to jeopardize a trade relationship worth around $2 billion per day to implement a ham-fisted tax that would raise less than $1 billion annually.” On the other hand, Wei Cui, a tax law professor at the University of British Columbia, told The New York Times that “Canada has come up with a principled way of levying the tax that should not provoke a trade controversy” since Canadian online retailers would be taxed just like American companies. Big Tech often serves as a handy political boogeyman, but Canada’s DST could affect more than big tech companies. A US analysis of France’s now-suspended DST reveals the retroactive application of the tax “is unusual and inconsistent with prevailing tax principles and renders the tax particularly burdensome for covered US companies, which will also affect their customers, including US small businesses and consumers.” Indeed, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai has stressed that if Canada proceeds with the tax—which the US argues unfairly discriminates against US companies—the US would be left with no choice but to take retaliatory measures. The feeling appears to be bipartisan. Last month, Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Ranking Member Mike Crapo (R-ID) subsequently urged Tai to make it especially clear that the US will “immediately respond using available trade tools upon Canada’s enactment of any DST.” That could include US tariffs on Canadian exports, anything from steel, cars, lumber, paper, meat, or dairy. In a trade war, there are rarely winners, only losers. Are we ready for it? Or will the next two months see trade negotiations successfully ease US-Canada tension over a DST? Policymakers might need to pick up their pace. It’s a sprint now, not a marathon.

    "title": "Addressing Tech Giants' Power Through User Awareness and Data Privacy Measures",
    "originLink": "https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/big-tech-responsibility-society/",
    "originBody": "PIA Homepage Privacy News Contact The Golden Rule of Big Tech’s Social Responsibility Posted on Nov 3, 2023 by Arline Groenewald Have you ever played a game of Monopoly and realized you started abusing your power halfway through the game? It might have seemed innocent at first, but that’s what power will do to you — before you know it, you’re corrupted. Despite potentially losing an invite to the next game night, though, it’s not really a big deal. Tech giants like Alphabet Inc., Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon are playing a much bigger game, and their decisions — and their power — have real consequences. Whether you notice it or not, these consequences affect you. The internet and the devices we use to connect to it are an indispensable part of how we work, talk to each other, shop, gather information, and entertain ourselves. It’s obvious society has benefited from big tech companies, but they don’t exist for anyone’s benefit: their goal is to make money. A growing list of big tech companies now hold higher market caps and have more influence than entire countries. What helped them achieve this? The answer is scary: they have constant access to our private lives. Do companies use their immense power for good, or responsibly? Let’s look at how tech giants play their high-stakes game, and how social responsibility has become a corporate issue. Blurring the Lines Between Virtual and Reality: Short-Sightedness Causes Harm It’s easy to think of what happens online as separate from our real lives because it exists in a space we can’t physically exist in. However, their impact is immense: our online experiences influence the way we think, speak, and even behave. Logically, whoever owns these spaces and devices has immense control over what information we have access to, and by extent, how we think and what we do. Sometimes the consequences are unintended. Companies like Meta and TikTok didn’t invent their content algorithms intending to bombard people with negative news, influence people’s political views, or create unrealistic standards. Yet that’s exactly what happened — doom scrolling is now a national pastime, the political divide keeps getting wider, and social media is worsening mental health problems. It isn’t always accidental, though. Companies have been found intentionally using their power to sway political and economic structures in their favor. Some also force out competition and stifle innovations that threaten their status quo. Then there’s the big tech elephant in the room (although, really, it’s more like a vulture spying over your shoulder): big tech profits off people’s personal lives by selling the vast amounts of data it collects or using that data to predict and influence a wide range of behaviors. All this happens in the name of chasing short-term profits. It’s no secret. We’re all too aware of the vulture in the room with us, but somehow privacy has been sold as priceless to the rich and worthless to the people whose lives are collected for profit. Things are changing, though. Digital privacy has become a hot topic worldwide in the last couple of years, and clearly, governments are taking notice. Following the Breadcrumbs: A Trail of Lawsuits If you look up any big tech company, chances are good you’ll find at least one regulatory probe or lawsuit aimed at its practices. In recent years, countries and bodies like the US, the UK, and the EU seem to have ramped up their efforts to investigate how big tech companies conduct business — especially in terms of how these decisions affect society. Look at some of the more high-profile cases from 2023 alone: Judges closed an FTC suit against Meta in April 2023 that, among other things, tried to revert its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC accused Meta of conducting “anti-competitive practices, like buying up or cutting off rivals that threatened its monopoly, for years.” The judges ruled it was too late to revert these decisions. The FTC and 17 state attorneys general launched a lawsuit against Amazon in September 2023, accusing it of predatory marketplace practices. According to the case, Amazon uses “a set of interlocking anticompetitive and unfair strategies” to block competition, inflate prices, prevent sellers from lowering prices, and degrade quality for shoppers. A class action lawsuit filed in the UK in September 2023, claims Google manipulated its dominant position in search engine results, costing consumers and contributing to the cost of living crisis. According to the suit, the company has used various practices to stifle competition allowing it to charge advertisers more. Advertisers then passed these costs on to consumers. Despite winning its legal battle against Epic Games earlier in 2023, the App Store is under fire again. In September, payment card issuers filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple for “coercing” people into using the Apple Pay mobile wallet over alternatives. The plaintiffs claim this has harmed consumers by stifling innovation, increasing prices, and “minimizing the incentive to make Apple Pay safer and easier to use.” Multiple similar lawsuits are still ongoing today, against these and other big tech companies. While not all of them make it to trial or lead to a favorable ruling for the accusers, these lawsuits still touch on something important. They highlight how the decisions made by these companies can affect you and me — the average person who relies on this technology every day. Big Tech Companies Are Constantly Changing Society In 2020, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Apple appeared before Congress after a year-long investigation by lawmakers which concluded they had “wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand.” While the main focus of that hearing was whether existing antitrust laws are sufficiently keeping big tech companies in check, committee members also questioned how the companies managed speech and expression on their platforms. Interestingly, tech companies often say that big tech is unfairly targeted and constantly scrutinized by politicians. Regardless of the political intent behind those lawmakers’ questions, it’s almost definitely right that they’re asking them. Big tech companies have direct control over how we gain information, learn new ideas, and share our thoughts. Shouldn’t something with that much power be under constant scrutiny? It’s true that sometimes the anger these companies face is misplaced. No entity can account for every unintended problem it causes, and many politicians point fingers out of self-interest. None of this changes the fact that tech giants have now become more influential than whole countries. They hold decision-making powers that can affect the global market and social stability. Thanks to corporate lobbying, big tech companies can even use their deep pockets to change laws and determine government priorities. “The problem we face today is that innovation is happening so fast and reshaping entire industries overnight that the negative externalities can be like flash floods,” says Adam Kleinberg, CEO of advertising agency Traction. That level of power should be held accountable. Can Tech Giants Be Held in Check? You know that old saying about an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object? So far, big tech companies have managed to simply push through any form of resistance in their paths. What’s it going to take to stop that monolithic force? You could argue that capitalism has a system of checks and balances built into it. Things will sort themselves out as competitors work to keep each other in check. It’s a nice thought. Except, remember that game of Monopoly your friends are still angry about? Because it should have clued you in: there isn’t space for anyone else when you own the whole street. Tech giants have become so big that new competitors just don’t have the funds or resources to stop their astronomical growth anymore. How do you oppose an entity that is part of how society functions, knows everything about you, and can manipulate the world around you in ways you can’t even see? Our only option is to focus on responsibility — and not just big tech’s responsibility, but every person’s responsibility too. The Long Arm of the Law May Have Reached Its Limit Many big tech companies are currently facing flash floods of their own in the form of lawsuits. Yet lawsuits clearly haven’t been all that effective in reining in bad decision-making on the part of big tech companies to date. They pay a few million dollars in fines and go on to make billions more that same year. Even when competitors like Epic Games and others try to take them on, the legal system lets them down. So if punishment isn’t as effective as we’d hoped, we’re left with no option but to keep playing the game. This isn’t board game night, though. We can change the rules. As an example, research shows that companies with effective Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs are more profitable than those without them. This led companies to switch tactics and started changing their policies and getting involved in charity. To date, though, companies have treated CSR as more of a vanity marketing tactic than anything else. Most do just enough to make themselves look good without worrying about whether they actually create a positive impact on society. If companies are getting by pretending to be responsible, it’s because no one is actually holding them accountable. Netizen: Your Social Responsibility Counts Too Corporations aren’t people and don’t have a conscience, but they’re kept alive by people like you and me. It’s up to corporate leaders to be mindful and make decisions that both benefit a company and minimize its negative consequences to society. Unfortunately, companies tend to ignore this responsibility until it affects their bottom line. “Ignorance is bliss until it’s not. Technology companies that do not assess the impact of their work are prioritizing shareholders and stakeholders over consequences,” says Brian Solis, principal analyst at Altimeter Group. When leaders don’t make mindful decisions, the responsibility to apply these consequences falls on us. As a citizen of society, you have fundamental rights. These rights are hard-won and they come with responsibilities too — because what you do affects the world around you. The internet may be virtual, but it’s still us, at its core. We’ve become a society of netizens, and if we want our rights to apply to the virtual realm, then our responsibilities should naturally follow. So what is your responsibility here? It’s to change the way you think about your privacy. Sounds simple, doesn’t it? That’s because it’s easy to understand but tough to follow through. If we can reclaim our privacy, which we give to tech companies by using their products and services without a thought, we reclaim some of our power. It’s going to take work and maybe even a little inconvenience — but nothing worth having has ever been easy to get. The Golden Rule: He Who Holds the Gold Makes the Rules You’ve probably seen the phrase “data is the new currency” at least once by now, and moved on without giving it a second thought. We’re all guilty of it, because “data” seems far removed from reality, even though you’re constantly surrounded by tech. The change starts with you accepting your data is valuable. You have to accept that if you want big tech corporations to stop gaining (and abusing) power, you need to start protecting your privacy. Following through is hard because what these companies provide is convenient, and better options are either less user-friendly or don’t exist yet. Don’t let that be an excuse to give up before you even start, though. Striving for perfect ethical consumption doesn’t work because it’s not real. We just have to use the information available to us and make the best decisions we can at that time. If you take some time to look, you’ll find plenty of resources and options available to you. You can: Educate yourself about how companies collect and use your information. PIA has plenty of privacy-focused content on our blog, but use other sources too. Non-profit organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) may be a good place to start. Switch to gadgets and services that value privacy. You have options when it comes to anonymous browsers, private messaging apps, and tools that improve your privacy like script and tracker blockers, VPNs, and even anonymous payment methods. If you can, stop using products and services from companies that aren’t transparent about their practices or that have been charged with abusing their power. If you can’t find a better competitor, reconsider whether you really need it. If you can’t stop using a product or service, try to limit how much data you share with it. Change the privacy settings it makes available (if any), but also change the way you use it. As an example, if you’re not using your phone then put it in another room. You’ll still be able to hear when you get a text, but Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant won’t constantly be listening to you. Change your online habits. This may be the hardest one by far but it can also have the most impact. We tend to share a lot of details about ourselves with the internet without thinking about it. We overshare on social media, give away our personal details in online competitions, and sign in using other accounts because it takes a few seconds less than using an email address. Unless you decide to leave society altogether, you’re stuck seeing this game through. So maybe it’s time to start making some strategic choices. If you don’t like what a big tech company is doing, then change the rules, try new players — and most importantly, stop displaying your hand of cards for everyone to see. Stop giving your precious data away in exchange for convenience or free services that end up costing you things you didn’t want to pay in the end. We strongly recommend using a VPN to help avoid some of the data tracking discussed here. When choosing a VPN to protect your online privacy, it’s just as important to trust that the VPN won’t collect your data. PIA is the only court-proven and independently verified No Logs VPN. We use open-source software that anyone can verify, have RAM-only servers, and accept anonymous payments. Get PIA VPN Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

    "originBody": "× GROW Sales Marketing Customer Service IoT AR/VR Code Data and Security Energy Hack Web LEAD Productivity Culture Branding Tech Cloud Connect Deals Fund Health Startups SITE LINKS About Advertise Events Guest Post Contact Privacy AI Blockchain Cryptocurrency Devices Fintech Gambling Industrial Startups Smart Cities Lifestyle Reviews Contributors+ More Search for: India debuts digital surveillance for tech imports Deanna Ritchie / Nov 3, 2023 / ReadWrite Starting in November, the Indian administration granted 110 corporations, including major tech companies such as Apple, Dell, and Lenovo, permission to import laptops, tablets, and personal computers under a newly implemented digital surveillance system. This move aims to oversee shipments of electronic goods entering the country and streamline the import process. The new digital surveillance system mandates that businesses report the amount and worth of imported items on a website, with approvals valid through September 2024. This system aims to enhance the transparency in tracking electronic goods entering India, curb the potential for smuggling, and boost domestic manufacturing by better understanding the demand for imported products. India’s Import Policy Reversal India recently reversed its previous scheme to enforce import restrictions on electronic devices, which faced disapproval from both the sector and international administrations. The current system strives to achieve equilibrium between overseeing imports and encouraging the advancement of India’s technology industry. The new approach seeks to establish a balance between supporting local manufacturers and addressing global trade relations. Thus, the new policy aims to strengthen India’s position as an attractive destination for foreign investment while simultaneously fostering the growth of the domestic electronics sector. Although representatives from India’s National Trade Department have not yet officially addressed the situation and specifics regarding the approvals have not been disclosed, the fact that prominent tech organizations like Apple, Dell, and Lenovo have obtained import permissions shows the Indian administration’s inclination to nurture a favorable climate for technology sector expansion within the nation. India may set a precedent for other countries considering similar policies This move by the Indian administration will streamline the import process, boost transparency in tracking electronic goods, and establish India as a global technology hub.
