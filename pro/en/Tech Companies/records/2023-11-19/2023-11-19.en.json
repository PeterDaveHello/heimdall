Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Top 10 Stocks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Tech Companies Can't Stop Spending on Artificial Intelligence (AI): 1 Stock to Buy to Cash In on the Megatrend By Adam Levy – Nov 19, 2023 at 8:00AM Key Points Almost every company is spending big on AI. One way investors can capitalize on that trend is by investing in the companies that provide key infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Real estate investment trust Digital Realty's properties house infrastructure that companies will need to run their real-time AI applications. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: DLR Digital Realty Trust Market Cap $41B Today's Change (-0.46%) -$0.62 Current Price $134.53 Price as of November 17, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Digital Realty will play an important role in the next step for artificial intelligence applications. It seems like every company in the world is talking about how it can use artificial intelligence to improve its operations. In a recent survey by MIT Technology Review, every enterprise that responded said it would increase its spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure over the next year. Businesses can't afford not to look at the ways AI could help them improve their results -- to do otherwise would put them at risk of being left behind. A few businesses are particularly well positioned to benefit from the forthcoming growth in AI spending. Among them, one of the best options for investors is Digital Realty (DLR -0.46%). The real estate investment trust specializes in data centers. And management says it's just starting to see the impact of growing AI spending. Even with data centers, real estate is all about location, location, location Digital Realty owns a portfolio of properties located in more than 50 metro areas across six continents. Its global footprint is unmatched in its niche, and it gives the company a meaningful competitive advantage. A big focus in artificial intelligence is on training large language models. Those tasks are very time- and energy-intensive, and it takes a significant amount of space to house the hardware necessary to provide the computing power they require. As such, it can be done way out in the middle of nowhere. So, in that regard, Digital Realty doesn't have much advantage. But business and investing is about skating to where the puck will be. And businesses know they'll need to be in Digital Realty's data centers in the future. Collapse NYSE: DLR Digital Realty Trust Today's Change (-0.46%) -$0.62 Current Price $134.53 YTD +29.79% 1w1m3m6m1y5y Price VS S&P DLR Key Data Points Market Cap $41B Day's Range $133.64 - $136.05 52wk Range $86.33 - $136.55 Volume 1,542,659 Avg Vol 1,953,302 Gross Margin 21.49% Dividend Yield 3.61% \"The public consumption-consumer consumption is well outweighing the enterprise [consumption of AI]. That's going to change,\" CEO Andy Power said on Digital Realty's third-quarter earnings call. That's going to make the location of data centers running AI applications increasingly important. Enterprises want low-latency connections to their servers to help drive decision-making in real-time. Otherwise, the use cases for AI can be much more limited. Chief Revenue Officer Colin McLean noted, \"We also feel pretty strongly that core market orientation -- i.e., proximity to eyeballs and GDP -- is still going to remain a core requirement for much of this AI workload.\" That's where Digital Realty's 300-plus locations play an important role. Building the on-ramps to the public cloud Not every business is a multinational enterprise that needs space in data centers all over the world. For smaller businesses looking to use public clouds like Amazon's Amazon Web Services, Digital Realty is becoming more appealing. It's increasingly focused on serving customers that require less than 1 megawatt of power. Last quarter, 28% of its total bookings came from such customers. Importantly, those customers' contracts generally produce higher margins than its deals with big wholesale customers. Moreover, it's working on building entry points to public cloud services like AWS to allow businesses to connect to public cloud service providers without using the public internet. That increases privacy and security. Cloud providers put on-ramps in data centers that have high-density network connections because it makes it convenient for businesses to connect equipment directly to cloud providers. Last quarter, Digital Realty added on-ramps for AWS and other large cloud service providers, giving smaller enterprises more reason to use Digital Realty. Despite its efforts, Digital Realty still trails rival Equinix in its on-ramp portfolio and network density. But growing demand should prove a tailwind for its efforts to expand that part of the business. Meanwhile, its ability to offer wholesale space to lease to businesses like Amazon remains an advantage for attracting more of their spending. Does Digital Realty belong in your portfolio? One of the most straightforward ways of valuing real estate investment trusts is based on funds from operation, or FFO. FFO gives investors a better picture of the cash earnings power of a REIT by adjusting for non-cash expenses like depreciation and amortization and removing one-time gains and losses from asset sales. As such, it's a better valuation measure than net income for REITs. So, the price-to-FFO multiple for REITs is similar to a PE ratio for stocks. Digital Realty is currently trading at 23 times its trailing 12-month adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). That's a slightly better valuation than its biggest rival Equinix, which trades closer to a ratio of 24.5. Both companies should benefit from the growing demand for computing power and space to run artificial intelligence applications. However, Digital Realty is better positioned, literally, to take advantage of customers' growing needs for a global presence. That should enable it to grow its top line more consistently. Meanwhile, the growing share of its business coming from smaller enterprises should allow it to produce better operating margins over time. Digital Realty's dividend yield is also better today than Equinix's. At the current share price, it yields 3.6%, and management should consistently boost the payout as the REIT produces better AFFO every year by raising rents and expanding its footprint. As such, investors interested in capitalizing on the growing AI spending from just about every company in the world should consider adding Digital Realty to their portfolios.

    "originBody": "FROM AFP NEWS How Big Tech Generated Billions In Fines... Then Didn't Pay Them By Joseph Boyle and Peter Murphy in Dublin November 18, 2023 Order Reprints Print Article Text size Rarely a month goes by without big tech companies getting fined for price fixing, squashing competitors or misusing data, but it can take years before they pay a penny. Ireland's data regulator confirmed to AFP that Meta has not paid any of the two billion euros ($2.2 billion) in fines issued since last September. TikTok also owes hundreds of millions. Amazon is still appealing against a 746 million euro fine from 2021, Luxembourg's data regulator told AFP. Google is still disputing EU fines worth more than eight billion euros for abusing its market position between 2017 and 2019. Apple has fought for years against a French antitrust fine of 1.1 billion euros and an order to pay 13 billion euros of tax to Ireland. The problem is constant, global and involves tech companies of all sizes, not just the big four. This week Australia confirmed that X (formerly Twitter) had not paid a fine imposed for failing to outline its plans to stamp out content depicting child sexual abuse -- though X is now counter-suing. Critics say fining tech companies does not stop their bad behaviour and it is time for more drastic action. Margarida Silva, a researcher at Dutch NGO the Centre for Research on Multinationals, pointed out that tech firms have long revelled in their reputation for \"disruption\". \"Not paying the fines fits in with the way we've seen big tech companies challenge pretty much any enforcement of rules against them,\" said Silva. \"Even if the company ultimately loses, by that point they will have dragged the administration through years and years of expenditure.\" This sets tech apart from industries like finance, she argued, where there is still an incentive to pay to reassure the public and investors. But Romain Rard, a lawyer at Gide Loyrette Nouel in Paris, said it was common sense that firms would look to appeal big penalties. \"It's not as if companies can just ignore the fine, challenge decisions and hope for the best that they can get away without having to pay anything,\" he told AFP. And there have been notable successes for the companies -- chip firms Intel and Qualcomm have both recently had billion-dollar EU antitrust fines overturned or dramatically reduced on appeal. Europe's system is different to jurisdictions like China or the United States, where fines often come at the end of a lengthy process and are announced as settlements. In 2019, Facebook paid a record $5 billion fine to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And e-commerce giant Alibaba told investors in 2021 it immediately paid a record almost $3 billion fine to Chinese regulators in 2021. Activists argue that these companies are simply too rich for financial penalties to have much impact. Austrian lawyer Max Schrems, who has campaigned vigorously for data rights in Europe, said the issue was exacerbated by uneven application of the rules. The Irish Data Protection Commission, he said, allowed the companies too much leeway with their appeals processes and issued fines that were far too small. In an interview with AFP, Ireland's deputy data protection commissioner Graham Doyle defended his office's record and said fines were only one part of the story. \"With the vast majority of these investigations that we've finalised, whilst the fines tend to generate the most publicity, we have also imposed corrective measures,\" he said. He highlighted an investigation into Instagram for their handling of children's data. A 405 million euro fine is currently under appeal, but Doyle stressed that the platform had already fixed the initial problem. Activists agree that fines can only be a part of the solution. Silva argued that rather than noodling around with financial penalties, it was time for competition regulators to step up. She urged them to halt future takeovers and mergers in the sector and undo the damage of the past, potentially even breaking up the companies. \"The problem of Meta would be entirely different if it hadn't been allowed to buy Instagram and WhatsApp,\" she said. AFP has asked Meta for a response. jxb/cw/sn The Barron's news department was not involved in the creation of the content above. This story was produced by AFP.

      "This raises concerns about the effectiveness of financial penalties in deterring bad behavior, as tech companies often challenge enforcement and prolong legal processes.",
      "Critics argue that fines may not have a significant impact on these financially powerful companies, leading to calls for more drastic measures like blocking mergers and breaking up the companies."

    "originBody": "Boards, Policy & Regulation Boards OpenAI CEO Sam Altman discusses possible return, mulls new AI venture, source says By Anna Tong, Krystal Hu and Jeffrey Dastin November 19, 202311:17 AM UTCUpdated 2 hours ago Sam Altman, CEO of Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT creator speaks during a talk at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel June 5, 2023. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Companies Openai LLC Follow Apple Inc Follow Microsoft Corp Follow Show more companies Nov 18 (Reuters) - (This Nov. 18 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of 'Khosla' in paragraph 6) Sam Altman, the just ousted CEO of OpenAI, is discussing a possible return to the company behind the ChatGPT bot even as he considers launching a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture, a person briefed on the matter said on Saturday. A day after the board fired him in a surprise move that rocked the tech world, Altman was talking with OpenAI executives about improving the company's governance structure while he discusses with some core OpenAI researchers and others loyal to Altman how they could start a new AI company, the person said. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The possibilities of a return or a restart for Altman, seen by many as the face of generative AI, are in flux, said the source, who asked not to be named because the source was not authorized to speak on behalf of the parties involved. OpenAI and Altman did not reply to requests for comment. Investors in OpenAI, including its biggest backer Microsoft, are discussing damage control, including possibly pushing the board to restore Altman as CEO, fearing a mass exodus of talent without him, other sources said. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Khosla Ventures, an early backer of OpenAI, wants Altman back at OpenAI but \"will back him in whatever he does next,\" the fund's founder Vinod Khosla posted on X on Saturday. Microsoft declined to comment. It reportedly owns 49% of the company, while other investors and employees control 49%, with 2% owned by OpenAI's nonprofit parent. Emotions ran high on Saturday as current and former employees were angered by Altman's sacking and worried over how an upcoming $86 billion share sale could be affected by the sudden management upheaval. Advertisement · Scroll to continue OpenAI, a nonprofit co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk, launched ChatGPT on Nov. 30 last year, setting off a global sensation over generative AI technology that quickly became the world's fastest-growing software application. It set off a wave of investments and announcements across industries to use AI to enhance everything from financial services and healthcare to entertainment and media. Trained on reams of data, generative AI can create human-like content, helping users spin up term papers, complete science homework and even write entire novels. After ChatGPT's launch, regulators scrambled to catch up: the European Union revised its AI Act and the U.S. kicked off AI regulation efforts. By Saturday, some shell-shocked employees contemplated quitting if Altman was not restored by the end of the weekend, one source said. Others expressed support for joining Altman in starting a company, a third person familiar with the matter said. Former OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who said he quit OpenAI over Altman's firing on Friday, is expected to join any effort, according to the Information, which earlier reported the possible new venture, citing a person familiar with the matter. Brockman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. Some researchers at OpenAI, including Szymon Sidor, have quit the company over the CEO change, but it was unclear if Sidor and others would join a new Altman venture, two people familiar with the matter said. Sidor confirmed quitting. Altman and Apple's (AAPL.O) former design chief Jony Ive have been discussing building a new AI hardware device, the Information reported in September. It reported that SoftBank (9434.T) CEO Masayoshi Son had been involved in the conversation. Altman's ouster was over a \"breakdown of communications,\" not \"malfeasance,\" Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap wrote in an internal company memo on Saturday that was viewed by Reuters. Tech website The Verge earlier reported the OpenAI board's discussions with Altman to return as CEO. Forbes reported on Saturday investors were plotting to restore Altman as CEO.

Facebook-parent Meta has split up its Responsible AI division, the team dedicated to regulating the safety of its artificial intelligence ventures. Most Responsible AI staffers have been reassigned to the Generative AI product development team. The move comes after a slew of layoffs and team redistribution changes at the company this year. Meta has disbanded its Responsible AI division, the team dedicated to regulating the safety of its artificial intelligence ventures as they get developed and deployed, according to a Meta spokesperson. Most members of the RAI team have been reassigned to the company's Generative AI product division, while some others will now work on the AI Infrastructure team, the spokesperson said. The news was first reported by The Information. The Generative AI team, born in February, focuses on developing products that generate language and images to mimic the equivalent human-made version. It came as companies across the tech industry poured money into machine learning development so as not to get left behind in the AI race. Meta is among the Big Tech companies that have been playing catch-up since the AI boom took hold. The RAI restructuring comes as the Facebook parent nears the end of its \"year of efficiency,\" as CEO Mark Zuckerberg called it during a February earnings call. So far, that has played out as a flurry of layoffs, team-mergers and redistributions at the company. Ensuring the safety of AI has become a stated priority of top players in the space, especially as regulators and other officials pay closer attention to the nascent technology's potential harms. In July, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and OpenAI formed an industry group focused specifically on setting safety standards as AI advances. Though RAI employees have now been dispersed throughout the organization, the spokesperson noted that they will continue to support \"responsible AI development and use.\" Money Report NEWS 10 HOURS AGO OpenAI investors push to bring Altman back as CEO one day after he was ousted by board NEWS 12 HOURS AGO Sam Altman's last days as OpenAI CEO gave no indication trouble was brewing \"We continue to prioritize and invest in safe and responsible AI development,\" the spokesperson said.

In many markets, regulators and governments are increasingly eyeing stricter rules for tech companies — and emphasizing the need for compliance.
