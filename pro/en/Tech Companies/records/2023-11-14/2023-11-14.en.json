REUTERS/Pedro Nunes Acquire Licensing Rights LISBON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people have gathered in Lisbon to attend Europe's largest technology conference, the Web Summit, as the event attempts to get back on its feet after the resignation of its CEO over comments he made about the Israel-Hamas war. Paddy Cosgrave, the Irish founder of the Web Summit, drew criticism for a post on social media related to Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Palestinian militant group Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, saying \"war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies\".

Cosgrave resigned as CEO last month, saying his personal comments on the conflict had become a distraction from Web Summit 2023 in Lisbon. Web Summit appointed former Wikimedia Foundation CEO Katherine Maher as the chief executive. \"I think it's important to say that I believe everyone, everywhere, has the right to express their views on what is happening in the world,\" Maher said as she addressed Cosgrave's resignation at the event's opening.

Most of the attendees who spoke to Reuters said the controversy would not have an impact on their experience and praised the new CEO for addressing the issue straight on. \"They were very transparent...that helps,\" said Ellanoor Rep, a 34-year-old tech worker from the Netherlands. The Web Summit said more than 300 of its partners were coming to the event and that some \"who were deliberating have come back on board and reversed their decision\".

The event attracts about 70,000 participants every year, drawing speakers from global tech companies and startups, as well as politicians.

GETTY In the ever-evolving tech industry, there's an unignorable truth: Diversity is not just a buzzword. It's the key to unlocking innovation and enhancing user experiences. As human resources professionals, we hold the power to reshape our organizations and drive growth through diversity. One strategic approach for increasing diversity is tapping into potential talent that has participated in coding boot camps. Read on if you're ready to explore how inclusivity can transform your workforce and product development. Software Engineering's Diversity Challenge The lack of diversity in software engineering is a well-documented issue. According to a 2021 report by the U.S. Census Bureau, women are consistently underrepresented in STEM occupations, including software engineering. Additionally, American software engineers are typically white. This underrepresentation poses a challenge both in terms of your organization's talent acquisition and product development. A lack of diverse perspectives within software teams can result in unintentional biases and gaps in user experiences, ultimately limiting the potential of software solutions. When companies embrace employees' unique perspectives, they can gain invaluable insights for solving complex problems and understanding diverse user needs.

For example, during a networking event, I had the privilege of connecting with Alex Taylor, a determined professional who embarked on a remarkable career transformation through a coding boot camp. Alex, whose background was in marketing, was eager to transition into software development. After exploring various avenues, they determined a coding boot camp that specialized in web development was the most practical, effective path to acquire the technical skills needed for this career overhaul. Alex told me how the intensive boot camp program offered hands-on projects and personalized mentorship, providing a unique opportunity to enhance their coding skills rapidly. After completing the program, Alex was able to secure a position at a leading tech company. This was a boon for the company as well because it gained a valuable perspective thanks to Alex's nontraditional background, ultimately enriching the software team with diverse insights and ideas. This success story illustrated to me the immense value of sourcing talent from coding boot camps. It's not just about skills; it's about unlocking potential and embracing individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can help ensure a workforce that reflects the varied experiences of our global society. What Makes Coding Boot Camps More Inclusive These intensive, short-term programs are gaining prominence among burgeoning tech talent because of their affordability, flexibility and accessibility. Coding boot camps are often an affordable alternative for people without the means to pursue a four-year degree. This is likely because the more-focused curriculum and shorter duration allow boot camp organizations to streamline costs and provide quality education at a lower price point. Additionally, numerous coding boot camps have implemented programs and scholarships specifically to support underrepresented individuals. These initiatives break down barriers and provide a much-needed opportunity for those who may have otherwise been excluded from the tech industry. Coding boot camps are often more accessible opportunities for professional development opportunities. Many participants are often working full time or balancing family responsibilities while they pursue a career change or advancement. Because the majority of coding boot camps offer online options, learners can go at their own pace and on their own schedule. This kind of flexibility accommodates the needs of underrepresented professionals who are juggling multiple commitments or lack the means to attend classes in person. Leveraging Coding Boot Camps For A More Inclusive Tech Pipeline As an HR leader, here are steps you can take to leverage coding boot camps as a source of diverse talent. Forge Partnerships Establish connections with coding boot camps in your region. Collaborate with them to create initiatives like internship programs, mentorship opportunities or direct hiring pipelines for graduates. These partnerships benefit your organization while also contributing to the growth of local tech ecosystems. To form these relationships, you should first research suitable coding boot camps, attend industry events or reach out through professional networks and email. Then, clearly outline the mutual benefits of a partnership, arrange planning discussions and maintain regular communication. If there aren't any local coding boot camps, you still have options. Explore online boot camps, collaborate with educational institutions that offer tech programs or consider sponsoring and supporting remote boot camps. Offer Ongoing Support Once you've onboarded coding boot camp graduates, providing them with a supportive environment is crucial. This means having an organizational culture of inclusion where diverse voices are heard and valued. Employees must feel that your organization embraces diverse perspectives, provides equal opportunities and ensures mutual respect. Mentorship programs or skill development workshops help build this culture because they offer guidance, foster confidence, promote diverse voices and address unconscious biases. This helps ensure that all employees, including boot camp graduates, are empowered and appreciated within your organization. Measure And Adjust Implementing effective diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts requires a lot of internal and external information. For example, you'll need to establish clear metrics, benchmark against industry standards and collect demographic data for analysis. DEI commitments also require you to consider intersectionality and hold leadership accountable for inclusivity. Finally, providing inclusivity trainings, setting up continuous feedback loops with employees and celebrating achievements are practices that further contribute to an inclusive environment. This can help you create a workplace where everyone, including people with nontraditional backgrounds, can thrive and contribute meaningfully. Conclusion In the software engineering sector, incorporating coding boot camp graduates into your technical talent pipeline is a strategic move. It can help you address diversity challenges and bring fresh perspectives and innovation to your organization. When tech companies are champions for diversity and inclusion, they're supporting essential principles that impact talent acquisition, software product success and user satisfaction. By embracing nontraditional backgrounds, providing ongoing support and measuring progress, we can build a more inclusive tech talent pipeline that reflects the diverse world we serve. And remember, this isn't just good for business. It's a moral and ethical imperative in today's tech-driven society.

Sascha Schurmann/Stringer/Getty Images Amazon is laying off 180 more employees after cutting over 20,000 jobs in 2023. This year, layoffs have expanded beyond tech, media, and finance with retail companies also cutting. See the full list of layoffs so far in 2023. Advertisement Advertisement Layoffs have remained an unfortunate reality of 2023, continuing pace with the cuts made at dozens of companies toward the end of last year. On Monday, Amazon announced that it would be laying off more than 180 employees in its Amazon Games division. The move is meant to help the company with \"focusing efforts on making and publishing video games,\" a spokesperson told Insider. Earlier this year, Amazon cut 18,000 roles in January and laid off 9,000 more in March. \"It never feels good to say goodbye to colleagues,\" Christoph Hartmann, vice president of Amazon Games, wrote in his memo to employees that was shared with Insider. \"This isn't a decision the leadership team came to quickly; it was the result of extensive considerations and road mapping for our future.\" Advertisement Advertisement Meanwhile, dozens of other companies have made significant reductions to staff this year: Tech companies, including Meta and Google, and finance behemoths, like Goldman Sachs, announced big layoffs in the first weeks of 2023 amid worries about the economy. The downsizings followed significant reductions that companies, including Meta and Twitter, made toward the end of last year. According to data from Layoffs.fyi, a site tracking layoffs since the start of the pandemic, tech companies slashed more than 244,000 jobs in 2023 alone — compared to during the pandemic, when they cut 80,000 in March to December 2020 and 15,000 in 2021.

Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images Amazon Games is cutting just over 180 roles, according to a memo sent to employees on Monday. As part of the changes, the gaming division is closing its Crown Channel and Game Growth initiatives and refocusing on Prime Gaming. \"After our initial restructuring in April, it became clear that we needed to focus our resources even more on the areas that are growing with the highest potential to drive our business forward,\" Hartmann wrote in the memo, which was shared with Insider. Amazon announced on March 20 that it would cut 9,000 jobs from its workforce over the coming weeks. The cuts came on the heels of the 18,000 roles the company announced it was cutting back in January. In a message to employees shared on Amazon's site, CEO Andy Jassy noted that the impacted positions are largely in the Amazon Web Services, People Experience and Technology Solutions, Advertising, and Twitch departments.

Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Charles Schwab let go of 5% to 6% of its total number of employees last month. Although an exact number hasn't been disclosed as far as the company's staff cuts, Charles Schwab had about 35,900 employees as of September 30, according to a corporate fact sheet. The reduction, which comes out to between 1,795 to 2,154 people, comes amid cost-cutting efforts as Charles Schwab's stock recovers from the depths of its losses so far this year. A spokesperson for the company confirmed to Insider that the layoffs were a part of its plan to \"remove cost and complexity from our organization.\" \"These were hard but necessary steps to ensure Schwab remains highly competitive, with industry-leading levels of efficiency, well into the future. They are decisions that impact very talented people personally, and we take that very seriously,\" the spokesperson said. Advertisement Advertisement Stack Overflow: 28% of its staff Stack Overflow CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar announced the layoffs in a blog post in October. Stack Overflow Chandrasekar attributed the cuts to \"macroeconomic pressures impacting the entire tech industry\" as the company focuses on profitability amid a drop in online traffic. \"This year we took many steps to spend less.\"CEO Prashanth Chandrasekar wrote in his blog post. \"Changes have been pursued through the lens of minimizing impact to the lives of Stackers. Unfortunately, those changes were not enough and we have made the extremely difficult decision to reduce the company's headcount by approximately 28%.\" Companies are looking to AI for coding help, but the Stack Overflow CEO has faith in the human element in his company, and it's also launched its own AI-based tool. Many AI companies used Stack Overflow's data to train AI in coding, something that the company is now looking to be compensated for.

Courtesy of Flexport The logistics company said it would be laying off up to 30% of its workforce toward the end of October. The pending layoffs follow a series of cost-cutting measures that Flexport has made since Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in September, following Dave Clark's departure. \"Ryan has been very transparent in the need to drive the growth and cost discipline required to return Flexport to profitability,\" a spokesperson for Flexport told Insider by email. \"We will do so in a way that doesn't impact customer service and our ability to help grow our customers' businesses. We won't be commenting on specific details with regard to employee reductions.\" This is the second round of cuts for Flexport this year. The company laid off about 20% of its workforce in January.

BARTOSZ SIEDLIK/AFP via Getty Images Epic Games is laying off 16% of its workforce and selling its music platform, CEO Tim Sweeney announced on September 28. Sweeney told employees that the company would be divesting from Bandcamp and spinning off most of its SuperAwesome digital media services. \"For a while now, we've been spending way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators,\" Sweeney wrote. \"Success with the creator ecosystem is a great achievement, but it means a major structural change to our economics.\" Advertisement Advertisement Roku: 10% of workforce Roku announced layoffs for the third time in 12 months amid quarterly losses that began in 2022. Photo by Arturo Holmes/Getty Images for Tribeca Festival Roku said it will limit new hires and lay off 10% of its estimated 3,600 employees in company-wide restructuring. Although the company was riding high during the pandemic, it's experienced quarterly losses dating back to 2022. In July, Roku posted a $107.6 million loss, according to the AP. Roku cut 200 roles, or 6% of its workforce, Reuters reported on March 30. The cuts came after the streaming device manufacturer previously laid off 200 employees in November 2022. Advertisement Advertisement Farmers Insurance: 2,400 roles Farmers Insurance logo Farmers Insurance said in late August that it was laying off 2,400 employees or about 11% of its workforce in a press release. \"Given the existing conditions of the insurance industry and the impact they are having on our business, we need to take decisive actions today to better position Farmers for future success,\" Raul Vargas, the CEO and president of the company, said in the release. The company said that the cuts will affect all lines of business and are part of actions to improve its long-term profitability and efficiency. Vargas said in the release, \"As our industry continues to face macroeconomic challenges, we must carefully manage risk and prudently align our costs with our strategic plans for sustainable profitability.\" He added, \"Our leaner structure will make us more nimble and better able to pursue opportunities for growth and ultimately make Farmers more responsive to the needs of our insured customers and agents. Advertisement Advertisement T-Mobile: 5,000 US jobs Laid off employees will receive \"competitive severance packages,\" according to Sievert. Robyn Beck/Getty The mobile carrier is laying off just under 7% of its total employees in wave of cuts that are expected to be made by September. In his letter, Sievert cited T-Mobile's efforts to compete with rivals in attracting new customers. Its most recent quarterly earnings report revealed that sales were down 2.5% year-over-year and net customer additions fell. \"What it takes to attract and retain customers is materially more expensive than it was just a few quarters ago,\" Sievert said in the letter. \"This is a company and team that looks around corners, that anticipates change and stays ahead of it.\" Sievert added that affected employees can expect to receive \"competitive severance packages,\" career transition services, and more.

Courtesy of Comparably The pharmacy giant is axing 5,000 jobs in a cost-cutting push. The cuts will impact employees in corporate roles, while those in customer-facing roles in CVS pharmacies, stores, clinics, and customer service centers are not likely to be impacted, the company said in a statement to Insider. In an internal memo that was sent to staff and viewed by the Wall Street Journal, the company's chief executive Karen Lynch said the cuts would help CVS \"be at the forefront of a once-in-a-generation transformation in health care.\" In addition to the layoffs, CVS is also reducing travel budgets and its use of external consultants in an effort to cut costs. Advertisement Advertisement Binance: More than 1,000 jobs NurPhoto Binance, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume, cut over 1,000 people from its workforce in July, the Wall Street Journal reports. The cuts come after the SEC filed a lawsuit against the company in June, alleging that it operated as an unlicensed crypto exchange. The cuts, which are ongoing, could whittle down Binance's staff by at least a third, a person familiar with the cuts told the Journal. Even before the SEC's suit the exchange was considering staff cuts to prepare for the next bull cycle and evaluate its \"talent density,\" a Binance spokesperson told Insider. \"As we prepare for the next major bull cycle, it has become clear that we need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we remain nimble and dynamic,\" the spokesperson said. The statement came after a series of tweets from independent journalist Colin Wu on May 31 that indicated forthcoming layoffs at the company. \"This is not a case of rightsizing, but rather, re-evaluating whether we have the right talent and expertise in critical roles,\" the Binance statement continued. \"This will include looking at certain products and business units to ensure our resources are allocated properly to reflect the evolving demands of users and regulators.\" Advertisement Advertisement Niantic: About 230 jobs Niantic released Pokemon Go to immense popularity in 2016. Thiago Prudêncio/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Niantic CEO John Hanke announced that the AR gaming company would be laying off about 230 employees in June. Hanke informed employees that the company would sunset its basketball game, \"NBA All-World,\" and stop development of an unreleased superhero game \"Marvel: World of Heroes.\" The company will also close a Los Angeles studio, he said. \"In the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively,\" Hanke wrote. \"Post Covid, our revenue returned to pre-Covid levels and new projects in games and platform have not delivered revenues commensurate with those investments.\" He added that Niantic is still confident about the potential of the augmented and mixed reality space, and pointed to Meta and Apple's commitments to their respective headsets as a reason the industry should be optimistic. Advertisement Advertisement Robinhood: About 7% of the workforce Robinhood will cut around 150 jobs through its recent wave of layoffs. Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Robinhood, a stock-trading app, is laying off around 150 of its full-time employees, The Wall Street Journal first reported. The job cuts will amount to about 7% of Robinhood's workforce — adding to the more than a thousand jobs the company has cut since last year. Robinhood's Chief Financial Officer Jason Warnick, wrote that the layoffs were done to \"adjust to volumes and to better align team structures,\" according to an internal company message obtained by the Journal. \"We're ensuring operational excellence in how we work together on an ongoing basis. In some cases, this may mean teams make changes based on volume, workload, org design, and more.\" a Robinhood spokesperson told Insider in an emailed statement. The spokesperson did not respond to Insider's questions asking about how many employees would face layoffs, and what positions would be impacted. This marks the third workforce reduction the company has undergone since last year. In 2022, Robinhood went through two rounds of layoffs in April and August which axed more than a thousand positions of its then 3,800 employees. The company cited these earlier layoffs as necessary to cut costs and eliminate duplicate roles that resulted from the company undergoing rapid hiring. The layoffs at Robinhood followed a ballooning period of stock trading and hiring at the company during the Covid-19 pandemic, Insider previously reported. But trading has only declined since then, as stimulus checks have dried up and inflation rates climbed, granting people fewer disposable income for trading. Advertisement Advertisement Ford: anticipated layoffs Ford confirmed it would undergo layoffs, as part of the company's Ford+ growth plan. Ford Ford said it would undergo layoffs that would mainly impact engineering positions based in the US and Canada. A spokesperson for Ford declined to say how many employees would be laid off this week, when Insider asked for comment. The layoffs would mostly impact engineering roles in the US and Canada, the spokesperson said in a statement. The recent round of layoffs at Ford are part of the company's Ford+ growth plan that was introduced in 2021, the spokesperson told Insider. Part of this plan focuses on expanding the company's electric vehicles sales, CNBC reported. \"Delivering on the plan includes adjusting staffing to match focused priorities and ambitions, while raising quality and lowering costs,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to Insider, when asked about the reasoning for the layoffs. The layoffs will impact employees in each of Ford's business divisions, including its Ford Blue unit, its Model e electric vehicle division, and its Ford Pro services, CNBC reported. This layoff follows reductions the company made last year. In August, Ford laid off around 3,000 employees — a part of the company's plans to restructure the company's attention on electric vehicles. But the layoffs in the car industry are also distinct from those spreading across other industries, Insider previously reported. As more automakers shift to electric vehicles, more layoffs are anticipated across the industry. But while these changes signal some jobs will no longer exist in the industry, new positions will also be created as more automakers move in this direction. Advertisement Advertisement Sonos: About 7% of the workforce The Sonos team celebrates its Nasdaq initial public offering. Sonos In a June 14 filing, Sonos disclosed it would be laying off around 7% of its workforce, or 130 people. \"In the face of continued headwinds we have had to make some hard choices, including eliminating some positions and reevaluating program spend,\" the company's CEO Patrick Spence said in a statement. The cuts come a month after the company announced a 24% drop in revenue for the second quarter of 2023 as compared to the second quarter of 2022. At the time, company cited softening demand and reduced its earnings guidance for the rest of the year, causing its stock to take a hit. Advertisement Advertisement Grubhub: Around 400 jobs Brandon Bell/Getty Images Grubhub CEO Howard Migdal told staff that the food-delivery company would be laying off about 400 jobs on June 12 — or about 15% of its workforce. The cuts impacted Grubhub's corporate office, as the company's operating and staff costs have increased at a faster rate than its business over the past few years, the memo said. \"We operate in a highly competitive and constantly evolving industry,\" Migdal wrote. \"There is no doubt whatsoever that we have a solid foundation in place and an immense opportunity ahead of us – but it is also clear that we need to make some tough decisions in order to maintain our competitiveness.\" Grubhub has struggled to keep up with the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats, and it is now the third biggest delivery operator in the US, according to Bloomberg Second Measure. The company has had three CEOs over the last two years, and its owner, Dutch conglomerate Just Eat Takeaway.com, tried to sell the firm less than a year after purchasing it. Meanwhile, more customers are turning away from food delivery, overall, in an attempt to save money and avoid sky-high fees. Advertisement Advertisement Spotify: 2% of workforce Spotify is the latest company to announce layoffs. Onur Dogman/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Spotify announced that the music and podcast streaming app would lay off about 200 employees, or 2% of its workforce. The layoffs will impact employees across Spotify's podcasting business and its supporting functions, including talent acquisition and financial roles, a Spotify spokesperson told Insider. In the memo sent to employees, the vice president of Spotify's podcast business Sahar Elhabashi explained the layoffs were a part of the brand's decision to change how it works with podcast partners around the globe. The \"fundamental pivot from a more uniform proposition will allow us to support the creator community better,\" the memo read. \"The company will support these individuals with generous severance packages, including extended Healthcare coverage and immediate access to outplacement support,\" the statement read. This announcement arrives on the tail of additional layoffs the music streaming service made back in January. In a memo to Spotify employees, CEO Daniel Ek said the company would cut 6% of its staff, about 600 people. \"While we have made great progress in improving speed in the last few years, we haven't focused as much on improving efficiency. We still spend far too much time syncing on slightly different strategies, which slows us down. And in a challenging economic environment, efficiency takes on greater importance. So, in an effort to drive more efficiency, control costs, and speed up decision-making, I have decided to restructure our organization,\" he wrote. As part of those changes, Dawn Ostroff, the company's chief content and advertising officer, who spent more than $1 billion signing exclusive podcast deals with Joe Rogan, the Obamas, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, has departed.

Reuters JPMorgan announced on March 26 that it is slashing 500 roles, CNBC reported. The cuts are expected to spread across JPMorgan's retail and commercial banking, asset and wealth management, and corporate and investment banking operations, according to CNBC. The reported layoffs come just a day after reports that JPMorgan laid off 1,000 First Republic employees, or about 15% of its workforce. JPMorgan, the largest bank in the US, got even larger earlier this month when it acquired the assets of failing First Republic after it was seized by regulators.

Courtesy of Ryan Roslansky LinkedIn announced earlier this month that it would be cutting 716 roles from its global workforce in a message from CEO Ryan Roslansky. Roslansky also noted that company will also be discontinuing InCareer, a local jobs app in China, as it refocuses on helping companies in China hire, market, and train abroad. The decision comes on the heels of LinkedIn's 20th anniversary last week. \"While we're making meaningful progress creating economic opportunities for our members and customers and experiencing record engagement on the platform, we're also seeing shifts in customer behavior and slower revenue growth,\" Roslansky said. Advertisement Advertisement Shopify: 20% of workforce David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile via Getty Images Shopify is slashing 20% of its workforce and selling off most of its logistics business to supply chain company Flexport, the company announced on May 4.

The cuts impacted workers in the \"Agile job family,\" a department which was eliminated and its responsibilities integrated into \"existing engineering and product manager roles,\" per the spokesperson. \"Decisions that affect our associates, especially those that involve role eliminations, are incredibly difficult,\" the Capital One spokesperson said in the statement. \"This announcement is not a reflection on these individuals or the work they have driven on behalf of our technology organization,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Their contributions have been critical to maturing our software delivery model and our overall tech transformation.\" The eliminations came after the bank had invested heavily in tech efforts in recent years, including launching a new software business focused on cloud computing in June 2022. \"This decision was made solely to meet the evolving skills and process enhancements needed to deliver on the next phase of our tech transformation,\" the spokesperson said. Advertisement Advertisement WeWork: About 300 employees Reuters WeWork announced on January 19 it will cut about 300 positions as it scales back on coworking spaces in low-performing regions, Reuters reported. The layoffs come after the company said in November 2022 it planned to exit 40 locations in the US as part of a larger cost-cutting effort. The company announced the cuts in a press release listing its fourth-quarter earnings call date, stating only the reductions are \"in connection with its portfolio optimization and in continuing to streamline operations.\" Advertisement Advertisement Wayfair: more than 1,000 employees Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Wayfair is expected to lay off more than 1,000 employees, about 5% of its workforce, in the coming weeks in response to slumping sales, the Wall Street Journal reported on January 19. The cuts mark the second round of layoffs in six months for the online furniture and home goods company, after it nixed 900 staffers in August 2022. Though the company experienced significant growth during the pandemic-driven home improvement boom, sales began to stagnate as social distancing policies loosened and Americans began returning to offices. \"We were seeing the tailwinds of the pandemic accelerate the adoption of e-commerce shopping, and I personally pushed hard to hire a strong team to support that growth. This year, that growth has not materialized as we had anticipated,\" Wayfair CEO Niraj Shah wrote in a letter to employees announcing the August 2022 layoffs, per CNN. In its most recent quarter, the Wayfair reported that net revenue decreased by $281 million, down 9% from the same period the year prior. Advertisement Advertisement Microsoft: 10,000 workers Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Stephen Brashear/Getty Images Microsoft announced on January 18 that it planned to reduce its workforce by 10,000 jobs by the end of the third quarter of this year. CEO Satya Nadella attributed the layoffs to customers cutting back in anticipation of a recession. However, Nadella also told workers that the company still plans to grow in some areas, despite the firings, writing that the company will \"continue to hire in key strategic areas.\" Microsoft's layoff announcement comes as the tech giant is reportedly in talks to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, which created the AI chatbot ChatGPT. On February 13, the company laid off staff at LinkedIn—which it acquired in 2016— according to The Information. The cuts were in the recruiting department, though the total number laid off is not immediately clear, The Information reported. Advertisement Advertisement Crypto.com: 20% of staff Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek Crypto.com Crypto.com announced on January 13 that it would let go of a fifth of its workforce amid a sagging crypto market and fallout from FTX's collapse. This is the second major round of firings for Crypto.com, which also had layoffs in July. \"The reductions we made last July positioned us to weather the macro economic downturn, but it did not account for the recent collapse of FTX, which significantly damaged trust in the industry. It's for this reason, as we continue to focus on prudent financial management, we made the difficult but necessary decision to make additional reductions in order to position the company for long-term success,\" CEO Kris Marszalek wrote in a memo to employees. Advertisement Advertisement BlackRock: up to 3% of global workforce BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Spencer Platt/Getty Images BlackRock is cutting up to 500 roles in its first round of firings since 2019. Staff members were notified on January 11 about whether they were laid off. \"Taking a targeted and disciplined approach to how we shape our teams, we will adapt our workforce to align even more closely with our strategic priorities and create opportunities for the immense talent inside the firm to develop and prosper,\" CEO Larry Fink and President Rob Kapito wrote in a memo to employees. Advertisement Advertisement Goldman Sachs: an estimated 6.5% of its global workforce Goldman Sachs is laying off an expected 3,200 employees. Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Goldman Sachs began laying off employees on Jan. 11, with cuts expected to impact an estimated 6.5% of the company's global workforce — or roughly 3,200 staffers — a source told Insider. The company previously slashed roles on its media and tech teams in September 2022, and it was expected to issue further reductions in the first half of January. The cost-cutting efforts from the investment banking giant mirror reductions from competitors including Morgan Stanley and Citi, which also laid off employees in 2022. \"We continue to see headwinds on our expense lines, particularly in the near term,\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said at a conference in December. \"We've set in motion certain expense mitigation plans, but it will take some time to realize the benefits. Ultimately, we will remain nimble and we will size the firm to reflect the opportunity set.\" Advertisement Advertisement BNY Mellon: 1,500 jobs BNY Mellon CEO Robin Vince BNY Mellon BNY Mellon is planning to cut approximately 3% of its workforce, or 1,500 jobs, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. The cuts will be primarily aimed at talent management roles, according to the report. BNY Mellon will reportedly plan to invest more in junior staff. Advertisement Advertisement Verily (part of Alphabet): reportedly 15% of workers Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai Jerod Harris/Getty Images Verily, which is Alphabet's healthcare unit, is laying off more than 200 employees, according to an email seen by the Wall Street Journal. The Journal reports that the company will also scale down the number of projects it works on in an effort to cut costs. \"We are making changes that refine our strategy, prioritize our product portfolio and simplify our operating model,\" Verily's CEO, Stephen Gillet, wrote in the email, according to the Journal. This is the first significant layoff done by Google's parent company, which had so far avoided the massive waves of job cuts done by other big tech giants like Amazon and Meta. Advertisement Advertisement DirecTV: 10% of management staff DirecTV. Karen Bleier/AFP/Getty Images DirecTV employees were told in the first week of January that the company would lay off several hundred workers in management roles. The satellite TV business has faced slowing revenues as more people choose to cut the cord and pay for streaming services over cable TV. \"The entire pay-TV industry is impacted by the secular decline and the increasing rates to secure and distribute programming. We're adjusting our operations costs to align with these changes and will continue to invest in new entertainment products and service enhancements,\" a spokesperson for DirecTV told Insider. Advertisement Advertisement Coinbase: 950 workers CEO Brian Armstrong cited the downward trend in cryptocurrency prices and the broader economy as reasons for the layoffs. Patrick Fallon/Getty Images Coinbase announced on Tuesday, Jan. 10, that would lay off another 20% of its staff. The cuts came after the crypto company laid off over 1,000 employees in July. In a memo to employees, CEO Brian Armstrong said, \"in hindsight, we could have cut further at that time,\" referencing the layoffs in July. Armstrong partially attributed the company's weakness to the \"fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry,\" likely referencing the alleged fraud that took place at FTX late last year under then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Armstrong predicted \"there could still be further contagion\" from FTX in the crypto markets but assured remaining employees that Coinbase is well capitalized. Advertisement Advertisement Amazon: 18,000 employees Amazon CEO Andy Jassy initially announced the company's latest round of layoffs in November. Amazon Amazon is in the midst of the most significant round of layoffs in the company's history. In a memo to employees, CEO Andy Jassy said the company would cut more than 18,000 workers in total — far more than what was initially expected based on reporting by the New York Times. Jassy cited \"the uncertain economy\" and rapid hiring as reasons for the layoffs. While most of Amazon's 1.5 million staff have warehouse jobs, the layoffs are concentrated in Amazon's corporate groups. Amazon's layoffs began late last year, though the Wall Street Journal reports cuts will continue through the first few weeks of 2023. Amazon's 18,000 jobs cuts are the largest of any major tech company amid the wave of recent layoffs. Advertisement Advertisement Salesforce: 10% of its staff Salesforce said in the first month of 2023 that it would enact big job cuts. Noam Galai/Getty Images Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff announced on Jan. 4 that the software company plans to layoff 10% of its workforce — an estimated 7,000 employees — and close select offices as part of a restructuring and cost-cutting plan. \"The environment remains challenging and our customers are taking a more measured approach to their purchasing decisions,\" Benioff wrote in an email to staff. \"With this in mind, we've made the very difficult decision to reduce our workforce by about 10 percent, mostly over the coming weeks.\" He continued: \"As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we're now facing, and I take responsibility for that.\" Advertisement Advertisement Everlane: 17% of corporate employees Everlane founder and executive chair Michael Preysman. Lars Ronbog/Getty Images for Copenhagen Fashion Summit Everlane is slashing 17% of its 175-person corporate workforce, and 3% of its retail staff. \"We know there will be some bumpiness over the next few weeks as we navigate a lot of change at once. We ask for your patience as we do right by our departing team members,\" CEO Andrea O'Donnell wrote to employees, according to an internal memo seen by Insider. In a statement to Insider, a company spokesperson said the decision was intended to \"improve profitability in 2023 and continue our efforts to help leave the fashion industry cleaner than we found it.\" The e-commerce clothing company previously laid off nearly 300 workers, mostly in retail in March 2020 amid the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. Advertisement Advertisement Vimeo: 11% of its workforce Anjali Sud, CEO of Vimeo, speaks during the company's direct listing on Nasdaq, Tuesday, May 25, 2021, in New York. AP Photo/Mark Lennihan Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud told employees on Jan. 4 that the company would layoff 11% of its staff, the video platform's second major round of layoffs in less than a year, after cutting 6% of employees in July \"This was a very hard decision that impacts each of us deeply,\" Sud wrote in an email to staff. \"It is also the right thing to do to enable Vimeo to be a more focused and successful company, operating with the necessary discipline in an uncertain economic environment.\" A spokesperson told Insider reduction is intended to assist with ongoing economic concerns and improve the company's balance sheet. Advertisement Advertisement Compass: size of layoffs not immediately disclosed Compass is letting go of more employees after two rounds of layoffs in the past eight months. Compass Compass CEO Robert Reffkin told staffers on Jan. 5 it would conduct more layoffs, following two previous rounds in the past eight months, as the brokerage continues to struggle with significant financial losses. \"We've been focused over the last year on controlling our costs,\" Reffkin wrote in an email to employees. \"As part of that work, today we reduced the size of some of our employee teams. While decisions like these are always hard, they are prudent and allow us to continue to build a long-term, successful business for all of you.\" While the size of the layoffs was not immediately disclosed, the brokerage let go of 450 corporate employees in June 2022, followed by an additional 750 people from its technology team in October 2022.

    "title": "Burnout in the Tech Industry: Factors, Symptoms, and Coping Strategies",
    "originLink": "https://www.dice.com/career-advice/burnout-tech-companies-big-problem",
    "originBody": "Burnout is Real, and These are Tech's Main Offenders by Nate Swanner Nov 14, 2023 3 min read Burnout is something that any tech pro can experience, and it can happen even at the largest companies with the best perks. How can you identify burnout in tech, and what can you do when you’re burned out? Here are some tips and tricks for preserving your mental health, from recognizing the physical symptoms of energy depletion to the best ways to tell your boss you’re burned out. In past Dice Sentiment Reports, tech pros have cited the following as key reasons for burnout: Workload Excessive hours worked Lack of recognition for work Lack of challenges/monotony But how do those factors translate into the physical and mental symptoms of burnout? Symptoms of Burnout (and What to Do About Them) Here are some key indicators that you’re experiencing burnout. If you’re dealing with any of these, don’t be afraid to take proactive steps to mitigate them. Constant fatigue: If you’re physically and mentally exhausted far more than normal (i.e., even after several days of consistently good sleep), it might be a sign that you’re overextended. Difficulty concentrating: If you just can’t seem to focus on your priorities throughout the day, you may need to take a step back and reevaluate. Irritability: For some people, burnout manifests as irritability. Are you blowing up over relatively minor issues? Emotional ‘deadness’: Do you struggle to care about things, even those things that previously held a good deal of interest for you? It could be a huge sign of burnout. Fortunately, there are also some straightforward steps for mitigating burnout and boosting your mental and physical health. Establish good work-life balance: Are you working too many hours? Are your meetings scheduled too late (or too early) in the day? Work with your manager to establish a better work-life balance. Your manager is vested in you delivering your best performance, and that means they’ll help you find ways to adjust your workload accordingly. (If they’re not willing to help, you may want to consider a different job.) No means no: As a part of work-life balance, empower yourself to say “no” to meetings, tasks, and projects—both at work and outside of it—that might overburden you. Identify what stresses you out: Throughout a typical week or month, take note of what makes you stressed and depressed; also identify what makes you happy. Once you’ve charted out your “pain points” and the things that give you joy, you can better determine what you need to eliminate (or double down on) to help alleviate burnout. Therapy is great: Everyone could use a little therapy, as the saying goes. Self-care is vital: Exercise, sleep, and proper diet can go a long way toward keeping you physically and mentally whole. Once you’ve identified burnout, you can deal with it. One of the keys is communication: tell your boss that you’re burned out, and suggest proactive, effective ways of dealing with it. Mental health and burnout shouldn’t be an isolated battle; you might be surprised at how quickly your community and team members will rally around you. Burnout Can Impact Everyone Burnout doesn’t just impact tech pros: according to a recent Gallup poll, managers are also feeling burned out. Some symptoms of managerial burnout include: Work disengagement Burnout Actively seeking a new job Feeling like their organization doesn’t care about their wellbeing With managers, many of the same curative options apply: work on your work-life balance and self-care. Burnout has the potential to impact everyone, but there are also ways to deal with it.",

The firm specializes in investing at the Series A stage and focuses primarily on software companies, including B2B marketplaces and vertical software, TechCrunch reported Monday (Nov. 13). This new fund further strengthens Interplay’s position in the market, bringing its total assets under management to $150 million, according to the report. The firm plans to invest in 20 companies with this fund, providing capital injections ranging from $1 million to $2 million per check, while also reserving additional funds for follow-on deals. One of the key factors that sets Interplay apart is its consistent team of general partners, including founder and Managing Partner Mark Peter Davis, Kevin Tung and Mike Rogers, the report said. These partners have been investing together for over eight years and 50 deals. Interplay also distinguishes itself by offering significant value to its portfolio companies, per the report. The firm’s studio enables it to incubate and start companies, expanding its reach and creating a strong deal flow. Davis believes that the marketplace industry is undergoing a major shift toward specialization, with new companies offering tailored solutions for specific industries, according to the report. Despite the challenges of fundraising in the current market, Interplay managed to secure commitments from institutional funds, fund of funds, family offices and founders within its portfolio, the report said. Interplay remains disciplined in its deployment of capital, passing on opportunities that reflect over-excitement in the market, per the report. Instead, the firm focuses on companies with healthy and fair valuations. Davis believes that the current market presents attractive investment opportunities, as valuations have come back down to reasonable levels. It was reported Sunday (Nov. 12) that venture capitalists have curtailed their startup investments due to rising interest rates, leading to investors raising enough to buy out the startups that VC firms have rejected. In another recent development in the VC space, it was reported in October that JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest bank in the United States, is aggressively positioning itself as the leading financial partner for startups, founders and venture-capital backers of tech companies in Silicon Valley.

World Fund invests in climate technologies with significant climate performance potential (CPP). Today, deep tech companies — companies creating cutting-edge, transformative technologies based on scientific breakthroughs and R&D, and bringing them to market — are finally garnering more attention from the VC community. From synthetic biology to quantum computing and battery recycling technology, the most innovative deep tech companies today are creating solutions that have the potential to transform entire industries and address pressing global challenges. Thousands of these exciting deep tech startups are based in Europe, and their founders are finally finding capital more readily available on home turf. European investment into deep tech remains strong, despite broader funding level drop-offs. Dealroom’s most recent European Deep Tech Report indicates a 60% increase in funding levels over the last 24 months, compared to 2020. This boom is also reflected in patents pending and R&D spending on moonshot technologies. This is what we mean by “deepwashing”: companies without much evidence of meaningful R&D or any real science pitching their product as transformative. Europe’s climate-focused deep tech companies form a crucial part of this growing sector, and increasing investor interest is a big net positive. However, deep tech hitting the zeitgeist has been accompanied by a disturbing rise in climate-focused startups positioning themselves as more “deep tech” than they actually are. This is what we mean by “deepwashing”: companies without much evidence of meaningful R&D or any real science pitching their product as transformative. This is a problem, because it leads to vital funding being directed toward startups that will never fundamentally shift the dial. By contrast, true climate deep techs are raising funding to enable them to deliver technologies with the capacity to decarbonise the global economy. And they’re needed. As outlined in a recent International Energy Agency (IEA) report, almost half of emissions reduction solutions in 2050 will come from technologies that are currently at the demonstration or prototype phase — and major innovation efforts must take place this decade in order to bring these new technologies to market in time. This is a mammoth task, but Europe is ready to take it on: In 2022, 42% of all climate tech dollars were raised on the continent, with investment into the sector growing 26% faster than the U.S. Founders need to stop deepwashing As specialist European climate tech investors, we are receiving “deepwashing” pitches from some solar, heat pump and micromobility startups, as well as from a few food tech companies. We’re regularly seeing teams using a lot of words about their tech, but when you actually examine their company’s product, there is no fundamental technology innovation. The product is maybe a slightly better application of tech that’s already on the market today, or a series of minute changes that might sound impressive packaged up together, but in reality the business is not shifting the dial.

However, most AI studios developing LLMs are running out of natural or human-generated data. Now it runs the risk of having to work with AI generated data. One of the problems that AI studios are facing is the refusal to pay for new natural data In the rapidly evolving landscape of the AI economy, data emerges as the linchpin that propels advancements. It is not merely a component; rather, it stands as the lifeblood of AI models, influencing their fundamental functionality and overall quality. The correlation is clear: the more abundant and diverse the human-generated data an AI system is exposed to, the more adept it becomes. However, a disconcerting revelation casts a shadow over AI companies—the finite nature of natural data. In a warning that has been reverberating among AI researchers for nearly a year, experts caution that the well of natural data, essential for training AI systems, is running dry. RELATED ARTICLES Most US adults think AI will add to election misinformation in 2024, shows new poll VantageWhy Rashmika Mandanna's deepfake is a wakeup call for all Rita Matulionyte, a professor of information technology law at Macquarie University in Australia, emphasizes this concern in an essay for The Conversation. A study by the AI forecasting organisation Epoch AI adds a tangible timeline to the foreboding scenario. The study estimates that AI companies could confront a shortage of high-quality textual training data as early as 2026, with low-quality text and image data potentially depleting between 2030 and 2060. This data scarcity poses a substantial threat to AI firms heavily reliant on continuous data influx for the enhancement of their models. The trajectory of AI development has mirrored the infusion of increasing volumes of data. If this supply chain stagnates, the consequences could reverberate throughout the industry. Matulionyte suggests a potential remedy in the form of synthetic data, generated by AI models. However, the viability of this solution is contested, with research indicating a risk of an “inbreeding effect” that distorts the model when trained on AI-generated content. Despite these challenges, some companies are already exploring synthetic training sets. A pragmatic alternative emerges in the concept of data partnerships. In essence, companies or institutions possessing vast repositories of high-quality data could enter into agreements with AI companies to share this data, often in exchange for financial compensation. OpenAI, a prominent Silicon Valley AI firm, recently launched a Data Partnership initiative. In a blog post, the company underscores the significance of such collaborations in steering the future of AI and creating models that are more relevant to diverse organizations. As the race for data intensifies, the practicality of data partnerships becomes a focal point. Many AI datasets currently derive from internet-scraped data created by online users, making data partnerships a plausible solution. Yet, with the escalating value of data, the competition for datasets is poised to intensify, raising questions about the willingness of institutions and individuals to share their data with AI entities. Even with data partnerships, there remains a lingering uncertainty about the sustainability of the data supply. Despite the seemingly boundless expanse of the internet, the impending challenge of dwindling data reserves forces a reassessment of assumptions about the endless nature of this critical resource.
