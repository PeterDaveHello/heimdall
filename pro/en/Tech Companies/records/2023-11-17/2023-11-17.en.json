REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Acquire Licensing Rights Companies Law Firms Alphabet Inc Follow Apple Inc Follow Block Inc Follow Show more companies Nov 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. consumer watchdog, not usually known to side with Wall Street lenders, has handed them a rare win by cracking down on Big Tech companies that are increasingly encroaching on banking turf. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) last week proposed regulating payments and smartphone wallets provided by tech leaders like Apple (AAPL.O) and Google (GOOGL.O), arguing they now rival traditional bank services in scale and scope and should be subject to the same consumer safeguards. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The long-anticipated move by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra, who built his career targeting Big Tech over privacy and competition issues, gives a competitive boost to lenders grappling with an onslaught of new rules from capital hikes and caps on debit and credit cards fees to tougher fair lending standards. \"The banks are under almost a bunker mentality right now. They are getting hit from a lot of different places,\" said Todd Phillips, a professor at Georgia State University. \"So when a regulator basically says, we are going to start treating your competition a lot like the way we treat you, that is good news.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue U.S. oversight of Big Tech financial services is fragmented. Companies must apply to each state for money transmitter licenses, and are subject to oversight by various regulators. The CFPB rule would toughen up supervision, requiring Big Tech to comply with its rules on privacy protections, executives' conduct and unfair and deceptive practices. Seventeen companies would be affected including Apple, Google, PayPal (PYPL.O) and Block's (SQ.N) CashApp, which together facilitated roughly $1.7 trillion worth of payments in 2021, the CFPB said. The value of all non-cash payments - excluding wire transfers primarily used for large transfers - was $128.51 trillion in 2021, Federal Reserve data shows. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The CFPB already supervises PayPal and CashApp under its international money transfer rules, but Apple and Google would be subject to CFPB oversight for the first time. Google declined to comment and Apple did not respond to a request for comment. \"Silicon Valley is already a major part of the financial marketplace,\" the CFPB said in a statement. Subjecting large tech companies in the payments market to similar oversight as banks will increase competition, the agency said. While tech giants rely on banks to process payments via bank-issued credit and debit cards, some - like Apple - charge lenders a fee for those transactions. The CFPB has also expressed concern that tech companies could be monetizing customer data and compromising user privacy. According to McKinsey research cited by the CFPB, big tech companies, by some measures, have surpassed regional and community banks in terms of consumer trust related to digital payments. Without regulatory scrutiny, they could leverage their growing dominance of consumer payments to capture other services like lending and card issuing, analysts said. Worried by this trend, the banking industry has been lobbying financial regulators to crack down on tech giants, arguing in public letters, blogs and congressional testimony that they are putting consumers' privacy at risk. They called for the CFPB to invoke its authority under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to designate \"larger participants\" in the nonbank market for consumer financial products. Washington trade group the Bank Policy Institute is among those leading that campaign. \"It's just not necessarily always clear to your average consumer what the differences are between a regulated and insured bank versus a totally unregulated tech company,\" said Paige Pidano Paridon, senior associate general counsel at BPI. Banks, for example, are required by law to disclose their information-sharing practices to their customers and face limits on what consumer data they can share with third parties. 'LEG UP' Representatives for Big Tech have accused the CFPB of trying to protect traditional lenders. The Chamber of Progress, a tech industry coalition whose partners include Apple and Google, said last week the proposal was \"more about giving Wall Street a leg up\" than protecting consumers. The CFPB did not address a query on that claim. Chopra has also been critical of bank practices and has targeted the fees they charge consumers, among other measures. While Big Tech companies have deep pockets and plenty of resources to handle the new scrutiny, the rule could limit how they use and protect consumer data. Legal experts also said the CFPB clearly has the authority to regulate Big Tech's payment businesses, suggesting the industry may not fight the proposal. The CFPB is accepting public feedback on the proposal until early 2024. \"From the perspective of large technology companies, you might even prefer to be supervised, because the agency is not going away,\" said John Coleman, a partner at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe.

In the past two weeks, several major tech companies focused on AI have added new policies and tools to build trust, avoid risks and improve legal compliance related to generative AI. Meta will require political campaigns disclose when they use AI in ads. YouTube is adding a similar policy for creators that use AI in videos uploaded. IBM just announced new AI governance tools. Shutterstock recently debuted a new framework for developing and deploying ethical AI. Those efforts aren’t stopping U.S. lawmakers from moving forward with proposals to mitigate the various risks posed by large language models and other forms of AI. On Wednesday, a group of U.S. senators introduced a new bipartisan bill that would create new transparency and accountability standards for AI. The “Artificial Intelligence Research, Innovation, and Accountability Act of 2023” is co-sponsored by three Democrats and three Republicans including U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn), John Thune (R-S.D.), and four others. “Artificial intelligence comes with the potential for great benefits, but also serious risks, and our laws need to keep up,” Klobuchar said in a statement. “This bipartisan legislation is one important step of many necessary towards addressing potential harms.” Earlier this week, IBM announced a new tool to help detect AI risks, predict potential future concerns, and monitor for things like bias, accuracy, fairness and privacy. Edward Calvesbert, vp of product management for WatsonX, described the new WatsonX.Governance as the “third pillar” of its WatsonX platform. Although it will initially be used for IBM’s own AI models, the plan is to expand the tools next year to integrate with LLMs developed by other companies. Calvesbert said the interoperability will help provide an overview of sorts for various AI models. “We can collect advanced metrics that are being generated from these other platforms and then centralize that in WatsonX.governance,” Calvesbert said. “So you have that kind of control tower view of all your AI activities, any regulatory implications, any monitoring [and] alerting. Because this is not just on the data science side. This also has a significant regulatory compliance side as well.” At Shutterstock, the goal is also to build ethics into the foundation of its AI platform. Last week, the stock image giant announced what it’s dubbed a new TRUST framework — which stands for “Training, Royalties, Uplift, Safeguards and Transparency.” The initiative is part of a two-year effort to build ethics into the foundation of the stock image giant’s AI platform and address a range of issues such as bias, transparency, creator compensation and harmful content. The efforts will also help raise standards for AI overall, said Alessandra Sala, Shutterstock’s senior director of AI and data science. “It’s a little bit like the aviation industry,” Sala said. “They come together and share their best practices. It doesn’t matter if you fly American Airlines or Lufthansa. The pilots are exposed to similar training and they have to respect the same guidelines. The industry imposes best standards that are the best of every player that is contributing to that vertical.” Some AI experts say self-assessment can only go so far. Ashley Casovan, managing director of the AI Governance Center at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said accountability and transparency can be more challenging when companies can “create their own tests and then check their own homework.” She added that creating an external organization to oversee standards could help, but that would require developing agreed-upon standards. It also requires developing ways to audit AI in a timely manner that’s also not cost-prohibitive. “You’re either going to write the test in a way that’s very easy to succeed or leaves things out,” Casovan said. “Or maybe they’ll give themselves an A- to show they’re working to improve things.” What companies should and shouldn’t do with AI also continues to be a concern for marketers. When hundred of CMOs met recently during the Association of National Advertisers’ Masters of Marketing summit, the consensus was around how to not fall behind with AI without also taking too many risks. “If we let this get ahead of us and we’re playing catch up, shame on us,” said Nick Primola, group evp of the ANA Global CMO Growth Council. “And we’re not going to do that as an industry, as a collective. We have to lead, we have so much learning from digital [and] social, with respect to all the things that we have for the past five or six years been frankly just catching up on. We’ve been playing catch up on privacy, catch up on misinformation, catch up on brand safety, catch up forever on transparency.” Although YouTube and Meta will require disclosures, many experts have pointed out that it’s not always easy to detect what’s AI-generated. However, the moves by Google and Meta are “generally a step in the right direction,” said Alon Yamin, co-founder of Copyleaks, which uses AI to detect AI-generated text. Detecting AI is a bit like antivirus software, Yamin said. Even if tools are in place, they won’t catch everything. However, scanning text-based transcripts of videos could help, along with adding ways to authenticate videos before they’re uploaded. “It really depends how they’re able to identify people or companies that are not actually stating they are using AI even if they are,” Yamin said. “I think we need to make sure that we have the right tools in place to detect it, and make sure that we’re able to hold people in organizations accountable for spreading generated data without acknowledging it.” Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit https://digiday.com/?p=526126 Trending in Generative AI 01 Generative AI Inside one agency’s efforts to build its own AI platform 02 Member Exclusive Digiday+ Research check-in: Publishers and brands go all-in on AI compared with Q2 Sponsored How AI-driven contextual targeting helps advertisers beyond cookie deprecation 03 Generative AI AI Briefing: Here is how a startup named after a Black inventor is addressing AI’s racial bias Most Read 01 Navigating Economic Instability Media companies announce more layoffs to cut costs, blaming a relentlessly challenging ad market 02 Strategizing for the Future Why BuzzFeed might as well sell Complex 03 Life Beyond the Cookie GroupM agrees to new program that lets clients experiment within Google’s Privacy Sandbox 04 Strategizing for the Future Publishers double down on events heading into 2024 05 Brands in Culture Here is the anatomy of the 2023 Christmas ad season More in Media Buying View More Life Beyond the Cookie Study examines combining first-party and third-party data to reach wider audiences, reduce costs November 15, 2023 • 3 min read Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit IPG siblings Magna and Acxiom this week released a study measuring the effectiveness of combining first-party and third-party data to reach wider audiences.

    "originBody": "Struggling News Media In Fight to Get Wealthy Tech Companies To Revenue Share Author: Pernille Tranberg Published on: 2023-11-17 (The illustration is AI-generated by Adobe Firefly which tells us that it is trained only on consented material) Media outlets want a fair revenue share with tech companies that earn ad revenue from their content. With AI services, the conflict has intensified. Analysis. Google and Facebook owe publishers a lot of money because they earn ad revenue from their content. In the US alone, Google would have to pay 17.5% of its ad sales – about $10 billion a year – while Meta would have to cough up 6.6% – about $2 billion a year – if there was a fair revenue split. This is the conclusion of a new independent report Paying for News: What Google and Meta Owe US Publishers fra Columbia University. We’re only talking about using journalistic content by search engines and social media to generate traffic and engagement. Many countries, including Denmark, have introduced laws that give media outlets the right to demand payment, and negotiations are also underway. Still, there are no set amounts and it’s an uphill battle as Google and Facebook try to avoid paying. Google says according to Semafor Media that a maximum of 2% of all searche sare related to the news. Even with this low percentage, it would mean that the struggling media could share a lot of money from Google. However, before this issue is resolved, a new one is looming. AI companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI/Microsoft have launched popular generative AI services like Bard, Llama and ChatGPT. To do this, they have vacuumed (scraped) all content from the internet, including media, without asking permission first. All this content is used to train and develop the AI services. The US AI companies believe they should have the content for free to ensure progress and innovation and for the US to continue to compete with China. They say that it is fair use to scrape content from the open internet – just like Google once got a ruling in the US that it was ‘fair use’ to download all books and make them available to everyone for free. Media: Not Fair Use The media argues the exact opposite. In a White Paper, written by their trade association, they argue that the AI companies have used their content between 5 and 100 times more frequently for their AI services than other general content on the web, and that this is not fair use, because the AI companies profit from media content via commercial products, use media content to compete with the media, and do not use media content significantly differently from the way the media uses the content. The arguments are about US copyright law. In the EU we are, as always, stricter and do not allow ‘fair use’ to the same extent as in the US. License Agreement Many media outlets believe that AI companies should also enter into license agreements and provide them with a fair revenue share. But unlike before, when most news media put all their content online for free, they are a little smarter this time. Most of the big news outlets have blocked for more scraping, as far as I know. It’s the right thing to do, because why help them make their product better when they get nothing in return? The media hopes that blocking the scraping will place them in a better position when negotiating license agreements. And this is where I think it will be more than difficult. When it comes to putting a price tag on those license agreements, it’s going to be peanuts at best. Having followed the big tech companies closely over a couple of decades, it’s hard to imagine that there will be a fair share. Meta is telling the US government in a consultation process for a new law that might give media a fair share that media content is ‘completely insignificant’ in the big data AI services, so a reasonable royalty would be incredibly small. AI companies are fighting hard not to pay for something they believe they have a right to access for free. That’s why news media should use their good, fact-checked content to create better trusted AI services that are being developed in a legal and fair way. It doesn’t matter if it takes a while. Legal, democratic and ethical processes usually do.

    "originBody": "Watch: Joe Biden gives up trying to pronounce tech company’s name In a speech to CEOs the US president stopped and admitted: ‘It’s better to not try’ By Tony Diver, US Editor 17 November 2023 • 8:20am Joe Biden gave up trying to pronounce a tech company’s name after stumbling at a speech to CEOs on Thursday. The US president addressed chief executives at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco, where he attempted to read a list of tech companies from a teleprompter. His speech was cut off as he tried to pronounce the name of a company, before giving up and admitting: “It’s better to not try.” “Here in this world, this world-renowned hub of innovation, so many tech companies like Anthropic and…I’m gonna mispronounce,” he said. “I’m not going to even try. It’s better to not try, and not mispronounce, than try and mispronounce.” Members of the audience laughed as Mr Biden smiled and continued with his speech. “The point is, small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups are getting into action as well.” Mr Biden, who had a speech impediment as a child, has become famous for trip-ups and gaffes in his speeches. President plays down inflation rise In his address to the summit on Thursday, the president acknowledged the US’s recent inflation figures, which show prices rose by 3.2 per cent in the year to October – the smallest annual increase since June. “Unemployment has been under 4 per cent for 21 straight months, inflation has come down by 65 per cent,” he said. “There is more to do. We now have the lowest inflation rate of any advanced economy in the world. Meanwhile, median household wealth has grown by 37 per cent in real terms, since before the pandemic.” The president joined an informal roundtable with world leaders Credit: GETTY IMAGES He added that he acknowledged a “disconnect between the numbers and how people feel about their place in the world right now”, but said: “We can deal with the second part as well.” The Apec summit has seen Mr Biden meet with Xi Jinping, the Chinese premier, for the first time in a year. At their bilateral meeting on Wednesday, the pair agreed to resume military-to-military communication and Mr Xi pledged to crack down on companies producing the ingredients of fentanyl, which are shipped to Latin America before being imported into the US. China relationship ‘not all Kumbaya’ On Thursday Mr Biden said the US’s relationship with China was “not all Kumbaya” and highlighted economic and national security concerns. “It’s not all, as my generation would say back in the day, it’s not all Kumbaya, but it’s straightforward, straightforward,” he said. “We have real differences with Beijing when it comes to maintaining a fair level economic playing field and protecting your intellectual property. “We’re going to continue to address them with smart policies and strong diplomacy. We have also taken targeted action to protect our vital national security interest.” The speech comes after the president described Mr Xi as a “dictator”, and was rebuffed by the Chinese foreign ministry just hours after the bilateral meeting to promote cooperation between the two countries.
