    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT OPINION ZEYNEP TUFEKCI What Google’s Multibillion Payment to Apple Says About Privacy and Power in Tech Nov. 20, 2023, 5:03 a.m. ET Credit... Getty Images Share full article 31 By Zeynep Tufekci Opinion Columnist A report in The Guardian in August that lawyers who had had business before the Supreme Court gave money to an aide to Justice Clarence Thomas for a Christmas party was surprising. Just as surprising was the way the publication learned about it: from the aide’s public Venmo records. Brian X. Chen, the consumer technology writer for The Times, wrote that even he was surprised that such records of money transfers could be public. A few years ago it became known that Alexa, Amazon’s voice device, recorded and sent private conversations to third parties, that Amazon staff members listened to recordings and kept an extensive archive of recordings by default. Both companies responded to these startling violations of privacy by suggesting that the burden to keep this information from going public was on users, who could, they said, opt out of devices’ default settings to ensure privacy. This is often the standard industry response. Even if you’re aware of these problems, how easy is it to protect your privacy? Chen helpfully shared instructions for opting out of Venmo’s public disclosures. “Inside the app, click on the Me tab, tap the settings icon and select Privacy. Under default privacy settings, select Private,” he explained. “Then, under the ‘More’ section in Privacy, click ‘Past Transactions’ and make sure to set that to ‘Change All to Private.’” Got all that? I did, and changed my settings, too, as I had also been in the dark. The bigger problem is not the sometimes ridiculous difficulty of opting out, it’s that consumers often aren’t even aware of what their settings allow, or what it all means. If they were truly informed and actively choosing among the available options, the default setting would matter little, and be of little to no value. But companies expect users to accept what they’re given, not know their options or not have the constant vigilance required to keep track of the available options, however limited they may be. Since the power in the industry is concentrated among few gatekeepers, and the technology is opaque and its consequences hard to foresee, default settings are some of the most important ways for companies to keep collecting and using data as they want. So, how much are default settings worth? In April 2021, Apple changed the default settings on iPhones and other devices so that users could not be tracked automatically via a unique identifier assigned to their Apple device. For many companies, and even for entire industries whose business models are based on tracking people online, it was a cataclysmic event. No longer would people have to opt out of such tracking by going into their settings and changing the permissions. Now the apps had to ask for and receive explicit permission before they could have access to that identifier. In 2021, Snap, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube were estimated to have lost about $10 billion in total because of the change. In early 2022, Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said it alone stood to lose $10 billion. Industries like mobile gaming, in which revenue largely depends on tracking users, also suffered. Another valuation of default settings became clear in the current Google antitrust trial. During the trial, Google revealed that it paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to be the default search engine on various platforms, with a substantial portion of the money going to Apple. That $26.3 billion was more than a third of the entire 2021 profit of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. That was more than the 2021 revenue of United Airlines and even of many tech companies, including Uber. An expert witness for Google testified that as part of that deal, the company was paying Apple 36 percent of its search advertising revenue to be its products’ default search engine. Even when you might think you know what your default settings are, you can be surprised. On more than one occasion I discovered that my privacy settings had changed from what I thought they were. Help forums are full of similarly befuddled users. Sometimes it’s a bug. Other times, when I dug into it, I realized that another change I had made had surreptitiously switched me back into tracking. Sometimes I learned that there was yet another setting somewhere else that also needed to be changed. I’m not a tech novice: I started programming in middle school, worked as a developer and study these systems academically. If professionals can be tripped up, I’d argue that an industry rife with information asymmetries and powerful, complicated technologies needs to be reined in. Regulators can require companies to have defaults that favor privacy and autonomy, and make it easy to remain in control of them. There are already good efforts underway. California allows people to make a single opt-out or delete request to get all data brokers to delete all their information, rather than having to appeal to them one by one. Colorado also recently passed similar universal one-stop opt-out mechanisms. Other states have made similar privacy protection moves. I would go further: Data brokers should not be allowed to amass information about people unless they first get explicit permission. But that’s not sufficient, since it is difficult for individuals to evaluate all the implications of their data — professionals, experts and the companies themselves keep getting surprised. A few years ago, aggregate maps generated by the running app Strava, which showed where users were running, seemingly revealed the location of what could have been a secret Central Intelligence Agency annex in Mogadishu, Somalia. It appears that even the C.I.A. hadn’t anticipated this, and instructed its personnel to change the setting. If that’s the case, what chance do ordinary people have to evaluate all future implications of their data? There need to be stronger guardrails, including for data that is legitimately collected. The default should be the most restrictive setting, with additional protections. For example, companies should have expiration dates for how long they can hold data needed for a particular service, limiting the data use to that service alone, with explicit consent required for different uses. The process by which companies get such permissions also needs strong oversight to ensure accountability and transparency. After all, this is the industry that invented “dark patterns”: user interfaces designed to deceive customers into “opting in” to choices without fully realizing what was happening. Many apps have already been trying to get around Apple’s privacy restrictions, by carefully engineering how to get people to opt in or by figuring out other ways to fingerprint devices. What about all the benefits we derive from services based on personalized data, including even location tracking? I use such tools all the time, but there are certainly ways to provide services and value without this level of unchecked surveillance. But it’s wishful thinking to expect companies to provide those services in a more privacy-preserving manner without regulation that forces them to do so. I was happy to see Apple switch the defaults for tracking in 2021, but I’m not happy that it was because of a decision by one powerful company — what oligopoly giveth, oligopoly can taketh away. We didn’t elect Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, to be the sovereign of our digital world. He could change his mind. Notably, Apple’s change followed years of intense public criticism of Facebook, after privacy scandals, the election of Donald Trump, Brexit and so on. None of that seemed to have made a substantial dent in Facebook’s business. A single decision by Tim Cook did, clearly demonstrating where real power over this industry lies. It’s time that our own elected officials got smarter — and prioritized the public interest rather than cozy arrangements with the tech industry — to exercise that power. If the federal government can’t or won’t, states can follow California and Colorado’s lead. In 1966, California forged ahead alone to set high emission standards for cars, which then pulled along the rest of the nation and the industry. If it were all as simple as people changing their settings, Google wouldn’t be forking over a sum larger than the G.D.P. of entire countries to have Apple users start with one setting rather than another. The default way the technology industry does business needs to change now. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

But what do parents and kids think? To understand how families are grappling with generative AI, researchers at Kantar and the Family Online Safety Institute sought to find how “habits, hopes and fears” vary in the U.S., but also in Germany and Japan. The findings, released last week, showed that a majority of parents felt positive about their teens using generative AI even if they’re still concerned about the risks. Overall, Germany had the highest percentage of overall positive sentiment (70%) followed by the U.S. (66%) and Japan (59%). Japan had the highest percentage with a negative outlook, with 38% expressing a negative outlook versus 29% in the U.S. and 27% in Germany. To address the concerns, parents in all three countries mentioned data transparency as a top priority — something that teens in the U.S. and Germany also mentioned. When Kantar asked about how they’ve tried genAI tools, a majority of parents and teens mentioned using it for analytical tasks. However, a higher percentage of parents in all three countries have used it for creative tasks while teens were more likely to use it for “efficiency-boosting” tasks like grammar checks. On the other hand, parents and teens both mentioned being worried about the potential for job loss and misinformation. Teens also expressed worry about AI being used to created new forms of harassment and cyber-bullying. One of the more surprising findings in Kantar’s report: Teens said their parents knew more about AI than they did. That’s especially noteworthy after nearly two decade of the social media era, when kids adopted new platforms faster than their parents. However, that might be because parents are using AI more than social media in work settings, noted Kara Sundby, senior director of Kantar’s Futures Practice. Another possibility is that parents have gone through enough digital evolutions to become more adept at “responsible learning.” “Parents are also using this for themselves in ways that they didn’t jump on TikTok and Snap,” Sundby said. “It is more of a workhorse.” Despite the optimism Kantar uncovered, a separate survey in the U.S. and U.K. conducted by Braze found that around half of consumers are worried brands won’t use their data responsibly, with just 16% being “completely confident” or “very confident.” Only 29% said they were comfortable with brands using AI to personalize experiences for them while another 38% said they weren’t comfortable and another 33% were unsure. It’s important to understand how communities use AI systems and how they’re impacted by them, said Ashley Casovan, managing director of the AI Governance Center at the International Association of Privacy Professionals. In her prior role as managing director of the Responsible AI Institute, Casovan also helped conduct a survey of Canadians to see what they thought about AI, and found that 71% of respondents thought AI should be developed in consultation with “everyday people” while 82% thought it’s important to incorporate ethics to minimize harms. (Casovan also spent years working for the Canadian government, where she helped develop its first national policy around government use of AI.) “There is a really strong need to understand the context of how these AI systems are being used,” Casovan said. “There does need to be literacy at the end user level, which I think you can generally say is the public, although it might stop before that.” AI news: It was a wild weekend for OpenAI. On Friday, cofounder Sam Altman was ousted from his role as CEO and removed from the board while CTO Mira Murati was named as interim CEO. In a blog post about the leadership changes, OpenAI also said cofounder and president Greg Brockman was stepping down from his role as board chair but staying with the company. However, hours later, Brockman announced he’d quit. Since then, various rumors and reports have swirled related to what sparked the sudden changes and might happen next. In OpenAI’s blog post, the company said Altman’s departure came after “a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.” Major tech companies including Google, Meta, IBM and Shutterstock are adding new AI-related policies and tools to build trust, avoid risks and improve legal compliance. A new bipartisan bill in the U.S. Senate aims to bring more accountability and transparency to AI while also fostering innovation. The bill, called the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Research, Innovation, and Accountability Act, was filed last week with three Republican cosponsors along with three Democrats. Meanwhile, the FTC announced a new “voice cloning challenge” to raise awareness about the potential risks posed by AI. Major publishers including News Corp and IAC expressed that they are increasingly frustrated about generative AI companies scraping content without paying for it. A key executive at Stability AI, resigned over copyright concerns related to how the popular AI startup trains its AI models. In an op-ed about his departure, Ed Newton-Rex, who led Stability’s audio efforts, said he felt the company has “exploiting” copyrighted content by using it without permission. (Stability AI has been the target of multiple copyright lawsuits, including one from artists and another by Getty Images.) Generative AI has continued to show up in various companies’ quarterly earnings reports. Last week, Getty Images, Visa, Chegg, Alibaba and others all mentioned genAI in their results presentations. Generative AI partially contributed to the 35% growth in gross profit for Tencent’s online advertising business, the company said, citing the roles of “heightened demand for video advertisements and the innovative application of generative AI tools in creating compelling ad visuals.” Prompts and Products: Microsoft announced a number of AI updates last week during its Ignite event. Along with rebranding Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise to become Copilot — which will be available on Dec. 1 — Microsoft also announced other updates including new support for OpenAI’s GPTs, enhanced commercial data protections, more plugins and a new Copilot Studio to help people build their own standalone low-code Copilots. Microsoft also released a new report detailing how people have been using Copilots for creativity and productivity. Finally, it announced Baidu as the latest partner for its Chat Ads API. Google is experimenting with new music-related generative AI tools including a way for users to create original music clips for YouTube Shorts created by text-based prompts. In a preview released last week, the company showed how it’s working with major artists — including Charlie Puth, Demi Lovato, T-Pain, John Legend and Sia — who are providing their music for the project. IBM announced a new governance tool for its Watson portfolio called watsonx.governance that will help AI clients detect AI risks, predict potential future concerns, and monitor for things like bias, accuracy, fairness and privacy. Ally Financial announced initial results of generative AI experiment using company’s large language model. According to Ally, using the tools reduced campaign production time by 2-3 weeks while others saw a 34% time saving on various tasks. More agencies are inking new deals as a way to tap into the generative AI boom. Last week, Omnicom announced a new collaboration with Getty Images to integrate Getty’s new AI image generator into Omnicom’s Omni data orchestration platform. Meanwhile, Stagwell announced a new partnership with Google to infuse the tech giant’s AI into Stagwell Marketing Cloud.

    "originBody": "FROM AFP NEWS Australia Targets Tech Giants With 'Harmful Content' Standards By AFP - Agence France Presse November 20, 2023 Order Reprints Print Article Text size Australia's internet watchdog wants to force technology giants to crack down on deepfake child abuse material and \"pro-terror content\" under new, industry-wide protocols being developed in the country. Australia's eSafety Commissioner said Monday its standards would require tech companies to do more to tackle seriously harmful content, including \"synthetic child sexual abuse\" material created with artificial intelligence. The regulator said it had been forced to step in after giving the technology industry two years to develop its own codes. These codes \"failed to provide sufficient safeguards\", the eSafety Commissioner said, and lacked \"a strong commitment to identify and remove known child sexual abuse material\". The new standards, which have been released for consultation and still need parliamentary approval, would impact companies such as Meta, Apple and Google. \"These world-leading codes and standards cover the worst-of-the-worst online content including child sexual abuse material and pro-terror content,\" said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, a former Twitter employee. They would apply to websites, photo storage services and messaging apps, Inman Grant said. \"Our focus is on ensuring industry take meaningful steps to prevent the proliferation of seriously harmful content like child sexual abuse material.\" Previous efforts by Australia to hold tech giants accountable have proven difficult to enforce. The country passed its groundbreaking \"Online Safety Act\" in 2021, spearheading global efforts to hold tech giants accountable for what users post on social media. But attempts to exercise these sweeping new powers have occasionally been met with indifference. The eSafety Commissioner slapped Elon Musk's X with an Aus$610,500 (US$388,000) fine earlier this month, saying the company failed to show how it was scrubbing child sexual abuse content from the platform. X ignored the deadline to pay the fine, before launching ongoing legal action to have it overturned. sft/djw/lb The Barron's news department was not involved in the creation of the content above.

    "originLink": "https://wraltechwire.com/2023/11/20/this-nc-food-tech-company-is-about-more-than-crops-its-addressing-waste-hunger-as-well/",
    "originBody": "News This NC food tech company is about more than crops – it’s addressing waste, hunger as well B corporationfood techn.c. biotech centerSinnovaTek Pixabay by Jim Shamp, NCBiotech Writer — November 20, 2023 . RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK – You could call SinnovaTek a Raleigh-based food technology company. But that would miss some significant nuances. SinnovaTek is a privately held certified B corporation that is tapping its origins in North Carolina State University research, and North Carolina’s unique agricultural diversity, to upend food processing technology and, also, to address local and global agricultural waste and hunger issues. B Corp certification is a designation that a business is meeting high standards of verified performance, accountability, and transparency on factors from employee benefits and sustainability metrics to supply chain practices and corporate governance. SinnovaTek is primarily an equipment purveyor, but it has also spun out successful contract development and production businesses serving some of the nation’s largest consumer corporations, while still making it possible for small entrepreneurial North Carolina food startups to affordably test their ideas. The company’s FirstWave Innovations manufacturing subsidiary opened a small-scale facility in Raleigh in 2020, an 8,300-square-foot site for pilot manufacturing and for helping companies and entrepreneurs launch and test new products. In September FirstWave Innovations began full-scale contract processing and packaging at a new $20 million, 62,500-square-foot plant in Nash County’s Middlesex Corporate Centre, about 35 miles east of Raleigh. The company says the newly upfitted industrial shell building is now one of the most advanced food-processing factories in the world. The company expects to double its staff, with some 25 new employees by the end of this year and as many as 75 employees there by the end of 2025. SinnovaTek also markets the highly specialized food processing equipment it develops and uses, which primarily incorporates a technology called continuous-flow microwave thermal processing. It’s a platform that enables long shelf life and flavor and quality preservation of fruit- and vegetable-based fluid food products. Think of it as a flow-through truck-sized microwave oven that only zaps juicy vegetation that is being forced through tubes at precise temperatures, pressures and velocities. The process kills unwanted microbes in the slurry, but it happens quickly enough to preserve color, nutrients and other desirable properties of the plant-based fluids. Scaling production capabilities for companies big and small Building on the commercial success of SinnovaTek’s previous smaller-scale installations, FirstWave’s Middlesex site is scaling production of much larger commercial quantities of unique, nutritionally superior, shelf-stable, aseptically packaged (in a sterile environment) foods and beverages, including baby and toddler foods supplemented with “sensitive,” health-promoting ingredients. Josip Simunovic, Ph.D., a research professor at NC State’s Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, says the company achieves this level of product quality, stability and sensitive nutrient retention through a number of patented advanced processing technologies invented and developed over several decades by teams of faculty and student researchers at NC State. Simunovic, a native of the Eastern European country Croatia, has become a true North Carolina transplant since earning his doctorate at NC State in 1998. He was mentored by Kenneth Swartzel, William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor Emeritus who is another aseptic processing pioneer and inventor. Simunovic has since led numerous teams of faculty and student researchers at the Raleigh university. Licensing and commercializing the resulting technologies from NC State, he helped start more than 10 companies. He co-founded SinnovaTek in 2015 with President and CEO Michael Druga and Chief Innovation Officer Amanda Vargochik, who earned her master’s in food science at NC State. Simunovic serves as the company’s chief science officer. Another subsidiary, SinnoVita, provides R&D services to perfect ingredients in a wide range of plant-based foods. Simunovic says one the founders’ shared goals is to open consumers’ minds to the reality that Josip Simunovic, Michael Druga, and Amanda Vargochik in FirstWave facility. -Photo from FirstWave processed foods, when processed correctly, can be tasty and nutritious. Importantly, the company’s unique patent portfolio also includes novel systems for temperature and flow measurements and safety validation of both homogeneous and complex particulate foods. These have led to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s clearance and the company’s market introduction of more than 200 new food and beverage products under a variety of brands, including those of some of the largest global consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies as well as small local, innovative startups. “Right now we have about half a dozen brand owners with a dozen products lined up to start production at our new Middlesex facility,” said Simunovic. “Dr. Simunovic is a true genius and innovator who has contributed immensely to North Carolina’s agricultural infrastructure,” said Nandini Mendu, Ph.D., senior director of evaluation with the North Carolina Biotechnology Center’s focused initiative team. “We are delighted to have this FirstWave opening to expand our ag tech and food tech visibility worldwide.” In an interview with NCBiotech, Simunovic said the first industrial application of the technology spinning out of his lab came several years before he and his colleagues established SinnovaTek. It was actually with Yamco, a Snow Hill-based association of North Carolina sweet potato growers and farmers. “North Carolina has long been the nation’s largest producer of sweetpotatoes,” he said, “in large part because NC State had a fantastic multigenerational team developing varieties that helped our farmers maintain the lead.” Getting it right around the holiday table One related item in which North Carolina has played a leadership role: those involved in the industry have stumped for a universal change in the spelling of “sweet potato” for more than 30 years, to make it one word. In 2019, the North Carolina Sweetpotato Commission lobbied the general assembly to officially change the spelling of the state vegetable to “sweetpotato.” The measure passed and was signed into law by the governor. Advocates note that sweetpotato is a noun and not an adjective. They say “sweet” is not a descriptor, but part of the actual nomenclature for the vegetable technically known as Ipomoea batatas. This is different than a potato which uses adjectives like white, red or russet to describe Solanum tuberosum, an entirely different vegetable. And by the way, yams (Dioscorea sp.) are not even grown in the U.S. commercially. If you haven’t spent time in Africa, the Caribbean, South America or other areas where yams are cultivated, you’ve probably never even tasted one of the starchy tubers that are true yams.

For example, sweetpotatoes were previously generally grown in North Carolina only to be marketed as baking potatoes, with a small number also used in canning operations. That meant North Carolina farmers left about 40% of their crop on the ground to rot, also distributing some in bulk containers to food banks, because those sweetpotatoes didn’t satisfy the size and shape requirements of the ideal baking potato that make it to grocery stores. Then, along came the Simunovic technology, which later also got a major boost with a grant from NC State’s Chancellor’s Innovation Fund in 2014. “We’d spent more than a decade at NC State working to develop a prototype system for effective food preservation,” recalled Simunovic. “Then one day we had a visit from Ron Fish, the assistant director of agribusiness with the NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. He arranged a meeting with us and a team of sweetpotato growers.” At that time, says Simunovic, North Carolina led the nation in sweetpotato production by a margin of 34%. “Soon we were able to produce a sweetpotato purée with our process, so the size and shape of a sweetpotato no longer mattered,” he said. The growers could scoop up all their crop, send the baking potatoes to that market, and process the former waste items into this purée that eventually ended up in hundreds of new, nutritionally enriched products. Some of the leftovers even became Covington, the first sweetpotato vodka in the market, named after the patented sweetpotato variety developed by the NC State scientist Henry M. Covington. “The sweetpotato canning operations previously had to use an outdated, severe thermal process for a purée to be shelf stable, and it would lose 70% of thermosensitive nutrients like beta-carotene,” said Simunovic. “Our microwave aseptic process allows it to save 97% to 98% of beta-carotene, also known as pro-vitamin A.” The rest, as they say, was history. Food companies now use sweetpotato purées in a lot of important products, Simunovic noted. In fact, each year SinnovaTek microwave technologies help turn millions of pounds of sweetpotatoes, carrots, mangoes, berries, apples, grapes and other foods once destined to rot into products such as purées or soups, smoothies and sauces. Food processed by FirstWave has a shelf life of a year to 18 months without refrigeration, Simunovic explained. “We like to say that before we started that process, North Carolina was #1 in sweetpotato production by 34%, but still leaving 40% of the crop on the ground,” he said. “Now, 15 years later, North Carolina is still first – but now by 60% – even though sweetpotato production in the U.S. has doubled! We like to believe our process was part of that growth for North Carolina.” Farmers around the world struggle with losses from food waste, Simunovic said, especially in Africa, where it often claims 70% to 80% of crops, partly due to small and inefficient distribution systems, lack of reliable electric grids and other struggles. As a result, SinnovaTek helped establish a food processing facility in Kenya in 2020, and it’s developing another in South Africa. More new opportunities are unfolding “Our products are still all homogeneous fluids, but beyond what we’re marketing now is the ability to make beverages and foods containing particulates,” said Simunovic. “We hope to be able to introduce things like bubble teas, and particle-loaded soups like minestrone and stews like goulash. These are still very much under development.” Simunovic is like a kid in a candy store when he talks about the historic spool-up and now the successes and future possibilities. “There were ups and downs and numerous explosions, but the technology is just magical,” he muses. “The ability to prevent both microbial spoilage and growth of pathogenic microorganisms depends on the temperature level achieved during sterilization. The higher the temp, the more efficient the inactivation is. For every 10 degrees Celsius you go beyond the 121-degree Celsius sterilization used in conventional canning, the effective rate of inactivation of pathogenic spores increases 10 times. “The process, therefore, is timewise divided by 10 at that higher temperature. Therefore, our ability to preserve nutrients and flavors and colors and vitamins gets better as we go up in sterilization temperature. That is the theory behind the science of our technologies.” Microwave technology turned out to do the trick. “The pathway the food must go through in microwave is much shorter in time, sometimes 100 times shorter than in canning. The resulting products are safe, shelf stable and have superior sensory and nutritional quality.” He says he’s especially enthusiastic about baby foods because they fit well into the FirstWave sweet spot. “Our biggest focus now is baby and toddler foods in aseptic pouches,” he said. “We don’t do our own brands. We co-pack for others. And the major advantage for the companies working with us is that the flavors, nutrients and their added supplements are preserved.” Both SinnovaTek and FirstWave have been recognized with many industry, professional and government awards for innovation, product quality, sustainability and service. Simunovic was also recently recognized with a Lifetime Achievement Award by the International Association for Engineering and Foods. (C) N.C.
