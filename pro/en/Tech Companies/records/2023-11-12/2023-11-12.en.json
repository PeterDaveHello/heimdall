    "originBody": "NEWS Fresno tech company founders charged with $100M fraud scheme that bankrolled lavish salaries By Katherine Donlevy Published Nov. 11, 2023, 11:30 p.m. ET MORE ON: FRAUD The Great Grift: COVID fraudster used stolen relief aid to buy private island in Florida Don Jr. to be called as first defense witness at fraud trial: Trump legal team Artist’s courtroom sketch of Ivanka Trump panned: ‘This feels like a grudge’ Ivanka Trump testified she got advice from husband Jared Kushner on real estate financing deals The founders of a failed California tech company were charged by federal authorities Thursday for their roles in a $100 million fraud scheme in which they bankrolled their lavish lifestyles and hefty salaries. Irma Olguin, Jr. and Jake Soberal, who headed the Fresno-based startup Bitwise Industries, surrendered to authorities on charges they conspired to commit wire fraud and took millions of dollars from various businesses and individuals, the US attorney for the Eastern District of California announced. The pair allegedly created a tangled web of lies and fabricated documents to create the illusion the private technology company was succeeding. They are accused of fabricating bank statements, lying to investors, providing false financial information to their board of directors, forging documents, and using buildings Bitwise no longer even owned as collateral for loans, “all while lining their own pockets,” United States Attorney Phillip Talbert said in a press release. Olguin and Soberal allegedly agreed to start their complicated string of lies in January 2022, 16 months before Bitwise abruptly collapsed — despite recent reports the company was worth over $500,000,000 and was financially sound. The duo allegedly faked its financial records to obtain investments, loans and other funding, which they put toward Bitwise’s payroll and fringe benefits, outfitting the company’s office spaces and repaying debts owed to prior lenders. Irma Olguin, Jr. and Jake Soberal allegedly agreed to fake the success of Bitwise Industries to gain investor funding. SFGATE They also took care to fulfill their own $600,000 annual salaries, investigators said. When the scheme was finally exposed in May 2023, the company’s 900 employees and apprentices were immediately furloughed and later laid off. Olguin and Soberal were fired by the company’s board of directors and Bitwise filed for bankruptcy protection the following month. Bitwise Industries abruptly collapsed in May 2023, leaving 900 employees without jobs. SFGATE “These sorts of white-collar crimes often root from greed and mismanagement and leave hard-working tax-paying citizens damaged in their wake,” Mark Silva, IRS Criminal Investigation Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Oakland Field Office, said in a statement. The pair have admitted to carrying out the scheme, but plead not guilty in court in a Fresno courthouse Thursday. SEE ALSO Fake ‘billionaire rabbi’ who tried to buy Lord & Taylor gets 8 years in jail They claimed they did so in a genuine effort to resuscitate the dying business. “Jake and Irma have taken full responsibility for the mistakes they made while trying to preserve Bitwise. Their sincere desire not to see Bitwise fail caused them to make numerous grave and consequential errors in judgment,” lawyers for Soberal and Olguin said in a statement. Both have agreed to a bar preventing them from serving as officers or directors of public companies, as well as other penalties, the SEC said. If convicted, the two face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images The Observer Data protection Private UK health data donated for medical research shared with insurance companies Observer investigation reveals UK Biobank opened its biomedical database to insurance firms despite pledge it would not do so Shanti Das Sun 12 Nov 2023 02.00 EST Sensitive health information donated for medical research by half a million UK citizens has been shared with insurance companies despite a pledge that it would not be. An Observer investigation has found that UK Biobank opened up its vast biomedical database to insurance sector firms several times between 2020 and 2023. The data was provided to insurance consultancy and tech firms for projects to create digital tools that help insurers predict a person’s risk of getting a chronic disease. The findings have raised concerns among geneticists, data privacy experts and campaigners over vetting and ethical checks at Biobank. Set up in 2006 to help researchers investigating diseases, the database contains millions of blood, saliva and urine samples, collected regularly from about 500,000 adult volunteers – along with medical records, scans, wearable device data and lifestyle information. Approved researchers around the world can pay £3,000 to £9,000 to access records ranging from medical history and lifestyle information to whole genome sequencing data. The resulting research has yielded major medical discoveries and led to Biobank being considered a “jewel in the crown” of British science. Biobank said it strictly guarded access to its data, only allowing access by bona fide researchers for health-related projects in the public interest. It said this included researchers of all stripes, whether employed by academic, charitable or commercial organisations – including insurance companies – and that “information about data sharing was clearly set out to participants at the point of recruitment and the initial assessment”. But evidence gathered by the Observer suggests Biobank did not explicitly tell participants it would share data with insurance companies – and made several public commitments not to do so. When the project was announced, in 2002, Biobank promised that data would not be given to insurance companies after concerns were raised that it could be used in a discriminatory way, such as by the exclusion of people with a particular genetic makeup from insurance. In an FAQ section on the Biobank website, participants were told: “Insurance companies will not be allowed access to any individual results nor will they be allowed access to anonymised data.” The statement remained online until February 2006, during which time the Biobank project was subject to public scrutiny and discussed in parliament. The promise was also reiterated in several public statements by backers of Biobank, who said safeguards would be built in to ensure that “no insurance company or police force or employer will have access”. This weekend, Biobank said the pledge – made repeatedly over four years – no longer applied. It said the commitment had been made before recruitment formally began in 2007 and that when Biobank volunteers enrolled they were given revised information. This included leaflets and consent forms that contained a provision that anonymised Biobank data could be shared with private firms for “health-related” research, but did not explicitly mention insurance firms or correct the previous assurances. Biobank also said commitments that “insurance companies ... will not be given any individual’s information, samples or test results” – repeated in leaflets over a 17-year period – meant to refer to identifiable information, such as that which is linked to a person’s name, rather than to other data about Biobank participants. The exact nature of the data shared with the insurance industry is not clear because Biobank does not routinely publish this and has declined so far to say. Summaries of the projects published online suggest it included de-identified, participant-level data on diseases, lifestyle and biomarkers. One company granted access, ReMark International, is a “global insurance consultancy” that underwrites a million policies a year and lists clients including Legal & General and MetLife. In its application to Biobank, approved in December 2022, the company said it needed data to develop an algorithm to predict diseases and death, using hospital records and smartwatch data to examine the relationship between lifestyle, mental health and biomarkers. Another firm given Biobank data, Lydia.ai, is a Canadian “insurtech” firm that wants to give people “personalised and predictive health scores”. The company says insurers work with it to “leverage new sources of data to make risk predictions”. It was granted access to Biobank data in January for a project linking health records to lifestyle data to “predict chronic diseases”. Club Vita, a “longevity data analytics company for pension funds & their advisors, insurers, reinsurers and asset managers” – whose clients include 400 pension funds and 25 insurers – was also granted access. Its project sought to assess data on morbidity outcomes using a range of risk factors such as gender, diseases, treatment, location and lifestyle. Prof Yves Moreau, a genetics and AI expert who has worked on projects using data from UK Biobank, said the data-sharing appeared to be a “serious and disturbing breach of trust”. He said the idea that Biobank’s public commitments could be “silently superseded” by leaflets was “weak”, and questioned whether participants understood that data could be shared with insurance firms. “The data looks very mundane – a bunch of measurements. But there are really major impacts,” he said. Prof Sandra Wachter, an expert in technology and regulation at the Oxford Internet Institute, said the cases risked eroding the trust of volunteers who “donated their data for a good cause”. She said the development of insurance products to “predict if someone will get sick” raised serious ethical concerns. Sam Smith, coordinator of medConfidential, which campaigns for the privacy of health data, said people gave data to Biobank to “help cure diseases”, not so it could be used by the insurance industry. He said: “Biobank must tell every participant what data was shared with insurance companies and why.” Biobank said it rejected any suggestion that data had ever been shared for uses that volunteers had not consented to, and said it was wrong to suggest that prior promises – which pre-dated formal enrolment at Biobank – should still apply. It added that researchers worked for “all manner of companies”, and that provided they passed its “stringent access protocols”, they could conduct research using Biobank data. Research by insurance companies into how lifestyle behaviours can improve health or help identify health risks was “consistent with being health-related and in the public interest”, it said. It added that it had consulted independent ethicists “at length” about commercial data sharing, and that “complex” applications were referred to an expert committee. Prof Naomi Allen, chief scientist at UK Biobank, said: “Our careful processes have been followed in all these cases. De-identified health data has been shared because these are bona fide researchers working on health-related research, including looking at what impacts human health and longevity – and that is what our participants signed up to help with.” There is no suggestion that Biobank data has ever been used by insurers to make direct decisions about individual policies. No physical biological samples were shared. As well as insurance sector firms, Biobank data has also been given to other companies that are not directly health-related, including pension funds and investment firms, project records show. In another case that has raised questions for Biobank, a California company whose website is covered in spelling mistakes was granted access to data. Flying Troika LLC’s website says it is a “pure research lab” offering “deep larning” solutions in sectors including insurance, pharma, manufacturing and retail. It says it has teams in 13 cities, including “Maimi” and Edinburgh. The company is understood to have sought genetic data, MRI scans and other information in April 2021, to develop a “novel AI model” that can predict ageing processes. Prof David Leslie, director of ethics and responsible innovation at the Alan Turing Institute, said: “Making explicit … just how each of these projects counted as data being used for medical projects in the public interest would seem essential for maintaining public trust.” The Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s data privacy watchdog, is considering the matter. It said: “People have the right to expect that organisations will handle their information securely and that it will only be used for the purpose they are told or agree to. Organisations must provide clear, accurate and comprehensive information … especially where sensitive personal information is involved.” Fears over China’s access to genetic data of UK citizens Read more Explore more on these topics Data protection The Observer Medical research Health Privacy Insurance industry Big data Biotechnology industry news Reuse this content",

    "originBody": "Pro Intel quietly invested in a startup that uses AMD CPU to get rid of the \"colostomy bag on the side of the switch\" — Oxide has a plan that could make the world's biggest tech companies a bit anxious News By Keumars Afifi-Sabet published 11 November 2023 The cloud servers-for-purchase are powered by an AMD EPYC Milan CPU (Image credit: Oxide) Intel is one of several companies that have ploughed $44 billion into Oxide, a startup that wants to change the face of on-premise and cloud servers with a minimalist design. Oxide’s mission has revolved around provisioning cloud-facing servers for purchase, rather than just for rent, for businesses primarily concerned with keeping IT infrastructure on-premises. The firm is combining this approach with its co-designing of hardware and software suited to the purpose. Oxide ships its rack ith everything installed in one box, rather than the “rack-and-stack” approach that sees servers arrive with additional cabling and hardware. Its servers have no hard-coded quotas for switching or routing, with customers able to program the switch. The firm has also replaced the baseboard management controller with a service processor, which can handle power cycling and remote management of servers. A bare-bones cloud computer you can buy The company first outlined the concept of reequipping servers in 2019, and has since developed its own components and software to manage workloads and networking. Servers are ordinarily designed to combine stacks of software and hardware layers that take software further away from chipsets, according to the firm. But this minimalist approach brings the software much closer to the silicon. “We felt like it was a real shame to have a traditional switch,” said Oxide CTO Bryan Cantrill, according to HPCWire. “x86 is a kind of a colostomy bag on the side of the switch, where you have got this kind of low-powered Xeon D, or what have you, on that an Intel Management Engine, and a bunch of things that we didn’t want in it.” Companies like Google, AWS and Meta have built lightweight servers like this by stripping away parts, but they can’t be accessed for purchase – only for rent by tapping into their services. The likes of Dell and HPE also haven’t yet developed barebones cloud servers yet, which is where Oxide is hoping to step in. Its system uses AMD EPYC Milan CPUs in compute sleds that also include the memory, storage and networking components. These are the basis for the servers, and can even handle tasks like VM management, with customers no longer needing to operate software from VMware or OpenStack.

    "originLink": "https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/technology/personalized-ai-agents.html",
    "originBody": "A.I. and Chatbots Meet the New ChatGPT Meta’s A.I. Characters ChatGPT’s Image Generator Google’s Bard Extensions ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT THE SHIFT Personalized A.I. Agents Are Here. Is the World Ready for Them? The age of autonomous A.I. assistants could have huge implications. Share full article Sam Altman is the chief executive of OpenAI, which is introducing personalized chatbots. Credit... Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Kevin Roose Published Nov. 10, 2023 Updated Nov. 11, 2023 You could think of the recent history of A.I. chatbots as having two distinct phases. The first, which kicked off last year with the release of ChatGPT and continues to this day, consists mainly of chatbots capable of talking about things. Greek mythology, vegan recipes, Python scripts — you name the topic and ChatGPT and its ilk can generate some convincing (if occasionally generic or inaccurate) text about it. That ability is impressive, and frequently useful, but it is really just a prelude to the second phase: artificial intelligence that can actually do things. Very soon, tech companies tell us, A.I. “agents” will be able to send emails and schedule meetings for us, book restaurant reservations and plane tickets, and handle complex tasks like “negotiate a raise with my boss” or “buy Christmas presents for all my family members.” That phase, though still remote, came a little closer on Monday when OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, announced that users could now create their own, personalized chatbots. I got an early taste of these chatbots, which the company calls GPTs — and which will be available to paying ChatGPT Plus users and enterprise customers. They differ from the regular ChatGPT in a few important ways. First, they are programmed for specific tasks. (Examples that OpenAI created include “Creative Writing Coach” and “Mocktail Mixologist,” a bot that suggests nonalcoholic drink recipes.) Second, the bots can pull from private data, such as a company’s internal H.R. documents or a database of real estate listings, and incorporate that data into their responses. Third, if you let them, the bots can plug into other parts of your online life — your calendar, your to-do list, your Slack account — and take actions using your credentials. Sound scary? It is, if you ask some A.I. safety researchers, who fear that giving bots more autonomy could lead to disaster. The Center for AI Safety, a nonprofit research organization, listed autonomous agents as one of its “catastrophic A.I. risks” this year, saying that “malicious actors could intentionally create rogue A.I.s with dangerous goals.” But there is money to be made in A.I. assistants that can do useful tasks for people, and corporate customers have been itching to train chatbots on their own data. There is also an argument that A.I. won’t truly be useful until it really understands its users — their communication styles, their likes and dislikes, what they look at and shop for online. So here we are, speeding into the age of the autonomous A.I. agent — doomers be damned. To be fair, OpenAI’s bots aren’t particularly dangerous. I got a demo of several GPTs during the company’s developer conference in San Francisco on Monday, and they mostly automated harmless tasks like creating coloring pages for children, or explaining the rules of card games. Custom GPTs also can’t really do much yet, beyond searching through documents and plugging into common apps. One demo I saw on Monday involved an OpenAI employee asking a GPT to look up conflicting meetings on her Google calendar and send a Slack message to her boss. Another happened onstage when Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, built a “start-up mentor” chatbot to give advice to aspiring founders, based on an uploaded file of a speech he had given years earlier. These might seem like gimmicks. But the idea of customizing our chatbots, and allowing them to take actions on our behalf, represents an important step in what Mr. Altman calls OpenAI’s strategy of “gradual iterative deployment” — releasing small improvements to A.I. at a fast pace, rather than big leaps over extended periods. For now, OpenAI’s bots are limited to simple, well-defined tasks, and can’t handle complex planning or long sequences of actions. Eventually, Mr. Altman said on Monday, users will be able to offer their GPTs to the public through OpenAI’s version of an app store. (He was light on details, but said the company planned to share some of its revenue with the makers of popular GPTs.) OpenAI has made it very easy to build a custom GPT, even if you don’t know a line of code. Just answer a few simple questions about your bot — its name, its purpose, what tone it should use when responding to users — and the bot builds itself in just a few seconds. Users can edit its instructions, connect it to other apps or upload files they want it to use as reference material. (And to answer the question going through every corporate lawyer’s head right now: OpenAI says it doesn’t use uploaded files to train its A.I. models.) Image For now, OpenAI’s bots are limited to simple, well-defined tasks, and can’t handle complex planning or long sequences of actions. After OpenAI gave me early access to its custom GPT creator, I spent several days playing around with it. The first custom bot I made was “Day Care Helper,” a tool for responding to questions about my son’s day care. As the sleep-deprived parent of a toddler, I’m always forgetting details — whether we can send a snack with peanuts or not, whether day care is open or closed for certain holidays — and looking everything up in the parent handbook is a pain. So I uploaded the parent handbook to OpenAI’s GPT creator tool, and in a matter of seconds, I had a chatbot that I could use to easily look up the answers to my questions. It worked impressively well, especially after I changed its instructions to clarify that it was supposed to respond using only information from the handbook, and not make up an answer to questions the handbook didn’t address. Image After a day care’s handbook was uploaded to OpenAI’s GPT creator tool, a chatbot could easily look up answers to questions about it. Image A screenshot of a GPT “Day Care Helper” conversation between the author and the chatbot about circle time. My second chatbot was called “Grandpa Roose’s Financial Advice.” It was based on another document — a 23-page advice booklet that was written by my grandfather, an economist and passionate stock picker, with all his collected wisdom about financial planning over the years when he was alive. It’s a document I’ve consulted occasionally, and I wondered if, by putting it inside a chatbot, I might be inspired to use it more frequently. I uploaded the text of the booklet, and less than five minutes later I had a chatbot that could parrot my grandfather’s financial advice and answer questions in something vaguely resembling his voice. (Although, amusingly, it often slipped from folksy grandpa-speak back to ChatGPT boilerplate in the middle of an answer, such as when it answered a question about Tesla stock by saying, “It’s like I always say, before making any specific investment decision, such as buying Tesla stock, it’s crucial to evaluate your own investment goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon.”) None of my custom chatbots worked perfectly, and there was plenty they couldn’t do. But if you squint, you can see hints of the kinds of jobs that autonomous A.I. agents could replace, if they actually work. Imagine the benefits department at a big company. On a regular day, benefits administrators might spend 20 percent of their time answering employee questions like, “Does our dental insurance cover orthodontics?” or “What forms do I need to fill out to apply for parental leave?” Build a chatbot to answer those questions and you might free those administrators to do higher-value tasks — or you might just need 20 percent fewer of them. Or imagine a company that trains A.I. agents to respond to the vast majority of customer service requests by feeding them information and hooking them up to a database of past customer problems. Would that company’s customer service department shrink? Could it eventually be as good as, or superior to, a customer service department staffed by humans? Don’t get me wrong — I’m not saying millions of jobs will disappear tomorrow, or that OpenAI’s customized GPTs are the harbingers of doom. They seem fairly harmless and limited in their scope, and nothing I saw this week worried me on an existential level. But making A.I. agents more autonomous, giving them access to our personal data and embedding them inside every app we use has profound, head-spinning implications. Soon, if the predictions are right, A.I.s could get to know us on a deep level — perhaps, in some cases, better than we know ourselves — and will be able to perform complex actions with or without our oversight. If OpenAI is right, we may be transitioning to a world in which A.I.s are less our creative partners than silicon-based extensions of us — artificial satellite brains that can move throughout the world, gathering information and taking actions on our behalf. I’m not fully prepared for that world yet, but by the looks of things, I’d better start getting ready. Kevin Roose is a Times technology columnist and a host of the podcast “Hard Fork.” More about Kevin Roose Share full article Explore Our Coverage of Artificial Intelligence Latest News Research from Vectara, a new start-up founded by former Google employees, estimates that chatbots invent information at least 3% of the time — and as high as 27%. Experts call this chatbot behavior “hallucination.” Rishi Sunak, the prime minister of Britain, hosted dozens of government leaders, tech executives and other experts as part of the A.I. Safety Summit he organized to discuss the dangers of the technology. President Biden signed a far-reaching executive order on A.I. that imposes new rules on companies and directs federal agencies to begin putting guardrails around the technology. The Age of A.I. The F.D.A. has approved many new medical products that use A.I., but doctors remain skeptical of these tools. A nonprofit led by a respected computer scientist is trying to democratize A.I. by building a freely available alternative to those offered by the likes of Google and OpenAI. OpenAI now lets outside businesses and independent developers tweak what its chatbot does. A new paper says that can lead to trouble. Advances in A.I. are offering new ways for bad actors to misappropriate online content of children. That is posing new risks for parents posting about their children on social media. Researchers at Anthropic asked roughly 1,000 Americans to write rules for their chatbot. The results could be a model for future kinds of A.I. governance. Leading A.I. researchers are transforming chatbots into a new kind of autonomous system called an A.I. agent that can play games, query websites, schedule meetings and build bar charts.

OpenAI unveiled the latest version of the technology that underpins its viral ChatGPT chatbot. Elon Musk announced a sarcastic AI ChatGPT rival called Grok coming to his platform, X, formerly known as Twitter. There was a Senate subcommittee hearing about AI regulation in the healthcare space, a targeted attack against OpenAI and the first wearable AI device that intends to one day replace the smartphone. “These significant announcements are indicative of the speed the AI market is moving at,” said Reece Hayden, an analyst at ABI Research. Hayden noted the week’s development exemplified what’s unfolding in the industry. AI community continues to balance the risk of unintended consequences by moving too fast while moving as quickly as possible to remain competitive and innovative. “Overall, it [was] a huge week,” Hayden added. Here’s a closer look at everything you need to know about the week in AI: OpenAI’s big day OpenAI hosted its first developer conference about a year after the launch of ChatGPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. The company unveiled a series of AI tool updates, including the ability for developers to create custom versions of ChatGPT called GPTs. Similar to plugins, GPTs can connect to databases, be used in emails or facilitate e-commerce orders. CEO Sam Altman, in a few minutes, demonstrated how easy it is for anyone to create a GPT without any prior coding experience. The company is also rolling out a GPT Store, starting later this month, to allow GPTs to become searchable. Similar to other app stores, they’ll be listed on a leaderboard, and the company will highlight useful tools across categories such as productivity, education and “just for fun.” Hayden said the announcements, as well as the Apple-like Keynote structure and focus on developers, signaled their intention to “solve their commercial strategic challenges,” which include high costs and limited revenue sources, by building a strong developer ecosystem. Altman also showed off GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. He said it now can support input that’s equal to about 300 pages of a standard book, about 16 times longer than the previous iteration. Altman shared more about the platform’s growth, too: About 2 million developers now use the platform and about 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally. It currently has 100 million active users. Humane’s Ai Pin Humane, a startup founded by former Apple employees, introduced its first AI wearable device called the Ai Pin, a small blinking gadget that attaches to clothing. It intends to eventually replace smartphones by projecting information onto a user’s hands, offering the ability to answer phone calls and perform various tasks without holding a smartphone. The company said it also features a handful of AI-powered tools, including the ability to search, send messages and manage email clutter. The Ai pin, which runs on a Snapdragon processor and boasts a Qualcomm AI engine, is packed with depth and motion sensors, features an ultra-wide camera and a laser ink display. Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at Gartner, said the unveiling marked an “important step in futuristic hardware design for generative and an exploration of a potentially new way of human and machine interaction.” Still, it’s unclear what adoption could look like. Although the company promises an all-day battery, Hayden said the biggest challenge for on-device AI deployment is battery life. “Given that this device is so small and claims to offer multiple different behaviors and use cases and can sense data to inform the model, it will be interesting to see if the battery life is suitable.” Other concerns exist, too: “Always-on AI that collects and processes data will really take a leap of faith from society which at present most are unlikely to take,” Hayden said. The Ai Pin, which starts at $699, will go on sale in the US on Thursday, November 16. The arrival of Grok xAI said in a blog post it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams. “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” xAI said in the post. Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI unveiled a chatbot called Grok for some users of X, which he suggested has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own. Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year, said Grok is trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform. Musk said Grok is still in the early stages of testing but will soon come to X’s Premium+ service in the US, which includes features such as the blue checkmark for $16 a month. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down as chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the co?mpany’s direction. A targeted attack Two days after the developer conference, OpenAI experienced large-scale outages to its services, which it later attributed to potential targeted attacks on its servers. The company wrote on its website Wednesday evening that it is “dealing with periodic outages due to an abnormal traffic pattern reflective of a DDoS attack.” A DDoS attack, or distributed denial of service, typically refers to an attacker that floods an internet server to disrupt normal traffic. Users on Wednesday were unable to access all of OpenAI’s tools and services and received a message that the platform was at capacity. The company told CNN no user information was compromised. More on AI Major tech companies continue to double down on AI, too. Reuters reported Amazon is investing millions of dollars on training an AI codenamed “Olympus,” which is expected to have double the amount of “parameters,” or building blocks that make AI smarter than OpenAI’s GPT-4 model In addition, YouTube is testing AI tools that answers questions about content, makes recommendations and summarizes topics in the comment sections of videos. Chandrasekaran said that while not all companies will create huge AI models, many will continue to build smaller and specific ones to improve their products, automate tasks and gain a competitive edge. - CNN’s Anna Coobin contributed to this report The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Summary UAE hopes to moderate Israel's Gaza campaign Hamas seen by Abu Dhabi as existential threat UAE has close economic, security ties with Israel ABU DHABI, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates plans to maintain diplomatic ties with Israel despite international outcry over the mounting toll of the war in Gaza and hopes to have some moderating influence over the Israeli campaign while safeguarding its own interests, according to four sources familiar with UAE government policy. Abu Dhabi became the most prominent Arab nation to establish diplomatic ties with Israel in 30 years under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. That paved the way for other Arab states to forge their own ties with Israel by breaking a taboo on normalising relations without the creation of a Palestinian state. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The mounting death toll from Israel's invasion of the Gaza Strip – launched in retaliation for cross-border attacks on Oct. 7 by the Hamas militant group that governs the enclave – have stirred outrage in Arab capitals. UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke last month with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. UAE officials have publicly condemned Israel's actions and repeatedly called for an end to the violence. Advertisement · Scroll to continue In response to a request for comment for this story, an Emirati official said the UAE's immediate priority was to secure a ceasefire and to open up humanitarian corridors. The Gulf Arab power, backed by its oil wealth, wields significant influence in regional affairs. It also serves as a security partner of the United States, hosting American forces. As well as speaking to Israel, the UAE has worked to moderate public positions taken by Arab states so that once the war ends there is the possibility of a return to a broad dialogue, said the four sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Sheikh Mohamed met in Abu Dhabi on Thursday with Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to discuss calls for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, amid Qatari-brokered talks for the release of a limited number of hostages in return for a break in the fighting. \"The UAE and Qatar stand firm in urging the need to advance de-escalation efforts and secure a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace in the region,\" Sheikh Mohamed said on social media after their discussions. Despite closer economic and security ties with Israel forged over the past three years, Abu Dhabi has had little apparent success in reining in the Gaza offensive, which has led to the death of more than 11,000 people, according to Palestinian officials. Hamas killed around 1,200 people in its surprise attack on Israel and some 240 hostages were taken, Israeli authorities have said. Amid the impasse, the UAE has grown increasingly frustrated with its most important security partner Washington, which it believes is not exerting enough pressure to end the war, the four sources said. Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE president, said this week that Washington needed to end the conflict swiftly and initiate a process to resolve the decades old Israeli-Palestinian issue by addressing refugees, borders and East Jerusalem. The UAE has publicly expressed concern that the war now risks igniting regional tensions and a new wave of extremism in the Middle East. Speaking on Oct. 18 at the UN Security Council, where the UAE holds a rotating seat, ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said that Abu Dhabi had sought via the Abraham Accords with Israel and the United States to deliver prosperity and security in a new Middle East through cooperation and peaceful co-existence. \"The indiscriminate damage visited upon the people of Gaza in pursuit of Israel's security risks extinguishing that hope,\" she said. A senior European official told Reuters that Arab states had recognised now that it was not possible to build ties with Israel without addressing the Palestinian issue. Israel's foreign ministry declined to comment for this story. NO BREAK IN TIES The UAE continues to host an Israeli ambassador and there was no prospect of an end to diplomatic ties, which represented a longer-term strategic priority by Abu Dhabi, the sources said. The accord was motivated, in part, by shared concerns over the threat posed by Iran, as well as a broader economic-driven realignment of Abu Dhabi's foreign policy. The UAE sees Iran as a threat to regional security, although in recent years it has taken diplomatic steps to de-escalate tensions. Israel and the UAE have developed close economic and security ties in the three years since normalisation, including defence cooperation. Israel supplied the UAE with air defense systems after missile and drone attacks on Abu Dhabi in early 2022 by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen. Bilateral trade has exceeded $6 billion since 2020, according to Israeli government data. Israeli tourists have thronged hotels, beaches and shopping centres in the UAE, which is an OPEC oil power and a regional business hub. \"They (UAE) have gains that they don't want to lose,\" said one of the sources, a senior diplomat based in the Middle East. Even prior to the Oct. 7 attack, however, Abu Dhabi was concerned by the failure of Israel's right-wing government to curb expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and repeated visits by right-wing religious Israelis to the compound that houses the Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site in Islam. The compound, revered by Jews as a vestige of their two ancient temples, has long been a flashpoint of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. None of four sources ruled out that the UAE could downgrade or sever its ties if the crisis escalated. Sources said that the displacement of the Palestinian population from the Gaza Strip or the West Bank into Egypt or Jordan was a red line for Abu Dhabi. James Dorsey, a senior fellow at the National University of Singapore, said the war in Gaza had discredited the notion that economic cooperation on its own could build a stable region. \"The new Middle East was being built on very fragile ground,\" he told Reuters. DISTANCED FROM HAMAS Israel has rejected international calls for an immediate ceasefire: Netanyahu has said there would be no halt to its attack until hostages are returned. His government has pledged to destroy Hamas, which is classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. While criticising Israel's conduct of the war, Abu Dhabi has also condemned Hamas for its attack. The UAE sees the Palestinian militant group and other Islamists as a threat to the stability of the Middle East and beyond. \"Hamas is not their favourite organisation,\" said one of the sources. \"It is Muslim Brotherhood after all.\" The UAE has led the charge against Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist organisation in the Arab World. It helped Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi topple Mohammed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in a military takeover in 2013 that followed mass protests against his rule. The UAE provided Egypt with billions of dollars in support following Mursi's ouster. Abu Dhabi also abandoned Sudan's former Islamist president Omar Hassan al-Bashir in 2019, ultimately leading to the fall of the Muslim Brotherhood's grip on power there after it had dominated Sudanese politics for decades. The UAE had previously pumped billions of dollars into Sudan's coffers.
