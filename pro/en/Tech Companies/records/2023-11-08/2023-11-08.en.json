    "originBody": "CFPB Proposes New Federal Oversight of Big Tech Companies and Other Providers of Digital Wallets and Payment Apps Proposed rule would subject large players to the same supervisory exam process as banks NOV 07, 2023 Share & print WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is proposing to supervise larger nonbank companies that offer services like digital wallets and payment apps. Driven largely by Big Tech and other large technology firms, digital payment apps and wallets continue to grow in popularity, but many of the companies are not subject to CFPB supervisory examinations. The rule proposed today would ensure that these nonbank financial companies – specifically those larger companies handling more than 5 million transactions per year – adhere to the same rules as large banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions already supervised by the CFPB. \"Payment systems are critical infrastructure for our economy. These activities used to be conducted almost exclusively by supervised banks,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. \"Today's rule would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight.\" Digital applications now help millions of people to send money to friends and family, as well as to help them make a variety of consumer retail payment transactions. These digital applications have a share of ecommerce payments volume that is similar to or greater than traditional payment methods, such as credit cards and debit cards. Such applications also have gained a significant volume of in-person retail spending. Amid growing merchant acceptance of general-use digital consumer payment applications, consumers with middle and lower incomes use digital consumer payment applications for a share of their overall retail spending that rivals or exceeds their use of cash. However, complaints about these applications and the companies that run them have been rising in recent years. Big Tech and other companies operating in consumer finance markets blur the traditional lines that have separated banking and payments from commercial activities. The CFPB has found that this blurring can put consumers at risk, especially when the same traditional banking safeguards, like deposit insurance, may not apply. Despite their impact on consumer finance, Big Tech and other nonbank companies operating in the payments sphere do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny and oversight as banks and credit unions. While the CFPB has enforcement authority over these companies, the CFPB has not previously had, inside many of these firms, examiners carefully scrutinizing their activities to ensure they are following the law and monitoring their executives. The proposed rule would subject larger nonbank digital consumer payment companies to the CFPB’s authority to conduct examinations, helping to ensure consistent application of federal consumer financial laws across the marketplace. Specifically, the proposed rule would help ensure these large nonbank companies: Adhere to applicable funds transfer, privacy, and other consumer protection laws: The CFPB would be able to supervise larger participants for compliance with applicable federal consumer financial protection laws, which includes applicable protections against unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices, rights of consumers transferring money, and privacy rights. Play by the same rules as banks and credit unions: The CFPB’s supervision of these large companies can foster a level playing field with depository institutions. Greater supervision of nonbanks in this market would ensure federal consumer financial protection law is enforced consistently between non-depository and depository institutions in order to promote fair competition. Today’s proposed rule, if finalized, would be one part of the CFPB’s efforts to carefully monitor the entry of large technology firms, including Big Tech giants, into consumer financial markets. In 2022, the CFPB warned Big Tech firms that they must adhere to federal consumer financial protection laws when using sophisticated behavioral targeting techniques to market financial products, and launched a public inquiry to gain more information on the risks posed by Big Tech’s payments platforms along with potential policy solutions. In 2023, the CFPB followed up on a 2021 request to Big Tech companies for information on their payment system plans with more detailed orders to ascertain more information on their use of sensitive personal data, and highlighted the role of certain Big Tech firms in limiting competition and innovation in mobile payments. In addition to those actions, the CFPB has opened the Office of Competition and Innovation to ensure nascent firms can compete with Big Tech companies within consumer finance, and established a supervision technology program staffed with technology experts and examiners focused on, among other things, risks associated with Big Tech consumer financial products. The Consumer Financial Protection Act provides the CFPB with the authority to conduct supervisory examinations over all nonbank companies in the mortgage, payday loan, and private student loan industries, as well as those who serve as service providers to banks and credit unions. In addition, the CFPB can supervise individual entities that pose a risk to consumers, as well as larger participants in other markets. The proposed rule would be the sixth in a series of CFPB rulemakings to define larger participants operating in markets for consumer financial products and services that play a substantial role in consumers’ everyday lives. The first five rules covered larger participants in consumer reporting, consumer debt collection, student loan servicing, international money transfers, and automobile financing. Read today’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Comments must be received on or before January 8, 2024, or 30 days after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register, whichever is later. Read Director Chopra’s October 2023 remarks on digital payments. Consumers can submit complaints about financial products or services by visiting the CFPB’s website or by calling (855) 411-CFPB (2372). Employees who they believe their company has violated federal consumer financial protection laws are encouraged to send information about what they know to whistleblower@cfpb.gov. ### The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a 21st century agency that helps consumer finance markets work by making rules more effective, by consistently and fairly enforcing those rules, and by empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives.

    "originLink": "https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03490-9",
    "originBody": "SPOTLIGHT 08 November 2023 How Paris is becoming a happy home for health-technology start-up companies A long-term investment plan is helping the French capital to attract talent. Nic Fleming Twitter Facebook Email DNA Script co-founder Thomas Ybert with the company’s bench-top DNA printer.Credit: ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty In 2021, President Emmanuel Macron announced a €7.5-billion (US$7.9-billion) plan aimed at making France a global health-care innovation leader by 2030. It is too soon to tell whether he will achieve his ambition, but researchers on the ground say that the sector is growing and maturing. Between 2020 and 2022, the number of health-technology companies grew from 2,050 to 2,640, according to a survey by France Biotech, an industry body based in Paris. Furthermore, the proportion of enterprises with at least one subsidiary abroad rose from one in five in 2021 to one in four last year, and the percentage of medical-technology and diagnostics companies with products on the market grew by 6 percentage points, to 56%. More than one-quarter of the companies in France Biotech’s survey were based in the greater Paris region. Every year, Nature publishes rankings of institutions and countries according to the number of scientific articles and papers published in high-quality journals. In the 2021 Nature Index, researchers at institutions in the Paris metropolitan area accounted for 44% of France’s total research output and for 48% of its output in the biological sciences. Here, leading figures at three companies discuss the benefits and downsides of launching and running medical-technology businesses in the French capital. Resolve Stroke People recovering in hospital from strokes and traumatic brain injuries must be monitored in case they develop complications or brain damage. But all of the current monitoring methods have disadvantages. For those with the most severe injuries, probes can be inserted through the skull to track measures such as brain temperature, cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure, but this technique requires a high level of expertise, is expensive and carries the risk of bleeds and infections. Non-invasive technologies such as transcranial doppler ultrasound, together with the tracking of vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate, are cheaper and less risky than invasive techniques but provide less detail about the situation. Computed tomography (CT) scanners can generate higher-resolution images, but are large and expensive, and patients must be transported to them. Science in France The Paris-based start-up firm Resolve Stroke is developing a bedside neuromonitoring device that it hopes will “combine the benefits of transcranial doppler and CT scanners”, says co-founder and chief technology officer Vincent Hingot. “Our device will enable measurements to be taken by non-experts and provide more detailed information than conventional doppler,” he says. “Given sufficient time, it could be used as an alternative to CT scans in some cases, reducing X-ray exposures and intra-hospital transport, and enabling more frequent imaging.” Conventional medical ultrasound generates images of organs by emitting sound waves and recording their echoes when they hit structures in the body. It is widely used, but cannot produce high-resolution images of the brain and other organs that are deep inside the body. But in 2015, physicist Olivier Couture at Sorbonne University in Paris and his colleagues showed it was possible to increase the resolution tenfold. The researchers injected bubbles of inert gas with diameters of 1–5 micrometres into the bloodstream and tracked them as they moved around the body, capturing 1,000 images a second1. Last May, Couture, Hingot and biomedical engineer Aritz Zamacola launched Resolve Stroke to commercialize technology based on the technique, called ultrasound localization microscopy. Together with physical tests, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are widely used to determine whether strokes have been caused by blocked arteries or by burst blood vessels, and therefore what type of treatment is required. The flow of blood and oxygen to the brain must be restored within 3–4.5 hours to minimize the risks of permanent disability or death. Hingot and his colleagues are investigating the possibility of using a portable version of their technology in ambulances to speed up stroke diagnosis and reduce the risk of patients failing to get the treatment they need in time. They think the technology could also improve the imaging and treatment of conditions such as arteriosclerosis and kidney and liver diseases. Resolve Stroke received substantial support from both Sorbonne University and Bpifrance, a French public investment bank, to launch at the publicly funded Agoranov science and technology incubator in Paris. Hingot says that start-ups launching in the French capital enjoy some key benefits. “It is easy to start a company in Paris,” he says. “The concentration of top universities and research groups means it attracts a lot of talent. There are also more in-person events and networking opportunities here.” Paris also has disadvantages as a place to start a medical-technology business, according to Hingot. “While French government agencies and universities provide a lot of support in the form of funding, subsidies and access to facilities, competition for these is greater in the capital because it is home to a large number of start-ups and the higher costs of office space.” Outlook: Research commercialization Some of the challenges faced by Resolve Stroke relate more to being in France and Europe than specifically in Paris. The company will require approval for its clinical-trial design from the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health products. To launch a product in the European Union, it will need the go-ahead from a ‘notified body’ to check the product conforms to the relevant legal and technical requirements. Hingot says that delays in either process could put his company at a disadvantage against competitors elsewhere in the world. Last month, Resolve Stroke announced it had secured €2.2 million in seed funding. The financing round was led by two Paris-based venture-capital companies, OVNI Capital and Quantonation, but Hingot says that the company might have to consider moving some of its operations away from Paris as it grows and gets closer to launching its products. “We are still young and we have found investors willing to take a risk on us,” he says. “However, at some point, we may have to move at least some of our activities to the United States or somewhere where greater volumes of investment funds are available. The US market is a prime target for us.” DNA Script Short strands of synthetic DNA, or oligos, have a growing range of applications, from life-sciences research and genetic testing to gene therapy and the production of mRNA vaccines. Since the 1980s, they have been made by sequentially linking nucleotides using a chemical technique called phosphoramidite synthesis. The technique works well for producing short sequences of genetic material, but not for ambitious projects, such as building synthetic genes2. “We are reaching a plateau with phosphoramidite synthesis,” says Thomas Ybert, chief executive and co-founder of Paris-based DNA Script. “It is not possible to ensure that all of the molecules undergo the reactions needed to make the nucleotides in the DNA chain, and the longer the oligo, the more errors build up.” Changing old viticulture for all the right rieslings DNA Script is one of several companies turning to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a naturally occurring enzyme that is particularly useful for DNA synthesis because it does not need a DNA template to copy sequences from, but that usually adds nucleotides to the end of the growing DNA sequence indiscriminately. The company engineered TdT such that it could control the order in which nucleotides are added. In 2021, DNA Script launched SYNTAX, one of the world’s first DNA printers, which uses TdT technology to make up to 96 oligos of up to 120 nucleotides long within 24 hours. It saves users time, because they no longer have to order the oligos from commercial suppliers and wait for them to be made and shipped. “Scientists with SYNTAX in their labs have full control and the fastest available access to DNA for their projects, allowing them to iterate and make decisions faster, and generate huge gains in productivity and efficiency,” says Ybert. DNA Script has around 220 employees, launched in Paris in 2014, and opened an office in San Francisco, California, in 2019. Ybert agrees with Hingot that Paris is a good place for companies to begin their journey, but becomes less convenient as they grow in size. “Paris is at the centre of French culture, and so is a great place for companies seeking to attract foreign talent,” says Ybert. “Public transport is cheap, dense and frequent, which is attractive to young workers.” Furthermore, he adds, companies are closer to government officials, so have higher visibility than elsewhere in France. However, they can find it difficult to attract the sums needed to take them to the next level. The precautionary principle, which urges caution in the face of potential risks in the absence of evidence, was incorporated into the French national constitution to apply to environmental policies in 2005. Ybert says that this has become a broader national mindset that can sometimes hold back innovation. “The French mentality is that if something is too big or new or futuristic, people can be scared and put off from doing it.” And this includes French investors, whose business is to take risks. They are not willing to take the same level of risk as do those in Silicon Valley, he explains. Ybert says that the French government could boost innovation by lowering business taxes and introducing reforms to reduce labour costs. “The standard 35-hour working week is not competitive compared to other key economies like the US, China and other countries in the EU,” he says. “The government could also boost innovation by reducing taxes on employee shareholders so they can get higher financial returns on the risks and hard work they put in, especially for innovative ‘deep tech’ enterprises using advanced science and engineering to solve complex problems.” Owkin Machine learning has the potential to diagnose a number of medical conditions as well as or more accurately than humans can. Its ability to do so is, however, restricted by the data it is trained on. And for rare conditions, especially, it can be hard to access enough data. Computer scientists at medical artificial-intelligence company Owkin are among those who say the answer lies in federated learning — in which AI models are trained on data from multiple sites without compromising privacy and security. In a paper published in January, researchers showed they had trained a machine-learning model on real patient data from two French hospitals without needing to send those data to an external location3. France’s research minister has a plan to shake up science The researchers used Owkin’s Substra software and high-resolution digital images of tumour biopsies to train a deep-learning model to predict the effectiveness of a chemotherapy drug in treating people with a condition known as triple-negative breast cancer, which has more-limited treatment options than other forms of breast cancer. When the model was then tested on data for 650 patients from another four hospitals, it outperformed a machine-learning model trained on the clinical data typically used by pathologists, including the physical characteristics of tumours and immune-system markers. If clinicians could predict who will respond, they could adapt their treatment, instead of just treating everyone the same and hoping it will work, as they do currently, says Jean-Philippe Vert, head of research and development at Owkin. Vert agrees that the medical-technology sector is thriving in Paris in part because the French capital provides a fertile ecosystem for those seeking employees and collaborators to help them launch companies. France came sixth globally in the 2023 Nature Index ranking of countries according to the health-sciences research output in high-quality medical journals. And the Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris, a university hospital trust based in the French capital, was one of only two non-US health-care institutions to make the latest Nature Index global top 15 for research output. “I think the medtech sector in Paris is growing quickly,” says Vert. “The academic setting is among the best in the world, with a lot of good students, big hospitals and excellent biomedical research centres. We also have big pharmaceutical companies, like Sanofi, and many mid-sized pharmas too.” Owkin, which employs around 350 people, has raised more than $300 million in funding from Sanofi and other biopharmaceutical companies and from venture-capital funds including Google Ventures and Fidelity Investments. Vert says that Owkin’s New York offices have helped it to attract investment, highlighting how the relative lack of domestic venture capital is often a problem for French companies. “Attracting investment funding, especially at the growth stage, is easier in the US than in Paris.” doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-03490-9 This article is part of Nature Spotlight: Science in France, an editorially independent supplement.

The social networking giant, which has long had a contentious relationship with political ads, is reckoning with a wave of generative A.I. tools. Share full article Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, recently announced a tool called AI Studio, part of a suite of new A.I. features from the company. Credit... Loren Elliott for The New York Times By Mike Isaac Mike Isaac covered Facebook and political advertising through the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Nov. 8, 2023, 6:00 a.m. ET Meta spent years figuring out how to handle political advertising across Facebook and Instagram. It put systems into place and developed policies for what types of political ads were and were not allowed on its platforms. But that was before the rise of consumer artificial intelligence. On Wednesday, Meta introduced a new policy to grapple with A.I.’s effects on political advertising. The Silicon Valley company said that starting next year, it would require political advertisers around the world to disclose when they had used third-party A.I. software in political or social issue ads to synthetically depict people and events. Meta added that it would bar advertisers from using its own A.I.-assisted software to create political or social issue ads, as well as ads related to housing, employment, credit, health, pharmaceuticals or financial services. Those advertisers would be able to use third-party A.I. tools such as the image generators DALL-E and Midjourney, but with disclosures. “We believe this approach will allow us to better understand potential risks and build the right safeguards for the use of generative A.I. in ads that relate to potentially sensitive topics in regulated industries,” the company said. Meta is reckoning with a wave of A.I. tools that the public has embraced over the past year. As consumers have flocked to ChatGPT, Google Bard, Midjourney and other “generative A.I.” products, big tech companies such as Meta have had to rethink how to handle a new era of manipulated or outright false imagery, video and audio. Political advertising has long been a contentious issue for Meta. In 2016, Facebook was criticized for a lack of oversight after Russians used the social network’s ads to sow discontent among Americans. Since then, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s founder and chief executive, has spent billions of dollars working to tamp down disinformation and misinformation on the company’s platforms and has hired independent contractors to closely monitor political ads that go through the system. The company has also not shied away from allowing politicians to lie in ads on the platform, which Mr. Zuckerberg has defended on the grounds of free speech and public discourse. Meta has also shown reluctance to limit the speech of elected officials. Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, has called for regulatory guidance on such issues instead of having tech companies determine the rules. Those who run political ads on Meta are currently required to complete an authorization process and include a “paid for by” disclaimer on the ads, which are stored in the company’s public Ad Library for seven years so journalists and academics can study them. When Meta’s new A.I. policy goes into effect next year, political campaigns and marketers will be asked to disclose whether they used A.I. tools to alter the ads. If they have and the ad is accepted, the company will run it with the information that it was created with A.I. tools. Meta said it would not require advertisers to disclose alterations that were “inconsequential or immaterial to the claim, assertion or issue raised,” such as photo retouching and image cropping. Political and social issue ads that have apparently used A.I. to alter images, video and audio but have failed to disclose doing so will be rejected, the company said. Organizations that repeatedly try to submit such ads without disclosures will be penalized, it added, without specifying what the penalties might be. The company has long had third-party fact-checking partners review, rate and potentially remove ads that are designed to spread misinformation. By barring advertisers from using the company’s own A.I.-assisted software to create political or social issue ads, Meta may be able to prevent headaches or litigation related to its advertising technology. In 2019, the Justice Department sued the company for allowing advertisers to discriminate against Facebook users based on their race, gender, religion and other characteristics. The company eventually settled the lawsuit, agreeing to alter its ad technology and pay a penalty of $115,054. Mike Isaac is a technology correspondent for The Times based in San Francisco.

Experts call this chatbot behavior “hallucination.” Rishi Sunak, the prime minister of Britain, hosted dozens of government leaders, tech executives and other experts as part of the A.I. Safety Summit he organized to discuss the dangers of the technology. President Biden signed a far-reaching executive order on A.I. that imposes new rules on companies and directs federal agencies to begin putting guardrails around the technology. The Age of A.I. The F.D.A. has approved many new medical products that use A.I., but doctors remain skeptical of these tools. A nonprofit led by a respected computer scientist is trying to democratize A.I. by building a freely available alternative to those offered by the likes of Google and OpenAI. OpenAI now lets outside businesses and independent developers tweak what its chatbot does. A new paper says that can lead to trouble. Advances in A.I. are offering new ways for bad actors to misappropriate online content of children. That is posing new risks for parents posting about their children on social media. Researchers at Anthropic asked roughly 1,000 Americans to write rules for their chatbot. The results could be a model for future kinds of A.I. governance. Leading A.I. researchers are transforming chatbots into a new kind of autonomous system called an A.I. agent that can play games, query websites, schedule meetings and build bar charts.

    "originBody": "Future of Money US consumer watchdog proposes rules for Big Tech payments, digital wallets By Douglas Gillison and Hannah Lang November 7, 20239:15 PM UTCUpdated 16 hours ago A smartphone with the PayPal logo is placed on a laptop in this illustration taken on July 14, 2021. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights WASHINGTON, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The top U.S. consumer financial watchdog on Tuesday proposed to regulate tech giants' digital payments and smartphone wallet services, saying they rival traditional payment methods in scale and scope but lack consumer safeguards. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) proposal would subject companies like Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), PayPal (PYPL.O) and Block's CashApp (SQ.N) to bank-like supervision, with CFPB examiners inspecting their privacy protections, executives' conduct and compliance with laws barring unfair and deceptive practices. Advertisement · Scroll to continue If finalized, the proposal would cover about 17 companies that together send more than 13 billion payments annually, according to a CFPB official. The agency declined to name the other platforms that would be covered beyond GooglePay, ApplePay, PayPal and CashApp. Apple, PayPal and CashApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Google declined to comment. The proposal marks a long-anticipated and ambitious move by CFPB Director Rohit Chopra to assert the agency's full authority over Big Tech, a sector he has frequently criticized for privacy and competition issues. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Since becoming director in 2021, Chopra has steadily increased CFPB scrutiny of the sector, seeking information in 2021 on how Big Tech companies use consumer data and last year launching an inquiry into their payments platforms. In a statement on Tuesday, Chopra said the tech sector had expanded into financial services traditionally provided by the closely regulated banking sector. \"Today's rule would crack down on one avenue for regulatory arbitrage by ensuring large technology firms and other nonbank payments companies are subjected to appropriate oversight,\" he said. Advertisement · Scroll to continue In a speech last month, Chopra said CFPB research had found tech giants collected vast amounts of consumer payments data with few limits, scant transparency and confusing corporate policies, putting consumers at risk of Chinese-style surveillance by the companies. Speaking about Tuesday's proposal, senior CFPB officials said it was imperative to look into privacy compliance at these larger firms with a wealth of consumer data, noting that many of their business models focus on monetizing that data. Representatives of Big Tech companies have previously highlighted their efforts to protect consumer data. Tuesday's proposal would apply to companies handling more than five million transactions a year. The agency said the rule would also foster competition by ensuring that both traditional financial players and the tech sector were equally subject to the same oversight. In a statement, the Consumer Bankers Association called the proposal \"a step in the right direction.\" \"For a healthy, innovative, and competitive financial services ecosystem to function, consumers need to know that they are protected equally, regardless of who they do business with to meet their financial needs,\" said CBA President and CEO Lindsey Johnson. The Electronic Transactions Association, representing banks, fintechs and big tech companies, said in a statement it wants \"to ensure the proposal achieves the goals of consumer protection and consistent application of public policy for all players.\" The proposal is now subject to a notice-and-comment period expected to end in early 2024.

    "title": "Canadian Talent Company Toast Leverages AI to Combat Gender Bias in Tech Recruitment",
    "originLink": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/meimeifox/2023/11/07/how-talent-company-toast-eliminates-gender-bias-in-tech-hiring/",
    "originBody": "FORBESLEADERSHIPFORBESWOMEN How Talent Company Toast Eliminates Gender Bias In Tech Hiring MeiMei Fox Contributor 2x NYT Bestselling AuthorTeaches Course: Your Bestselling Book Nov 7, 2023,04:36pm EST Women still represent only about one-quarter of total employees in STEM careers. GETTY According to a 2023 report from MIT, women occupy only 28% of jobs in STEM fields. Not only that, but they’ve been quiet quitting and leaning out for several years now. Despite a recent tech boom in Canada, women still face a gender pay gap of $20,000 per year in the industry. These grim statistics are what inspired April Hicke and Marissa McNeelands to cofound Toast, Canada’s first female-focused talent partner aimed at placing women in tech companies. Toast is backed by the federal government to help organizations who have tagged gender diversity to their ESG reporting for 2024. Although they only launched in 2022, Toast already boasts over 6,000 women and 70 partner organizations in Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto. They will launch U.S. operations in 2024. What sets them apart is how Toast partners with companies keen to diversify their tech teams, providing a unique AI-driven recruitment tool free from gender and socioeconomic biases. When Toast presents candidates, they remove the names of the individuals (eliminating gender and racial bias), the companies previously worked for (since for people with foreign work experience, this introduces bias), and the schools attended (as this introduces socioeconomic bias). Toast has received serious press attention for their efforts, with coverage in The Globe and Mail, BNN Bloomberg, and The Financial Post. “Our algorithms are meticulously trained on diverse datasets, challenging the status quo of male-dominated tech industries and fostering a more inclusive workforce,” said McNeelands, Toast’s cofounder and CEO, in an exclusive interview with me. She holds a master’s degree in AI, and built the algorithms used by Toast herself. April Hicke and Marissa McNeelands are the cofounders of Toast. GENEVIEVE RENEE PHOTOGRAPHIE MORE FOR YOU Apple Finally Kills Its Awkward MacBook Pro Ukraine’s American-Made M-1 Tanks Have Reached The Front Line Zero Punctuation Ends As The Escapist Faces Mass Resignations After EIC Firing Furthermore, Toast runs a membership collective aimed at eliminating the “lonely only” syndrome, helping women in tech find mentorship, support, and growth opportunities. “Toast is more than a career platform—it is a movement towards gender equity in tech,” says Hicke. “It was born out of a genuine need to diversify technical teams. Really, we are trying to level the playing field for women and change the way people look at hiring. We are not just helping women land tech jobs; we are ensuring they rise and thrive in them.” McNeelands adds, “Toast help women in tech get the jobs they want, the pay they deserve, and a community that supports them. We do this by creating a safe online space for women to transparently discuss salary, refer each other, and lean on each other while navigating the career journey. Ultimately, we give voice to the cognitive dissonance that women experience working in a field so vastly dominated by men.” Hicke says adversity gave her the mantra that she now lives by: “We were given this baggage to show others how it can be unpacked.” She grew up without much support or mentorship. When she took on her first leadership role at work in her late twenties, she decided that she wanted women never to feel as unsupported as she did. “I use my own experience, strength and hope to support and elevate other women,” she says. The Toast cofounders feel there needs to be more support for girls learning STEM in schools. GETTY The biggest challenges they face, McNeelands says, are encouraging more girls to pursue STEM in school and creating a workforce environment where women’s skills are valued at the same level as their male peers. “Sometimes the slow pace of progress can be frustrating,” she explains. “When you do something that you are so passionate about, the stakes are very high. A bad day at Toast doesn’t just impact me or my team, but it feels like it impacts all the women in tech looking to us to make a change.” That said, both cofounders find their work extremely rewarding. “Living into exactly who I was meant to be every day is the greatest feeling,” says Hicke. “This is my dream job. Not only do we get to make a difference in the lives of women, but we are actually driving systemic change in an industry that is ripe with bias and stigmas.” To women looking to make it in STEM jobs, McNeelands offers this advice. “If you can’t find the right opportunity, create it. If you aren’t feeling fulfilled, dig into why and seek out others. By giving voice to how you are feeling, you will probably find that there are others in the same spot. We can’t sit back and wait for the systems to change for us. We have to change them.” “Anything is possible,” adds Hicke. “It is completely possible to take small steps every day to create the dream life you’ve always wanted. And then when you’re living in your dream life, dream even more.” Follow me on LinkedIn. Check out my website.
