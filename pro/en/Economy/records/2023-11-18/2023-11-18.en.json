    "originBody": "Major retailers say their customers have refrained from expensive purchases as the holiday season approaches. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) Listen 5 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save Consumers are in a cautious mood heading into the holiday shopping season, moderating their spending in the face of higher prices and costlier credit, signaling a likely downshift in the engine of the U.S. economy. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. Major retailers say their customers over the last three months have pulled back from high-ticket purchases, focused on essentials and held out for deals — a shift that industry executives and observers expect to persist into the busiest shopping period of the year. “Sales have been somewhat uneven, and this gives us reason to think slightly more cautiously about the consumer versus 90 days ago,” Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey told analysts Thursday on a call to discuss the retailer’s third-quarter earnings. Story continues below advertisement The consumer restraint showed up across the economy in October, as retail sales fell by 0.1 percent from the previous month, the first such decline in six months, according to the Commerce Department. Those who were spending increasingly embraced alternative payment methods, with “buy now, pay later” purchases climbing 6 percent over the same period last year, a report by Adobe Analytics found. Advertisement Customers facing squeezed budgets are subjecting their purchases to tougher scrutiny and asking themselves: “Is this really going to add value to my life?” Target’s chief growth officer, Christina Hennington, said on an earnings call this week. Other top retail executives expect more of the same: Macy’s Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell warned the company expects “the consumer to continue to be challenged”; Gap Chief Financial Officer Katrina O’Connell said the retailer is trying “really just trying to remain prudent about the consumer”; Williams-Sonoma executives noted the company has been dealing with “ongoing consumer hesitancy” even though the company remains optimistic for the holiday season. Story continues below advertisement The National Retail Federation, for its part, projects holiday shoppers will step up their spending over last year but at a slower pace than in recent years. The group forecasts retail sales will increase 3 to 4 percent in November and December — a more modest bump than the 5.4 percent hike they recorded last year — as Americans reckon with new economic uncertainty. Advertisement “People feel less secure about spending when they feel less confident in their jobs,” said Jack Kleinhenz, the retail group’s chief economist, pointing to a recent uptick in the unemployment rate despite what remains a historically strong job market. “The ability to spend is there, now the question is the willingness.” Accordingly, businesses are preparing for a leaner season, with listings for seasonal job openings hitting their lowest level in a decade, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a firm that tracks labor trends. Inflection points Economists see good reason for shoppers to be wary, as both consumers and the economy itself appear to be at inflection points. Story continues below advertisement Two years of red-hot inflation that sent prices soaring to 40-year highs and stretched household budgets finally looks to be cooling. But to tame the phenomenon, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to their highest level in 22 years, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing. Advertisement Consumers initially relied on pandemic-era emergency payments and debt forgiveness programs to patch their personal finances as prices rose. After spending down more than $2 trillion in savings since the pandemic, they have turned to credit cards and other borrowing in recent months — a development now worrying some economists. Share this article Share Credit card debt has piled up at a historically fast clip — consumers added $154 billion to their balances in the last quarter, the biggest leap over the previous year on record, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That debt has grown sharply more expensive as interest rates have climbed, with the average credit card interest rate rising from 16.3 percent two years ago to a record-high 20.7 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Story continues below advertisement Borrowers, meanwhile, are falling further behind on making payments. Nearly 8 percent of total credit card debt is at least 30 days past due, the highest such figure since the Great Recession. Advertisement Moody’s Analytics economist Justin Begley called the jump in credit card balances “concerning,” while noting that “the American household remains on pretty good financial footing generally speaking.” The delinquency rate should peak over the next year, as long as wage gains continue to outpace price increases and interest rates come down, allowing some borrowers to refinance their debt, Begley added. For now, though, Americans’ economic outlook remains dour. Consumer sentiment this month slid to its lowest level since May, according to the University of Michigan. Shoppers are focused on prices of necessities such as gas and food, rather than the slower pace of increases, and are worrying about high interest rates and the effects of wars in Ukraine and Gaza. Story continues below advertisement Other surveys back up those findings, with 81 percent of registered voters rating the economy as either “fair” or “poor” and only 19 percent calling it “good” or “excellent” in a recent poll by the New York Times and Siena College. Newly cautious consumers will respond by slowing down their spending, though not halting it altogether, said Oxford Economics senior economist Bob Schwartz. “People like to vent in surveys, but it’s not necessarily how they behave,” Schwartz said. “I believe in not watching what people say but what they do.” Jaclyn Peiser contributed to this report.

    "originLink": "https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/11/what-awaits-turkeys-economy-its-foreign-exchange-woes-ease",
    "originBody": "Analysis What awaits Turkey's economy as its foreign exchange woes ease? After the March local polls, Ankara will be free of major domestic political concerns and is expected to enact a stern program to cool the economy and make real progress in fighting inflation. Turkish Treasury and Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek (C) addresses a statement to the journalists at the party's group meeting at the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) on June 21, 2023. - ADEM ALTAFP via Getty Images Mustafa Sonmez @mustfsnmz November 18, 2023 A combination of factors helped Turkey ease its foreign-currency woes during the summer, but the problem could resurge in the coming months as Ankara balks at unpopular measures ahead of local elections in spring. Decreasing uncertainty after the presidential and parliamentary elections in May laid the ground for foreign-currency assets held abroad or “under the pillow” to flow into the formal economy. That confidence was increased after Mehmet Simsek, an economist highly regarded among international investors, took the reins of the economy in June. According to central bank data, such inflows — recorded under “net errors and omissions” in the balance of payments — totaled about $16 billion in the four months from June through September. In the same period, foreign investors put about $5 billion in Turkish stocks and sovereign bonds, while inflows in the form of bank deposits and loans totaled some $9.5 billion. Foreign direct investments were the weakest link. While real estate sales brought in $930 million, actual direct investments saw an outflow of about $630 million. All in all, foreign inflows amounted to nearly $15 billion in the first four months under Simsek’s economic leadership, with the figure reaching some $31 billion including “net errors and omissions,” known also as inflows from unknown sources. That sum easily covered the $3.4 billion current account deficit in the June-September period, leading also to a $27 billion increase in the country’s foreign reserves. As a result, the Turkish lira remained relatively stable, especially in August and September. Simsek's leadership Before the elections, Ankara pursued an unconventional policy of low interest rates, despite runaway inflation, and intervened in the foreign-exchange market to prop up the lira. After his re-election in late May, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed Simsek to run the economy, also replacing the central bank’s leadership. Simsek pledged a return to “rational ground,” which meant, for a while, that the market was allowed to freely determine the exchange rate of the dollar vs. the embattled lira. As a result, the lira tumbled and the price of the dollar — a crucial factor for the import-reliant Turkish economy — rose 17.4% in June and 14.6% in July. As expected, the more expensive dollar became the main driver of price increases. Annual consumer inflation, which stood just below 40% in May, shot up to nearly 60% in August. In its latest inflation report, released in early November, the central bank notes that a third of the 61.5% annual inflation in October stemmed from exchange-rate-driven cost pressures. Since August, the slide of the lira has notably slowed, with the price of the dollar increasing 2% that month, staying mostly stable in September and rising 3.2% in October. The inflow of foreign funds and those of unknown origin were instrumental in the relative calm. The slowing pace of growth and thus imports and, more importantly, the increased foreign-exchange revenues, narrowed the current account deficit. The foreign-exchange revenues of the tourism sector topped $20 billion in the four-month period. As a result, Turkey even posted current account surpluses in June and September. With the current account deficit now manageable, the foreign-currency inflows helped replenish the country’s foreign reserves, giving Ankara a summer respite on this long-running problem. The October current account data has yet to be released, but in an important sign of a surplus, Trade Ministry figures put the monthly foreign trade deficit in October at $6.7 billion — a gap that the revenues from tourism could cover. Still, things are likely to be a bit different in the ensuing months. In November, Turkey’s foreign-currency revenues from tourism usually drop to half of those in September and October. In low seasons, the tourism industry’s foreign-currency revenues typically range between $1 billion and $2 billion, making it difficult to sustain the current account performance of the summer. Eyes on local elections Meanwhile, Turkey is headed for local elections in March, in which Erdogan is eager to regain the local administrations in a number of big cities, including Istanbul and Ankara, which the opposition won in 2019. Thus, he is believed to be averse to cooling the economy until the end of March. And Simsek and the central bank leadership appear unwilling to clash with the president, despite their appetite for a firm disinflation program. They have failed to implement the measures required to curb demand, though they frequently talk about them. Chief among those measures are the curbing of pay rises and sharply hiking interest rates. The government is expected to announce fresh hikes to public-sector salaries and the minimum wage in December, and Simsek and his team will apparently yield to Erdogan’s decisions in the lead-up to the local polls. Without the desired contraction in demand, economic growth would not slow and thus imports would not decrease. This raises the prospect of resurging current account woes during the winter, with monthly deficits back in the region of $4 billion to $5 billion. Along with imports, the repayments of short-term external debt will also drive the demand for foreign exchange, meaning that foreign reserves might melt again. After the March local elections, however, Ankara will be free of major domestic political concerns and is expected to enact a stern disinflation program that would cool the economy and slow imports to make progress in fighting inflation. Simsek himself has frequently said that economic improvements will become more pronounced in the second half of 2024.

    "originBody": "Afghanistan’s Economy Once Again Nears the Precipice Despite some signs of stabilization, Afghanistan now faces renewed crisis as humanitarian aid dries up. Friday, November 17, 2023 / By: Belquis Ahmadi; William Byrd, Ph.D.; Scott Worden Publication Type: Analysis and Commentary Share This Print the Page More than two years into Taliban rule, Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world with some of the highest humanitarian needs. The situation has shown some signs of stabilizing over the last year — but many Afghan households are still struggling to procure basic needs, and many women have been driven from the workforce altogether. Unfortunately, financial troubles loom ahead, and the already beleaguered Afghan economy is now projected to decline. Combined with population growth and the influx of thousands of Afghans forced to return from neighboring Pakistan, this is a recipe for increased humanitarian need over the longer term in the absence of major structural and political reforms. Street vendors in Kabul, Afghanistan. August 18, 2021. (Jim Huylebroek/The New York Times) USIP’s Belquis Ahmadi, William Byrd and Scott Worden discuss what two new World Bank reports can tell us about Afghanistan’s economic outlook, why the Taliban’s decrees targeting women’s participation in the workforce have only exacerbated the country’s instability, and what can be done to improve the situation amid dwindling humanitarian aid. The Taliban have claimed progress in countering corruption and revenue collection, yet Afghanistan is also one of the largest recipients of humanitarian aid. What is the Afghan economy’s capacity to provide for the needs of its people? Byrd: Two recent World Bank reports — which were launched at a USIP event last week — lay out the landscape of the Afghan economy and the situation of Afghan households. Despite some signs of economic stability over the past year, the economy remains weak and unable to generate the jobs and livelihoods needed to accommodate the growing population — hence unemployment and underemployment are widespread and increasing. Poverty remains very high, and large numbers of Afghans are still unable to meet their basic food and non-food needs. Moreover, there are storm clouds ahead — some but not all of which are noted in the World Bank reports. International humanitarian aid in 2023 will likely only amount to around half of its 2022 level, which was roughly $3 billion. The Taliban’s opium ban will also reduce the earnings of rural households by more than $1 billion per year without an alternative livelihood program for farmers, which will only further aggravate poverty and deprivation. Meanwhile, Pakistan’s deportation of an estimated 400,000 Afghans (and counting) exacerbates the country’s financial woes at exactly the wrong time. Afghans should be working in other countries and sending back remittances. Instead, even more will now need to look for work in the already meager Afghan economy. Macroeconomic factors are not promising either. Afghanistan is encountering disinflation, which the Taliban see as good news because it lowers prices. But in reality, this is bad news because it will shrink the value of the overall economy and lead to greater unemployment and lower government revenue. Finally, Afghanistan’s export growth is weakening. Coal, for example, had exploded as an export good when Pakistan was facing a shortage and global prices were high in comparison. That seems to have plateaued now as the markets shift. The Taliban’s ability to collect taxes effectively led to impressive revenue totals in the first two years of their rule. But this revenue growth will falter as long as the economy is stagnant. How has women’s participation in the Afghan economy changed since the Taliban took over in 2021? Ahmadi: During the Afghan Islamic Republic, government institutions put in place measures to encourage women to apply for vacant positions. While the environment was not always enabling — cultural norms, bad security caused by Taliban insurgency, and lower access to education often impeded female job applicants — women were willing to face these challenges to exercise their right to employment and to earn an income. Both Afghan government policy and donor-funded programs were successful in building the female workforce of Afghanistan. More than 6,000 women served as judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police and army personnel. Government data counted about 10,000 women among the country’s doctors, nurses and health professionals. Schools and universities were the largest employers of women, with more than 68,000 women teachers, including 800 university professors, working in private and public institutions. Since 2021, the Taliban have issued over 140 decrees, 90 of which specifically restrict the rights and movement of women and girls. In a particular blow to women’s economic freedom, the Taliban blocked women from working in the government and replaced the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and its related departments — which employed thousands of men and women — with the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. Women are still employed as teachers, nurses and doctors, but in fewer numbers and with lower wages. Overall, the professional workforce that was once a source of economic growth, family welfare and vital services for women has shrunk dramatically. Many professionals are now struggling to make ends meet with small, in-home enterprises like sewing and mending, which does little to replace both the income and the dignity of a salaried, professional position. Women face fewer official restrictions from the Taliban in the private sector, but the Taliban’s overall social policies and a vastly shrunken economy mean that women are much worse off as entrepreneurs and private sector employees than they were under the Republic. In 2020, the Afghan Women Chamber of Commerce and Industries reported that there were 2,471 licensed and 54,000 informal/unlicensed businesses owned and operated by women, employing more than 130,000 people. While the Taliban have not issued a formal decree banning women altogether from the private sector, their targeted decrees concerning beauty parlors in the summer of 2023 alone have left some 60,000 women out of job. Women have also been banned from parks where women had kiosks selling food, snack and handicrafts. Women have been banned from public baths, some owned by women. Other general restrictions such as the enforcement of segregated offices and work stations and mandates that women be accompanied by a mahram while outside their homes have had an enormous effect in pushing women out of the workforce in the private sector. Many employers have opted for replacing their female employees with men altogether to avoid being harassed by the Taliban’s religious police. What can be done to improve the Afghan economy and reduce its need for a shrinking supply of international humanitarian aid? Worden: There are no quick fixes to the Afghan economy, and the World Bank’s recent reports show that demographic pressures from population growth and the return of hundreds of thousands of refugees from Pakistan will likely outpace economic growth in the short term. When it comes to maintaining — let alone increasing — Western donor assistance and removing the formal and informal sanctions that have been hindering the Afghan economy, the Taliban would have to moderate their severe restrictions against female education and women working, which seems most unlikely to happen in the light of past experience. While Afghanistan’s banking sector has been largely moribund since the Kabul Bank crisis of 2010-2011, things have gotten even worse since the Taliban takeover. The banking sector cannot be fixed in the short run, but it is important to ensure smooth payments to facilitate trade, aid and — not least — remittances from Afghans in other countries. One priority is to arrange for third-party monitoring for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, which the Afghan Central Bank cannot handle — due both to loss of institutional capacity and to the potential conflicts of interest entailed by the Central Bank being currently led by sanctioned Taliban individuals. Another potential option is to arrange for a portion of the $3.5 billion of Afghanistan’s frozen foreign exchange reserves funds that have been sequestered in the Swiss Afghanistan Fund to be returned to private sector commercial banks that had deposited extra amounts of their funds in the Central Bank, and then onward to private sector depositors in the commercial banks. Increased agricultural production is key to improving livelihoods on a broad scale, but the opium ban increases the headwinds against the rural economy. Irrigation projects (one of which, Qush-teppe in northern Afghanistan, is currently underway) and expanding agricultural exports will be needed. Over the medium term, increased regional trade could provide a boost to the Afghan economy if the Taliban are able to improve transportation infrastructure and manage Afghanistan’s borders in a way that gives neighbors greater confidence that refugees, terrorists and traffickers will not cross over from Afghanistan along with trade goods. Ultimately, Afghanistan’s longer-term economic development will require political and policy choices the Taliban are unwilling to make. For example, no country can move up the scale of development as long as women and girls are categorically excluded from public life.",

He replied, “As long as the music is playing, you have to get up and dance.” Fast forward to today, we have to wonder whether financial markets are dancing on the eve of another financial market crisis that could trigger a meaningful economic recession. This time, the trigger might be a full-blown regional bank crisis caused by the lethal combination of high interest rates and a wave of commercial property loan defaults. The importance of the regional banks for the U.S. economy cannot be overstated. According to Goldman Sachs, banks with less than $250 billion in assets originate half of the loans made to businesses and corporations for capital expenditures. These smaller banks also account for 60% of all U.S. mortgages, 80% of all commercial real estate loans, and 45% of all consumer loans. The last thing a slowing economy needs is a credit crunch in the regional bank sector. Unfortunately, it is difficult to see how such a crunch can be avoided, given the sharp spike in long-dated Treasury bond yields and the troubles in the commercial real estate sector. The regional banks, along with the rest of the banking system, have taken a significant hit from a decline in the value of their bond portfolios due to the spike in Treasury bond rates. With such significant losses on their bond portfolios, anyone doubting that the regional banks have a solvency problem need only reflect on the heavy exposure of those banks to commercial real estate loans. That exposure is estimated at 18% of those banks’ loan portfolios. Property developers are widely expected to have serious trouble rolling over the $500 billion in loans that mature over the next year. They will do so due to the combination of low-occupancy rates in a post-COVID world and the higher interest rates they will now have to pay on their loans. This means that the regional banks will soon be in real trouble when property developers start defaulting in a big way. The loan write-offs they will be forced to do will compound the problems that high interest rates are already causing to their profitability and balance sheets. When that occurs, those banks will be forced to cut back on their lending faster than they are already doing. That could be especially damaging to the prospects for small- and medium-size businesses that account for 45% of our country’s economic activity and employment. In 2008, the Federal Reserve was caught flat-footed by the Lehman bankruptcy despite many indications that should have been informing it that a financial crisis was brewing. It will be inexcusable if, once again, the Fed misses the clues of another such crisis, especially after the failures of First Republic Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, the second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures on record.
