Pete Marovich for The New York Times By Jack Healy Reporting from Phoenix. Nov. 14, 2023, 5:03 a.m. ET If President Biden hopes to replicate his narrow victory in Arizona, he will need disillusioned voters like Alex Jumah. An immigrant from Iraq, Mr. Jumah leans conservative, but he said he voted for Mr. Biden because he could not stomach former President Trump’s anti-Muslim views. That was 2020. Since then, Mr. Jumah, 41, said, his economic fortunes cratered after he contracted Covid, missed two months of work as a trucking dispatcher, was evicted from his home and was forced to move in with his mother. He said he could no longer afford an apartment in Tucson, where rents have risen sharply since the pandemic. He is now planning to vote for Mr. Trump. “At first I was really happy with Biden,” he said. “We got rid of Trump, rid of the racism. And then I regretted it. We need a strong president to keep this country first.” His anger helps explain why Mr. Biden appears to be struggling in Arizona and other closely divided 2024 battleground states, according to a recent poll by The New York Times and Siena College. Surveys and interviews with Arizona voters find that they are sour on the economy, despite solid job growth in the state. The Biden administration also fails to get credit for a parade of new companies coming to Arizona that will produce lithium-ion batteries, electric vehicles and computer chips — investments that the White House hails as emblems of its push for a next generation of American manufacturing. Breanne Laird, 32, a doctoral student at Arizona State University and a Republican, said she sat out the 2020 elections in part because she never thought Arizona would turn blue. But after two years without any pay increases and after losing $170,000 trying to fix and flip a house she bought in suburban Phoenix, she said she was determined to vote next year, for Mr. Trump. She bought the investment property near the peak of the market last year, and said she watched its value slip as mortgage rates rose toward 8 percent. She said she had to max out credit cards, and her credit score fell. Arizona’s housing market fell farther than most parts of the country after the 2008 financial crisis, and it took longer to recover. Few economists are predicting a similar crash now, but even so, Ms. Laird said she felt frustrated, and was itching to return Mr. Trump to power. “I’m even further behind,” she said. “I see the value in voting, and plan to vote as much as possible.” Image Voters waited in line to cast their ballots at dawn in Guadalupe, Ariz., in 2020. Credit... Adriana Zehbrauskas for The New York Times A majority of Arizona voters in the recent New York Times/Siena survey rated the country’s economy as poor. Just 3 percent of voters said it was excellent. Arizona experienced some of the worst inflation in the country, largely because housing costs shot upward as people thronged to the state during the pandemic. Average monthly rents in Phoenix rose to $1,919 in September from $1,373 in early 2020, a 40 percent increase according to Zillow. Average rents across the country rose about 30 percent over the same period. Home prices and rents have fallen from their peaks this year, but even so, economists say that the state is increasingly unaffordable for middle-class families, whose migration to Arizona has powered decades of growth in the state. Arizona’s economy sprinted out of the pandemic, but economists said the speed of new hiring and consumer spending in the state has now eased. The state unemployment rate of 4 percent is about equal to the national average, and the quarterly Arizona Economic Outlook, published by the University of Arizona, predicts that the state will keep growing next year, though at a slower pace. Arizona has added 280,000 jobs since Mr. Biden took office, according to the federal Labor Department, compared with 150,000 during Mr. Trump’s term. Phoenix just hosted the Super Bowl, usually a high-profile boost to the local mood and economy. Barely a week goes by without Arizona’s first-term Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, visiting a groundbreaking or job-training event to talk up the state’s economy or the infrastructure money arriving from Washington. Image Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs on stage during the 2023 Inauguration Ceremony at the Arizona State Capitol in Phoenix. Credit... Rebecca Noble for The New York Times Mr. Biden was even farther behind Mr. Trump in another poll being released this week by the Phoenix-based firm Noble Predictive Insights. That survey of about 1,000 Arizona voters said Mr. Trump had an eight-point lead, a significant swing toward Republicans from this past winter, when Mr. Biden had a two-point edge. Mike Noble, the polling firm’s chief executive, said that Mr. Trump had built his lead in Arizona by consolidating support from Republicans and — for the moment — winning back independents. Respondents cited immigration and inflation as their top concerns. “Economists say, ‘Look at these indicators’ — People don’t care about that,” Mr. Noble said. “They care about their day-to-day lives.” Bill Ruiz, the business representative of Local 1912 of the Southwest Mountain States Carpenters Union, said the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill and CHIPS Act were bringing billions of dollars into Arizona, and helping to power an increase in union jobs and wages. Carpenters in his union were working 7 percent more hours than they were a year ago, and the union’s membership has doubled to 3,400 over the past five years. “We’re making bigger gains and bigger paychecks,” he said. “It blows me away people don’t see that.” Political strategists say Mr. Biden could still win in Arizona next year, if Democrats can reassemble the just-big-enough coalition of moderate Republicans and suburban women, Latinos and younger voters who rejected Mr. Trump by 10,000 votes in 2020. It was the first time in more than two decades that a Democrat had carried Arizona and its 11 electoral votes. The same pattern was seen in last year’s midterm elections, when Arizona voters elected Democrats running on abortion rights and democracy for governor, attorney general and secretary of state, defeating a slate of Trump-endorsed hard-right Republicans. Abortion is still a powerful motivator and a winning issue for Democrats, but many Arizona voters now say their dominant concerns are immigration, inflation and what they feel is a faltering economy. Grant Cooper, 53, who retired from a career in medical sales, is the kind of disaffected Republican voter that Democrats hope to peel away next year. He supports abortion rights and limited government, and while he voted for Mr. Trump in 2020, he said he would not do so again. He said his personal finances and retirement investments were in decent shape, and he did not blame the president for the spike in gas prices in 2022. Still, he said he plans to vote for a third-party candidate next year, saying that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump were out-of-touch relics of a two-party system that was failing to address long-term challenges. “They squibble and squabble about the dumbest things, rather than looking at things that could improve our economy,” he said. “The Republicans are fighting the Democrats. The Democrats are fighting the Republicans. And what gets done? Nothing.” David Martinez, 43, is emblematic of the demographic shift that has made Arizona such a battleground. He and his family moved back to Phoenix after 15 years in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he still works remotely in the tech industry. He voted for Mr. Biden in 2020, and said he was worried about the threat Mr. Trump poses to free elections, democracy and America’s future in NATO. His working-class friends and extended family don’t share the same concerns. These days, the political conversations with them usually begin and end with the price of gas (now falling) and eggs (still high). “It falls on deaf ears,” Mr. Martinez said of his arguments about democracy. “They feel down about Biden and inflation and his age. They’re open to giving Trump a second term or skipping the election entirely.” Camille Baker contributed reporting.

More about Jack Healy Share full article The Run-Up to the 2024 Election Donald Trump The former president is planning an extreme expansion of his first-term crackdown on immigration if he is re-elected — including preparing to round up undocumented people in sprawling camps while they wait to be expelled. Trump’s campaign rejected criticism that he was echoing the language of fascists with his vow to root out his political opponents like “vermin,” then doubled down, saying that those who made such comparisons would be “crushed.” President Biden A wave of Democratic success in off-year elections was a win for the president after demoralizing poll numbers. But some strategists argue the outcomes show only that Democrats are doing well, not necessarily Biden. Why do Americans remain so down on the economy when economic data are trending up? Biden’s team has been consumed with that disconnect. Other Candidates Tim Scott: The South Carolina senator, who tried carving out a space in the Republican presidential field with a hopeful message built on his life story, has suspended his campaign. Chris Christie: In Israel, the former governor of New Jersey said Trump’s rhetoric of intolerance had fueled the surge of bigotry confronting Jews and Muslims after Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. Nikki Haley: The former South Carolina governor’s latest debate performance prompted more than $1 million in donations — and drew a billionaire backer. She’s still banking on a breakthrough to catch up to Trump. Vivek Ramaswamy: The first-time presidential candidate and conservative author is at once deeply in touch with his Indian heritage and adamant that the growing focus on diversity in America has come at the cost of national unity. Ron DeSantis: The Florida governor, who needed a lift in his quest to beat Trump in the crucial Iowa caucuses, received the endorsement of Kim Reynolds, the state’s popular Republican governor.

    "title": "Bidenomics' Economic Message Fails to Resonate with Voters, New Poll Shows",
    "originLink": "https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/14/white-house-bidenomics-polling-00126982",
    "originBody": "White House Biden is in a deep hole on the economy. New polling may show a way out. Top White House aides reviewed private polling showing Biden’s economic message falling flat and suggesting paths toward a turnaround. Joe Biden’s insulin cap has spurred relatively little pushback from the GOP since it took effect.Alex Brandon/AP By Adam Cancryn 11/14/2023 05:00 AM EST Link Copied Earlier this fall, President Joe Biden’s top aides met a pair of progressives who had arrived in the West Wing with reams of data and a private warning: “Bidenomics” wasn’t breaking through. The White House had spent the past three months trying to build enthusiasm for Biden’s economic record, spotlighting major policy accomplishments and celebrating a surging economy that it planned to make central to his reelection bid. But voters, discouraged by rising prices and baffled by the “Bidenomics” brand, weren’t buying it. Now Biden’s closest advisers had a raft of fresh evidence confirming it. Just 35 percent of Americans trusted Democrats more on economic issues, according to weeks of private polling presented to the White House in mid-September and recently obtained by POLITICO. The data reinforced broad concerns over the public’s dismal outlook. Despite expressing widespread support for Biden’s policy agenda, few voters were aware he’d made much progress on any of a dozen-plus top priorities, like drug pricing or infrastructure. Perhaps most alarming, 7 out of 10 people surveyed believed the economy wasn’t getting better — even after they were explicitly told that inflation had eased and unemployment sat near record lows. That preface, designed specifically to persuade voters to brighten their view of the economy, did not seem to move them. “When we intentionally put our finger on the scale, and 100 percent of people hear good economic indicators before saying if the economy’s going well for them, we still get walloped,” said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. The group, alongside Data for Progress, conducted the polling and briefed White House officials, Democratic congressional leaders and top party operatives over several days in September and October. The meetings — the extent of which have not been previously reported — included sitdowns with members of Biden’s inner circle, as well as top aides charged with shaping Biden’s political and policy strategy ahead of 2024. They offer a window into a White House well aware that its economic message wasn’t resonating, even as it’s repeatedly dismissed such fears as overblown. Democrats have fretted for months about Biden’s poor economic approval ratings, with some going as far as directly urging the White House to abandon the “Bidenomics” branding, which the administration has used as shorthand for the president’s economic agenda. Biden’s advisers remain confident their strategy will pay off over the long term. But the private polling discussions provide clues as to how the administration might tweak their argument over the next several months. Biden officials during the sessions pored over data that tested a range of new messages designed to narrow the polling deficit — from more directly targeting Republicans over Donald Trump-era tax cuts to attempting to revive a fight over Social Security. “Democrats can’t just hammer people over the head with an insistence that the economy is great,” said Green, whose work with the White House on a junk fee initiative over the summer prompted the broader discussions on Bidenomics messaging. “We have to acknowledge pain and pivot, and there are ways that we can optimize that pivot to hit Trump for mismanaging the economy.” The White House characterized the polling as further confirmation that Biden’s economic agenda is popular with voters, and that the central challenge is convincing them to give him credit. “What we need to do is boost awareness that it’s the president that brought those things to their lives,” said one senior official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the meetings. “We’re aware, and have been aware, that there’s a gap.” Biden aides have insisted they’ll soon begin closing that gap by drawing a sharper contrast between Biden and Republicans. They point specifically to a mid-September memo that previewed plans to pit Bidenomics against GOP policies they dubbed “MAGAnomics.” But there is little sign Americans’ outlook on the economy is improving, frustrating aides even as they maintain that there is plenty of time to turn the trajectory around. “We’re working every day to show the American people what President Biden and Congressional Democrats have delivered,” White House spokesperson Michael Kikukawa said in a statement, listing progress on drug prices, manufacturing jobs and infrastructure. “We will continue reaching out to the portion of Americans who are not yet aware of those incredibly popular accomplishments.” The difficulty of that task has surprised even Biden’s staunchest supporters, who concede he started in a deeper hole than anticipated. Voters blame the administration for the sharp rise in basic expenses like groceries, gas and housing, and they remain fixated on the cost of living even as inflation has moderated. They give Biden little credit for pulling the U.S. out of a Covid-induced recession, or for orchestrating record job growth without plunging the country back into a downturn. Voters responded far better when talk of Biden's record was paired with an acknowledgment the economy remained challenging and a reminder of Trump’s record.Andrew Harnik/AP “We’ve just had huge GDP numbers, wages are growing in real terms, we have a booming jobs market and we’ve got manufacturing on the rebound,” said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at centrist Democratic think tank Third Way. But when it comes to getting voters to appreciate that progress, Biden “has work to do. There’s no doubt about it.” Democratic anxiety over Bidenomics peaked in recent weeks, amid fresh polls showing Biden underwater on economic issues and trailing former President Trump in key swing states. Biden aides quickly dismissed the results, arguing that polling a year out from the election is unreliable. But the findings reflect entrenched challenges that the White House has been aware of for weeks. The PCCC and Data for Progress polling showed voters overwhelmingly supported central planks of Biden’s agenda — like slashing drug prices, protecting Social Security and eliminating so-called junk fees — only to then say they’d yet to hear much from the president on the topic. For example, fewer than a third of voters said they’d heard much from Biden about capping the cost of insulin, a wildly popular provision that took effect back in January. Only 20 percent had “heard a lot” about work done to fend off threats to Social Security and Medicare, and even fewer were aware of the administration’s work on veterans’ benefits and child care. One central barrier, the progressive groups concluded, was that the White House has struggled to distinguish its positioning on several major issues from Republicans. Biden’s insulin cap has spurred relatively little pushback from the GOP since it took effect, depriving him of the kind of sustained partisan back-and-forth that might elevate the subject in voters’ minds. On Social Security, the president earlier this year goaded Republicans into swearing off cuts to the program, heading off what Democrats anticipated would be a high-volume fight. That represented a major victory in the moment. But the longer-term impact, the PCCC and Data for Progress polling found, is that voters remain divided over whether Biden or Trump would be more likely to protect their benefits. Trump publicly urged Republicans to leave social insurance programs alone during that debt ceiling fight earlier this year. The polling found that many respondents don’t believe Republicans would now slash Social Security. “Biden was almost a victim of his own success,” said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director at Data for Progress. “Yes, we should be educating voters about [Biden’s policies]. … But it’s also about going on offense and picking fights.” In meetings with White House aides and congressional leaders, Green and Deiseroth detailed the steep climb Biden faces in convincing voters economic conditions are improving. Voters responded far better when talk of Biden’s record was paired with an acknowledgment the economy remained challenging and a reminder of Trump’s record. But even that approach failed to turn most voters positive on the economy. The pair have instead urged the administration to hone its Bidenomics message, zeroing in on a handful of popular policies and finding tension points where Biden can bait Republicans into battle. At one point, they floated having Biden propose an expansion of Social Security funded by greater taxes on billionaires, arguing the move would be broadly popular and force the GOP into a debate over both elements. The senior White House official declined to say how and whether the discussions would influence Biden’s campaign strategy. But no matter how the White House sharpens his economic argument, Green and Deiseroth said Biden’s ability to break through to voters will depend heavily on better defining what exactly Bidenomics is — and just as importantly, what it’s not. “It’s about de-wonkifying the message,” Deiseroth said. “When we acknowledge the pain that people have felt and remind them that Republicans are not going to be the savior on this, that’s where we start to gain ground. That’s where it starts to get a lot less scary.” Filed under: White House, Medicare, Social Security, Economy, Polling, Democrats, Joe Biden 2024 POLITICO Link Copied",

    "title": "UBS Predicts US Economy Could Resemble Bustling 1990s Instead of Gloomy 1970s",
    "originLink": "https://fortune.com/2023/11/14/ubs-us-economy-return-1990s-not-roaring-20s/",
    "originBody": "FINANCE ·U.S. ECONOMY Forget the gloom of the 1970s—UBS thinks the U.S. economy is headed back to a Clinton-like era of the bustling 1990s BYELEANOR PRINGLE UBS believes the US economy is more likely to return to the 1990s than the \"roaring 20s.\" RON SACHS—CNP VIA GETTY IMAGES Economic leaders are looking to the past for some inspiration on how to deal with the present—the only issue is, no one seems to be able to agree which past era they should be studying. Deutsche Bank believes the U.S. economy closely resembles the turbulent times of the 1970s, an outlook prompted by the war in Israel, oil shocks, and rampant inflation. Meanwhile economists at the White House say the inflationary period after World War II acts as a better guide because pent-up demand from the pandemic will eventually fade away. UBS disagrees with both, saying the 1990s more closely resembles the economic climate world leaders are currently attempting to navigate. A note from the UBS Chief Investment Office, led by Jason Draho, questioned whether the 2020s would act as “another roaring 20s” seen a century before. During this period, technological advances led to a rapid increase in productivity, while major industries like automotive, film and chemicals took off. The data suggests today’s economy has officially entered a new regime, UBS outlined: “A regime is defined by its growth, inflation, and rate attributes. These are all at their highest levels since prior to the global financial crisis (GFC).” The note says a roaring 20s is possible in a bullish scenario, highlighting five factors are necessary to bring this to fruition. These include inflation being “contained” below 3% (it has already worked its way down from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.7% in Sept 2023); widespread investment across the economy; a more dynamic economy after the pandemic; fading policy headwinds: and last but not least, an increase in productivity. The latter factors are those which UBS believes are the least likely to come to reality, and therefore the Swiss bank points to the 1990s as a better template for how the rest of this decade should be handled. “The current hiking cycle is reminiscent of 1994,” wrote Draho and his team. “The economy then had a soft landing in 1995, which we expect in 2024. “The rest of the ‘90s was characterized by faster growth, rising productivity, and disinflation.” Writing on LinkedIn, Draco added: “Rather than call this scenario Roaring ’20s, a better name is ’90s Redux because of the parallels to that decade.” An unusual economy Despite their proposals, Draho’s team made it clear that the economy is currently in a state of flux that makes forecasting very difficult. Many on Wall Street were bracing themselves for a hard landing at the start of the year, a downside which never came to fruition. Instead, UBS points out, the U.S. saw growth in GDP—up 4.9% in Q3 2023—despite aggressive Fed rate hikes that saw the base rate pulled to the highest in 22 years. Likewise uncertainty in the bond market saw certain Treasury yields at 16-year highs, before legendary investors like Bill Ackman were forced into U-turns amid increasingly uncharted waters. “These outcomes are opposite of consensus forecasts at the start of the year,” wrote UBS. “The bottom line: Something is afoot with the U.S. economy,” Draho added. It all hinges on supply Many of the thorns in the U.S. economy’s side have been brought about because of supply issues. Oil is one: the 13 member nations of OPEC, which produce roughly 80% of all crude, are now producing less oil than at any time since August 2021. Saudi Arabia and Russia also both decided this summer to cut their oil production by 1 million and 300,000 barrels per day, respectively, through the end of the year. Critical minerals are another—this month China announced that it will require a special export license for battery-grade graphite, effectively restricting sales to international markets. Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and graphite are essential for the manufacturing of batteries for electric vehicles, and the Chinese government currently controls more than 90% of the world’s supply. UBS said the supply issues were even wider: “Supply chain problems plagued the economy during the pandemic. While those have eased, supply issues will keep dominating—from labor and housing shortages, to new investment and technologies being positive supply shocks.” As well as supply issues, UBS outlined several other factors which could also prevent a so-called “roaring” 20s: “Several of them, including geopolitical conflicts, political dysfunction, and a debt crisis are essentially policy choices that could be avoidable but are hard to predict. “Others risk factors are an energy crisis, climate disasters, and AI fizzling.” Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance.

    "originBody": "European Markets ECB to hold rates through mid-2024 despite stalling economy - Reuters poll By Prerana Bhat November 14, 20238:04 AM UTCUpdated 5 hours ago A view shows the logo of the European Central Bank (ECB) outside its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany March 16, 2023. REUTERS/Heiko Becker/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights BENGALURU, Nov 14 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will hold interest rates steady well into next year, with a majority of economists polled by Reuters sticking to forecasts the first cut will have to wait until at least July despite expectations of a euro zone recession. Last month, the ECB left its deposit rate at a record high of 4.00% after raising rates for 10 consecutive meetings, and all 72 economists in a Reuters Nov. 8-13 poll agreed there would be no more hikes in the current cycle. Advertisement · Scroll to continue While financial markets currently expect an April rate cut, the latest Reuters poll suggests that is unlikely, especially after ECB President Christine Lagarde said last month \"even having a discussion on a cut is totally, totally premature.\" Around a 55% majority, 40 of 72, predicted rates would stay at current levels though the middle of next year. The remaining 45% saw a cut sometime before the ECB Governing Council meets in July. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The results are similar to a survey last month where 58% expected no cut before the July meeting. \"It seems that not much has to happen to push the eurozone into recession,\" wrote Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING, noting that ECB has acknowledged growth has been weaker than it expected. \"But that doesn't mean that the ECB is in a hurry to cut rates... We don't expect any rate cuts before the summer of 2024.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue An earlier than expected rate reduction would likely require a recession deep enough to prompt easing even if inflation remains above the ECB's 2% target. Over 40%, 15 of 35 economists, predicted another contraction this quarter after a flash estimate showed the 20-member bloc's economy shrank 0.1% in Q3, fulfilling the official definition of a recession. But the weakest GDP forecast provided for coming quarters was a modest -0.3%. Indeed, asked what type of recession the euro zone might enter, a strong majority, 24 of 29 respondents, said it would be short and shallow. Three said long and shallow, one said long and deep and another said short and deep. For now, the U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to ease policy a little earlier than the ECB, by end-Q2, although most economists say the greater risk to their forecasts is that it moves later. The ECB, which began raising rates several months later than the Fed, could weaken the euro and introduce unwanted imported inflation if it moved before the Fed. In the meantime, price pressures were expected to remain sticky. Headline inflation, which the ECB targets at 2.0%, fell to a more than two-year low of 2.9% last month from a peak of 10.6% in October 2022. It was forecast to remain around where it is now in the first half of next year and average 2.7% in 2024. Core inflation - stripped of volatile food and energy prices and a better gauge of underlying demand - was seen averaging 5.0% this year and 2.6% next. The jobless rate was expected to rise only slightly to 6.7% from the current 6.5% by end-2024, the poll showed.

Find more insights at Cetera Investment Management (@CeteraIM). GETTY In the complex realm of economic policymaking, data is the compass that guides the Federal Reserve's actions. The central bank of the United States, known as the Fed, carries a dual mandate: to maintain full employment and keep inflation in check. To fulfill these commitments, the Fed analyzes several economic and financial statistics to gauge the health of the economy and make crucial decisions that impact us all. Understanding The Fed's Dual Mandate At the heart of the Fed's mission lies a delicate balancing act. On one hand, the Fed strives to ensure that jobs are available to those seeking employment, fostering a robust labor market. On the other hand, they are tasked with preventing runaway inflation, which can erode the purchasing power of consumers. To achieve this equilibrium, the Fed resorts to a powerful tool in its arsenal: interest rates. By adjusting interest rates, the Fed can either stimulate economic growth or rein in an overheating economy. The Role Of Economic Data But how does the Fed determine when to raise or lower interest rates? This is where economic data comes into play. The Fed scrutinizes a wide range of economic indicators, with a particular focus on three key reports that offer critical insights into the state of the economy. Non-Farm Payrolls Report: A Pulse On Employment The Non-Farm Payrolls report, released monthly by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is a pivotal indicator for the Fed. It measures the number of workers in the U.S., excluding those in farming, private households, proprietors, nonprofit employees and active military. This report provides a comprehensive snapshot of employment in both the private sector and government agencies. A robust labor market, as indicated by this report, suggests a healthy overall economy. The Fed values it highly since it offers one of the earliest glimpses into the previous month's economic performance.

Relative to CPI, Core PCE provides a broader and more timely measure of inflation. The Fed monitors inflation closely because excessive inflation can erode the purchasing power of consumers and destabilize the economy. Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index: A Glimpse Into Consumer Behavior The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index combines consumer sentiment and inflation expectations. Since consumers drive about two-thirds of the U.S. economy, their sentiment holds significant sway. If consumers are pessimistic, they are less likely to spend, which can have a dampening effect on economic growth. Similarly, if inflation expectations are too high or too low, it can influence consumer spending habits. Predicting Economic Trends Analyzing these three crucial reports provides the Fed with a comprehensive view of the economic landscape. Currently, these indicators suggest a promising scenario—a potential economic soft landing. Inflation is showing signs of slowing down, while the labor market remains robust. This combination hints at economic stability, reducing the immediate risk of a recession. It's important to note that the Fed doesn't rely solely on these three indicators. In reality, the central bank examines thousands of data points and is, as they often emphasize, \"data-dependent.\" Investors, too, should diversify their data sources and not focus on a limited set of indicators when making financial decisions. The Federal Reserve's utilization of economic data is integral to its central role in the U.S. economy. By closely monitoring a multitude of vital indicators, the Fed strives to fulfill its dual mandate and maintain economic stability. For investors and economic observers, understanding the use of these indicators can be helpful in deciphering the complex and dynamic world of monetary policy. Time will tell, but one thing is certain: There will be increased scrutiny of economic reports, beyond those listed here, and more market volatility.

The investment bank believes the bulk of the drag from monetary and fiscal tightening policies is over. In this article GS Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT New York city skyline Alexander SpatariMomentGetty Images Goldman Sachs predicts the global economy will top expectations in 2024, driven by strong income growth and confidence that the worst of rate hikes is already over. The investment bank forecasts the world economy to expand 2.6% next year on an annual average basis, above the 2.1% consensus forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg. The U.S. is expected to outpace other developed markets again with estimated growth of 2.1%, Goldman said. Goldman also believes that the bulk of the drag from monetary and fiscal tightening policies is over. To curtail rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve started its aggressive rate hike campaign in March 2022 as inflation climbed to its highest levels in 40 years. Last Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he is \"not confident\" the Fed has done enough to tackle inflation, and suggested that more rate hikes may be necessary. Goldman said policymakers in developed markets are unlikely to cut interest rates before the second half of 2024 unless economic growth comes in weaker than estimated. The bank noted inflation has also continued to cool across G10 and emerging market economies, and is expected to ease further. \"Our economists forecast this year's decline in inflation to continue in 2024: sequential core inflation is predicted to fall from 3% now to an average 2-2.5% range across the G10 (excluding Japan),\" the report stated. Global factory activity The investment bank also expects global factory activity to recover from a recent slump as headwinds are set to dissipate this year. Goldman noted global manufacturing activity has been weighed down by a weaker-than-expected rebound in Chinese manufacturing and the European energy crisis, as well as an inventory cycle that had to correct for overbuilding last year. We continue to see only limited recession risk and reaffirm our 15% U.S. recession probability. Jan Hatzius CHIEF ECONOMIST AT GOLDMAN SACHS Global production has been in a slump for most of the year. S&P Global's gauge of worldwide manufacturing activity came in at 49.1 in September. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activity. Additionally, China's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5 in October from 50.6 in September, marking the first contraction since July. Manufacturing activity should recover somewhat in 2024 from a subdued 2023 pace, Goldman economists led by chief economist Jan Hatzius said, especially as \"spending patterns normalize, gas-intensive European production finds a trough, and inventories-to-GDP ratios stabilize.\" Big economies to avoid recession Rising real income also contributed to Goldman's positive growth outlook. \"Our economists have a positive outlook for real disposable income growth at a time of much lower headline inflation and still-strong labor markets,\" Goldman wrote in a release based on the report. While they hold the view that U.S. real income growth is set to slow from its strong 2023 pace of 4%, it is still purported to support consumption and GDP growth of at least 2%. \"We continue to see only limited recession risk and reaffirm our 15% U.S. recession probability,\" Hatzius continued in the outlook report, owed in part to the real disposable income growth. In September, the bank had cut their forecast for a U.S. recession from 20% to 15% on the basis of cooling inflation and a resilient labor market. While rate hikes and fiscal policy will still continue to weigh on the growth across G10 economies, Hatzius is confident that the worst of that \"drag\" is already over. \"Both the Euro area and the UK are expected to have a meaningful acceleration in real income growth — to around 2% by end-2024 — as the gas shock following Russia's invasion of Ukraine fades,\" the economists also noted.
