By comparison, the German government expects the economy to contract by 0.4% in 2023. The euro zone's largest economy is struggling with the highest interest rates in a decade, high inflation and weakness in international trade. Declining industrial production and a shrinking construction sector are also taking their toll.

OffOn LOG IN Stream on Economy has lost momentum during a tough year, EU commission says and warns of risk from Mideast The European Union’s executive commission has lowered growth its expectations for this year and next, saying the economy “has lost momentum” as inflation discourages consumers and higher interest rates deter borrowing for purchases and investment ByDAVID MCHUGH AP business writer November 15, 2023, 10:17 AM FILE - People looking for cheap clothes in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, on Sept. 28, 2023. The inflation that has been wearing on European consumers fell sharply to 2.9% in October, its lowest in more than two years as fuel prices fell and rapid interest rate hikes from the European Central Bank took hold. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File) The Associated Press FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Union's executive commission lowered growth its expectations for this year and next, saying the economy “has lost momentum” as inflation discourages consumers and higher interest rates deter borrowing for purchases and investment. The outlook was lowered to 0.6% from 0.8% for the 20 countries that use the euro currency, and to 1.2% from 1.3% for next year, the commission said Wednesday in its autumn economic forecast, which revised figures from its previous forecast in September. And the outlook is exposed to risks of trouble spreading from Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. So far, the conflict in Gaza has not interfered with oil supplies from Mideast producers such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and oil prices have fallen recently, while Europe's underground natural gas storage facilities are full ahead of the winter heating season. Nevertheless, “the main risk that we see is energy prices,” said Paolo Gentiloni, the EU's commissioner for economy. “I think we are all aware that if this conflict escalates, if it involves neighboring countries in some way ... it could create spillovers on energy prices.” While growth remains anemic, unemployment remains near record lows and growth should improve as inflation falls and leaves people with more spending more, the commission said. Meanwhile, government deficits and debt have declined after a burst of stimulus spending during the COVID-19 pandemic. Gentiloni said at a news conference in Brussels that “growth momentum in the EU remains very weak.” Hopes for a recovery are being sustained by investment and spending from the EU's pandemic recovery fund, and from a strong labor market, which provided “the main underlying force behind the outlook” for growth, he said. \"Importantly, this forecast foresees wage growth exceeding inflation, finally allowing workers to at least partially recovery purchasing power, Gentiloni said. The economy has barely grown this year, recording zero increase in the first quarter, 0.2% growth in the third, and a fall of 0.1% in output in the third quarter. Inflation declined to 2.9% in October from its peak of 10.6% a year earlier as the European Central Bank swiftly raised its key interest rate benchmark from minus 0.5% to 4% in just over a year. Higher interest rates are the typical central bank tool against inflation. But they can also weigh on growth by making credit more expensive for consumer purchases or for business investment in new offices or production facilities.

    "originBody": "HomeOffice of the SpokespersonPress Releases…Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee hide Joint Statement of the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee Media Note Office of the Spokesperson November 14, 2023 The text of the following statement was released by the Governments of the United States of America and the Government of Japan on the occasion of the second ministerial meeting of the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee. Begin text: We, Japan’s Minister for Foreign Affairs KAMIKAWA Yoko; Japan’s Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry NISHIMURA Yasutoshi; United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken; and United States Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, convened in San Francisco on November 14, 2023, for the second ministerial meeting of the Japan-U.S. Economic Policy Consultative Committee (EPCC). Japan and the United States have taken concrete steps to advance economic prosperity and security in 2023, including as part of Japan’s G7 presidency and the U.S. APEC host year. We affirm our continued shared commitment to enhancing the rules-based international economic order and making our economies more competitive and resilient. Together with like-minded partners, we intend to build on efforts such as the G7 Leaders’ Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security and APEC to create a resilient and sustainable future for all, including through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF). These efforts enhance our ongoing, bilateral strategic coordination on economic resilience and economic security by further reducing vulnerabilities and countering malign practices that exploit and reinforce those vulnerabilities. We aim to maximally align our economic, technology, and related strategies to advance innovation and build the industrial base, supply chains, and strategic emerging industries of the future, while at the same time accelerating our decarbonization efforts in line with our 2030 climate commitments and achieving global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest. We commit to promote public-private collaboration toward this end, including in furtherance of reskilling and workforce development, as well as startup-friendly ecosystems, while supporting women’s economic empowerment, women’s leadership in the public and private sectors, and women entrepreneurs. We also plan to pursue cross-sectoral initiatives to further strengthen business-to-business collaboration between our two countries, including maximizing innovation and investment to support the clean energy transition. We intend to strategically promote coordination of policies to address rising threats to our economic and national security, and to enhance communication with other like-minded partners to achieve this objective. We also intend to enhance private sector engagement, to better inform our vision under EPCC. We remain deeply concerned with the impact of Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine that continues to inflict death and destruction upon Ukraine’s people. Russia’s heinous war is also exacerbating fragility in the global economy by disrupting supply chains, heightening energy and food insecurity, increasing risk to financial stability, contributing to inflation, exacerbating market volatility, and constraining growth. We intend to continue to coordinate on preventing the cutting-edge technologies we develop, as well as existing technologies that are useful for military purposes, from being used to further military capabilities that threaten international peace and security. Strengthening the Rules-Based Economic Order in the Indo-Pacific Region 1. Economic Engagement with the Indo-Pacific Region As Indo-Pacific nations, we have a shared responsibility to advance peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. As the region stands vulnerable to economic coercion and non-market policies and practices, it is critical to enhance resilience by building trusted supply chains and promoting open markets and fair competition. We need to encourage the region to uphold meaningful labor, social, and environmental protections that attract high-quality investment and downstream buyers. We also need to encourage regional actors to enhance economic integration with trusted partners. We welcome the significant progress made this year to deepen regional economic cooperation through IPEF and look forward to continuing to work closely with our IPEF partners to enhance our economic competitiveness in the region and globally. Acknowledging the impact of existing partnerships and initiatives to promote trade and investment in the Indo-Pacific region, we intend to use EPCC as a venue for bilateral discussions on further deepening economic ties in the region. 2. Addressing Non-Market Policies and Practices We aim to build on the G7 Leaders’ Statement on Economic Resilience and Economic Security to address non-market policies and practices that are increasingly used to create and reinforce strategic dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities. These non-market policies and practices pose a systemic challenge and are deployed strategically, systematically, and in combination to fundamentally skew the playing field, dominate domestic and global markets, and create vulnerabilities in global supply chains. We are seriously concerned about the wide and evolving range of such policies and practices, which include all forms of forced technology transfer, as well as harmful industrial subsidies and market-distortive practices of state-owned enterprises, including those that create excess capacity. Japan and the United States are working bilaterally, as well as with other like-minded partners, to address the systemic challenges posed by non-market policies and practices through utilizing and developing tools, as well as international rules and norms. 3. Addressing Economic Coercion We affirm our bilateral information sharing and coordination on deterring and countering economic coercion, as well as our work with other like-minded partners, including through the G7 Coordination Platform on Economic Coercion. We welcome economic analysis by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to deepen our understanding of the effects of economic coercion. We intend to continue to improve our ability to deter and mount a coordinated response to instances of economic coercion. We plan to continue engaging partners in the Indo-Pacific region to help them identify and reduce economic vulnerabilities to support their economic development, resilience, and prosperity. We remain vigilant and intend to continue to assess potential impacts of export restrictions on critical minerals, which could significantly affect production of solar panels, semiconductors, and other essential inputs for electric vehicles, computers, and smart devices. 4. Addressing Trade Restrictions not based on Scientific Principles or Substantiated by Scientific Evidence We reiterate that measures affecting the free trade of food and agricultural products should be based on scientific principles and substantiated by scientific evidence and that restrictions on the imports of Japanese food products should be immediately rescinded. We reaffirm our satisfaction with Japan’s plans to discharge Advanced Liquid Processing System (ALPS) treated water, in light of findings by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other international experts that Japan’s plans are safe, science-based, and transparent. We acknowledge the reported monitoring results after each discharge to date, showing that the concentration of nuclides including tritium in sea water and marine products are far below internationally recognized standards. 5. Building Transparent, Resilient, and Sustainable Supply Chains We intend to work together to formulate transparent, resilient, and sustainable supply chain strategies that promote reliable and trustworthy sources for strategic goods and also advance environmental protections. Through such efforts, we aim to promote a level playing field and counter non-market policies and practices. 6. Promoting Quality Infrastructure and Sustainable Investment and Addressing Opaque Lending Practices We intend to continue working together with partner countries to make concrete progress in fostering investment under the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), building on the G7 Hiroshima Summit and G20 New Delhi Summit. To this end, the United States and Japan support the establishment of a Blue Dot Network Secretariat to certify quality infrastructure projects. We will continue calling on all actors to adhere to international rules, standards, and principles for investment, lending, and debt transparency, including those in the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment, the G20 Operational Guidelines for Sustainable Financing, the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. We are expanding economic and diplomatic ties with Pacific Island Countries, including in the area of economic cooperation, by leveraging the private sector to enhance the business environment of these countries, and by jointly promoting the provision of business development support and access to fair, competitive, and transparent financing for startups and micro, small, and medium enterprises that contribute to the solutions needed for issues such as climate resilience and addressing the infrastructure gap. 7. Personal Data Protection and Privacy Through the Japan-U.S. Commercial and Industrial Partnership (JUCIP), we will continue collaborating to facilitate cross-border data flows and effective data and privacy protections globally. In support of our efforts to enable cross-border data flows and operationalize Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT), we plan to coordinate bilaterally and multilaterally on outreach to partners to promote expansion of the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) Forum. We are committed to the establishment and promotion of the Global CBPR and Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) Systems as government-backed, internationally recognized certifications that can serve as the basis for the interoperability of privacy regimes globally. Furthering the objectives of effective data protection and privacy, we also intend to identify bilateral and multilateral opportunities for collaboration on the promotion of the OECD Declaration on Government Access to Personal Data Held by Private Sector Entities, including demonstrating how our countries adhere to the principles in the Declaration under our national laws and legal procedures, engaging non-OECD countries about supporting the Declaration, and providing input to planned OECD-led efforts to develop a roadmap for how non-OECD countries can demonstrate consistency with the Declaration. Enhancing Economic Resilience and Promoting and Protecting Critical and Emerging Technologies 8. Computing Technology A) Semiconductors We intend to continue to consult closely on global semiconductor supply and demand trends to strengthen supply chains among like-minded partners and to enhance efforts toward early warning systems to detect disruptions to the supply of semiconductors. We intend to build upon productive discussions under the Joint Task Force on the development of next-generation semiconductors to enable new designs for chips used in emerging industrial applications. We encourage cooperation on the R&D roadmap to be accelerated between Japan’s Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center (LSTC) and the U.S. National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC). We intend to promote cooperation in talent development involving academia and national research institutes and intend to start a collaborative project from next year while expanding and following up on these concrete projects. B) Artificial Intelligence We intend to lead discussions around AI with other like-minded partners in international fora, including the G7 Hiroshima AI Process and elsewhere. We welcome progress under the Hiroshima AI Process, particularly the Hiroshima Process International Guiding Principles for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems and the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems and affirm our determination to further advance the Hiroshima AI Process together with other G7 members. We intend to continue supporting efforts by relevant ministers of the G7 to conduct multi-stakeholder outreach and consultation within the G7 and beyond. We share a sense of the need for improving the interoperability of governance frameworks and welcome the opportunity to collaborate toward developing a crosswalk, to be led by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Japan’s Information-technology Promotion Agency, between the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and Japan’s AI Guidelines. We intend to cooperate on expanding the availability of cutting-edge semiconductors essential for the development of generative AI in Japan and the United States. C) Quantum Information Science and Technology We welcome the revision of the MOU between NIST and Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), which expands their cooperation to quantum technology, as well as the initiation of joint discussions on shared research interests and international standardization activities in support of the development of robust quantum supply chains and practical use cases. 9. Biotechnology In view of the lessons of the COVID-19 pandemic, we intend to promote linkages between the public and private sectors toward strengthening the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industrial base. We intend to continue working to enhance our competitiveness in biomanufacturing and to foster a healthy ecosystem for drug discovery and innovative biotechnology research between our two countries. 10. Clean Energy Technology We intend to work to strengthen battery supply chains and promote innovative technologies such as perovskite solar cells, floating offshore wind, and advanced nuclear reactors, including small modular reactors. We intend to support the development of international standards and evaluation methods to grow the global market for secure, sustainable, and resilient clean energy technology while accelerating the deployment of these technologies in our domestic markets this decade. 11. Advanced Communications Technology We intend to work to accelerate the adoption of 5G networks with Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) as a secure, commercially viable telecommunications approach in global markets, including by building workforce capacity and raising awareness of the Open RAN model. To this end, Japan intends to support the Asia Open RAN Academy (AORA) in the Philippines in its regional expansion to India and the Pacific Islands, as well as the development and implementation of the AORA interoperability lab in the Philippines. We intend to continue to advance the U.S.-Japan Global Digital Connectivity Partnership through the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on Digital Economy. We plan to continue supporting efforts to build secure and open 5G networks globally with an ambition to significantly increase the market share of Open RAN in the 5G market. Such efforts may include workshops, seminars, and proof-of-concept projects in third countries. 12. Critical Minerals We are committed to continuing to support local value creation in critical minerals supply chains, including processing and refining, to ensure those supply chains remain robust, resilient, responsible, and transparent. We plan to continue our collaboration through the Minerals Security Partnership to strengthen supply chains for critical minerals; promote responsible and sustainable investment in extraction, processing, and recycling; and to drive high Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards in order to reduce dependence on certain countries. We support efforts to promote e-waste recycling in our countries and other partner countries in the Indo-Pacific region. 13. Energy Security We underscore our commitment to reduce reliance on Russian energy. We intend to deepen our cooperation on nuclear energy and the building of robust civil nuclear energy supply chains. We aim to continue cooperation to support the development and deployment of advanced nuclear reactors, consistent with highest international nuclear security, nonproliferation, and safety standards, in each of our countries and in third countries, including through the Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of SMR Technology (FIRST) program, building upon our existing cooperation in third countries such as Romania, Indonesia, and Ghana. We endorse the expanded use of zero-emission and renewable energy resources such as offshore wind, solar, nuclear, and others as appropriate to accelerate decarbonization of our respective power sectors during this critical decade, in line with domestic and international climate commitments, as well as the role of clean hydrogen and its derivatives, such as ammonia, in decarbonizing hard to abate sectors, and we shared perspectives on the potential use of those fuels to generate zero-emission thermal power. We commend and support private sector efforts to strengthen supply chains for hydrogen production and utilization, including through joint workshops, seminars, research, and development. We intend to enhance action to reduce methane emissions across sectors, including from internationally traded fossil fuels, and to support methane emissions reduction in third countries. We welcome the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. Energy Security Dialogue at the Hoover Institution in Palo Alto, California, from October 16-18, where our two countries reiterated our aim to strengthen our collective energy security and accelerate the clean energy transition. 14. Food Security We remain committed to promoting rules-based, open, fair, transparent, predictable, and non-discriminatory trade as an essential basis for building more resilient and sustainable agriculture and food systems, promoting food security, and making nutritious food more available and affordable. We welcome the launch of and intend to actively engage in the Vision for Adapted Crops and Soils and to continue addressing food insecurity, including by collaborating on climate adaptation for nutritious crops and healthy soils in Africa and beyond. Recognizing the impact of the climate crisis on global food security, we intend to work together to support ambitious public and private agricultural research and development efforts to pursue increased agricultural productivity, soil health, and nutrition to meet the food needs of a growing global population. We encourage the private sector to be involved in efforts to make small farming more resilient and sustainable around the world and commend the Enhanced Linkages between Private sector and Small-scale producers (ELPS) initiative as welcomed in the 2023 G7 Agriculture Ministers’ Communique. We welcome the establishment of the Japan-U.S. Dialogue on Sustainable Agriculture as announced in Miyazaki, Japan. We condemn Russia’s weaponization of food exports and recognize the importance to global food security of resuming the shipment of grain from Ukraine through the Black Sea. We intend to continue cooperating with like-minded countries to urge Russia to return to the Black Sea Grain Initiative to enable more normal shipments of Ukraine’s grain and to improve global food security. 15. Cybersecurity We applaud the success of the U.S.-led Cybersecurity Business Development Mission to Japan in September 2023 and intend to continue promoting information sharing on cybersecurity threats, including through discussion of threat assessment and mitigation efforts in the Japan-U.S. Cyber Dialogue. We also intend to continue working to ensure interoperability of Internet-of-Things (IoT) device labeling schemes currently in development in both countries. We intend to coordinate efforts on outreach to other like-minded partners towards global interoperability of IoT device labeling schemes. We intend to strengthen research collaboration between AIST’s Cyber Physical Security Research Center (CPSEC) and NIST on cryptography and hardware security technologies under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for comprehensive research cooperation between AIST and NIST, which was renewed in 2019. 16.

This could have a wide-ranging impact for the German economy, which has been struggling in recent months. Higher interest rates and increased materials costs are among the reasons for the issues. A construction site of residential buildings on the Elbe dike near downtown Wittenberg. Soeren StachePicture AllianceGetty Images Germany's Olaf Scholz once set the goal of building 400,000 new homes a year, even before he become chancellor. Fast forward two years, and German housebuilding looks like it's collapsing, putting pressure on both his hard-to-reach goal, but also the overall economy of the country. Companies are canceling residential construction projects, order numbers are shrinking and the outlook for the industry appears bleak, a report by the Ifo Institute for Economic Research published last week showed. Over 22% of companies surveyed reported the cancellation of residential construction projects in Germany in October, a new record high. Meanwhile, 48.7% said there was a lack of orders — which compares to 46.6% in the previous month, and 18.7% a year earlier. Expectations for the residential construction industry fell to what the Ifo described as an \"exceptional low.\" And this isn't the only set of data that is raising concerns among onlookers. The latest construction PMI survey for Germany by the Hamburg Commercial Bank fell to its lowest level in three and a half years at 38.3, which also marked a decline compared to September. \"Things continue to go from bad to worse in Germany's construction sector. The housing sector is the epicentre of the downturn, nosediving at a breakneck speed,\" Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said in a press release. Elsewhere, building permits data also paints a weak picture. Between January and August, 28.3% less building permits were issued compared to the same timeframe in 2022, according to the German Federal Statistical Office. Just 175,500 permits were issued in the first eight months of the year, the data shows, indicating that the government is on track to miss its goal of 400,000 new homes. Less than 250,000 are likely to be built this year, Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research and chief economist for Germany at ING, told CNBC. 'The first victim of higher interest rates' Higher interest rates have been a key contributor to the downward trend in the sector, Brzeski said. \"The homebuilding or construction sector is the first victim of higher interest rates,\" he said, pointing to increased costs of materials and energy, as well as overall financing costs being the key reasons for the collapse. Much like many central banks around the world, the European Central Bank has been hiking interest rates in an effort to ease inflationary pressures. The ECB kept rates unchanged at 4% when it met last month, following a series of 10 consecutive increases. Klaus Wohlrabe, head of Ifo surveys, said that cuts in housing construction subsidies have also added pressure, alongside higher rates and materials. WATCH NOW VIDEO04:41 We see more market scepticism towards Germany, says Bilfinger CEO \"Taking all three points together makes it impossible for many private consumers to build a house,\" he told CNBC. 'Bad news' for the economy And the current situation is only the beginning, according to the experts. \"The situation will worsen next year, when all order books are empty, developers are left with high cost projects and demand won't pick up quickly enough,\" Brzeski explained. Wohlrabe agrees that 2024 could bring further difficulties. \"Currently many firms are relying on the backlog of orders. But the gap between current construction production and the incoming orders is widening. This means a drop in 2024 becomes more likely,\" he said. And with the construction industry being worth around 7% of Germany's GDP, such a decline could put pressure on economic growth, he added. This comes as concerns about the state of Germany's economy have been piling on throughout the year after it fell into a technical recession in the first quarter of 2023. In its most recent forecast, the European Commission said it expected Germany's economic activity to contract this year, before increasing again in 2024, even if at a lower level than previously anticipated. But it's also the jobs market that could be impacted by troubles in the homebuilding sector, Brzeski noted. WATCH NOW VIDEO03:20 Germany is the 'sore athlete' of Europe, not its 'sick man,' strategist says \"It is a clear signal that what currently is a stagnating economy could easily become an economy in recession with rising unemployment,\" he said. Last week, the German federal government announced fresh measures that aim to speed up planning and permit processes for construction work and reduce red tape. Separately, it also announced financial relief for companies incurring high electricity costs. But the experts are not fully convinced the measures will ease the housebuilding crisis Germany finds itself in, and neither Brzeski nor Wohlrabe see the measures as a clear solution. While Brzeski believes the measures could at least help smooth the downswing, Wohlrabe is concerned that without key issues like financing costs being addressed, further long-term issues could develop. If the crisis continues for too long, machinery and workforce capacities could be diminished, and would then be missing when the industry regains strength, Wohlrabe suggested, adding that this could then have a \"dampening effect\" overall.

    "title": "Mexico Surpasses Economic Growth Expectations, but Uneven Impact of Nearshoring Persists",

    "originBody": "MEXICO Mexico is on track to exceed economic growth expectations this year Multilateral organizations, ratings agencies and investment banks have updated their growth forecasts due to ‘repeated positive surprises’ in a market that has resisted financial volatility U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen greets Mexico's Secretary of Finance Rogelio Ramírez de la O, in San Francisco, November 12, 2023. JOHN G. MABANGLO (EFE) ISABELLA COTA Mexico - NOV 15, 2023 - 12:37 CET The Secretary of the Treasury of Mexico, Rogelio Ramírez de la O, arrived at the meeting of finance ministers of the APEC summit that took place on Tuesday in San Francisco with good news in his briefcase. Everything seems to indicate that Mexico is on track to exceed economic growth expectations this year, to the surprise of analysts and experts. The second economy in Latin America lifted 5.1 million people out of poverty between 2018 and 2022, the official said at the event before his counterparts from the United States, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, according to an APEC statement. The focus of his presentation was on the social assistance policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The macroeconomic and foreign direct investment (FDI) figures also look good. Multilateral organizations, rating agencies and even investment banks have been updating their growth forecasts for Mexico, surprised by the behavior of emerging markets in general, which have resisted financial volatility and shocks in global supply chains. The Mexican Ministry of Economy registered a historic amount of FDI worth $32.9 billion in the third quarter of the year. Of this amount, 76% represents a reinvestment of profits by companies that are already established in Mexico, so it is possible that the investment expected by nearshoring has not yet arrived. The term indicates a global trend to relocate manufacturing operations from China to countries closer to their final market. “Repeated positive surprises justify upwardly revised forecasts for Mexico’s growth projections,” Moody’s analysts wrote in a report published on November 8. Experts raised their growth estimates for 2023 and 2024 to 3.5% and 2.3%, respectively, compared to previous estimates of 3.3% and 1.9%. Moody’s analysts said that strong economic activity has been driven in part by strong investments, the completion of unfinished projects and nearshoring. They expect Mexico’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2025 to average “a solid 2.0%-2.5% as it continues to reap benefits from nearshoring.” The Fitch rating agency, meanwhile, has raised its own forecast for Mexico to 3.1% of GDP since September, as did the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. According to the survey of private sector specialists published by the Bank of Mexico in October, these experts raised Mexico’s GDP growth forecast for 2023 to 3.15% from a previous estimate of 3.04%. Uneven growth In a second report from Moody’s, published on Tuesday, the analysis firm warns that nearshoring is having an uneven economic impact in Mexico, since the states that have benefited from the highest proportion of investment are in the northern, central and western parts of the country. This includes Mexico City, Nuevo León, Mexico state, Jalisco, Chihuahua and Coahuila. But several states still face limitations in continuing to attract foreign direct investment, warned Moody’s. States that have traditionally received FDI have public infrastructure that allows easy access to the United States, and they have a qualified workforce, said the analysts. However, the main limitations to ensuring the future flow of foreign investment are linked to the existence of sufficient industrial parks and public investment that ensures the necessary inputs for the operation, such as water and energy.

weakness in troubled real estate sectorNov. 14, 2023 at 9:20 pmBy The Associated Press The Associated PressBEIJING (AP) — China&#8217;s economy showed more signs of reviving in October as retail sales and manufacturing picked up though the property sector remained sluggish, the government said Wednesday. Factory output rose 4.6% from a year earlier in October, while retail sales jumped 7.6%, helped by robust spending during the weeklong National Day holidays. But real estate investment sank 9.3%, and officials acknowledged that the industry was still in the “midst of adjustment,” after a crackdown on excessive borrowing by developers two years ago, coupled with the pandemic, plunged the industry into crisis.Disruptions to manufacturing, transport, travel and virtually every other aspect of life during the pandemic ended nearly a year ago when China&#8217;s leaders abandoned their “zero-COVID” policies aimed at preventing infections. So improved economic data from October also reflect lower rates of growth a year earlier. Overall, China&#8217;s recovery from the pandemic has been fitful, though recently activity has revived, leading many economists to upgrade their estimates for growth this year to above the government&#8217;s target of about 5%.China’s economy slowed in the summer as global demand for its exports faltered and the property sector deteriorated further. The economy expanded at a 4.9% annual pace in July-September, beating analysts’ forecasts of about 4.5%, official data show. But that was much slower than the 6.3% annual growth rate of the previous quarter.Advertising The recent evidence that the world’s No. 2 economy is again gaining steam comes just as President Xi Jinping is due to meet later Wednesday with U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit in California. Briefing reporters in Beijing, Liu Aihua, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, repeatedly emphasized China&#8217;s transition to new models of growth, part of a decades-long shift from rapid industrialization and heavy investments in factories, ports and other infrastructure to a more sustainable pace of growth led by consumer spending. The economy was continuing to improve under “effective” policies, though its recovery was experiencing “wave-like development and tortuous progress,” he said. “At present, the external pressure is still great, the constraints of insufficient domestic demand are still prominent, enterprises have many difficulties in production and operation, and hidden risks in some fields require much attention,” Liu said. The report showed consumer spending is playing an increasingly important role in driving growth, with consumption contributing 83.2% to economic growth in January-October, up 6% from the same period a year earlier. Given the wide gap between the incomes of city dwellers and people living in rural areas, there is ample room for growth, Liu said. The auto industry stands out. Sales of passenger cars rose 10.2% in October over a year earlier as makers ramped up promotions and customers opted for electric and hybrid vehicles. Exports of passenger cars jumped nearly 50% to 391,000 units in October and have risen 66% this year, to just over 3 million units, the China Passenger Car Association reported last week. But he acknowledged that Chinese families have limited leeway to spend and that employment remains an issue.Overall unemployment remained at 5% in October. The government stopped announcing the rate of unemployment for young workers months ago, once it topped 20%. Liu said the statistics bureau and other relevant departments were researching the issue and working to improve collection of statistics and that updates on the situation would be released “at an appropriate time.”The Associated Press Most Read Business Stories Dubai Air Show opens with a huge boost for BoeingBoeing still lags Airbus in jet deliveries, but orders are soaringSharp drop in airfares cheers inflation-weary travelersTacoma renter measure still narrowly ahead as final ballots are countedStarbucks unionized baristas plan largest-ever strike for Red Cup Day The Seattle Times does not append comment threads to stories from wire services such as the Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post or Bloomberg News.
