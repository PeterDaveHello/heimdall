OffOn LOG IN Stream on British economy flatlines in third quarter of the year, update shows The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year ByPAN PYLAS Associated Press November 10, 2023, 7:46 AM FILE - Christmas lights are displayed on Regent Street in London on Nov. 24, 2022. The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year, official figures showed Friday, Nov. 10, 2023, ahead of a budget statement from the government later this month. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) The Associated Press LONDON -- The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year, official figures showed Friday ahead of a budget statement from the government later this month that it hopes will bolster growth in the run-up to national elections. The Office for National Statistics said growth in the July-to-September period was zero compared to the previous three-months. All sectors, such as manufacturing and construction, broadly showed the same subdued picture. Despite the uninspiring headline figure, the quarterly outcome was slightly ahead of analysts' expectations for a modest decline in output. The British economy, like many others particularly in the world, is facing headwinds in the form of higher interest rates, which are aimed at taming inflation. Last week, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at the 15-year high of 5.25% and indicated that borrowing costs will likely remain at these elevated levels for a while to get inflation back to its target of 2% from the current 6.7% The Bank of England, like other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively from near zero as it sought to counter price rises first stoked by supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy costs. One way higher interest rates work in getting inflation down is by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, thereby reining in spending. “With higher interest rates feeding through to mortgage holders and with challenges in the labour market, activity is likely to flatline through to the middle of next year,” said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. Though a widely predicted recession has not materialized over the past year, the economic backdrop is hardly ideal for the governing Conservative Party given that a general election must take place by January 2025. The main opposition Labour Party is way ahead in opinion polls at present. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said a budget statement he will deliver on Nov. 22 will focus on how to “get the economy growing healthily again by unlocking investment.” Labour economy spokesperson Rachel Reeves said the figures provide “further evidence that the economy is not working under the Conservatives.” Related Topics United Kingdom Top Stories Former Baltimore prosecutor Marilyn Mosby found guilty of perjury Nov 10, 3:26 AM New book details chaos when Trump aide tried to start Afghanistan withdrawal 2 hours ago Biden keeps polling poorly and other Democrats keep winning anyway.

    "title": "UK Economy Stagnates Amid High Interest Rates and Housing Industry Woes",

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT U.K. Economy Stagnates as High Interest Rates Take Toll By Eshe Nelson Reporting from London Nov. 10, 2023, 4:30 a.m. ET Share full article The News The British economy flatlined in the third quarter, entering what is expected to be a protracted period of stagnation on the cusp of a recession. Gross domestic product recorded no growth in July to September compared with the previous quarter, when it grew 0.2 percent. The economy was 0.6 percent larger in the third quarter than a year ago, when many businesses closed for the state funeral for Queen Elizabeth II, the Office for National Statistics said on Friday. Image The heart of London’s West End. Britain’s economy has entered a protracted period of stagnation, according to economists. Credit... Jane Stockdale for The New York Times Deeper Into the Numbers: Housing drags as higher rates hit. After proving unexpectedly resilient this year despite the rising cost of living, the British economy has weakened notably. The services sector contracted last quarter as the highest interest rates since 2008 have weighed on the housing industry. The manufacturing industry also slumped, while repairs helped offset the decline in new work in the construction sector. According to the statistics agency’s breakdown of G.D.P. by month, the economy grew 0.2 percent in September, slightly more than in August, which came after a 0.6 percent decline in July. International Comparisons: A stagnant Europe and strong United States. Britain’s weak economy mirrors the stagnation in Europe, where eurozone economies contracted 0.1 percent in the third quarter. Germany, the bloc’s largest economy, has barely avoided a recession as businesses have been hit by high energy prices and weak demand for industrial goods. Across the region, high interest rates intended to drive down inflation are weakening economic activity, with demand for loans dropping and consumer spending slowing. This contrasts with the United States, where the economy is growing strongly and defying expectations for a slowdown prompted by high interest rates. Instead, slowing inflation and a resilient labor market have bolstered consumers’ confidence to spend. The Outlook: No growth — but no recession. The British economy is not expected to sink into a recession, according to the Bank of England, but it will only avoid this distinction by a whisker. The central bank forecasts G.D.P. to increase just 0.1 percent in the last three months of the year and then to flatline throughout 2024 and the beginning of 2025. This weak outlook is driven by high interest rates, which are expected to have an increasingly heavy toll on the economy. So far, less than half of the full effect of higher rates has been felt, the central bank estimates, and policymakers expect the restraining effects to shift from the housing market into business investment and consumer spending. Quotable: “Chugging along really slowly.” Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, an independent research institute, said this week that they expected “sluggish” economic growth this year and next, but slightly stronger activity than the Bank of England foresees. “The bottom line here is that the U.K. is almost flatlining, chugging along really slowly,” said Stephen Millard, a deputy director at the institute, “and the precise numbers are almost besides the point.” About five million people in lower income groups won’t see their living standards return to prepandemic levels until 2026, the institute forecasts. What’s Next: The government introduces efforts to bolster the economy. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the Exchequer, will announce updates to the country’s budget later this month, which he said would focus on “how we get the economy growing healthily again” through private investment and encouraging more people back into work. But Mr. Hunt is not expected to make any substantial changes to taxes or spending because of the constraints imposed by another of his priorities: reducing the national debt as a share of G.D.P. Even if it looks like the nation’s public finances are in better shape than expected, most analysts expect Mr. Hunt to wait until closer to the next election, which must be held by January 2025, to offer fiscal sweeteners. But economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research have urged the government to significantly and urgently increase public investment, particularly in infrastructure and housing.

    "originBody": "United Kingdom UK economy fails to grow but sidesteps start of a recession By William Schomberg and Andy Bruce November 10, 20239:12 AM UTCUpdated 4 hours ago People walk over London Bridge looking at a view of Tower Bridge in the City of London financial district in London, Britain, October 25, 2023. REUTERS/ Susannah Ireland/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Summary UK GDP 0.0% in Q3 vs Reuters poll -0.1% GDP in Sept +0.2% vs poll 0.0% Hunt promises measures to boost growth Jobs and inflation data next week key for BoE LONDON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Britain's stagnating economy failed to grow in the July-to-September period but at least managed to avoid the start of a recession, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed on Friday. The 0% change in gross domestic product in the third quarter was a touch better than a forecast for a 0.1% fall in a Reuters poll of economists, which many analysts said was likely to represent the start of a recession. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Paul Dales, chief economist with consultancy Capital Economics, said the fine details of the data showed GDP did decline by a marginal 0.02% even if the figure was rounded to show no change. \"But the key point is that the economy is not weak enough to reduce core inflation and wage growth quickly,\" Dales said. \"As such, we don't expect the Bank of England will be able to cut interest rates until late in 2024 rather than in mid-2024 as widely expected.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue James Smith at ING said the economy was saved from a contraction by net imports which are often volatile, while consumption and business investment fell. The data from the Office for National Statistics is preliminary and may be subject to revision. Reuters Graphics The BoE said last week it expected zero economic growth next year - a tough backdrop for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak who is widely expected to call a national election in 2024 - but it kept interest rates at a 15-year high as it continued to battle an inflation rate that is more than three times its 2% target. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The BoE, which acknowledges the economic pain being caused by its 14 back-to-back interest rate increases over nearly two years to August, had been expecting a flat reading for GDP in the third quarter. Economic output per head fell 0.1% in the third quarter, the first drop in a year. Britain's economy has failed to recover the kind of growth it enjoyed before the 2008-09 global financial crisis and the weak outlook is putting pressure on finance minister Jeremy Hunt to come up with pro-growth measures in a Nov. 22 budget update. \"The Autumn Statement will focus on how we get the economy growing healthily again by unlocking investment, getting people back into work and reforming our public services,\" Hunt said after Friday's data. The situation is no better in the euro zone where problems in Germany are likely to mean that official figures due on Tuesday show GDP fell by 0.1% in the third quarter, according to a Reuters poll. While the BoE might take comfort from the avoidance, so far, of a recession in Britain, it is probably more likely to focus on key data releases due next week which are likely to show a sharp fall in headline inflation but probably little easing in the pace of wage growth that worries the central bank. In the month of September alone, Britain's economy grew by 0.2% from August when growth was revised down to 0.1% from 0.2%. The Reuters poll had pointed to no change in GDP in September. In the three months to September, output in Britain's huge services sector fell by 0.1%, industrial production was broadly flat and construction grew by 0.1%, the statistics office said. Britain's economy stood 1.8% above its level in late 2019, the ONS said, making its post-COVID recovery stronger than that of Germany and matching that of France but a long way behind the United States where the economy has grown by more than 7% from its pre-pandemic level.

U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said high inflation remains the \"single greatest barrier to economic growth\" in the country. Skyscrapers in the Canary Wharf financial, business and shopping district in London, UK. BloombergBloombergGetty Images The U.K. economy flatlined in the third quarter, initial figures showed Friday. Gross domestic product showed no quarterly growth in the the three months to the end of September, following an increase of 0.2% the previous quarter. In annual terms, Britain's third-quarter GDP was 0.6% higher than in the same period in 2022. Services sector output dropped 0.1% on the quarter, but the decline was offset by a 0.1% increase in construction performance, while the production sector flatlined. U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt said high inflation remains the \"single greatest barrier to economic growth\" in the country, with the consumer price index remaining at 6.7% year-on-year in September. \"The best way to sustainably grow our economy right now is stick to our plan and knock inflation on its head,\" Hunt said. \"The Autumn Statement will focus on how we get the economy growing healthily again by unlocking investment, getting people back into work and reforming our public services so we can deliver the growth our country needs.\" Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter Investors, said the Friday figures confirmed an incoming slowdown that has been increasingly signaled by leading indicators in recent months, with consumer spending and business activity showing cracks that have also softened labor demand. \"September's data did positively surprise thanks to the U.K.'s strong services sector, but was not enough to offset July's negative print and produce any growth in Q3 relative to the previous quarter. While somehow avoiding a recession this year, today's no growth reading means the UK economy is flatlining with only 0.2% economic growth in the last six months.\" she said. \"Unfortunately, for many the economic pain has only been delayed.

    "title": "Thailand Announces $14 Billion Cash Handout Program to Boost Economy",
    "originLink": "https://time.com/6333748/thailand-digital-wallet-cash-handout/",
    "originBody": "By Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Pathom Sangwongwanich / Bloomberg November 10, 2023 5:00 AM EST Thailand unveiled a $14 billion cash handout to jumpstart its economy, trimming the size of the planned stimulus only slightly despite warnings from some economists and former central bankers that the outlay may stoke inflation and widen fiscal deficit. The so-called digital wallet program will cover 50 million people with each receiving 10,000 baht ($280) that may be ready for disbursal by May, according to Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin. That’s down from an original proposal to extend the handout to 56 million people who are 16 years or older. Read more: After Awkward Ascension, Thailand’s New Prime Minister Tries Old-Fashioned Populism To be eligible for the cash handout, one should be earning less than 70,000 baht a month and hold less than 500,000 baht in savings accounts. The cash dole will cost the government 500 billion baht and will be funded through a one-time borrowing, Srettha said. The government plans to move a special bill before the parliament by early next year to facilitate the borrowing, he said, adding the administration will also inject 100 billion baht into a capacity-building fund to promote automation and industrial innovation. Shares of Thailand’s retailers and home-furnishing companies rallied on the wallet announcement while bonds and currencies fell on concerns of fresh borrowing widening the fiscal deficit. Central Retail Corp Pcl jumped as much as 6%, Berli Jucker Pcl surged 5.6%, Home Product Center Pcl rose 3.4% and Index Livingmall Pcl advanced 3%. The baht extended losses to 0.8%, set for its first weekly loss in three, while the yield on 10-year sovereign bonds rose 3 basis points to 3.066%. The one-time digital wallet payment is the flagship pre-election promise of Pheu Thai Party that leads the current coalition government. Srettha, a former property tycoon-turned-premier, has said the cash handout “will act as a trigger to revitalize the economy,” that has expanded at less than 2% average in the past decade, well below its Southeast Asian neighbors such as Indonesia and Vietnam. “This marks the beginning of Thailand’s economic shift,” Srettha said. “This digital wallet scheme is only an initial economic stimulus policy. And let me reiterate that this is not a populist policy that will damage the economy and wellbeing of the people.” Srettha’s proposals are part of a plan to stimulate economic growth to about 5% annually over the next four years. A petition signed by dozens of Thai economists and analysts, including former central bankers, last month said the program will do more harm than good. It’s also at odds with Bank of Thailand Governor Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput’s stance calling for prioritizing investment over stimulating consumption. On Friday, Srettha defended the stimulus measures saying they were meant to boost the economy in the short term and will not be inflationary. The funding of the digital wallet scheme will adhere to fiscal discipline and help reduce the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product, he said. The plan needs the approval of the cabinet and parliament, the premier said. The main opposition Move Forward Party slammed the the plan to borrow money to finance the digital wallet, saying it will violate several existing laws and imperil the nation’s fiscal discipline and saddle it with interest and debt burden for years to come. Read more: Thailand’s Populist Pheu Thai Party Finally Won the Prime Minister Vote—But at What Cost? “Interest burden on the budget will exceed 10% in fiscal year 2025, which is something that credit rating agencies are definitely keeping an eye on to cut ratings,” party’s deputy leader Sirikanya Tansakun said. While the cash handout is seen stimulating purchasing power at grassroots level of the economy in the short term, more measures may be needed to sustain the momentum, said Amonthep Chawla, head of research at CIMB Thai Bank. The use of blockchain technology will help prevent the fund’s misuse and lay the foundation for a digital economy that can tackle structural problems, Srettha said. Those not eligible for the cash handout can claim a personal income tax rebate on spending of as much as 50,000 baht in 2024, Srettha said. The government plans to pay back the money borrowed to finance the digital wallet within four years, he said.",

    "title": "Anne Arundel County Residents Express Concerns Over Crime and Economy, According to AACC Poll",
    "originLink": "https://www.capitalgazette.com/politics/ac-cn-poll-crime-economy-anne-arundel-county-20231110-ueuwlfoux5dvzcz2g2vpupnvfi-story.html",
    "originBody": "A recent poll of Anne Arundel County residents listed crime and the state of the economy as the area’s most pressing challenges. Approximately 36% of the 586 county residents who responded to the survey conducted in the last week of October cited crime as a top concern, while 23% pointed to the state of the economy, including employment, cost of living and the business environment, as a major issue. The poll was conducted by Anne Arundel Community College and the Center for the Study of Local Issues. Crime has consistently ranked as a major concern in the survey over the past year, with 24% viewing it as a top issue six months ago and 27% a year ago. Meanwhile, concern about the economy has declined. Six months ago, 22% of respondents cited it as a top issue; a year ago, 32% did. Increased concern over public safety generally aligns with crime trends over the past year in Anne Arundel. Though the county’s homicide rate has stayed almost the same, with 12 victims so far this year and 13 in the same period last year, according to Anne Arundel County Police Department spokesperson Justin Mulcahy, the city of Annapolis has seen a significant uptick. So far, the city has reported nine homicide victims this year as opposed to one at this time last year. A shooting in June on Paddington Place in Annapolis that resulted in the deaths of three people contributed to that uptick. Another factor driving crime, including a 20% increase in gun violence since last year, is the number of incidents involving young people, said Annapolis Police Chief Edward Jackson. “That’s a phenomenon that’s not unique to the city of Annapolis, it’s all over the place, all over the country, throughout the state of Maryland,” Jackson said. “Most of it is retaliatory, neighborhood disputes.” According to Annapolis Police spokesperson Shepard Bennett, there are few records on how many young people have committed crimes because of restrictions passed by the General Assembly on arresting or charging juveniles. “Juveniles have been empowered by legislation and they feel the law favors them not being held accountable when they do commit crime,” Jackson said. “A lot of them are not going to school and we see this throughout Anne Arundel County, especially in underserved communities in Annapolis, subsidized housing, parents who are struggling with poverty and it’s a challenge for educators.” In order to reverse the trend Jackson said it’s necessary to look at the punishments handed down to youthful offenders from a legislative and judicial perspective. Incarceration is not the only way to hold them accountable or break the cycle of youth crime, he said, adding that providing social services and focusing more attention on school truancy could also produce positive results. “Crime is anti-social behavior,” he said. “A lot of these juveniles are crying out for help, and it manifests itself in the behaviors that we’re seeing, the violence that we’re seeing. It’s a whole host of social and government agencies that need to participate if we want to get a handle on this juvenile violence.” Many survey respondents specified guns as a concern as well as shootings in Annapolis and the lack of an adequate plan to restore and maintain public safety. Some took issue with what they felt was Gov. Wes Moore’s and the Maryland legislature’s hands-off approach to holding juveniles responsible for crimes.

The second highest-rated issue was the economy. It was most concerning to 31% of unaffiliated voters, 22% of Democrats and 18% of Republicans. Respondents noted rising inflation, food and gas prices as major components. “We are still in this high inflationary environment,” said Amy Gowan, CEO and president of Anne Arundel Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-government nonprofit. “I do think people are having to make choices about their spending.” Employment and wages, however, are steadily reaching pre-pandemic levels, Gowan said. Between this year and last year, the county’s unemployment rate dropped nearly 1 percentage point. The jobless rate now stands at 1.7%, with about 5,000 unemployed residents, compared to 8,000 at this time last year. Gowan credits some of this to growth at Fort Meade, which has led to employment opportunities in the cyber industry and among other government contractors. The county’s business sector is also growing at a faster rate this year with 217 new businesses or added locations to existing businesses so far this year compared to 176 at this time last year. “The biggest issue we hear from employers when we talk to them ... is challenges with the talent pipeline and workforce — attraction and retention primarily,” Gowan said. “Wages are increasing but I don’t know that they’re necessarily commensurate in all industries with the cost of living right now.”",
