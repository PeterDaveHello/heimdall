    "title": "Japan's Economy Shows Signs of Turning Point: Can Inflation Expectations and Corporate Dynamism Drive Growth?",
    "originLink": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/16/is-japans-economy-at-a-turning-point",
    "originBody": "AsiaA chance to rise again Is Japan’s economy at a turning point? Wage and price inflation is coinciding with an exciting corporate renewal image: getty images Nov 16th 2023TOKYO Share A oki masahiko, a prominent Japanese economist, once predicted it would take 30 years for his country’s economy to emerge from the “lost decades” that began in the early 1990s. At that time, an asset bubble burst and the sun set on the model that had helped Japan grow rapidly. Though the country remained rich, it slid into deflation and its growth rate slowed. Aoki reckoned generational change would be necessary for a new model to coalesce. He started the clock at the moment the bubble had definitively burst and the long-time ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party, first lost power: the year of 1993. Fast forward to 2023 and Aoki’s words ring prophetic. The world’s third-largest economy is awakening from its decades-long torpor. After years of deflation or low inflation, Japan is seeing its fastest price growth in more than 30 years. Wages, long stagnant, are rising faster than at any time since the 1990s. Both increases are driven largely by global supply shocks. But they are not the only changes afoot. As Aoki predicted, gradual institutional and generational shifts are bearing fruit and changing Japan Inc from within. Struggling to keep upimage: the economist This confluence of external shocks and internal evolution represents a chance for Japan to change its economic trajectory. The country’s share of global gdp in ppp terms has fallen from 9% in 1990 to under 4% today; its gdp per person in ppp terms slid from 81% of America’s level to 64% over the same period (see chart). Goldman Sachs, a bank, projects that Japan will drop out of the top five economies by 2050 and out of the top ten by 2075. A shrinking population limits the upsides to its growth. Even so, if Japan can reset inflation expectations, boost productivity and unleash corporate dynamism, its fall from the top league could perhaps be halted. Investors are excited. Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons Japan has “convincingly emerged from three decades of economic stagnation”. Warren Buffett has built up large holdings in five Japanese trading houses. Earlier this year, the benchmark Nikkei stock index hit its highest level since the bubble burst. “Japan is undergoing a series of extraordinary economic transformations,” gushed Larry Fink, the ceo of BlackRock, an asset-management firm, while in Tokyo in October. The past 30 years have seen many false dawns in Japan. There are reasons for scepticism this time, too. Japan’s post-pandemic recovery remains fragile: after growing 4.5% year-on-year in the second quarter, gdp contracted by 2.1% in the third quarter, according to data released on November 15th. Wages have not kept pace with price increases. Consumption is flat. The yen’s depreciation led the International Monetary Fund to project that Japan’s nominal gdp in dollar terms will slip this year from third largest to fourth in the world, behind America, China and Germany. Servicing Japan’s massive government debt is already a heavy burden. It will become more of one if the Bank of Japan (boj) moves away from its ultra-loose policy based on negative interest rates and yield-curve control, as it hints it may do next year. Many firms that rely on interest-free capital would struggle to stay solvent, too. Japan’s workforce is still shrinking and ageing. Its firms continue to hoard cash. Over 40% of firms listed on Japan’s topix 500 trade below book value, compared with under 5% on America’s s&p 500. Foreign-investor interest has as much to do with Japan’s relative stability and cheap currency as excitement about new growth. Yet those familiar flaws obscure other developments. In recent decades “the fundamental problem of the Japanese economy was dynamism,” says Hoshi Takeo of the University of Tokyo. Too few new companies were formed, too many old ones hung around, prices barely changed and talent was trapped within firms for life. “Now we’re seeing that begin to change.” Inflating hopesimage: the economist Start with prices. Headline annual inflation has been above the boj’s 2% target for 18 straight months. Even if much of that is due to higher import costs the psychology of price-setting is changing as a result. Firms have been forced to test the long-held assumption that pushing up prices would mean losing customers. “We came to understand we can raise prices,” says Niinami Takeshi, the ceo of Suntory, a big drinks maker, and the chair of Keizai Doyukai, an influential association of corporate executives. The practice has become widespread: prices for nearly 90% of items monitored by the boj are rising (see chart). Demographic opportunity Higher inflation has outsized implications for wages, which have stagnated for decades. Inflation of 1% in Japan produces wage growth of just 0.2%, but the sensitivity jumps when inflation exceeds 2%, reckons Ota Tomohiro of Goldman Sachs. Demographic change ought to provide another push. Though Japan’s population started shrinking more than a decade ago, women and old people entering the workforce largely offset the decline. But that trend has slowed in recent years, leaving employers feeling the crunch and needing to entice workers with higher pay. Though wage growth still lags price growth, if next year’s annual shunto wage negotiations produce big gains again, a long-awaited virtuous cycle of price and wage growth would be tantalisingly close. Geopolitical turbulence, from war in Ukraine to tension between America, Japan’s security provider, and China, its largest trading partner, has also changed the landscape for Japan Inc. A growing number of executives recognise that “we can’t keep the status quo,” says Mr Niinami. As firms prioritise supply-chain resilience and worry about location risk, Japan stands to benefit. Even if manufacturers do not build factories in Japan, they may rely on its factory-automation firms to help build them elsewhere. America once perceived Japan as an economic rival, yet it now wants to see Japan thrive. American officials cheered as ibm, an American tech giant, entered into a joint venture with Japanese counterparts to design chips in Japan. Japanese firms are poised to put their cash to use. The growth rate for planned capital investments is at its highest level since the boj began collecting survey data in 1983. The government is encouraging this trend: big subsidies have gone to the semiconductor industry; the government has pledged to spend 2trn yen ($13.2bn), or 0.3% of gdp, per year for the next decade to fuel the green transition. With defence spending set to rise substantially, officials want to spur defence-industrial-driven innovation of a kind that was formerly taboo. Corporate-governance reforms that began over a decade ago have become entrenched. Pressure to enhance corporate value and return on equity no longer comes solely from foreign activists—Japanese institutional investors are also pushing. The pressure will increase. The government announced an “asset-doubling plan” that seeks to encourage Japanese savers to invest their cash holdings, with tax incentives set to come into effect next year. The jpx, which oversees the Tokyo Stock Exchange, is another force for change under its new president, Yamaji Hiromi. Beginning next year, the bourse plans to publish a list of firms that meet corporate-governance guidelines. Mr Yamaji says that when ceos approach him at the golf club to grumble, he answers: “Good luck.” These shifts have coincided with generational change in Japanese business. The average age of ceos at firms in the Nikkei stock index has dropped by 12 years in a decade, according to Jesper Koll of Monex Group, a brokerage. Many are moving beyond old mores such as lifetime employment and seniority-based pay. Young Japanese are happy to switch jobs. The best and brightest increasingly join or start new firms. “We should be betting on these groups of people,” says Namba Tomoko, a vice-chair of Keidanren, a business group. The startup ecosystem is small relative to Japan’s gdp, yet increasingly vibrant. “The old Japan is still there, but in parallel to that a new Japan coexists and grows,” says Kushida Kenji of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, an American think-tank. Investment in startups rose from 88bn yen in 2013 to 877bn yen in 2022; the number of Japanese venture-capital funds has quadrupled in that time. Where many Japanese entrepreneurs were once content to be big in Japan, a new class of founders with global ambitions is rising. Shin Taejun, founder of Gojo, a microfinance firm, wants it to be “the World Bank of the private sector”. Maeda Yosuke, founder of Wota, which builds decentralised water-treatment infrastructure, aspires to “solve the global water crisis”. Rather than inheriting his family’s construction firm, he decided to build his own. “The old industrial structure can’t solve the problems we want to solve,” he says. Okada Nobu, founder of Astroscale, is leading global efforts to clean up debris in outer space. Japan needs new “champions”, Mr Okada says. “We still refer to Sony and Honda—let’s forget about them.” This new generation also seeks to reshape corporate culture. Many young Japanese want to shed the post-war model based on lifetime employment, male domination and age-based hierarchies, says Takeshita Ryuichiro of Pivot, a media startup that focuses on the new Japan Inc. “Change used to be seen as negative or traitorous,” he says. “But we aim to portray pivot or change as positive.” In just over a year Pivot has racked up over 1m subscribers on YouTube, where it broadcasts interviews with founders, investors and inventors. Many Japanese executives and policymakers seem not only to understand that Japan stands at a significant juncture; they are determined to make the most of it. “People who know Japan really well ask me, is this time different?” Mr Yamaji says. “My answer is it could be—we should make it be.” The opportunity may not present itself again soon. Unlike the sun, Japan’s chance to rise does not come every day. ■ Share Reuse this content THE ECONOMIST TODAY Handpicked stories, in your inbox A daily newsletter with the best of our journalism Sign up Yes, I agree to receive exclusive content, offers and updates to products and services from The Economist Group.

    "originLink": "https://fortune.com/europe/2023/11/16/barbie-movie-added-100-million-struggling-british-economy-beyonce-taylor-swift/",
    "originBody": "FINANCE ·BARBIE Barbie movie added close to $100 million to the struggling British economy BYORIANNA ROSA ROYLE Despite looking like it was set in a pink fantasy toy town, much of Warner Bros' Barbie blockbuster was actually filmed in the U.K. MIKE KEMP/IN PICTURES — GETTY IMAGES Barbie is more than 2023’s biggest blockbuster movie and cultural zeitgeist—the iconic doll-turned-movie star is now being credited with boosting Britain’s sluggish economy. The music-anticipated film starring Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken has contributed more than $99 million (£80 million) to the U.K. economy thanks to the hiring of more than 6,000 extras, creation of 685 jobs, and patronage of more than 750 local businesses. Greta Gerwig’s movie about the Mattel doll is Warner Bros’ most successful theatrical release of all time, leapfrogging Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, The Dark Knight Rises and Joker to the top spot. In the U.K. box office alone, it generated more than $118 million (£95 million), Warner Bros recently revealed while giving evidence to the U.K. parliament. While Barbieland was designed to look like a pink fantasy toy town in California’s Venice Beach, much of the set was built and shot in the U.K. at the Warner Bros studios just north of London. The U.K. is Warner Bros’ largest base outside the U.S “During its production in the U.K., [Barbie] contributed over £80 million in direct spend to the local economy, created 685 jobs, involved over 6,000 extras, supported 754 local businesses, paid over £40 million in local wages,” Warner Bros. Discovery told the U.K. government in response to a consultation about film and high-end TV production. “The benefit of attracting such productions are that they are net positive for the U.K.” Other major film studies like Paramount and Amazon have also given evidence as part of a call for targeted tax support and changes to regulations impacting the British film industry. Warner Bros also revealed in the inquiry that the U.K. is the company’s largest base outside the U.S., with over 4,000 permanent staff. As well as being home to Barbie’s Dreamhouse the 200-acre site in Leavesden, Hertfordshire is also being used to film the forthcoming Wonka, inspired by Roald Dahl’s Charlie & The Chocolate Factory and starring Timothée Chalamet. Warner Bros is now to expand its studio’s capacity by more than 50% by 2027, turning it into the primary production hub for all future DC Studios films, including the Batman franchises. The company says another 4,000 jobs will be created in the process and $248 million (£200 million) will be contributed to the U.K. economy. Women are shaping the economy It’s not only Barbie that’s given economies—and retailers like Zara—a much-needed boost; This summer, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé went on tour for the first time since 2018 and it sent fans into a frenzy. Tickets for a seat at Swift’s Eras Tour were fetching upwards of $35,000 on reselling sites like StubHub and Viagogo; Beyoncé fans flew across the globe from Dallas to Stockholm to land a seat at Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour; Meanwhile, some desperate fans were even sneaking into their concerts by bagging security gigs. Even tickets to watch the movie of Swift’s concert—instead of the real deal—has helped AMC notch its highest-ever single-day ticket revenue in its 103-year history. Experts originally cautioned that the surge of fans going to extreme measures to see the pop icons perform was keeping inflation stubbornly high. However, Morgan Stanley recently estimated that the female powerhouses added around $5.4 billion to the U.S. economy in Q3—to put that figure into context, Swift and Beyoncé have had a greater economic impact than the 2008 Olympics did for Beijing.

    "originBody": "A bird shop destroyed by Israeli bombing of Ahmed Yassin Mosque in Gaza City on Oct. 9, two days after the deadly Hamas incursion into Israel. (Loay Ayyoub for The Washington Post) Listen 8 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save The solar energy company Sunbox paid its 15 full-time employees in Gaza this month. But next month is uncertain: The company’s main offices in Gaza City were destroyed in an Israeli strike, said Kamal Almashharawi, 24, the company’s head of operations. Get the full experience.Choose your plan The devastation of Gaza’s infrastructure has only increased the need for solar panels. Almashharawi and others say that Israeli strikes have damaged or destroyed many rooftop solar arrays — among the few sources of power in Gaza as fuel runs out. But with its office obliterated, its revenue cut and its employees sheltering from Israeli bombardments, the company, like most in the Gaza Strip, has bleak prospects in the months ahead. Story continues below advertisement Gaza’s economy already was crumbling. The war has pounded it to dust. “I don’t really see any light at the end of the tunnel,” Almashharawi said. Advertisement For the better part of two decades, economic growth in Gaza was close to stagnant amid regular conflict and Israeli restrictions on the movement of people and goods. Hamas, the militant group that has controlled the territory since 2007, often focused on military aims. With little outside investment and few jobs, living standards dropped as Gazans became poorer. Last year, 80 percent of the population relied on international aid, according to a United Nations estimate. The World Bank projected “nominal” GDP growth in 2023, driven by coronavirus pandemic recovery and more job permits for Gazans to work in Israel. Most of whatever economic activity persisted has ground to a halt amid Israel’s response to the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7. Bombardments and a ground invasion have left more than 11,100 Palestinians dead, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Some 1.5 million people — much of the population of Gaza — have been displaced, according to the United Nations. “Gaza’s economy ceased to function as of the last quarter of 2023, and will continue to be so indefinitely,” read a statement this month from the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute, based in Ramallah, in the West Bank. Story continues below advertisement Making accurate or final estimates of economic damage remains impossible. Israel has closed it borders with Gaza. A trickle of aid has entered across Gaza’s border with Egypt. Advertisement Palestinian authorities in Ramallah have said that Gaza’s economic output is running at 10 percent. “If anything, it’s a subsistence-type economy,” said Raja Khalidi, the director general of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute. The U.N. Development Program published a report this month estimating that 61 percent of jobs in Gaza had been lost, along with $857 million of economic activity, setting the economy back “by many years.” Although Gaza has a long history of conflict, there are no parallels to the scale of the present devastation. Some Palestinian officials put the economic cost of Israel’s ground operation in Gaza in 2014 at more than $6 billion. The current war is already longer and far more destructive. Story continues below advertisement “We haven’t reached bottom yet,” said Richard Kozul-Wright, who is the lead author of a report on Gaza’s economy published by the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development that was published in September. Advertisement After the violence subsides, the economic future of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents will be another line of battle. An economically viable Gaza is widely considered a prerequisite for any lasting peace. Some experts say that the pressure placed on Gaza in the years before Oct. 7 had increased support for Hamas. But many in Israel say instead that the country had become too lenient with Gaza’s economy, allowing Hamas to enrich itself. Charles Freilich, a former deputy national security adviser in Israel, said that many in Israel felt that the small but increasing level of economic cooperation with Palestinians living in Gaza had proved to be an “overall failure.” Why news outlets and the U.N. rely on Gaza Health Ministry for death tolls From bad to worse Experts say that Gaza, with its coastal location, arable land and young population, could have a productive, even thriving, economy. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement As recently as a few decades ago, some Israeli economists had hoped that Gaza could follow in the steps of Singapore, “very small,” but “with a few million people who are young who are either now or will be very educated,” said Paul Rivlin, an expert on Middle Eastern economies at Tel Aviv University. “It didn’t happen.” Per capita income in Gaza is a quarter of that in the West Bank, according to the International Monetary Fund. That gap has widened significantly since 2005, when Israel withdrew militarily from Gaza, and since Hamas took power. Israel tightly controls its borders with Gaza, limiting exports from the enclave and restricting its imports, citing concerns over the import of “dual use” goods that could be directed into weaponry. What weapons do Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have and how powerful are they? The restrictions hit hard. Only 40 percent of the population that could work did so in 2021, according to the International Labor Organization. The Hamas-run civil sector employed roughly 50,000 people, about a tenth of Gaza’s estimated labor force. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Earlier this year, the Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights reported that the number of people employed in construction had dropped from 70,000 before the restrictions to 700 — despite Gaza’s booming population. The war will make housing needs more acute. “It took four years of conflict in Syria to destroy a comparable share of housing stock,” said Abdallah Al Dardari, UNDP director for Arab states. Share this article Share Although Egypt imposed fewer economic restrictions on its border with Gaza, Rivlin said, it’s “a long way from the center of the Egyptian economy.” ‘From the river to the sea’: Why a Palestinian rallying cry ignites dispute In 2014, after a rift with Hamas, the Egyptian government destroyed most of the smuggling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt — a key source of black-market income, and funding for Hamas. Story continues below advertisement Kozul-Wright said Gaza was not a “functioning economy” before the present war. Advertisement Some economists have said the Palestinian territories, and Gaza in particular, have experienced “de-development” or “development in reverse,” with the population increasingly reliant on diminishing aid. In 2020, UNCTAD estimated that the total economic loss for Gaza between 2007 and 2018 was $16.7 billion. Little hope Satellite imagery shows that huge Gaza neighborhoods have been destroyed since last month, including areas of Gaza City once known for commercial activity. At gate to Gaza, deported workers mark end of rare exchange with Israel Israel has rescinded the permits of Palestinians who had worked in the country, and those who were in Israel have been deported. Strict sanctions have made sending cash to Gaza difficult, and aid has become scant. Story continues below advertisement In 2021, the Israeli government began a process that would allow 17,500 Gazans to work in Israel. Although most who applied did not receive permits and those who did represent a tiny fraction of Gaza’s workforce, the program still was a break from the past. Advertisement Israel allowed money from Qatar — tens of millions of dollars a month — to flow to Gaza, in part so that Hamas could keep the government functioning. Even before Oct. 7, some Israelis were raising questions about the wisdom of these policies. The veteran military journalist Amos Harel wrote in Haaretz barely a week before the attack that the notion that Gazans could pressure Hamas into economic improvements was a “false idea.” Hamas tunnels under Gaza stretch miles, holding hostages and weapons Critics say that Hamas was never focused on improving economic conditions for those in Gaza, many of whom it classifies as refugees and thus the responsibility of the United Nations. The group appears to have used much of its funds to build a vast network of tunnels. Story continues below advertisement The U.S. Treasury has sharply tightened sanctions on Hamas, accusing its leaders of living “in luxury” while Gazans face “dire economic prospects.” Advertisement Freilich, the former Israeli deputy national security adviser, said it was clear that Israel would no longer permit people from Gaza to work in the country. “There will be an attempt to end any Israeli involvement and responsibility for providing electricity, water and things like that,” he said, referring to the services that Israel has provided under the 1993 Oslo accords. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken this month that any peace agreement “must include a sustained mechanism for reconstruction.” The Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute estimated this month that the cost of rebuilding could reach $20 billion over the next five years. Gaza’s economy could shrink by 30 to 70 percent, said Anas Iqtait, an expert on Middle Eastern economies at Australian National University. “The only way for the economy to recover, if at all, is through extensive international intervention.” “It was an unacceptable situation before the war,” Khalidi said. “We know how much that contributed to the sense of desperation … that Gaza had become accustomed to.” Israel-Gaza war The Israeli military said it is carrying out a “precise and targeted operation against Hamas” at al-Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital. President Biden said Monday that Gaza’s hospitals “must be protected” as Israeli soldiers surrounded Shifa, and the hospital ran out of power and medicine. Understand what’s behind the Israel-Gaza war. Hostages: Officials say Hamas militants abducted about 239 hostages in a highly organized attack. Four hostages have been released — two Americans and two Israelis — as families hold on to hope. One released Israeli hostage recounted the “spiderweb” of Gaza tunnels she was held in. Humanitarian aid: The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it has received over 370 trucks with food, medicine and water in the Gaza Strip through Egypt’s Rafah crossing. However, the PRCS said, there hasn’t been permission yet to bring in fuel to power the enclave’s hospitals, water pumps, taxis and more. Israeli-Palestinian conflict: The Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip has a complicated history, and its rulers have long been at odds with the Palestinian Authority, the U.S.-backed government in the West Bank.

    "title": "The US economy projected to exceed expectations with Goldman Sachs Research predicting a 2.1% GDP growth in 2024",
    "originLink": "https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/the-us-economy-is-on-its-final-descent-to-a-soft-landing.html",
    "originBody": "After defying recession fears this year, the US economy is forecast by Goldman Sachs Research to easily beat consensus expectations again in 2024. US GDP is projected to expand 2.1% in 2024 on a full-year basis, compared with 1% for the consensus of economist forecasts surveyed by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Research reaffirms its longstanding view that the probability of a US recession is much lower than commonly appreciated — at just 15% over the next 12 months. “It was fair to wonder last year whether labor market overheating and an at times unsettling high inflation mindset could be reversed painlessly,” David Mericle, Goldman Sachs Research chief US economist, writes in the team’s report titled 2024 US Economic Outlook: Final Descent. “But these problems now look largely solved, the conditions for inflation to return to target are in place, and the heaviest blows from monetary and fiscal tightening are well behind us,” Mericle writes. How did US inflation fall without a spike in unemployment? At the start of 2023, Goldman Sachs Research argued that the key risk was not recession, as most forecasters thought, but rather that the economy would re-accelerate amid still-high inflation. In that case, the team assumed that the Federal Reserve would simply hike rates more aggressively to subdue demand growth so that supply could continue to catch up. But that didn’t happen. In the spring, banking stress heightened concern about raising rates too much, and by the summer it became clear that strong GDP growth wasn’t keeping the labor market from continuing to rebalance or wage growth and inflation from continuing to fall, according to Goldman Sachs Research. How has the US managed to have both strong growth and progress in bringing down inflation this year? Our economists note that labor supply has more than recovered. Transitory influences on wages and prices have faded or reversed. And high prices have cured themselves by, for example, incentivizing massive construction of rental housing. A bit more surprisingly, labor demand has been contained even as final demand for goods and services accelerated and recession fears faded. The Beveridge curve, which is a way of showing the relationship between unemployment and job openings, may help explain why. “Extremely tight labor markets create a feedback loop between workers quitting and employers pre-emptively posting more job openings,” Mericle writes. This interplay “can heat up quickly but can cool down quickly too,” Mericle writes. The hard part of the inflation fight looks over, according to Goldman Sachs Research. The unemployment rate has barely changed, but other measures of labor market tightness have fallen sharply and are on average only slightly above pre-pandemic levels. This cooling off is likely good enough, or nearly good enough, because inflation was a bit too low before the pandemic. This means further below-potential growth is no longer needed. With inflation falling and the job market buoyant, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that the Fed will keep rates steady until a rate cut in the last quarter of 2024. Our economists expect that policy decision to be followed by a 25-basis-point cut per quarter until the fed funds rate reaches 3.5-3.75% (compared with 5.25-5.5% now) in the second quarter of 2026. Why the US economy is expected to beat consensus expectations The main reason the world’s largest economy accelerated from 2022 to 2023 is that the impact of fiscal tightening and central bank rates hikes on GDP growth diminished sharply, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Our economists expect in 2024 a similarly modest drag on growth — a bit from tightening in both fiscal and financial conditions. Consumer spending is expected to be strong. Real disposable income is forecast to grow nearly 3% next year amid slowing but solid job gains, roughly 1% real wage growth, and a large increase in household interest income. Income growth will be partly offset by a higher savings rate, which is a little too low compared with its pre-pandemic level. Business investment will slow. Subsidies driven by the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act accounted for all of the net growth in business investment this year, and financing conditions are expected to be more difficult, especially for commercial real estate. At the same time, investment in artificial intelligence is rising and recessionary fears are fading, which could make business leaders more confident. All told, business investment is expected to grow 1.75% in 2024. Existing home sales are expected to be very weak next year as mortgage rates remain high. Residential investment is predicted to end the year roughly flat. Low affordability but very tight supply should generate modest home price growth of about 1% in 2024. Federal government spending is forecast to be roughly flat, while state and local spending increases 0.5%. A government shutdown would shift growth between quarters. US imports have eased from an elevated level (fueled by pandemic stimulus), but US exports remain depressed. Goldman Sachs Research predicts a recovery in foreign economic growth next year will boost demand for US exports. That’s expected to narrow the trade deficit enough in 2024 to contribute 0.2 percentage points to GDP expansion. With GDP growth near the economy’s potential growth rate, conditions for the labor market are forecast to be roughly stable in 2024. Our economists put the current trend pace of job growth at around 175,000 per month, and they expect it to slow to 100,000 in the second half of 2024. The unemployment rate will likely hover in the mid-to-high 3s next year because the layoff rate remains low and job openings remain even higher than in 2019 — one of the best labor markets in US history — in nearly every industry.

The president will also pose for the traditional “family photo” with APEC leaders, host a working lunch and a fancy leaders dinner. BIDEN-XI MEETING Pandas, fentanyl and Taiwan — takeaways from Biden’s long-awaited meeting with Xi China’s state media take a new tone toward the US ahead of meeting between their leaders Biden, Xi met for hours and agreed to ‘pick up the phone’ for any urgent concerns: ‘That’s progress’ The U.S. hasn’t hosted the annual leaders’ summit — started in 1993 by President Bill Clinton -- since 2011. The group met virtually in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders did gather in Bangkok last year, but Biden skipped the summit because his granddaughter was getting married and he sent Vice President Kamala Harris in his place. The annual leaders’ conference brings together heads of nations and other top economic and diplomatic leaders. Biden told those who gathered Wednesday evening at a welcome party — including Russia’s representative, Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk — that today’s challenges were unlike those faced by other APEC leaders. “How we’re going to harness the potential of artificial intelligence to lift up the world, while minimizing the risks and safety concerns of the present?” he asked. “Will we act, with the urgency necessary to dramatically curb carbon emissions and avert a climate catastrophe that threatens us all? Can supply chains be built that are more resilient and secure in the face of threats like natural disasters and pandemics?” On Thursday, Biden will speak to CEOs who are exploring new technologies and the concept of resilience so that companies can steer through a variety of challenges. After decades of trade built on the premise of keeping prices low, accessing new markets and maximizing profits, many companies are now finding a vulnerable global economy. The Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts aren’t helping matters. The coronavirus pandemic exposed frailties in their supply chains. Climate change has intensified natural disasters that can close factories. The Israel-Hamas war and Ukraine’s defense against a Russia invasion have generated new financial risks, and new technologies such as artificial intelligence could change how companies operate and displace workers. Chinese President Xi Jinping, too, met with American business leaders — at a $2,000-per-plate dinner Wednesday evening. It was a rare opportunity for U.S. business leaders to hear directly from the Chinese leader as they seek clarification on Beijing’s expanding security rules that may choke foreign investment. “China is pursuing high-quality development, and the United States is revitalizing its economy,” he said, according to an English language translation. “There is plenty of room for our cooperation, and we are fully able to help each other succeed and achieve win-win outcomes.” He even signaled that China would send the U.S. new pandas, just a week after three from the Smithsonian National Zoo were returned to China — much to the dismay of Americans. There are only four pandas left in the United States — at the Atlanta Zoo. Biden and Xi understand that the complicated ties between the two nations have major global impacts. Their meeting Wednesday at a Northern California estate was in part an effort to show the world that while they are global economic competitors, the U.S. and China aren’t full-fledged rivals. With his characteristic optimism, Biden sketched a vision of leaders who manage competition “responsibly,” adding, “that’s what the United States wants and what we intend to do.” Xi, though, was gloomier about the state of the post-pandemic global economy. China’s economy remains in the doldrums, with prices falling due to slack demand from consumers and businesses. “The global economy is recovering, but its momentum remains sluggish,” Xi said. “Industrial and supply chains are still under the threat of interruption and protectionism is rising. All these are grave problems.” White House officials said Biden has been bolstered by signs the U.S. economy is in a stronger position than China’s, and that the U.S. was building stronger alliances throughout the Pacific. Part of those alliances are through the IPEF framework, announced during a May 2022 trip to Tokyo. It came six years after the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that was signed by 12 countries. The new framework has four major pillars: supply chains, climate, anti-corruption and trade. There won’t be any official trade deals to announce — the “framework” label allows Biden to bypass Congress on any agreements reached with the 13 countries. ___ Associated Press writers Josh Boak in Washington and Didi Tang in San Francisco contributed to this report.

    "originBody": "National How China's weakened economy plays into talks between Biden and Xi November 15, 20234:19 PM ET Heard on All Things Considered By Tyler Bartlam , Patrick Jarenwattananon , Ari Shapiro How China's weakened economy plays into talks between Biden and Xi Listen · 5:11 5:11 Toggle more options Download Embed EmbedTranscript Robert Daly of the Wilson Center speaks about how China's weakened economy may affect talks between President Biden and President Xi. AILSA CHANG, HOST: If you were to describe the relationship between the U.S. and China, you might say it's complicated. The two countries are intertwined on trade, national security and overall economic health, even as diplomacy in the last few years has been rocky. Now, as President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping attempt a reset in San Francisco, China's economy is struggling. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The country is dealing with high youth unemployment, a real estate debt crisis, wary international investors and a slow rebound after COVID lockdowns. So does that give the U.S. more leverage in these discussions? Well, we're joined by Robert Daly of the Wilson Center, who directs the Kissinger Institute on China and the U.S. Thanks for being here. ROBERT DALY: Good to be with you. SHAPIRO: How big an economic funk is China in right now? Is this a country in decline or just growing less quickly than it used to be? DALY: I think the latter. It's growing less quickly. It is in the midst of its biggest economic crisis since it began opening up in 1978, but I think that many in the West have been too quick and too triumphalist to declare that this is peak China and that China is done. There's - you know, they face structural difficulties, but they still have a lot of strengths. SHAPIRO: Does that present opportunities for the United States in this moment? DALY: Well, the question right now is, how much is Xi's worry about his weakness at home a driver of his willingness to come to San Francisco and his willingness to perhaps offer some sweeteners to the United States to stabilize the relationship? Xi, when he speaks to the Chinese people, always emphasizes confidence. You should be confident that our form of development is correct, that we have the right form of government. You should be confident in China's culture. But he's made a lot of public misjudgments over the past several years, beginning with backing Putin on the eve of the invasion, his handling of COVID at the outset and especially his handling of COVID at the very end, when he put cities like Shanghai under lockdown for months and then suddenly dropped the lockdown and millions died. Now the economy is slowing, youth unemployment is well over 20%, and this is all happening publicly. So he may be feeling less confident when he comes to see Biden. SHAPIRO: And so can you play out how that might be useful to the Biden administration right now? DALY: Well, the Biden administration already feels that it is in a position of strength vis a vis China, at least in the security realm. It has greatly strengthened its alliances throughout Europe and with our allies in the Pacific, as well as in the Americas. It has brought Korea and Japan back together. It has concluded the AUKUS agreement with Australia and the U.K. to build nuclear submarines for Australia and to work on hypersonic weapon systems. That's all aimed at China. It has strengthened what's called the quad - Europe, Japan, Australia and the United States - also aimed at China. It's got more bases opened in the Philippines, and now NATO has a China or Asia-facing mission. SHAPIRO: So with all of that positioning... DALY: So the Biden administration's confident. SHAPIRO: Yeah. DALY: Yeah. SHAPIRO: Where does that put the Biden administration vis a vis China's economic weakness right now? DALY: Well, I think that the Biden administration knows it's too soon to make a call. This could be a few bad quarters or one or two bad years. This crisis in China is certainly nowhere nearly as bad as our financial crisis in 2008 yet, and we weren't done then. So I think that the Biden administration is not looking to take short-term advantage of China's economic weakness, nor is it clear that Xi's confidence is really dented. As far as we know, he still believes that the East is rising and that the West is declining. SHAPIRO: And so if this is going to change anything, what might it change? DALY: It gives us a chance to stabilize the relationship, which is the word that both sides are using. You mentioned that - a reset at the beginning. I don't think that's quite right. The trajectory and nature of the relationship, which is not only complicated but rivalrous, is likely to remain in place. But both sides would like to reduce the chances of conflict even as they compete vigorously. And this kind of dialogue between leaders - and in the lead up, the dialogues between secretarial-level people - can do that. It can bring some stability but not change the nature of a relationship that probably hasn't found bottom yet. SHAPIRO: The U.S. has been steadily increasing its economic controls on China under the Trump and Biden administrations. Do you think that's likely to continue, or could you envision some of these restrictions being lifted and the U.S. letting up a bit? DALY: I don't think that the export controls that are designed to hamper China's development of advanced node semiconductors and to limit its ability to get leading AI - that's not going to change because the security rationale for that has been loudly declared, and it's, by its nature, absolutist and expansionist. We've told China we're not going to give it any technologies that it could use in weapons that target us, and once you start down that road, you really can't walk that back. SHAPIRO: That's Robert Daly, director of the Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States. Thank you very much. DALY: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.
