(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post) Listen 9 min Share Comment Add to your saved stories Save There’s an economic mystery confounding the White House: Most Americans are financially better off than they were before the coronavirus pandemic, but they feel worse about their economic prospects. Rising prices are largely to blame. New data coming out Tuesday is expected to show that inflation once again lessened its grip on households in October, extending a year-long trend. That comes on top of a string of eye-popping data points — strong economic growth, unemployment at longtime lows, wages finally outpacing inflation, all leaving Americans with more money in their bank accounts than they have had in years. Get a curated selection of 10 of our best stories in your inbox every weekend. President Biden has played a considerable role in improving Americans’ financial situation, through legislative victories that have yielded a surge in government funding and related private investment, which is building electric vehicles, new bridges, airport upgrades and a host of other infrastructure and green energy projects that have juiced the economy. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Yet Americans are still angry that prices rose as much as they did, showing up in consumer sentiment that has fallen for three straight months. Just 30 percent of voters approve of President Biden’s handling of the economy, the lowest reading since he took office, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. That disconnect between a booming economy and how Americans feel about it appears to be widening at a critical time ahead of next year’s presidential election. It is also shaping up to be a key liability for the White House, even as its policies are bolstering job creation and business investments. For many voters, the economy’s recent growth comes alongside other realities, such as high inflation, rising interest rates that have made loans more costly and dwindling savings. Importantly, home prices are at an all-time high, and housing affordability is near a record low, which is also influencing people’s feelings about their finances. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “Those are all very salient things: how much you’re spending at the grocery store, how much you’re paying in rent, whether you can afford to move,” said Jonathan Rothwell, principal economist at polling giant Gallup. “Those factors are very important to people’s sense of how the economy is doing, and they’re not performing well.” Inflation, at 3.7 percent, has come down dramatically from last summer’s high of 9.1 percent and is expected to decline even further in this week’s reading. But it’s still well above what policymakers would like and has become a sticking point for households across the country. Basic expenses, such as food, housing and transportation, are considerably higher than they were a year ago, even as energy prices have declined. At the same time, families are quickly spending down the trillions in extra cash they had amassed during the pandemic. There is a growing sense among Americans, economists say, that they’re having to overspend to maintain their pre-pandemic standard of living, which is clouding their view of the broader economy. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement That’s creating ongoing challenges for the president. The White House has been playing up its “Bidenomics” plan — which has spurred more than $1 trillion in public and private investments in infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors — with creating new jobs and helping workers secure higher wages. That money is already making its way through the economy and boosting growth. Infrastructure and green energy spending are powering the economy But the bigger struggle, political analysts say, has been making it clear to Americans that the local improvements they’re seeing, in roads, high-speed internet connections and airports, are being powered by Biden’s policies. Many federal funds are being doled out through state and local governments, and are often going to businesses and contractors instead of directly to families. “‘Bidenomics’ is the right plan. It’s the right approach, and we need to just work every day to show Americans how it is delivering for them around the kitchen table,” Lael Brainard, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview. “That’s our focus: trying to make that connection that clean drinking water, affordable high-speed internet, lower drug prices, better jobs — these are all things the president is delivering every day.” Advertisement Story continues below advertisement So far, the message appears to be falling flat. A recent New York Times/Siena poll shows that a vast majority of voters in battleground states — 81 percent — say the economy is “fair” or “poor.” Meanwhile, 59 percent of voters in those states said they trusted Trump’s handling of the economy over Biden’s. Those low marks come even as the U.S. economy has, by many measures, notched quarter after quarter of strong growth. Employers have added 14 million jobs under Biden’s watch, and household wealth surged during the pandemic. The median net worth of U.S. families grew by an unprecedented 37 percent between 2019 and 2022, to $192,900, according to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances. Share this article Share But there are also signs the biggest income gains went to the wealthiest Americans, according to the Fed’s survey, while average incomes inched down for those at the bottom. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “A lot of the gains that have been reported in the economy have been oriented toward wealthier people,” said Stephen Moore, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and an economic adviser to President Donald Trump. “People are feeling financially stressed because over the last two years, inflation has gone up and they’re falling behind.” Recent union victories could help push wages even higher. In the last four months, hundreds of thousands of workers — including delivery truck drivers, health-care workers, Hollywood writers and, most recently, autoworkers and actors — have secured historic union contracts with higher pay and more job security. Biden and UAW chief celebrate rare rebirth of shuttered auto factory The president made history this fall when he joined autoworkers on the picket line and played a supporting role in getting the deal done, making phone calls to automakers and urging them to stick to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, top Labor Department officials have been involved in recent union negotiations, including at Kaiser Permanente, where 85,000 health-care workers last week ratified a four-year contract that bumps the minimum wage to at least $23 and gives existing workers a 21 percent raise. Advertisement Story continues below advertisement “This is a moment for workers, in which workers are winning at the bargaining table, they’re winning in the workplace,” said Julie Su, the Labor Department’s acting secretary. “All of those things did not happen by accident. They happened because this president has been very clear that when we build an economy that does right by workers, that’s good for employers and that’s good for the nation.” Whether that will translate to higher approval ratings or votes, though, is unclear. White House officials say the strong economy and tight labor market made these contract negotiations possible in the first place, by giving workers the leverage to demand better working conditions. At the same time, union workers in some states have moved away from the Democratic Party in recent elections. “The big problem for Democrats right now is that Trump did very well with Blue Collar America, no question about it, and a lot of those blue-collar workers are union workers,” Moore of the Heritage Foundation said. “It’s quite possible that by winning these big union concessions, that some of them will migrate back to the Democrats. But if I were a Democrat, I’d be very nervous about the abandonment of the rank-and-file union members.” Advertisement Story continues below advertisement The Biden administration though, has a year to turn around its approval ratings and convince Americans that it’s doing enough to improve their financial standing. White House officials say they feel optimistic that Americans will begin to feel better about the economy, particularly as energy costs continue to recede. Average gas prices nationwide have fallen roughly 11 percent in the last year, from $3.80 a gallon to $3.40 a gallon, according to AAA. The administration is also working to drive down health-care costs by capping prescription drug prices for seniors on insulin, for example, which “will help Americans feel more confident,” according to a senior White House official. U.S eyes battle with drug giants over 10 costly medications for seniors “We are still recovering from the pandemic and its devastating effects on the economy,” said Su. “Workers are, like everybody else, reassessing their role in the economy. They’ve had four decades of increased productivity but stagnating wages. It’s going to take some time for us to build an economy in which those concerns are addressed.” Advertisement Story continues below advertisement By any measure, Robert Huber and his fiancée are doing well: They make six figures apiece, have gotten consistent raises and are preparing to close on a custom-built house in Midlothian, Va. Still, he said they feel the continued squeeze of inflation. “With food and utilities going up, it doesn’t matter what your budget level is — we’re all feeling the pinch,” said Huber, 46, who works in health-care sales. “We’re doing well, but we’ve certainly cut back on things. When you go to the grocery store and steaks are $14 a pound, when they used to be $7 a pound, it’s like, ‘Eh, maybe I’ll get something else for dinner today.’ It forces you to rethink your budget.” Americans are still better off, with more in the bank than before the pandemic Huber, a registered Independent who voted for Biden in 2020, said he plans to do so again. He doesn’t blame the president for rising prices — after all, he said, many other parts of the world have it much worse. But he said the administration could be doing more to connect with Americans. “Where I think he’s messing up is with the messaging,” he said. “I know GDP’s up and the job market has been favorable, but that’s not what people care about. They want to know: How are you going to lower the price of my breakfast cereal?” Jeanne Whalen contributed to this report. Share Comments",

While the figure is still below the US$40.4 billion record recorded in 2018-19 (when there were almost 1.1 million international students in the country) – the last year before the COVID-19 pandemic – it is US$6.3 billion (or 19%) higher than in 2021-22. The 368,333 jobs generated by international students’ spending – both at their colleges and universities, and in their communities – is almost 10% higher than last year and is 20% higher than during the year when America’s borders were closed because of COVID. These figures, which NAFSA announced in a press release unveiling the website entitled “NAFSA International Student Economic Value Tool” (ISEVT), follows by a few days NAFSA’s announcement for the formation of a coalition with 11 other partners to increase enrolment of international students in the United States. The coalition, called the US for Success Coalition (USSC), includes NAFSA, the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, World Education Services and Niskanen Center (a Washington DC-based think tank dedicated to strengthening liberal democratic governance and promoting prosperity and opportunity that this year was named “The Most Interesting Think Tank in American Politics” by Time Magazine). USSC will work with the US government, colleges, universities and community colleges, and other stakeholders such as the business sector, to coordinate efforts in seven key areas. Among these areas is diversifying the pool of international students that come to the US, with an emphasis on the Global South, economically underrepresented students, and women. USSC will also work towards ensuring that US colleges and universities are not hamstrung by policies and practices that prevent them from competing effectively in attracting and supporting international students who seek to come to the US, and to enable businesses to hire them. According to Fanta Aw, NAFSA’s executive director and CEO, the ISEVT places data drawn from The Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange, produced by the New York-based Institute of International Education (with funding from the United States Department of State), in both the national and granular level contexts. “We break [the economic data] down by state. We break it down in terms of what it looks like for English language programmes, community colleges and other stakeholders. It’s really important for the work that we do for folks to understand that the contributions of international students are multi-dimensional,” said Aw. “In addition to the research and innovation, startups and entrepreneurship, there is also undeniably an economic contribution that they [international students] make to American society,” said Aw. Economic benefits by state The state that benefitted the most from international students was California, where 138,393 international students pumped US$6 billion into the state’s economy, creating 55,167 jobs. New York, where 126,782 international students spent US$5.8 billion, which supported 50,430 jobs, was in second place. Texas was third on the list, with 80,757 international students spending US$2.2 billion that supported 21,568 jobs. Smaller states also benefitted. Rhode Island (population 1 million), for example, hosted 4,786 international students who spent US$257.6 million that supported 2,256 jobs, while the figures for Alabama (population 5 million) were US$305 million being spent by 9,022 international students and 2,259 jobs being supported. In Nebraska (population 1.9 million), in the central part of the country, 812 jobs were supported by the US$112 million spent by 4,057 international students. The ISEVT divides states according to their congressional districts, providing education policy planners with granular data that in some cases is almost at the neighbourhood level. For example, New York’s District 13, which covers the neighbourhood of Morningside Heights, had 24,178 international students who contributed US$1.1 billion that supported 10,305 jobs. ISEVT’s full economic report on this district shows that Columbia University’s international students contributed US$877 million that supported 8,986 jobs while international students at the Manhattan School of Music supported 132 jobs via spending US$29 million. Community colleges The ISEVT also supplies information on America’s community (junior colleges), which, in addition to providing education in technical fields like welding, respiratory therapy and car repair, have since the mid-2010s provided a pathway to four-year BA granting institutions via articulation agreements that ensure that most, if not all, credits earned in the two-year institutions are accepted by four-year state colleges and universities. In total, community colleges enrol more than 52,000 international students, who contributed US$1.5 billion to the country's economy and supported 6,602 jobs. California, Texas and New York, which are also among the top five states that benefited from overall spending by international students, saw injections of US$449 million, US$227 million and US$77 million, respectively, by students enrolled in their junior colleges; together these three states have 196 community colleges. Also among the top five states that benefited from spending by international students in community colleges are Washington and Florida. Respectively, these states received US$132 million and US$129 million, which created spending that created 1,127 jobs in these states. Student expenditure The ISEVT also provides NAFSA and its partners with detailed information about the impact of international student expenditures in all of the 50 US states. For example, in 2022 the 43,495 international students in Pennsylvania contributed US$2 billion to the state’s economy and supported almost 22,000 jobs: 60% were in education (that is, jobs in their colleges and universities), 16% in accommodation, 10% in dining, 8% in retail and about 2% in health insurance, telecom and the transportation sectors. Pennsylvanian’s figures are close to the national average. By contrast, in Nevada, which hosts just over 2,000 international students who contribute US$61 million that supported 522 jobs, the sectoral breakdown is significantly different: 48% of the jobs are in education while 21% are in accommodation, 13% in dining, 10% in retail and about 3% in the health insurance, telecom and transpiration sectors. North Dakota, too, differs from the national average. Its 2,102 international students contributed US$44 million to the state’s economy, generating 284 jobs, only 45% of which were in education, while 22% were in accommodation, 14% in dining, 11% in retail and 3% in each of the other four sectors. English language programmes More than 10,225 international students were studying in English Language Programs (ELP; that is, English as a second language programmes). Together, they contributed US$370 million to the American economy and supported more than 3,100 jobs. The states with the largest number of international students studying English were Texas (1,533), California (1,336) and Florida (1,023), which, respectively, have benefitted by US$49.3 million, US$64 million and US$29.7 million. Together, these states have 1,290 jobs that were supported by the contribution international students made to the states’ economies. ISEVT’s data reveals a curious fact. States such as Kentucky, Tennessee, North and South Carolina, as well as Missouri, Georgia and Arizona, all of which have enshrined English as their official language (there is no federally mandated official language), benefit from tens of millions of dollars from international students who are studying in ELPs. International students spent US$2.8 million in Kentucky, US$2.9 million in Tennessee, US$3.9 million in North Carolina, US$1.5 million in South Carolina and US$3.7 million in Missouri, US$7.7 million in Georgia, and US$15 million in Arizona.

    "title": "Outlook for Euro Area Economy and Financial Stability: Decreased Inflation and Deteriorating Growth Highlighted by ECB Vice-President",

    "originBody": "SPEECH Outlook for the euro area economy and financial stability Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 26th Frankfurt Euro Finance Week Frankfurt, 13 November 2023 It is a pleasure to take part in this year’s edition of the Frankfurt Euro Finance Week. I will begin by providing an overview of the euro area economic outlook that underpinned the Governing Council’s deliberations and the monetary policy decisions we took in October. I will then discuss how we see the risks to financial stability and related macroprudential policy issues. Euro area economic outlook When I spoke at this event last year, inflation was at historically high levels, both in the euro area and around the world, and growth was slowing following the post-pandemic rebound. Today, inflation is significantly lower, but it is still expected to stay too high for too long. At the same time, the growth outlook for the euro area economy has deteriorated further, as global growth momentum slows and tighter financing conditions are increasingly weighing on investment and consumer spending. In the third quarter of this year real GDP declined by 0.1% quarter on quarter. There are signs that manufacturing output remains firmly in contractionary territory, while the services sector has weakened further. Weaker industrial activity is spilling over to services, the impetus from reopening effects is fading and the impact of higher interest rates is broadening. It is likely that the euro area economy will remain subdued in the near term. However, it looks set to strengthen again over the medium term, as inflation falls further, household real incomes recover and the demand for euro area exports picks up. Inflation, which has been on a downward trajectory over the last 12 months, dropped markedly in both September and October. It now stands at 2.9%, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate. The decline, which was in part due to strong base effects, was broad-based, reflecting a drop in energy prices and falling food, goods and services inflation. We expect a temporary rebound in inflation in the coming months as the base effects from the sharp increase in energy and food prices in autumn 2022 drop out of the year on year calculation. But we see the general disinflationary process continuing over the medium term. Energy prices remain a major source of uncertainty amid heightened geopolitical tensions and the impact of fiscal measures. The same is true for food prices, which may also come under upward pressure owing to adverse weather events and the unfolding climate crisis more broadly. Most measures of underlying inflation continue to decline. The Eurostat’s flash estimate for inflation excluding energy and food points to a further decline to 4.2 % in October, supported by improving supply conditions, the pass-through of previous declines in energy prices, as well as the impact of tighter monetary policy on demand and corporate pricing power. At the same time, domestic price pressures are still strong and are being increasingly driven by wage pressures and the evolution of profit margins. While most measures of longer-term inflation expectations stand around 2 %, some indicators remain elevated and need to be monitored closely. The resilience of the labour market has been a bright spot for the euro area economy, but there are signs that the labour market is beginning to weaken. Fewer new jobs are being created and, according to the latest flash estimate, employment expectations have continued to decline in October for both services and manufacturing. Monetary policy Based on our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission, the Governing Council decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged at its October meeting. The incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Our past interest rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully into financial and monetary conditions. Banks’ funding costs have continued to rise and are being passed on to businesses and households. The combination of higher borrowing rates and weakening activity led to a further sharp drop in credit demand in the third quarter of this year. And credit standards have tightened again. We are also seeing increasing signs of the impact of our policy decisions on the real economy. Further tightening is still in the pipeline from the current policy stance, and it is set to further dampen demand and help push down inflation. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% medium-term target in a timely manner. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. Financial stability Let me now turn to financial stability. In our upcoming Financial Stability Review, we highlight that the financial stability outlook remains fragile as the gradual effects of tighter financial conditions on both the financial and non-financial sectors take hold. These concerns are heightened by the recent upward shift in bond yields owing to the global “higher-for-longer” narrative and the flare-up of tensions in the Middle East, which have added to the uncertainty surrounding the outlook. After a period of lower market volatility until August, the rising prospect of higher-for-longer rates has started to weigh on riskier asset valuations in recent months. Risk sentiment in markets remains highly sensitive to further surprises in inflation and economic growth. Higher than expected inflation or lower growth could trigger a rise in market volatility and risk premia, increasing the likelihood of credit events materialising. This brings me to the vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector. As regards credit risk, some non-banks remain heavily exposed to interest rate-sensitive sectors, such as highly indebted corporates and real estate. Deteriorating corporate fundamentals and the ongoing correction in real estate markets could expose non-banks that have invested in these sectors to revaluation losses and investor outflows. Furthermore, low levels of liquidity could expose investment funds to the potential risk of forced asset sales if macro-financial outcomes deteriorate. Corporate profitability in the euro area has held up well, but higher interest rates are weighing on the debt servicing capacity of more vulnerable firms. A weakening economy could prove challenging for firms with high debt levels, subdued earnings and low interest coverage ratios. Real estate firms are particularly vulnerable to losses stemming from the ongoing downturn in euro area commercial real estate markets. In an environment of tighter financing conditions and elevated uncertainty, real estate prices have declined markedly. The effects of higher interest rates have been compounded by structurally lower demand for some real estate assets following the pandemic. Although banks’ exposure to these markets is comparatively low, losses in this segment could act as an amplifying factor in the event of a wider shock. Euro area households, especially those with lower incomes and in countries with mainly floating-rate mortgages, are being increasingly squeezed by the higher interest rates. Tighter financing conditions have reduced the demand for housing, putting downward pressure on prices. On a more positive note, robust labour markets have so far supported household balance sheets, thereby mitigating the credit risk to banks. Spreads in government bond markets have remained contained as many governments managed to secure cheap financing at longer maturities during the period of low interest rates. However, higher funding costs and less prudent fiscal policies could reignite concerns around sovereign debt sustainability, particularly in countries where debt levels are already high. The euro area banking system has been a source of resilience in this turbulent year. Banks’ capital and liquidity buffers remain strong, and profitability has further improved in recent quarters on the back of higher interest rates. Despite these strong fundamentals, it is striking just how compressed bank valuations remain. This seems to reflect lingering concerns about the long-term sustainability of bank earnings, as they face increased downside risks from the prospect of deteriorating asset quality, lower lending volumes and higher funding costs. While asset quality indicators have been robust over the last year, early signs of deterioration are becoming visible – particularly in smaller firms and some sectors like commercial real estate. Conclusion Since the start of our hiking cycle, we have increased our policy rates by a cumulative 450 basis points. Our restrictive policy stance continues to be transmitted forcefully into financing conditions and is increasingly affecting the real economy. Inflation has come down markedly but is still expected to stay too high for too long, and domestic price pressures remain strong. We will therefore ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. In view of the prevailing elevated uncertainty, our future decisions on policy rates will continue to be data dependent and taken on a meeting-by-meeting basis. At our December meeting, we will have a new set of macroeconomic projections and more data on actual and underlying inflation, economic activity and the state of transmission, so we will be in a better position to reassess the inflation outlook and required policy action. A resilient and well-functioning financial system is essential for the smooth transmission of monetary policy that is required to achieve our goal. To this end, macroprudential authorities should preserve releasable capital buffers to ensure that they are available in the event that conditions in the banking sector deteriorate. Furthermore, the lessons learnt from the turmoil this spring underline the need to implement outstanding Basel III reforms and complete the banking union, while previous market shocks confirm the need to boost the resilience of the non-bank financial sector by strengthening the policy framework for non-banks in an internationally coordinated manner. Prudent and investment-oriented fiscal policies are also very supportive of our price stability goal. Fiscal policy should be geared towards making the euro area economy more productive and gradually bringing down high public debt. Structural reforms to enhance the euro area’s supply capacity can help reduce price pressures in the medium term. It is therefore vital that the reform of the EU’s economic governance framework is concluded, in order to anchor expectations and support fiscal discipline.

The government set a fiscal deficit target of 2.85 trillion Sri Lankan rupees ($8.73 billion) in 2024, or 9.1% of GDP, higher than the revised 8.5% of GDP in the current year.

The cabinet had already approved raising Value Added Tax (VAT) by 3% from Jan. 1 and broadening collection. The government has projected a primary account deficit of 0.6% of GDP, slightly smaller than 0.7% in 2023, with the IMF requiring the nation to reach a primary surplus of 2.3% by 2025 and reduce its debt to GDP to 95% by 2032. The debt to GDP ratio stood at 113.8% as of end-December.

    "originBody": "Media Published November 13, 2023 6:00am EST Boating industry's 'Super Bowl' brings in billions for Florida economy Economic impact from 2023 Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show could near $2 billion, city says Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Kristen Altus FOXBusiness close video Fort Lauderdale boat show is Florida’s ‘Super Bowl’: Mayor Dean Trantalis Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis speaks to FOX News Digital about the economic impact of the city’s annual international boat show. For the \"Venice of America,\" its annual boat show – the largest in-water boating event in the world – is like the city’s own Super Bowl. \"This boat show more than doubles the economic impact than the Super Bowl. People think the Super Bowl is this mega-economic attraction, and indeed it is, but the boat show far surpasses that sometimes twice, two-and-a-half times,\" Fort Lauderdale Mayor Dean Trantalis told FOX News Digital. \"And it's a fun thing that everybody can participate in.\" Over the course of five sunny days each fall, the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show attracts more than 100,000 ticket holders and represents the full spectrum of the boating industry, from smaller sporting vessels to mega yachts. While the inaugural event in 1959 was a more modest affair featuring just 13 boats, today, the city says the event generates over $1.8 billion for the economy, raking in more than $800 million in boat sales. REAL ESTATE POWERHOUSE REJUVENATES DOWNTOWN MIAMI WITH $1.1 BILLION INVESTMENT \"Many thousands of jobs have been created not just for the show, but year-round. So it's a very robust industry, very vital to our community. And what better place to showcase the marine industry than this paradise that we call Fort Lauderdale?\" Trantalis said. Fort Lauderdale is home to the worlds largest in-water boat show. This year marked the events 64th anniversary. (Getty Images) \"This is the mecca for boating,\" he continued. \"The marine industry capital is right here in Fort Lauderdale. From anywhere in the world, you talk about Fort Lauderdale, people know what it means to be connected to the marine industry. So we're very proud of that tradition. We continue to expand on it. We're building more and more dock space around the city for mid-sized boats, super yachts, because we want to make sure that we have sustainability when it comes to the marine industry.\" Though data from the 2023 event is actively being calculated, the president and CEO of Fort Lauderdale’s Downtown Development Authority (DDA) Jenni Morejon also told Digital there’s likely a $2 billion impact from this year’s boat show. \"Half of almost all boat show visitors are from outside of Florida,\" Morejon said. \"Downtown has about a $35 billion economic impact annually. So when we get to see the 'Super Bowl' come in every weekend and then you layer on the boat show, it just really starts to kind of exponentially add economic value to the community.\" Image 1 of 4 Visitors walk among the boats that are on display at the 64th Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show on October 25, 2023 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Getty Images In the year following the COVID pandemic, attendance demand boomed for the event, with the mayor noting one particular company sold over 200 boats this year. \"It was explosive in growth. They couldn't keep enough boats on hand to be able to sell. Orders two and three years in advance were taken,\" Trantalis said. \"So it's a very, very aggressive industry. It's a very robust economy that it's creating.\" \"There's about 400 boats that traverse downtown's New River on a daily basis. So, it's pretty amazing,\" Morejon added. \"It's a working river because you have all the boatyards further up. But from a leisure perspective, too, when you have that number and volume of boats that are going up and down the intracoastal and through downtown, it really shows that this is truly a boating community.\" Some boat show attendees come searching for ultra-luxury vessels, like one mega yacht this year with a helicopter pad on it. But according to the mayor and DDA CEO, the event has boosted small business and helped lower unemployment. MESSI MANIA HITS SOUTH FLORIDA: FORT LAUDERDALE MAYOR APPLAUDS STAR'S ECONOMIC IMPACT \"The wonderful thing about the boat show is that so many different businesses were able to participate, not just those associated with the marine industry, but also hotels, restaurants, entertainment venues,\" Trantalis explained. \"Yes, inflation has definitely come to Florida. But you know what? It hasn't been as impactful as many people say in the national news. We do have higher prices for a number of things, but a lot of that has to do with supply chain issues as opposed to the cost of production.\" \"We have 2.4% unemployment here in the region. So people are working, people are engaged in their careers. And we're seeing more and more young people coming to Fort Lauderdale,\" the mayor added. \"Our population increased by 10% over the last 18 months, and it's mostly young people. They see the opportunity here. They see the future here.\" Morejon pointed out that about 1,500 hotel rooms in the Downtown Fort Lauderdale area have been added in the last five to seven years. close video First-time boaters fueling demand FOX Business' Jeff Flock speaks with Sailtime member John Palmer on the boating boom. \"A lot of the hotel managers that we speak with, they tell us because of those connections through the water taxi and the easy access to the beach and even some of the venues downtown hosting parties for the yacht brokers and so forth, it really has had an impact on the street level in terms of [food and beverage] and retail,\" Morejon said. Echoing Trantalis’ notion of \"salty jobs,\" the DDA head expanded on how the event and overarching marine industry supports white and mixed-collar workers. \"That's kind of what the marine industry coins their program to really get not just youth, but underemployed and maybe folks from a socioeconomic strata that don't typically or will ever maybe have an opportunity to participate in that level of the boat show from a consumer level, but they can learn and have wonderful opportunities financially and professionally,\" Morejon noted. \"It's this very robust ecosystem that isn't just tied to the yacht broker and the purchaser and the fabricator of that vessel, but all of those wraparound job opportunities that this community, more so than anywhere else, can really have such a dynamic mix of jobs that help raise our community up.\" close video COVID not taking the wind out of surging US boat sales Ashley Webster at the Palm Beach International Boat Show Next year’s event will mark a milestone with the 65th anniversary of the international boat show. Looking ahead to the future, the city has noticed a growing interest in more efficient and climate-friendly vessels. \"A focus on sustainability, on environmental issues, on technology, trying to improve how we relate to our natural resources, trying to minimize pollution and see how we can eradicate the damage that the industry may have caused in the past,\" Trantalis pointed out. Fort Lauderdale’s coastal, beach brand and the boat show go hand-in-hand, Morejon reflected.

And we'd like to see the expansion of the product, the marine industries, the jobs it offers, the impact it has on all the communities that are associated with the local economy.\" READ MORE FROM FOX BUSINESS U.S. Stock Market Quotes Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement",

    "title": "Unpacking the Paradox: Joe Biden's Economy Thrives Amidst Perceived Struggles, But Why Does He Not Receive Credit?",
    "originLink": "https://www.salon.com/2023/11/13/joe-bidens-economy-is-honestly-pretty-amazing-how-come-he-doesnt-get-credit/",
    "originBody": "If the economy is so bad, why are shops and restaurants so packed? I understand that anecdotal evidence is hardly worth mentioning, but it does make you wonder if people are as concerned about the prices of goods and services as polling data says they are. As you stand in line at that restaurant or circle the mall parking lot looking for a space, do you wonder about the disparity between what people apparently tell pollsters about the economy and what you can see with your own two eyes? My wife and I are pretty conservative, at least in terms of economic consumption. When we splurge on a meal out, we tend to share a main dish and a salad. That’s both financial and dietary economy; we simply cannot finish the huge portions many restaurants typically serve. Part of that is a consequence of getting older, but it might also be that we can’t eat that much because somewhere along the line we made a conscious practice of not eating that much. I suspect that was connected with raising our daughters and paying for college. Advertisement: But when we eat at restaurants now, we notice what appears to be freewheeling spending all around us — trays of upscale cocktails and appetizers, pricey entrées and desserts. When we travel to see our grandchildren, the story is the same: Whether we’re in Nashville, Knoxville, Charlotte or Lexington, the restaurants are full. People seem to be spending money like there’s no tomorrow (and maybe there’s something to that). Related America is awash in good news — but does that equal a bad election for Joe Biden? It's easy to question the economic woes of someone who drives a $50,000 pickup, or complain about the guy in our town who drives around in an absurdly tricked-out golf cart flying a full-sized American flag. It’s entirely possible those individuals are Trump supporters who believe — or claim to believe — that Joe Biden is doing a terrible job with the economy, in the face of nearly all available evidence. Some of those dressed-down folks packed into the restaurants may feel the same way, despite the splurge-spending. Advertisement: Biden’s bad economy? What does that even mean? Never mind the lowest unemployment numbers in decades and the other telling economic data points: Just look around. Even the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal acknowledges how strong the economy has been under this president: Not only has economic output made up all the ground lost during the pandemic but it is above where it would have been had the pandemic never happened, judging by what the Congressional Budget Office projected in early 2020. So what gives? Why do so many people tell pollsters that they think Trump and the Republicans would do a better job with the economy when that has literally never been true in my lifetime? (When Republicans claim they’re great with the economy, there must be a “worthless statement clause” buried in the fine print.) Why do so many people tell pollsters that they think Trump and the Republicans would do a better job with the economy when that has literally never been true in my lifetime? Advertisement: Polling makes clear that Trump’s “working-class” supporters are not with him primarily over economic concerns. They must secretly suspect by now that he has no clue about managing the economy (and is a terrible businessman). They back Trump for his simplistic and often incoherent answers to complex issues. They love him for the hatred of others he promotes and the “anti-civic purpose” he gives them license to feel. Floating nonsensical or self-canceling conspiracy theories and “owning the libs” are easier (and a lot more fun) than actually trying to formulate policies to help move us forward as a nation in this fraught world. The old political button that read “Vote Republican: It’s Easier Than Thinking” isn’t even sarcastic in the age of voter suppression, book banning, Christian nationalism, and self-serving fake history. As New Yorker satirist Andy Borowitz said in a recent Salon interview, that put-down by Democrats has long been embraced as a winning tactic by the GOP: I'm a little bit hesitant to say that the Democrats are the party of smart people and the Republicans are the party of ignorant people. But I think the Republicans caught on a little bit sooner to the fact that this whole projection of anti-intellectualism was a vote-winner, and they really made it their brand. Advertisement: Americans like simple. They want a snappy slogan, not a complex and nuanced story without obvious villains. Democrats, for their own reasons, still haven’t wrapped their heads around that. MAGA voters tend to be more well-heeled (and not in the Ron DeSantis sense) than working-class Americans in general. They often pretend to be down-home guys and gals, but consider how many of the Jan. 6 rioters flew into Washington and stayed in nice hotels before they stormed the Capitol. We could assemble a considerable list of supposed good ol’ boys in Congress who attended Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford, where they presumably battled the liberal elites. We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support commentary and analysis you won't read anywhere else One inconvenient truth is that the ethos of a consumer society teaches us that enough is never enough. Our especially rapacious form of capitalism tries to fuel and amplify our desires and enable as many thoughtless purchases as possible. My wife and I recently traveled to the city where I grew up, for the funeral of my best childhood friend. I could barely recognize the place, or navigate through the endless rows of restaurants, strip malls and big-box stores sulking shoulder to shoulder along all the main streets. Of course, the city we live in now looks much the same. Advertisement: In many other affluent democratic countries — the ones where happiness is considered to be highest — people actively think about what they are consuming and why. But it isn’t surprising that citizens of countries with better government services and robust social safety nets have the mental and emotional space to do that. The Republican economic message to Americans remains steadfast: Every man for himself (It’s every woman for herself too, but for much of the GOP, women are still secondary and highly troublesome considerations, mostly meant to be controlled and manipulated). The Ayn Rand winner-take-all ethos and the thoroughly disproved trickle-down theory, which holds that helping those who need no help will somehow lift everyone up, continue to be trotted out in debased, zombified form. It’s unclear whether anyone still believes these deeply wrong and simplistic ideas, but plenty of people still embrace the myth that one day they might just get to join the billionaires’ club. It’s unclear whether anyone still believes the Republicans' ludicrous economic theories, but plenty of people still embrace the myth that one day they might get to join the billionaires’ club. Advertisement: Republicans tell people what they long to hear, while Democrats are forever hamstrung by trying to tell people what they need to hear in order to function as responsible citizens in a democracy. But busy, overworked, stressed-out people don’t want complexity, and most people have no abiding interest in politics. But they do crave neatly packaged explanations that blame their own problems, and the world’s, on somebody else. So while Republican voters keep on complaining about the Biden economy, they also keep on consuming like mad. They don’t like the higher prices of the last few years, which is understandable enough, and it doesn’t matter to them that all industrialized countries saw similar rates of inflation during the post-pandemic recovery, or that the inflation rate in the U.S has come down faster than in most other countries. Any economist or political scientist will tell you that presidents don’t usually have much effect on the economy, but in fact Biden’s policies, especially on infrastructure spending and revitalized manufacturing, are making a difference. “Build Back Better” wasn’t a big hit as a slogan, but it was a reasonable strategy that has led to better economic times. Advertisement: Another way to consider the packed shops, planes and restaurants of this moment is to reflect that we were bottled up for too long by the various strains of COVID-19 and that the apocalyptic thinking spread by our former president and his political party has affected too many of us. The worsening crisis of climate change hangs over us all, whether or not we want to think about it. We have one more or less functional political party, while the other one, a bizarre cult led by men super worried about their masculinity, talks endlessly about societal collapse and civil war. As Michael Stipe sang way back when: “It’s the end of the world as we know it (and I feel fine).” We all want comfort in hard times, and we definitely all want to get out of the house and see our friends, even if we know we are just wishing the pandemic to be over. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. Many of the people thronging the bars and restaurants are millennials (and even Gen Z members) who feel trapped by student debt, working jobs that don’t pay them enough to let them plan for the future. They may have concluded that absent a big score, they’ll never be able to buy their own house or have kids. Advertisement: Our younger daughter belongs to that generation, and says that’s the situation for most of her friends and colleagues. When you feel your personal economic future is bleak, it makes sense to live your life in terms of short-term enjoyment. George Orwell wrote in his memoir “Down and Out in Paris and London” that the poor in England would spen money on small luxuries, like a pack of cigarettes or a decent cup of tea, because poverty “annihilates the future.” Not too many of the millennials in those restaurants live in actual poverty, but when they look around them, they sure must feel cheated out of the old-school American dream. Many of the younger people thronging bars and restaurants have probably concluded that absent a big score, they'll never be able to buy a house or have kids. All that said, the fact is that Joe Biden’s economy is historically strong. That doesn’t seem to matter. Too many people buy into the shameless rhetoric of MAGA candidates who tell them what they want to hear, and maybe what they’re thrilled to hear (especially about their freedom to behave badly against others), rather than mundane or complicated facts about how responsible governments and economies work. Advertisement: Our problem isn’t that democracy is failing us. We need more of it, not less — along with a return to the study of civics as part of our education. What’s failing us, and failing the world, are the dull-witted politicians we send to Congress and state houses who try to push their religious views on the entire country and embrace a ruthless, predatory, unthinking capitalism, that lowers nearly everyone’s standard of living but elevates a tiny minority to incalculable and unhealthy levels of wealth. Last week’s election results in Ohio, Virginia, Kentucky and elsewhere offered heartening evidence that many voters are resistant to deceptive campaigns, and proved how out of step with public opinion the current Republican Party and its captive Supreme Court really are. But while abortion rights are clearly a potent issue for voters (including a lot of independents and Republicans), Democrats need to make a better case about how much Joe Biden has accomplished for the economy in general and for working-class Americans in particular. Facing near-total opposition by Republicans in Congress (the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act got exactly zero GOP votes), Biden got the massive bipartisan infrastructure bill passed. His manufacturing plan invests in rural areas and will transform local economies. He’s the first president in many decades to stand with organized labor and support its fight for better wages and benefits. He continues to work on alleviating the crushing student debt that limits so many young adults’ lives. He has taken on Big Pharma, moving to lower prescription drug prices and health care costs for older Americans. He is working to stop the junk fees hidden in so many transactions. He rejoined the Paris climate accords and has done far more to address that crisis than any previous president. Advertisement: But what really needs to change is the predatory character of present-tense American capitalism, where profit too often comes from the suffering of others. That would allow our younger generations, and all of us, to lead better and happier lives. Biden has done his part, but he can’t fix that on his own. The Republicans don’t want to, and won’t even try.
