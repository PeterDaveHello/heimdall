    "originBody": "U.S. Markets US needs new way to measure and advance economic fairness, group says By Timothy Aeppel November 9, 202312:57 PM UTCUpdated 17 min ago A volunteer arranges the food to be given as donations at a food bank in Columbus, Ohio, U.S. December 6, 2021.REUTERS/Gaelen Morse/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights Nov 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. must change how it measures the well-being of its people - including gauging how much of a voice they feel they have in political outcomes - as part of a larger effort to reverse rising inequality across the economy. That's the assessment of a new report released on Thursday by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. It includes recommendations ranging from redesigning social programs with an aim of providing greater stability to those facing economic hardships to extending to Black World War Two veterans and their descendants the benefits they were denied under the G.I. Bill decades ago. Advertisement · Scroll to continue There is growing concern about a contradiction in the U.S. economy: jobs are plentiful and economic growth is strong, especially compared with other advanced economies, but surveys show many Americans are sour about the outlook. \"We're close to full employment by traditional measures,\" said Matthew Slaughter, a member of the commission that wrote the report and the dean of Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business. \"But a lot of American families in surveys say they don't think it's going that well.\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue Reuters Graphics Recent data underscores the problem. A report on consumer finances from the Federal Reserve last month found that American families on average saw large gains in income and wealth from 2019 to 2022, but the income gains were largest among the highest-earning families, and fastest among white families. New estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau also show the share of income going to the top 5% grew from 2019 to 2022, extending a trend dating from the 1980s. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Dissatisfaction with the status quo shows up in how Americans vote, said Nicholas Lemann, a co-chair of the commission and a professor at the Columbia Journalism School, noting there's now a competition between the two major political parties to be the \"party of the working class.\" This reflects a growing focus on inequality as wealthier Americans and certain regions of the country have appeared to snare the bulk of the benefits of strong economic growth in recent decades, he said. \"There's a view that the good stuff in America gets concentrated on the coasts,\" Lemann added. MEASURING WELL-BEING This is the first time the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which was founded in 1780 to advance research and civil dialogue, has tackled a broad analysis of the U.S. economy. Based in part on 31 \"listening sessions\" conducted with groups of working Americans, the commission developed a list of 15 recommendations on how to make the economy more equitable. Some are vague, such as \"deconcentrating economic power,\" but others target specific steps, such as expanding access to low-cost banking and broadband connectivity in underserved communities. A key part of the report is a new tool developed to measure the well-being of Americans, which combines 11 different measures. Among the categories are indicators of health, such as life expectancy and the percentage of people with health insurance, and economic security, including the percentage of households that spend less than 30% of total income on housing. Researchers around the world have long sought to find better ways to gauge the well-being of people that look beyond measures such as economic growth or unemployment. One example is the Social Vulnerability Index, which uses Census data for every census tract to assess 14 social factors. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences' measure shows some broad trends that are well-known, such as pockets of poverty in the U.S. South and affluent clusters along the coasts. Reuters Graphics One unique part of the measure is an attempt to quantify the \"political voice\" of Americans. One component of this compares what people who responded to a government survey on what they would like to see happen on high-profile policy issues with how their representatives in Congress voted on those items when they arose during legislation. A high level of support for an issue and a \"yes\" vote by their representative yielded a high score. \"Even if the economy right now has low unemployment and relatively high growth, we know that people feel a huge amount of anxiety - and a lot of that is tied up with the sense that our society is changing, and our democracy isn't healthy,\" said Jacob Hacker, a political science professor at Yale University who spearheaded the development of the political voice score.

    "originBody": "Palestinian workers cross to Israel through the Nalin checkpoint near Ramallah in 2020. (Issam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Top Stories Palestinian Authority West Bank Gaza Strip economic crisis Israel-Hamas war Israel-Hamas War Casts a Shadow on the West Bank’s Economy Mohammad Al-Kassim 11/09/2023 The Palestinian Authority's economic outlook was bleak even before war began in the Gaza Strip, but with thousands of workers from the West Bank now blocked from entering Israel, the effects on the Palestinian economy could be \"devastating\" The Israeli military offensive in the Gaza Strip is now in its second month, and the Palestinian economy has severely weakened, with the continuing war casting a shadow on the future of the economy of the West Bank. The outlook for the Palestinian economy was already bleak before Israel declared war in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel. Hani Asa’ad, a 47-year-old taxi driver in Nablus, told The Media Line that his income has drastically dropped since the outbreak of war. Even before the war in Gaza erupted, the economic situation in the West Bank was “awful,” Asa’ad said. “We have been going through bad economic times for some time, but this war will surely add to our misery,” he said. Asa’ad, a father of five, said that continued closures and limits on freedom of movement imposed by Israel, with hundreds of military checkpoints dotting the West Bank and making travel difficult, had reduced his income and forced him to look for a second job. “I used to make about $40 a day, but with fewer and fewer people going out because of the security situation, and because many of them have lost their income, they are trying to save whatever they can, and one way is walking to where they need to go, rather than take a taxi,” Asa’ad said. “Add that to the increase in fuel prices and car repair costs, and my income from driving isn’t enough, so I picked up a second job delivering packages.” Hamza Odeh, a construction worker from Qalqilya, told The Media Line he had worked in Israel for 15 years, earning almost three times the income he would have had working in the West Bank. Odeh said that with more than two decades of experience in construction, he earned nearly $3,000 a month, an income many dream of in the Palestinian territories. “I built a nice home and bought a car for my wife, all due to my income. I did all that with a bank loan based on my income,” he said. I’m not sure if and when I will be returning to work, but until then we have to be careful with our money and watch what we spend However, like thousands of other Palestinians with permits to work in Israel, Odeh has been stuck at home since Oct. 7. When the war began, Israel closed all checkpoints with the West Bank, blocking the entry of Palestinian workers. “I’m not sure if and when I will be returning to work, but until then we have to be careful with our money and watch what we spend,” Odeh said. Until then, Odeh’s eldest son, Mohammad, has picked up work at a car garage in his home town to try to ease the burden on his father. “I can manage my university load with my work. I have no other choice, I’m the eldest and it’s my responsibility to pitch in and help,” Mohammad said. If prolonged, the closure may result in losses in the billions of dollars and spell disaster for an already ailing economy.

The Palestinian Monetary Authority estimates that Palestinian workers in Israel inject about $5.5 billion into the PA economy annually, equivalent to about 35% of its GDP. The economic activity of the West Bank depends heavily on the labor sector working in Israel. The General Federation of Palestinian Trade Unions estimates the number of such workers at more than 190,000, and Israel’s dismissal of them causes a monthly loss estimated at $390 million. The PA public employee sector, which numbers 140,000, also contributes to the economy in a significant way, but for two years public employees have been receiving only 80% of their salaries due to the financial hardship in the Palestinian Authority. These salaries were estimated at $3.7 billion in 2022. On Oct. 25, the Palestinian Monetary Authority issued a series of instructions to local banks in an effort to ease the financial consequences of the conflict, including postponing repayments of loans by Palestinian borrowers in Gaza until the end of January. There are real risks to the Palestinian economy, especially in the West Bank, because of the war, Ramallah-based economic analyst Dr. Thabit Abo Al Ros told The Media Line. He said that the most prominent is the general deterioration of the economic situation and the consequent fear of investing or spending in it. Dwindling foreign aid, coupled with the Israeli closure, “will have devastating effects on the Palestinian economy,” Abo Al Ros said. The unemployment rate exceeds 24% in the Palestinian Authority and poverty has risen above 29%, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. Nasr Abdul Karim, a professor of economics at Birzeit University, said he saw “limited and narrow options in the face of the magnitude of the damage and repercussions, and I have an already lame authority.” Abdul Karim said that individual options remain broader, with some people having savings and most having other sources of income and returning to working on the land and home economic projects, as well as solidarity and social support, “but the danger remains that these options will quickly be exhausted.” A prolonged conflict would lead to the collapse of an already fragile Palestinian economy He said that he does not expect the PA government to provide anything, as it does not pay full salaries to its employees, and it also depends largely on funds transferred from Israel, but from which Israel has deducted a portion for years, and from which it recently threatened to deduct Gaza’s share, a threat that angered the PA. “A prolonged conflict would lead to the collapse of an already fragile Palestinian economy,” said Abdul Karim. As part of the Oslo Accords, Israel collects taxes on imports for the Palestinian Authority and taxes on Palestinians working in Israel. Under the 1994 Protocol on Economic Relations, also called the Paris Protocol and incorporated with minor changes into the 1995 Oslo II Accord, Israel retains 25% of income taxes and 3% of total revenue as collection and processing fees, and is supposed to transfer the bulk of the money to the PA once every few months. However, a 2018 law mandates that the Israeli government will deduct an amount equal to the PA’s payments to prisoners or their families who have attacked Israelis, so as to pressure the PA into stopping such payments, which Israel says encourage more violent attacks.",

    "originBody": "FORBESSMALL BUSINESS The Role Of Technology And The Gig Economy In Contact Center Evolution Tyler Ashby Forbes Councils Member Forbes Business Council COUNCIL POST| Membership (Fee-Based) Click to save this article. You'll be asked to sign into your Forbes account. Nov 9, 2023,07:45am EST Tyler is COO of Agents Only, a GigCX platform disrupting the contact center industry. GETTY It was over 10 years ago when Marc Andreessen announced, \"Software is eating the world.\" His prescient words have proven accurate as software services continue to transform sectors from retail to transportation. But the contact center landscape, bound by old-school practices and heavy labor expenses, has historically lagged behind. Now, however, spurred by the pandemic's demand for remote work and amplified by rapid advancements in AI, I believe we are witnessing an industry at the center of digital transformation. Yet, those within the industry or utilizing this service should note that even as technology surges, it's the irreplaceable human aspect that is required to support and augment digital solutions. From Bricks To Clicks: The Digital Transformation Of Contact Centers Contact centers were once characterized by vast floors of agents anchored to their desks in brick-and-mortar setups, limiting flexibility and scalability. Alternative solutions, such as business process outsourcing (BPOs) or staffing agencies, offered additional flexibility but at the cost of direct control. The adoption of contact center as a service (CCaaS) changed the functionality and application of this sector. This cloud-based solution, along with human augmentation, allows businesses to deploy contact center functions with minimal infrastructure, ensuring agents can operate seamlessly from any location.

Extending into interactive voice response (IVR) solutions, these technologies not only offer customers instant resolutions but also help forecast customer needs. But while these advances provide a strong digital foundation to deliver the most value to the customer, the human element is still needed. Pure digital adoption isn't foolproof. Technical hiccups, implementation delays or unforeseen challenges can arise. Looking back to past digital transformations, the adoption of AI will likely contain similar advancements and setbacks. This underscores the need for a blended approach, using humans to fix where technology falters. Spotlight On Growth: CAG-Driven Insights For The Customer Interactions Market As industries converge over customer interactions, data provides insights into the transformational forces at play. As summarized from 2023 Gartner Inc. research on disruption in customer management business process outsourcing, with a market size of $453 billion, the customer interactions market is on track for 11.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) with a significant tilt toward technology and digitization. Conversational AI is surging with a staggering 72.2% CAG as companies invest in customer and agent-facing solutions. Similarly, CCaaS, software, and services project at 17.9% CAG, emphasizing an undeniable shift towards digital solutions that enhance customer interaction management. While still growing, the BPO sector shows the lowest CAG at 5.8%, as technology solutions compete at lower costs without giving up control of customer interactions. With increasing technological investments, I think it's time to redefine the total solution to include a layer of gig workers. As firms ramp up their adoption of data and CRM technologies, merging these tech advancements with innovative employment models becomes the next logical step. The end goal? To ensure businesses remain agile, customer-centric and adaptable with a balance between human touch and technology. The Gig Economy: Key Ally For The Digital Revolution On-demand and cloud-based digital services like CCaaS and AI analytics are surrounding the industry, priming it for disruption. On top of this, the gig economy, supercharged by these software advancements, is swooping in and redefining talent acquisition. I believe that this combination of a skilled workforce and advances in technology can allow companies to provide world-class outcomes without the layers of management designed for command and control brick-and-mortar operations. While some providers have offered independent contractors as a labor solution for 20-plus years, the software is where the term gig truly comes alive. Looking at older service models, they reflect more temp agency than Uber. GigCX platforms, built with the abilities of AI, offer more revolutionary solutions for companies, no longer constraining them by geography and allowing access to global talent pools that require neither a BPO intermediary nor a foreign entity. The gig economy in the contact center space should look to be powered by a combination of data and self-managed behavior loops, including schedule management. By combining analytical AI and data-rich CCaaS interactions, you can make sure agents are incentivized per transaction; this transactional pricing brings to life the full scalability of gig that can be added to augment any operation. Taking Advantage Of The Intersection I find that GigCX is both enabled and an enabler of the necessary digital transformation journey devouring the contact center industry. The reduction in human labor spend can help finance this digital transformation, while the flexibility and expertise that gig workers offer can provide a safety net from digital failures and seasonality. To best take advantage of the confluence of gig workers and digital transformation, I think companies must first prioritize cloud-based tools and then look to target areas of self-service or digital automation. Make sure the areas of digital transformation support a flexible labor force to help maximize self-serve and automation benefits without abandoning your customers who prefer humans or fail out of digital flows. Additional benefits can be unlocked if you arm your gig workforce with the ability to access the information gathered by self-service flows and chatbots, allowing human interaction to enhance and build off your digital journey instead of starting over. Vision 2030: The Software-Powered, Globalized Contact Center Picture a world where technology—particularly AI and real-time analytics—not only complements but amplifies the capabilities of a diverse, worldwide workforce. I believe this type of navigation through digital transformation is key for any contact center to thrive in the future. As organizations look to unleash their full digital potential by owning their customers end to end, the gig workforce can bridge the gaps with global talent already skilled at utilizing digital interfaces. Software continues to devour various sectors, with the contact center industry emerging as its latest feast. I believe that when done right, a flexible and knowledgeable gig workforce can help be a core part of a software-powered and globalized contact center.

Cafruny said the chapters in this volume “explore historical and theoretical approaches to sanctions, now affecting directly 54 countries and 29% of global GDP. Mostly enacted by the United States, the sanctions are often illegal under international law, and harmful not only to developing countries but also increasingly to Europe.” His contribution appears in a section of the book on “Third Parties: The Impact of Secondary Sanctions.” In “The U.S. Sanctions Offensive: Implications for ‘Third Parties’ and the Transatlantic Relationship,” he shows that “proliferation of U.S. extraterritorial or secondary sanctions illustrates vividly the formidable structural economic power of the United States based on dollar supremacy and the size and significance of the U.S. consumer market.” “U.S. sanctions and other forms of coercive economic statecraft directed against Russia, Iran, and China are imposing increasingly significant collateral damage on Europe while benefiting U.S. corporations,” Cafruny notes.",

Both parties are laser-focused on voters’ sour economic mood, but it’s anyone’s guess how today’s pessimism might play a year from now. American consumers — who drive two-thirds of economic activity — are still spending vigorously despite voicing downbeat sentiments.Eva Marie Uzcategui / Bloomberg via Getty Images file Print Save Create your free profile or log in to save this article Nov. 8, 2023, 11:54 PM UTC By Christine Romans By just about any measure, the mighty American economy is chugging along nicely. The much-forecast recession of 2023 simply never happened. Instead, the jobless rate has remained below 4% for two years, wages are finally rising faster than inflation, and the economy revved up in the third quarter to post a nearly 5% growth. Bipartisan investments in infrastructure and computer chip manufacturing are just starting to bear fruit, fueling more economic tailwinds in the months ahead. In fact, in a note to clients Wednesday, Goldman Sachs declared “the hard part is over” for efforts to shore up the global economy, predicting that inflation would continue to ease in 2024. The bank’s researchers now expect a mere 15% risk that the United States will tip into a recession next year, following a spate of forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, voicing growing economic optimism. But many Americans don’t share that view, and the Republican presidential candidates taking the stage in Miami for Wednesday night’s debate, hosted by NBC News, will be looking for opportunities to reinforce their outlook. In a new Bankrate survey, half of Americans reported that their overall financial situation is worse now compared with Election Day 2020. And a New York Times/Siena College poll released this week found 81% of voters rating the economy either “fair” or “poor,” with just 19% calling it “good” or “excellent.” Yet despite the widespread pessimism, consumers — who drive two-thirds of economic activity — are still spending. “People may be feeling bad, but they are not spending badly,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist of the payroll processing firm ADP. “They are spending like they are optimistic, even though they are reporting that they are pessimistic.” What gives? The likely explanation is a gloomy soup of two major wars, ongoing domestic political divisions, a still-recent pandemic and price pressures that have slowed down dramatically but rarely reversed. “It’s one word: inflation,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. In his view, inflation’s lingering toll over the past year and a half more than makes up for the historic strength in the job market and other upsides to Americans’ wallets. “Inflation is coming down, but prices aren’t coming down, which is the source of the irritation” for many, Hamrick said. And of course, the country’s yawning economic inequality means that robust overall consumer spending figures can’t help but mask wide disparities in households’ finances. (“There’s no one, monolithic ‘consumer,’” Hamrick noted.) Inflation has eased from the painful 9.1% in the middle of last year to 3.7% in September. But while economists and Fed officials are cheered by that trend, ordinary Americans vividly recall a not-so-distant past when many things were cheaper. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk in November 2019 was $3.19. It surged to $4.20 in May 2022, before settling back to $3.97 this fall. “We’re in an economy where the price level has taken a big, gigantic step up,” said Richardson. Add in the highest interest rates in decades and borrowing money is more expensive, too — translating to steeper mortgage rates and credit card interest. A year out from the 2024 vote, it’s an open question how, or even whether, Americans’ economic malaise will play out either in the economy itself or at the ballot box. But both parties have been betting heavily that it will matter. President Joe Biden has been pounding the pavement to trumpet $5 billion in new investments to juice rural economies, hoping that voters will reward him and fellow Democrats for infrastructure projects ramping up across the country. Meanwhile, Republicans have raced to pin voters’ frustrations over high prices on “Bidenomics,” the term that the White House has used to try — with uncertain success — to brand the administration’s economic policies. Of course, presidents frequently get too much credit and too much blame for the state of the economy on their watches, and pollsters note that voters tend to blame a leader for a declining economy more than they will credit for a good one. But if Tuesday’s election results are any indication, there’s no guarantee that next year’s contest will hinge on the economy. In a number of races — albeit off-year ones that tend to draw a different mix of voters than those who turn out for presidential elections — other issues rose to the fore. Abortion access in particular has continued to propel Democrats to victories at the state and local level after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. In many cases, conservative voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, including for his handling of the economy, crossed party lines to back more expansive reproductive rights. If the past 12 months’ mistaken economic predictions have illustrated anything, it’s that a lot can change in a year, both in Americans’ financial lives and the ways they feel about them. Reflecting on the dissonance between many of the economy’s fundamentals and consumers’ sour outlook, Richardson was circumspect. “When that feeling starts translating into behavior,” she said, “I think that’s when we’re going to have to pay attention.” Christine Romans Christine Romans is a senior business correspondent at NBC News.",

    "originBody": "ADVERTISEMENT SKIP ADVERTISEMENT SUBSCRIBER-ONLY NEWSLETTER Peter Coy OPINION Why Voters Are So Down on the Biden Economy Nov. 8, 2023 Credit... Illustration by Sam Whitney/The New York Times Share full article 207 By Peter Coy Opinion Writer Economists, meet Sara. She is in her early 50s, white, an office manager who lives in South Carolina and a Republican who is unenthusiastic about Donald Trump. When she thinks about the direction of the country right now, what she’s most worried about is the economy. And whom does she blame for the economy? Politicians in Washington, D.C., collectively. They have lost sight of how we live and work as middle-class people. We can give free Narcan to whoever we want to in the parking lot of McDonald’s because they’re OD’ing, but we cannot get diabetic medication to those kids who did not choose to be diabetic. People are losing their jobs and can’t afford health care, and you’re going to legislate whether or not somebody can read a book? There is a lot to unpack in that angry paragraph, which came from a focus group, convened in September by Times Opinion, of 13 Republican voters who are looking at candidates other than Trump. (More of their responses here.) On diabetic medication, for example, there’s actually good news. The Inflation Reduction Act capped the cost of insulin for Medicare recipients at $35 a month. Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi have cut prices for patients of all ages. But the part I want to focus on is what Sara and other Americans who aren’t economists mean when they use terms like economy, inflation and unemployment. It’s often not what economists mean. And I think the differences in perspective go a long way toward explaining why President Biden receives such poor marks on the economy despite strong growth in the country’s gross domestic product, as well as low unemployment and falling inflation. Ask a macroeconomist how the economy is doing and you might get a number, such as 4.9, which is the percentage increase in G.D.P. between the second quarter and third quarter, formulated as an annual rate. Ask Sara and you hear about politicians, Narcan, diabetes medication and book banning. And Sara isn’t wrong! Bloodless as it is today, the word economy once had a moral valence. The ancient Greek word oikonomia means the management of a household, which was considered a deeply moral activity. “In ancient economic theory, an action is considered economically rational only when taken toward a praiseworthy end,” Dotan Leshem of the University of Haifa wrote in 2016 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. Or take inflation. To an economist, it’s a change in the general price level. If prices rise rapidly and then plateau for a few months, an economist will say monthly inflation is zero. To the general public, that’s still inflation, because prices are high. A shopper might not be happy until prices go all the way back to where they were — which to many economists seems like a scary thing to wish for, because deflation tends to go along with depressions. And unemployment? To an economist, it’s the familiar rate that the Bureau of Labor Statistics refers to as “U-3”: an objective measure consisting of the number of people who are out of work but actively searching divided by all those in the labor force. The U-3 was just 3.9 percent in October, which is lower than the rate Federal Reserve policymakers see as sustainable in the long run. Yet 57 percent of people in an ABC News/Washington Post poll in September said that the unemployment rate was not so good or poor. Pollsters have long observed that voters who are unhappy in general will tend to express unhappiness in every answer, and not attempt to make fine distinctions. “People will default to the most pessimistic view: Sure, I can find a job, but it doesn’t pay a damn thing,” Michael Murphy, a Republican strategist in the Never Trump camp, told me. Which brings us to a bar chart I made based on data from the New York Times/Siena College polls of voters in battleground states. The polls, which alarmed many Democrats, showed Trump with leads in five of six important battleground states that Biden won in 2020. Biden has been campaigning on his economic record — job creation, infrastructure investment and so on — but the polls show that voters trust Trump more than Biden on the economy. “Whether they’re right or they’re wrong, the perception is that the economy is doing very poorly,” Don Levy, director of the Siena College Research Institute, told me. Image The low mark that Biden gets from white people with no college education is consistent with what I wrote about in Monday’s newsletter: Less educated voters have turned away from the Democratic Party en masse. Ironically for Biden, he seems to be getting dinged for a New Democrat strategy of “compensating losers” that he himself doesn’t buy into. (Biden does pretty well with nonwhites who have no college education, perhaps because they feel their nonwhite identity more strongly than their no-college identity.) Trump may also be benefiting from rose-colored hindsight. More voters have a favorable impression of Trump’s overall record now (48 percent) than they did when he left office (38 percent), according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll. I asked Representative Ro Khanna, a progressive Democrat from California who represents Silicon Valley, about the Times/Siena poll results. He said he thought Trump beat Biden on the economy in voters’ minds because “Trump, as hollow as he is, without a single idea, positioned himself as this outlaw, questioner of institutions, challenger of the status quo. He has that brand that appeals to people’s grievance.” A Blueprint/YouGov poll, conducted around the same time as the Times/Siena polls, has more bad news for the Democrats. (Blueprint is a new project of Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn.) The poll results, first reported by Semafor, found that voters care most about inflation and least about jobs, yet believe that the Democrats are focused least on inflation and most on jobs. As for the decline in inflation that Biden brags about: Only 38 percent said they believed the official statistics, against 62 percent who didn’t. That disbelief says a lot. I don’t think it’s entirely a measure of distrust in the statistical agencies. I think it’s deeper than that. People are saying that, for whatever reason, prices went up. And they’re saying they can’t make ends meet. Anyone who tries to tell them that inflation has fallen is going to be ignored, or worse. Which means the incumbent president is in a bad spot. Elsewhere: China Loses U.S. Market Share China’s share of goods imported by the United States fell to 16.5 percent last year from 21.6 percent in 2017, while Vietnam had the biggest percentage-point gain over the period, according to United Nations Comtrade data analyzed by Laura Alfaro of Harvard Business School and Davin Chor of Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business. However, China has stepped up trade with and investment in Vietnam as well as Mexico, a major source of U.S. imports, they note, adding, “This means that the U.S. could well remain indirectly connected to China.” Quote of the Day “The banking sector has stabilized since the period of acute stress earlier this year, and the system as a whole has ample capital and liquidity to withstand shocks. I continue to monitor the system for signs of renewed stresses.” — Lisa Cook, a governor of the Federal Reserve (Nov. 6, 2023) Peter Coy has covered business for more than 40 years.
