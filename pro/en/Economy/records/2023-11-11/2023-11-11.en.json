    "originBody": "FINANCE ·ECONOMY Recession? What recession? The unlikely factors shaping America’s economic landscape BYCHRISTIAAN HETZNER While a coordinated global interest rate tightening has slowed economies worldwide, the U.S., despite having higher rates, is defying predictions of contraction. GETTY IMAGES Amidst a robust U.S. economy, the usual doomsayers are notably silent. Michael Burry, of “Big Short” fame, and Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini—both typically bearish—have been conspicuously quiet on the troubled forecasts front. With the U.S. economy surging at a 4.9% rate, the bears seem to be hibernating early, as there’s no immediate sign of weakening in the pillars of robust employment and healthy household spending. “It was a complete blowout that nobody would have predicted even three months ago,” Olu Sonola, head of U.S. regional economics at Fitch Ratings, tells Fortune. “A tight labor market and a solid consumer balance sheet also mean the economy will be sustained for some time to come.” While a coordinated global interest rate tightening has slowed economies worldwide, the U.S., despite having higher rates, is defying predictions of contraction. Last October, models developed by Bloomberg Economics notably estimated the chance of a U.S. recession this year at a staggering 100%, a total certainty in other words. Even an emerging crisis in the regional lending market sparked by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic and Signature Bank this past spring has failed to make a noticeable dent in growth. How have so many got it wrong? Mohammed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at German insurer Allianz and author of the new book Permacrisis readily admits his profession has been all over the place with their forecasts over the last 15 months. Analysts like El-Erian criticize the Federal Reserve for blunders that eroded market faith in its ability to navigate economic challenges. The Fed’s actions, including rapid rate hikes and selling off Treasury holdings, were seen as attempts to cool an overheated economy, but the impact has been slow, prompting questions about the transmission process. One of the biggest mysteries, according to Deutsche Bank, is why this transmission has been so “exceedingly slow” in the U.S. versus other nations. “The absolute level of market rates is not the best metric of how tight policy is,” concluded George Saravelos, who looks at cross-border fund flows as Deutsche Bank’s global head of foreign exchange research. “It is where policy is being passed through the most that matters.” Paradoxically interest expenses for companies have in fact declined, he says, as the returns on their cash holdings have risen while their liabilities are fixed. One prime example is Warner Bros. Discovery, whose finance chief boasted his creditors are hurting so much due to the low rates he locked in over nearly 15 years that he could likely buy his bonds back from them at a sizeable discount. Fixed-rate 30-year mortgages have insulated American homeowners from rapid rate increases, and despite a total household liability of $17.3 trillion, most Americans still possess assets to liquidate in a pinch. The Fed’s recent report indicating a 37% increase in Americans’ net worth further underscores the country’s economic resilience. Were it not for recent polls putting Donald Trump ahead in key swing states, one might think Bidenomics with its focus on building the middle out has been a smashing success. Pockets of weakness emerging Importantly last quarter’s pace of 4.9% growth is not sustainable. For example, Fitch’s Sonola says roughly 1 percentage point of that came from inventory buildup that will ultimately reverse and become a temporary drag on the economy. There are also pockets of weakness emerging, particularly among younger consumers and low-income earners who rent and have little or no assets. The government’s growing interest burden, now estimated by Bloomberg at an annualized $1 trillion, could also curtail future public sector spending. Still, the worst Sonola expects for next year is a brief and shallow recession followed by an immediate bounce back that will still mean output will expand on an annual basis. Granted it will be below-trend, somewhere in the region shy of 1%, but still an expansion at a time when China is struggling with a property crash and Germany, Europe’s economic engine, may not grow at all. A big reason for that is a shortfall of about 3 million more vacancies in the U.S. than existed prior to the pandemic. Even if the Fed’s tightening measures result in unemployment creeping higher, there’s still plenty of cushion before consumer spending is likely to soften across the board. That is, so long as two conditions remain in place: 1) higher immigration remains politically challenging and 2) the baby boomers who exited the workforce during COVID don’t all want to return. But Sonola views that as an unlikely scenario given many are sitting on a stockpile of assets from which to live comfortably. “The real estate market has been good, their stock portfolio is good and they’re collecting social security checks,” Sonola says. “So they have the luxury to play with their grandkids and stop worrying about money.” Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance.

    "originBody": "CAROL CAIN Defense industry contributes $31B to Michigan economy — but we don't hear much about it Carol CainFree Press Business Columnist View Comments It's an industry that contributes $31 billion to the economy here yet most folks don’t hear much about it, even though its presence is felt economically across all 83 counties, according to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. The defense industry is also a vital part of our state’s past: We became known as the Arsenal of Democracy during World War II when our auto plants were quickly transformed to make bombers and more for the war effort. Our future is also tied to growing our defense sector as folks I talked to mentioned Michigan is perfectly positioned with its engineering and advanced manufacturing might, as well as its penchant for innovation. “Michigan is where the automotive industry got its start,” said Mark Ignash, interim executive director of the Michigan Defense Center and senior sector development director and defense adviser to the MEDC. “More than 100 years later, it’s still the global center and nexus of commercial automotive, electrification and military technology.” Michigan is home to some of the country’s largest ground vehicle defense companies, such as General Dynamics Land Systems, BAE Systems, GE Aviation and more, he added. Statewide, there are 4,000 companies in the defense, aerospace and homeland security sectors and thousands of jobs tied to them, according to the MEDC. “This is an industry that is important but seems to fly under the radar as many are not aware of everything that the DoD (Department of Defense) procures, as well as just how many businesses are engaged in the supply base,” Ignash said. He added: “The defense industry is everything under the sun, from defense land systems to enabling technologies such as AI to aerospace to homeland security and everything else that needs to be procured to sustain our national defense.\" A few interesting stats he shared: Michigan has 4,000 defense suppliers in the state. The state has $6.6 billion in defense contracts. There are 155,000 defense industry related jobs here. In southeast Michigan, we hear once in awhile about Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township. There’s been talk again about Selfridge’s future with the aging A-10 fighter jet housed there and 5,000-plus jobs connected to it. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and other Michigan lawmakers are urging the U.S. Air Force to consider buying more of the new F-15EX Eagle II fighter aircraft to boost odds of them being sent to Selfridge to replace the A-10 when it is retired in a few years. “Selfridge is our hometown airbase and we are proud of the work of the military and civilian personnel at the base who support the current and future missions,\" said Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel. “Collectively, we are making the right steps to secure a future fighter force mission that will ensure Selfridge remains a critical asset in our nation’s defense.\" Tammy Carnrike, COO of the Detroit Regional Chamber, is also civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army Michigan South. She’s been focused on helping grow our defense sector for nearly two decades. “When I first arrived and learned about what was U.S. Army TACOM at the time, I was very interested in the work they were doing and the economic impact to the region and state,” Carnrike said. “Shortly after, the U. S. Army went through a base realignment examination and there was concern that we could lose potential jobs and procurement advantage.” The Detroit Arsenal, home to TACOM headquarters, is the only active-duty U.S. military installation in the state of Michigan. She said the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command located in Warren on the Detroit Arsenal, manages the Army’s ground equipment supply chain, about 60% of the Army's total equipment. “If a soldier drives it, shoots it, wears it ... TACOM sustains it,” Carnrike said. “The entire country looks to Michigan for its engineering, manufacturing, and research and development talent and expertise to solve the defense industry’s toughest challenges,” she said. As civilian aide to the secretary, her role is “essential to the Army’s ability to connect by helping to build partnerships and strengthening relationships in their communities.” The National Advanced Mobility Consortium (NAMC) is a nonprofit started in 2008, headquartered in Ann Arbor with an office in Sterling Heights. Its membership consists of nearly 500 organizations and businesses bringing cutting-edge advanced mobility technologies to the Department of Defense. NAMC acts as a bridge between the government and the defense industry. The consortium was awarded the Detroit Arsenal Innovation Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) managed by the United States Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Ground Vehicle Systems Center, located at the Detroit Arsenal. This contracting mechanism authorizes NAMC to facilitate prototype projects in a variety of areas through its expansive member base. Projects under the OTA are focused on enhancing technology, systems and materials for the Department of Defense and the United States Armed Forces. Members join NAMC for access to opportunities to deliver capabilities to DoD priority efforts. This award gives an opportunity for diversification for Michigan companies. For example, companies with commercial technologies from the automotive/racing industries are able to apply their tech to defense vehicles and needs. “The DAI OTA is a tool of innovation,” said Alissa Roath, NAMC’s executive director. “With an emphasis on autonomy, connectivity, cybersecurity and more, this award aligns with NAMC's mission to provide cutting-edge solutions to our armed forces.“ Roath said up to 25% of NAMC members could gain new business as a result of the award. “There has been much accomplished in the last several years to place a higher priority on promoting the defense industry and the opportunities that exist in Michigan,” said Carnrike. “From Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation to economic development organizations, defense industry associations and county governments.” Carnrike’s hoping that industry, government, organizations and others work closer together to take advantage of that momentum. “The challenge will be getting everyone aligned and working toward one strategic effort,” Carnrike added.

    "originLink": "https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/the-global-economy-will-perform-better-than-many-expect-in-2024.html",
    "originBody": "Goldman Sachs Research expects the global economy to outperform expectations in 2024 — just as it did in 2023. That outlook is based on our economists’ prediction for strong income growth (amid cooling inflation and a robust job market), their expectation that rate hikes have already delivered their biggest hits to GDP growth, and their view that manufacturing will recover. Central banks, meanwhile, will have room to reduce interest rates if they’re concerned about the economy slowing. “This is an important insurance policy against a recession,” Goldman Sachs Research Chief Economist Jan Hatzius writes in the team’s report titled Macro Outlook 2024: The Hard Part Is Over. Worldwide GDP is forecast to expand 2.6% next year on an annual average basis, compared with the 2.1% consensus forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. In fact, Goldman Sachs Research’s forecasts for GDP growth in 2024 are more optimistic than the consensus for eight of the world’s nine largest economies, as of Nov. 8, 2023. And notably, our economists expect US growth to outpace its developed market peers again. The global economy fared better than many economists expected in 2023 Goldman Sachs Research was also optimistic about the global economy in 2023 — and the results have exceeded even our own economists’ expectations. Solid GDP growth has translated into more-than-solid labor market performance. The unemployment rate across all the economies covered by our analysts (and with high-quality labor market data) now stands about 0.5 percentage points below its pre-pandemic level. Importantly, this improvement is visible even in some key economies that have seen very low real GDP growth, such as the Euro area. Will inflation continue to cool in 2024? Importantly, GDP growth and employment have been surprisingly buoyant among economies that experienced a large and unwanted inflation surge in 2021-2022. (Policymakers in Japan, by contrast, wanted inflation.) And inflation is now cooling across G10 and emerging market economies. “We don’t think the last mile of disinflation will be particularly hard,” Hatzius writes. The supply and demand of goods have grown more balanced, and the impact of this on core goods disinflation is still unfolding and is forecast to continue through most of 2024. Shelter inflation is expected to have considerably further to fall. Most crucially, the supply-demand balance in the labor market continues to improve. Goldman Sachs Research’s jobs-workers gap — measured as job openings minus unemployed workers — is trending down everywhere. The adjustment has so far occurred almost entirely in a benign fashion, as job openings have declined without a rise in unemployment. Our economists forecast this year’s decline in inflation to continue in 2024: sequential core inflation is predicted to fall from 3% now to an average 2-2.5% range across the G10 (excluding Japan). “That would be broadly consistent with the inflation targets of most developed market central banks by the end of 2024,” Hatzius writes. “If anything, we think that the risks to the achievement of target-consistent inflation are on the earlier side.” Many big economies will avoid recession in 2024 Over the past year, our economists have been relatively optimistic that major economies can avoid a recession. In the team’s report, they reaffirm their longstanding view that the probability of a US recession is much lower than commonly appreciated — at just 15% over the next 12 months. There are four main reasons Goldman Sachs Research is optimistic about growth next year. Our economists have a positive outlook for real disposable income growth at a time of much lower headline inflation and still-strong labor markets. While they predict US real income growth will slow from its very strong 2023 pace, they think it will still be enough to support consumption and GDP growth of at least 2%. Meanwhile, both the Euro area and the UK are expected to have a meaningful acceleration in real income growth — to around 2% by end-2024 — as the gas shock following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine fades. Rate hikes and fiscal policy will continue to weigh on growth across the G10 economies, but the worst of that drag has already happened, Hatzius writes. The team’s research shows that the maximum impact of monetary tightening on the growth rate (as opposed to level) of GDP occurs with a short lag of about two quarters. “We therefore expect a smaller drag from tighter financial conditions in 2024 than in 2023, even after factoring in the recent increase in long-term interest rates,” Hatzius writes. Industrial activity has been weak amid a rebalancing of spending back towards services from goods, the European energy crisis, an inventory cycle that had to correct for overbuilding in 2022, and a weaker-than-expected rebound in Chinese manufacturing. Most of these headwinds are forecast to fade this year, and manufacturing is expected to recover toward longer-term trend levels. The “most novel reason” to be optimistic about GDP growth is that central banks don’t need a recession to bring inflation down, and will therefore try hard to avoid one, Hatzius writes. Our economists’ analysis of past hiking cycles shows that major central banks are twice as likely to cut rates when there’s a risk to growth once inflation has normalized to sub-3% rates (relative to when inflation is above 5%). Will central banks cut interest rates next year? Policymakers in developed markets are unlikely to cut interest rates before the second half of 2024 unless economic growth proves weaker than anticipated, according to Goldman Sachs Research. In part, that view is based on our economists’ baseline forecasts, which expect inflation to remain modestly above target, unemployment rates to stay below their long-run levels, and GDP to grow roughly at trend pace in 2024. In emerging markets, policy cuts are expected to be announced sooner. Japan stands apart because its inflation pickup was largely desired. After three decades of anemic price pressures or outright deflation, wage increases in 2023 signalled that the Bank of Japan was moving towards its goal of establishing a virtuous cycle between wages and prices. The BoJ is therefore poised to move toward an exit from its policy of yield curve control in April 2024, although a formal abandonment of these measures is unlikely until October 2024, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Even so, Japanese inflation should remain far below the levels experienced by its G10 peers during this cycle. China also stands apart when it comes to policy stimulus, as authorities have sought to counteract sluggish economic growth. Our economists expect China’s GDP growth to slow to 4.8% in 2024 as the boost from post-covid reopening fades, but partly offset by a slightly smaller housing drag, a modest rebound in global trade, and additional policy easing. The world’s second-largest economy still has challenges, however. Its property downturn is likely to endure, and there is still a risk that the resulting pessimism becomes entrenched. The country’s ongoing demographic deterioration and persistently shrinking working-age population will require it to reinvent its growth model. A modest cyclical rebound in exports is unlikely to reverse the ongoing diversification of global value chains away from China. “Near-term growth in China should benefit from further policy stimulus, but China’s multi-year slowdown will likely continue,” Hatzius writes.

    "originBody": "Economy Americans are unusually down on a solid economy. So far, they aren’t spending — or voting — like it. Both parties are laser-focused on voters’ sour economic mood, but it’s anyone’s guess how today’s pessimism might play a year from now. American consumers — who drive two-thirds of economic activity — are still spending vigorously despite voicing downbeat sentiments.Eva Marie Uzcategui / Bloomberg via Getty Images file Print Save Create your free profile or log in to save this article Nov. 8, 2023, 11:54 PM UTC / Updated Nov. 10, 2023, 5:43 PM UTC By Christine Romans By just about any measure, the mighty American economy is chugging along nicely. The much-forecast recession of 2023 simply never happened. Instead, the jobless rate has remained below 4% for two years, wages are finally rising faster than inflation, and the economy revved up in the third quarter to post a nearly 5% growth. Bipartisan investments in infrastructure and computer chip manufacturing are just starting to bear fruit, fueling more economic tailwinds in the months ahead. In fact, in a note to clients Wednesday, Goldman Sachs declared “the hard part is over” for efforts to shore up the global economy, predicting that inflation would continue to ease in 2024. The bank’s researchers now expect a mere 15% risk that the United States will tip into a recession next year, following a spate of forecasters, including those at the Federal Reserve, voicing growing economic optimism. But many Americans don’t share that view. Consumer sentiment dropped to a six-month low this month, according to University of Michigan data released Friday. A new Bankrate survey found half of Americans saying their overall financial situation is worse now than on Election Day 2020. And a recent New York Times/Siena College poll found 81% of voters rating the economy either “fair” or “poor,” with just 19% calling it “good” or “excellent.” Republican presidential candidates who debated in Miami Wednesday night looked to reinforce these views, making the case — sometimes by misrepresenting how gas prices and wages have trended — that the economy isn’t working well with a Democrat in the White House. Yet despite the widespread pessimism, consumers — who drive two-thirds of economic activity — are still spending. “People may be feeling bad, but they are not spending badly,” said Nela Richardson, chief economist of the payroll processing firm ADP. “They are spending like they are optimistic, even though they are reporting that they are pessimistic.” What gives? The likely explanation is a gloomy soup of two major wars, ongoing domestic political divisions, a still-recent pandemic and price pressures that have slowed down dramatically but rarely reversed. “It’s one word: inflation,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. In his view, inflation’s lingering toll over the past year and a half more than makes up for the historic strength in the job market and other upsides to Americans’ wallets. “Inflation is coming down, but prices aren’t coming down, which is the source of the irritation” for many, Hamrick said. And of course, the country’s yawning economic inequality means that robust overall consumer spending figures can’t help but mask wide disparities in households’ finances. (“There’s no one, monolithic ‘consumer,’” Hamrick noted.) Inflation has eased from the painful 9.1% in the middle of last year to 3.7% in September. But while economists and Fed officials are cheered by that trend, ordinary Americans vividly recall a not-so-distant past when many things were cheaper. For example, the average price of a gallon of milk in November 2019 was $3.19. It surged to $4.20 in May 2022, before settling back to $3.97 this fall. “We’re in an economy where the price level has taken a big, gigantic step up,” said Richardson. Add in the highest interest rates in decades and borrowing money is more expensive, too — translating to steeper mortgage rates and credit card interest. A year out from the 2024 vote, it’s an open question how, or even whether, Americans’ economic malaise will play out either in the economy itself or at the ballot box. But both parties have been betting heavily that it will matter. President Joe Biden has been pounding the pavement to trumpet $5 billion in new investments to juice rural economies, hoping that voters will reward him and fellow Democrats for infrastructure projects ramping up across the country. Meanwhile, Republicans have raced to pin voters’ frustrations over high prices on “Bidenomics,” the term that the White House has used to try — with uncertain success — to brand the administration’s economic policies. Of course, presidents frequently get too much credit and too much blame for the state of the economy on their watches, and pollsters note that voters tend to blame a leader for a declining economy more than they will credit for a good one. But if Tuesday’s election results are any indication, there’s no guarantee that next year’s contest will hinge on the economy. In a number of races — albeit off-year ones that tend to draw a different mix of voters than those who turn out for presidential elections — other issues rose to the fore. Abortion access in particular has continued to propel Democrats to victories at the state and local level after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. In many cases, conservative voters who strongly disapprove of Biden, including for his handling of the economy, crossed party lines to back more expansive reproductive rights. If the past 12 months’ mistaken economic predictions have illustrated anything, it’s that a lot can change in a year, both in Americans’ financial lives and the ways they feel about them. Reflecting on the dissonance between many of the economy’s fundamentals and consumers’ sour outlook, Richardson was circumspect. “When that feeling starts translating into behavior,” she said, “I think that’s when we’re going to have to pay attention.” Christine Romans Christine Romans is a senior business correspondent at NBC News.",

OffOn LOG IN Stream on British economy flatlines in third quarter of the year, update shows The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year ByPAN PYLAS Associated Press November 10, 2023, 7:46 AM FILE - Christmas lights are displayed on Regent Street in London on Nov. 24, 2022. The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year, official figures showed Friday, Nov. 10, 2023, ahead of a budget statement from the government later this month. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File) The Associated Press LONDON -- The British economy flatlined in the third quarter of the year, official figures showed Friday ahead of a budget statement from the government later this month that it hopes will bolster growth in the run-up to national elections. The Office for National Statistics said growth in the July-to-September period was zero compared to the previous three-months. All sectors, such as manufacturing and construction, broadly showed the same subdued picture. Despite the uninspiring headline figure, the quarterly outcome was slightly ahead of analysts' expectations for a modest decline in output. The British economy, like many others particularly in the world, is facing headwinds in the form of higher interest rates, which are aimed at taming inflation. Last week, the Bank of England kept its main interest rate unchanged at the 15-year high of 5.25% and indicated that borrowing costs will likely remain at these elevated levels for a while to get inflation back to its target of 2% from the current 6.7% The Bank of England, like other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively from near zero as it sought to counter price rises first stoked by supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up food and energy costs. One way higher interest rates work in getting inflation down is by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, thereby reining in spending. “With higher interest rates feeding through to mortgage holders and with challenges in the labour market, activity is likely to flatline through to the middle of next year,” said Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte. Though a widely predicted recession has not materialized over the past year, the economic backdrop is hardly ideal for the governing Conservative Party given that a general election must take place by January 2025. The main opposition Labour Party is way ahead in opinion polls at present. Treasury chief Jeremy Hunt said a budget statement he will deliver on Nov. 22 will focus on how to “get the economy growing healthily again by unlocking investment.” Labour economy spokesperson Rachel Reeves said the figures provide “further evidence that the economy is not working under the Conservatives.” Related Topics United Kingdom Top Stories Treasure-hunting divers seek mother lode of riches from a 400-year-old shipwreck 2 hours ago Judge rules in Prince Harry, Elton John's lawsuit against Daily Mail publisher Nov 10, 11:33 AM Jan. 6 suspect surrenders to police after widespread manhunt: FBI Nov 10, 4:57 PM 4 people injured in 'shootout' on highway in Birmingham, Alabama: Police Nov 11, 1:35 AM NYC Mayor Eric Adams' electronic devices seized by FBI Nov 10, 9:33 PM ABC News Live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ABC News Network Privacy Policy Your US State Privacy Rights Children's Online Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads About Nielsen Measurement Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Contact Us © 2023 ABC News",

Share full article Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held discussions with the Chinese vice premier, He Lifeng, in San Francisco on Thursday and Friday, ahead of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings. Credit... Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Alan Rappeport Reporting from Washington Nov. 10, 2023 The United States and China agreed on Friday that they would not seek to “decouple” their economies and pledged to take steps to improve the business climates for American and Chinese companies operating in both countries, a significant step toward thawing relations between the world’s largest economies. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said after two days of meetings with Vice Premier He Lifeng in San Francisco that they had concluded they should strive for a “healthy economic relationship” and try to work more constructively together. “We do not seek to decouple our economy from China’s,” Ms. Yellen said. “This would be damaging to both the U.S. and China and destabilizing for the world.” She and Mr. He met at a delicate moment for the world economy, which is grappling with sluggish growth and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. While economic strength in the United States has been a bright spot, China’s economy continues to sputter. Official statistics this week showed that prices in China are falling as households and businesses remain wary of spending even as state-controlled banks invest in the construction of more factories. The talks between Ms. Yellen and Mr. He, China’s top economic official since March, were held before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit begins in San Francisco on Saturday, and set the stage for a widely anticipated meeting next week between President Biden and China’s top leader, Xi Jinping. After years of growing acrimony between the two countries, the Biden administration has given priority to stabilizing relations, and this year sent several senior officials to Beijing in hopes of reopening lines of communication. After Ms. Yellen’s visit in July, the Treasury Department initiated economic and financial working groups with China to give both countries a new forum to air grievances and look for ways to collaborate. Many contentious economic issues continue to cloud the relationship. Biden administration officials have raised concerns about mistreatment of American companies operating in China, and there is continuing frustration about theft of American intellectual property and China’s dominance of the electric vehicle market. “A healthy economic relationship requires American workers and firms to be treated fairly,” Ms. Yellen said. China also has grievances and has expressed frustration about measures that the United States has taken to restrict American investment in certain Chinese sectors, tariffs on Chinese imports into the United States and backlash that Chinese companies face when investing in America. The Chinese government has also bristled at Biden administration rules aimed at blocking China’s access to advanced technologies that the United States worries could be used for military purposes. Ms. Yellen said she had raised concerns about the scale of China’s nonmarket policies, which the Biden administration believes unfairly subsidize Chinese exports, and their impact on U.S. workers and firms. The Treasury secretary also expressed concerns about China’s recent export controls on graphite and other critical minerals and urged China not to provide Russia’s defense industrial sector. The Treasury secretary said that the United States had seen evidence that Chinese companies were supporting Russia’s defense sector and that she had asked Mr. He to do more to crack down on actions by Chinese companies that violated American sanctions. Ms. Yellen has said face-to-face contact with China’s new economic team is important as the Biden administration tries to better understand how China intends to steer its economy out of a difficult postpandemic recovery. On Friday, she said Chinese officials had expressed confidence in their plans and wanted to avoid enacting short-term measures to boost the economy that could lead to longer term problems. Ms. Yellen said that she and Mr. He had also discussed the fiscal outlook in the United States and that she had reassured him that the Biden administration had been taking steps to raise more tax revenue and reduce budget deficits. China is one of the biggest holders of U.S. Treasury securities. The high-level meetings this week are taking place at a moment when the politics of trying to improve relations with China are growing more complicated. During a Republican presidential debate this week, several candidates struck a confrontational tone and called for severing economic ties with China. But Ms. Yellen has taken a much different approach. She has explained to her Chinese counterparts that the United States wants to diversify its supply chains while arguing that the consequences of further deterioration of economic ties between the two countries would have dire consequences for the world economy. Although no specific policy breakthroughs were announced on Friday, Ms. Yellen expressed hope that more dialogue would help avoid the kind of tit-for-tat retaliatory actions that had frayed the U.S. relationship with China over the years. “This is not just communication for communication’s sake,” she said. “It allows us to avoid misunderstandings and unintended escalation, make informed decisions and work toward specific policy outcomes.” Ms. Yellen said the two sides agreed to work together on efforts to combat climate change and to provide debt relief to low-income countries that were facing the prospect of default. The Treasury secretary added that she and Mr. He had agreed to have more regular communication and that she expected to travel to China again next year.
