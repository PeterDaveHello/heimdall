OffOn LOG IN Stream on A fragile global economy at stake as US and China seek to cool tensions at APEC The United States and China are the two global economic heavyweights. ByPAUL WISEMAN AP economics writer November 12, 2023, 3:16 AM File - An APEC Summit sign welcomes visitors Friday, Nov. 10, 2023, in San Francisco. World leaders, including President Joe Biden and China’s Xi Jinping, CEOS, protesters and thousands of others will soon descend on San Francisco for the high-profile trade summit. (AP Photo/Godofredo A. Vásquez, File) The Associated Press WASHINGTON -- The United States and China are the two global economic heavyweights. Combined, they produce more than 40% of the world's goods and services. So when Washington and Beijing do economic battle, as they have for five years running, the rest of the world suffers, too. And when they hold a rare high-level summit, as Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping will this week, it can have global consequences. The world's economy could surely benefit from a U.S.-China détente. Since 2020, it has suffered one crisis after another — the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring inflation, surging interest rates, violent conflicts in Ukraine and now Gaza. The global economy is expected to grow a lackluster 3% this year and 2.9% in 2024, according to the International Monetary Fund. “Having the world’s two largest economies at loggerheads at such a fraught moment,\" said Eswar Prasad, senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University, “exacerbates the negative impact of various geopolitical shocks that have hit the world economy.” Hopes have risen that Washington and Beijing can at least cool some of their economic tensions at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which starts Sunday in San Francisco. The meeting will bring together 21 Pacific Rim countries, which collectively represent 40% of the world’s people and nearly half of global trade. The marquee event will be the Biden-Xi meeting Wednesday on the sidelines of the summit, the first time the two leaders will have spoken in a year, during which time frictions between the two nations have worsened. The White House has sought to tamp down expectations, saying to expect no breakthroughs. At the same time, Prasad suggested that the threshold for declaring a successful outcome is relatively low. “Preventing any further deterioration in the bilateral economic relationship,\" he said, \"would already be a victory for both sides.’’ The U.S.-China economic relationship had been deteriorating for years before it erupted in 2018, at the instigation of President Donald Trump, into an all-out trade war. The Trump administration charged that China had violated the commitments it made, in joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, to open its vast market to U.S. and other foreign companies that wanted to sell their goods and services there. In 2018, the Trump administration began imposing tariffs on Chinese imports to punish Beijing for its actions in trying to supplant U.S. technological supremacy. Many experts agreed with the administration that Beijing had engaged in cyberespionage and had improperly demanded that foreign companies turn over trade secrets as the price of gaining access to the Chinese market. Beijing punched back against Trump's sanctions with its own retaliatory tariffs, making U.S. goods more expensive for Chinese buyers. When Biden took office in 2021, he kept much of Trump’s confrontational trade policy, including the China tariffs. The U.S. tax rate on Chinese imports now exceeds 19%, versus 3% at the start of 2018, before Trump imposed his tariffs. Likewise, Chinese import taxes on U.S. goods are up to 21%, from 8% before the trade war began, according to calculations by Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. One of the tenets of Biden's economic policy has been to reduce America’s economic reliance on Chinese factories, which came under strain when COVID-19 disrupted global supply chains, and to solidify partnerships with other Asian nations. As part of that policy, the Biden administration last year forged the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity with 14 countries. In some ways, U.S.-China trade tensions are even higher under Biden than they were under Trump. Beijing is seething over the Biden administration’s decision to impose — and then broaden — export controls that are designed to prevent China from acquiring advanced computer chips and the equipment to produce them. In August, Beijing countered with its own trade curbs: It began requiring that Chinese exporters of gallium and germanium, metals used in computer chips and solar cells, obtain government licenses to send those metals overseas. Beijing has also taken aggressive actions against foreign companies in China. Orchestrating what appears to be a counterespionage campaign, its authorities this year raided the Chinese offices of the U.S. consulting firms Capvision and the Mintz Group, questioned Shanghai employees of the Bain & Co. consultancy and announced a security review of the chipmaker Micron. Some analysts speak of a “decoupling’’ of the world’s two biggest economies after decades in which they relied deeply on each other for trade. Indeed, imports of Chinese goods to the United States were down 24% through September compared with the same period of 2022. The rift between Beijing and Washington has forced many other countries into a delicate predicament: Deciding which side they're on when they actually want to do business with both countries. The IMF says such economic “fragmentation’’ is damaging to the world. The 190-country lending agency estimates that higher trade barriers will subtract $7.4 trillion from global economic output after the world has adjusted to the higher trade barriers. And those barriers are rising: Last year, the IMF said, countries imposed nearly 3,000 new restrictions on trade, up from fewer than 1,000 in 2019. The agency foresees international trade growing just 0.9% this year and 3.5% in 2024 — down sharply from the 2000-2019 annual average of 4.9%. The Biden administration insists it isn’t trying to undermine China's economy. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with her Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, in San Francisco and sought to set the stage for Biden-Xi summit. “Our mutual desire — both China and the United States — is to create a level playing field and ongoing, meaningful and mutually beneficial economic relations,” Yellen said. Xi, too, has reason to try to restore economic cooperation with the United States. The Chinese economy is under heavy strain. Its real estate market has collapsed, youth unemployment is rampant and consumer spirits are low. The raids on foreign businesses have spooked international companies and investors. “With serious headwinds facing the Chinese economy and many U.S. firms packing up their bags and leaving China, Xi needs to convince investors that China is still a profitable place to conduct business,’’ said Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator. “This will not be an easy sell.’’ Complicating matters is that the tensions between Washington and Beijing go well beyond economics. Under Xi, the Chinese Communist Party has punished dissent in Hong Kong and the autonomous Muslim region of Xinjiang. His government made aggressive territorial demands in Asia, engaging in deadly border clashes with India and bullying the Philippines and other neighbors in parts of the South China Sea it claims as its own. It has increasingly threatened Taiwan, which it considers a renegade Chinese province. U.S.-China tensions could intensify next year with presidential elections in Taiwan and the United States, where criticism of Beijing is among the few areas that unite Democrats and Republicans. Xi’s policies appear to be costing China in the battle for world opinion. In a recent survey of people in 24 countries, the Pew Research Center reported that the United States was viewed more favorably than China in all but two (Kenya and Nigeria) nations. Could China change course? Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat who serves on a House committee that monitors China, noted optimistically that Xi has reversed himself before — notably in declaring a sudden end to the draconian zero-COVID policies that crippled China's economy last year. “We have to give that possibility a chance, even at the same time that we hedge and protect our interests,’’ Krishnamoorthi said. “That’s what I’m hoping we also see come out of this meeting.’’ Top Stories 3 dead, including SWAT officer, following hostage incident in Austin: Police Nov 12, 12:38 AM Dozens of Chinese ships chase Philippine vessels as US renews warning it will defend its treaty ally Nov 11, 1:55 PM Speaker Mike Johnson unveils plan to avert government shutdown Nov 11, 11:52 PM Treasure-hunting divers seek mother lode of riches from a 400-year-old shipwreck Nov 11, 11:10 AM At least 6 dead, 1 in critical condition after 'major' collision in Houston: Police Nov 11, 10:11 PM ABC News Live 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events ABC News Network Privacy Policy Your US State Privacy Rights Children's Online Privacy Policy Interest-Based Ads About Nielsen Measurement Terms of Use Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Contact Us © 2023 ABC News",

    "title": "Rising interest rates and economic shifts: Is a regime change underway?",
    "originLink": "https://english.elpais.com/economy-and-business/2023-11-12/regime-change-in-the-economy.html",
    "originBody": "MONETARY POLITICS OPINION i Regime change in the economy Let us not forget that a world with positive interest rates and inflation is better than a world with zero interest rates and inflation TOMÁS ONDARRA ÁNGEL UBIDE NOV 12, 2023 - 13:48 CET We say in Spain that when you turn 50 (age is more a mental than a physical state, but that’s another story) you “turn the ham to the other side.” For many people it is a regime change, which leads to a different approach to life, to focusing on different problems, with sometimes radical changes in behavior, for better or worse. In the economy, and in the markets, there are similar moments. Sometimes generational changes occur, what previously mattered takes a backseat, markets change behavior, and economic policy objectives shift. The rapid rise in long-term interest rates observed since the summer has some elements of such generational change. In some respects, it seems as if the markets have returned to the period before the 2007 financial crisis. Let’s refresh our memory a little. At that time, markets priced that inflation was well anchored at 2%, and assigned a negligible probability to everything that happened during the subsequent decades: that central banks would lower rates to zero, commit to keeping them at zero as long as it was necessary, or buy government bonds for years. It is true that there had been some debate about it: in 2002 Alan Greenspan mentioned the risk of “corrosive deflation” and discussed economic policy alternatives, and Ben Bernanke, then a Fed Governor, gave a speech titled “Deflation: Making Sure ‘It’ Doesn’t happen here.” In fact, the Federal Reserve lowered rates to 1% in 2003 to minimize the probability that inflation could reach zero. It is also true that Japan had been mired in deflation for some time, with zero interest rates, and buying, very timidly compared to what central bankers did later, government bonds. But nobody then believed that this was possible in the West; it was considered an exotic case stemming from the poor economic management of the Japanese authorities. Back then, markets also believed that the equilibrium interest rate was high. For the U.S., the consensus was that the interest rate that closed the output gap and set inflation at target was around 4-4.25%, which created enough room to lower interest rates in case of need — but also created an expected future range for interest rates around that level. Markets can remember, and in 2000 the Fed had raised rates to 6.5%. That is why it is not surprising that, in 2006, markets priced that, five years later (that is, in 2011), the short-term interest rate would be around 5%. Something that did not happen, because in 2011 rates had fallen to zero, but that is another story. The current pattern of long-term interest rates implies a return to that period before the 2007 crisis. Markets price that, over the next decade, inflation will be well anchored at 2%, the equilibrium interest rate will be positive, and central banks will no longer cut rates to zero or buy bonds. For example, markets price that, in five years (that is, in 2028), the short-term interest rate in the U.S. will be around 4.5%. Markets seem to have closed the deflationary period. Why this regime change? It’s difficult to pinpoint a single factor, but there are several clues. On the one hand, the challenging fiscal situation in the U.S., with a budget deficit of 6% of GDP and low expectations of reducing it given its institutional instability and the fragility of its budgetary process. The prospects of large deficits — the Congressional Budget Office projects deficits above 5% of GDP over the next three decades — has increased the risk premium on long-term bonds. Because the law of supply and demand also applies to government debt: given the expected abundant supply of public debt to finance these deficits, investors demand a lower price (which implies a higher interest rate) to buy it. On the other hand, the expectation that Japan could abandon the zero interest rate regime after almost four decades (with a very brief interval in 2005-06 when rates rose to 0.5%). Japanese investors are major buyers of global government debt, and a rise in interest rates in Japan to 1 or 2% would therefore change the pricing structure of government bonds globally. It is also increasingly evident that the world economy is more resistant to interest rates than previously thought. After a very aggressive increase in interest rates, and despite an unprecedented energy shock, the world economy shows the best labor market in recent decades: according to OECD data, the employment rate of the G7 countries is the highest in history. There are other factors, perhaps more speculative. For example, that in the future supply shocks will be dominant and inflation more volatile, due for example to climate change and geopolitical uncertainty, and that therefore bonds will be less useful as a hedging instrument for investment portfolios — as inflationary shocks increase the probability that interest rates will rise and stock prices will fall at the same time. And if bonds are less useful as a hedging instrument, their price should be lower — that is, their interest rate should be higher. It is also true that stock markets have resisted rising interest rates well, suggesting that perhaps the rise in interest rates reflects, in part, better medium-term growth prospects. Journalism is always the first draft of history. It is possible that, in a few years, we will look back and conclude that the cumulative effect of the reforms and policies developed in response to the 2007 financial crisis, the euro crisis, the pandemic, and the rapid increases in energy prices, served to improve economic policy frameworks, restore the health of the world economy, and close the deflationary cycle that began in 2007. Let us not forget that a world with positive interest rates and inflation is better than a world with zero interest rates and inflation. Just as many people reach their prime when they reach their fifth decade and “turn the ham to the other side,” it is possible that the economy in coming decades will be brighter than that of the previous two decades. Let’s celebrate it, and take advantage of the opportunities.

    "title": "Monetary-Fiscal Policy Disconnect Impacts Economy: Government Stimulus versus Fed Inflation Control",
    "originLink": "https://www.columbiatribune.com/story/opinion/2023/11/12/how-monetary-fiscal-policy-influence-us-economy/71517067007/",
    "originBody": "Here's how the disconnect between monetary and fiscal policy influences the economy Jeff MacLellanColumbia Daily Tribune It is no secret that we have been fighting inflation that reached a 40-year high and the Federal Reserve Bank has embarked on a historic interest rate increase to combat inflation. Not only have they increased interest rates but they have also reduced the size of the Fed’s balance sheet by letting securities mature and therefore tightening monetary policy (quantitative tightening). On the other hand, fiscal policy has been very much in an expansionary mode. The Congressional Budget Office’s preliminary figures for fiscal year 2023 showed the deficit came in at $2 trillion, nearly $1.1 trillion larger than last year excluding the impact of the administration’s student debt cancellation that the Supreme Court struck down in June. Only the deficits in 2020 of $3.1 trillion and 2021 of $2.8 trillion were higher as the government was trying to stimulate the economy from the affects of the pandemic. Essentially, the Fed is putting the brakes on the economy and fiscal policy set by the government is pushing on the accelerator. In retrospect, that stimulus has caused our GDP to grow by a robust 4.9% in the third quarter of this year and has kept the unemployment rate at 3.9% while the Fed is trying to slow things down. Let’s look at monetary and fiscal policy and how they work to influence the nation’s economy. Fiscal Policy. Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions, especially macroeconomic conditions. These include aggregate demand for goods and services, employment, inflation, and economic growth. How does fiscal policy work? U.S. fiscal policy is largely based on the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. He argued that governments could stabilize the business cycle and regulate economic output rather than let markets correct themselves on their own. For instance, when private sector spending decreases, the government can spend more and/or tax less in order to directly increase aggregate demand. Conversely, when the private sector is overly optimistic and spends too much, too fast on consumption and new investment projects, the government can spend less and/or tax more in order to decrease aggregate demand. This means that to help stabilize the economy, the government should run large budget deficits during economic downturns and run budget surpluses when the economy is growing. These are know as expansionary, or contractionary, fiscal policies, respectively. The executive and legislative branches of government are in charge of fiscal policy carried out by the secretary of the treasury. Monetary Policy. Monetary policy is a set of tools used by a nation’s central bank to control the overall money supply and promote economic growth and employ strategies such as revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Bank implements monetary policy through a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment while keeping inflation in check. How does monetary policy work? Monetary policies are either expansionary or contractionary, depending on the level of growth or stagnation in the economy. A contractionary policy increases interest rates and decreases the money supply to slow growth and to decrease inflation. Conversely, in times of a slowdown or a recession, an expansionary policy grows economic activity. By lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply, saving becomes less attractive and consumer spending and borrowing increase. As you can surmise from the foregoing, fiscal policy and monetary policy are not in sync. We have fiscal policy that is highly politicized as the legislature and executive branches of government want to stay in power and are trying to stimulate the economy to improve their chances of staying in office with expansionary policy. We have the Fed that is focused on fighting inflation and so far, has been somewhat successful in doing so with their contractionary policy. However, continued high deficits (not to mention our ever increasing national debt) will put upward pressure on inflation and could have the affect of causing the Fed to raise rates even higher. It appears for now that Fed is done with raising rates, but that could change if inflation persists.",

Photo: EPA-EFE EconomyChina Economy Chinese securities no longer ‘must-haves’ as overseas confidence wanes China’s stocks and bonds, long considered guarantors of stable returns, are no longer regarded as reliable prospects by foreign investors State intervention, as well as uncertainty in the property sector, has offshore capital alarmed and the markets are moving accordingly Amanda Lee + FOLLOW Published: 6:00pm, 12 Nov, 2023 Why you can trust SCMP Despite China’s pledge to deepen reform in its capital markets, weak confidence in the world’s second-largest economy means the days of Chinese securities as must-haves for foreign investors could be numbered, analysts said. Diminished access to capital markets by the country’s privately owned companies – compared to firms owned by local governments using the debt markets for refinancing – reflect pronounced changes in the structure of China’s economy. Fraser Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism: The Fragile Financial Foundation of China’s Extraordinary Rise, said that China has largely implemented reforms to improve foreign access to its markets over the past few years, although growing state influence on the economy means that some investors are now thinking twice. The problem for foreign investors now is not the tools, but more the macro picture Willer Chen, Forsyth Barr Asia “Foreign investors must surely have realised by now that the risk and reward dynamic has changed dramatically over the past few years,” Howie said. “The glory days of growth for favourite sectors like tech are gone. Rewards have fallen and risks have gone up … all in all it means that China is simply no longer the ‘must be in’ market it once was.” According to a survey of 295 fund managers conducted by Bank of America from October 6 – October 12, just 25 per cent of respondents expected the Chinese economy to strengthen over the next 12 months, compared to 33 per cent in September. The proportion of those who affirmed their likelihood to invest overweight in China markets for their portfolios, minus those who said they would go underweight – another important metric for investor confidence – dropped 15 per cent in October from September, the biggest net underweight move for Chinese assets in a year. China’s local governments issuing refinancing bonds to tackle LGFV debt Willer Chen, senior analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia, said he believes recent capital market reforms – such as the Nasdaq-style STAR Market set up in 2019 to fund China’s technological innovation – have been useful for foreign investors when it comes to presenting more choices. “But still, I think the problem for foreign investors now is not the tools, but more the macro picture and outlook,” Chen said. Earnings from many private companies, particularly Chinese property developers, have taken a hit over the past few years as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and regulatory scrutiny. Many of them have since lost access to capital markets, raising concerns among investors. The proportion of corporate bonds in China issued by privately owned companies declined to just 6 per cent in 2022 from 2019’s 9 per cent, according to a report published by US rating agency Moody’s Investors Service last month. 10:45 Chinese investors offloading overseas properties Chinese investors offloading overseas properties While issuance of bonds from privately owned companies remained low in the first half of this year, Moody’s said, onshore bond sales by local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) surged more than 30 per cent year on year over the same period, making them the biggest group of issuers in the Chinese corporate bond market. LGFVs are hybrid entities that are both public and corporate and were created to skirt restrictions on local government borrowing. They have proliferated since the global financial crisis in 2008. “Based on our observations, investors tend to prefer state-owned enterprises over privately owned companies,” said Jessie Tung, lead analyst at Moody’s. “The latter generally have better funding access, including from the banking sector, because of their background and potential government support.” A series of defaults from Chinese developers, including powerhouses Evergrande and Country Garden, has made it harder for real estate companies to access funds through capital markets. Chen said offshore financing is still available to some developers, though it is uncertain how long they can rely on this channel. “Onshore is slightly better, but mostly skewed to trust and bank loans for private developers when it comes to funding sources,” he said. “Financing difficulties, along with a dim property sales outlook, are major problems for the property market right now – and that is one of the most important factors offshore investors care about.” The banking sector remains the dominant source for China’s economic growth, and has counted on the rapid development of the real estate industry for reliable returns. The market was never the focus; it was the state that largely decided winners and losers Fraser Howie But in the US, capital markets fuel the economy, providing 71.9 per cent of equity and debt financing for non-financial corporations, according to a report by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association in July. Although the Chinese capital markets play a lesser role in supporting economic growth, Fraser said they were still powerful for some specific companies and help to make China a global financial player. President Xi Jinping’s emphasis on strategic industries, he added, will contort the markets and economy to support companies in those areas. “Deng Xiaoping always talked of using capitalist tools for socialist ends, and for a while it worked,” Fraser said. “The bond and stock markets were great ways to raise money both internally and externally. But the market was never the focus; it was the state that largely decided winners and losers.” 3",

    "originBody": "Economy The 'R' word: Why this time might be an exception to a key recession rule November 12, 20235:00 AM ET Heard on Weekend Edition Sunday Scott Horsley Enlarge this image The unemployment rate jumped in October, but layoffs are still rare. Joe Raedle/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images The unemployment rate jumped in October, but layoffs are still rare. Joe Raedle/Getty Images October's unemployment rate set off alarm bells in some quarters. That's because it was a half percentage point higher than its recent low — a jump that by one rule of thumb signals the onset of a recession. The monthly jobs report showed the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.9% in October — very low by historical standards but up from 3.4% in April. Here's why that's worth watching, but may be less worrisome than it seems. The Sahm Rule has observed a pattern since 1970 The rule was formulated by Claudia Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist, who observed that every time since 1970 that unemployment rose by half a percentage point or more from its low point in the preceding year, it marked the beginning of a recession. The logic of the rule is simple: When people lose their jobs, they spend less money, which puts pressure on businesses to cut more workers, and the downward cycle continues. Once unemployment jumps by half a percentage point, it typically keeps on climbing — at least 2 points and sometimes more. But Sahm says this time may be different. \"Empirical patterns are not laws of nature,\" Sahm told Weekend Edition Sunday. \"Rules are made to be broken.\" Why this time might be different First, there's the math. The Sahm Rule is based not on the monthly unemployment rate, but rather a three-month rolling average. And while that's up from its rock-bottom level in April, it hasn't risen by half a percentage point — at least not yet. So the alarm bell isn't actually ringing. Loading... What's more, much of the recent rise in the unemployment rate stems not from people losing their jobs but from new people entering or re-entering the workforce. More people were working in October than were in April. But because the number of people available to work had grown faster, the unemployment rate went up. That's not likely to trigger the kind of negative feedback loop of layoffs and reduced spending the Sahm Rule is based on. In fact, personal spending has remained surprisingly strong — helping to boost GDP at a rapid rate in July, August and September. But we're not out of the woods It's not clear how long that pace of spending can continue, however. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates aggressively in an effort to curb inflation. That's already put the brakes on the housing market, and could slow other parts of the economy as well. Many people have been relying on borrowed money to support their spending. Credit card debt grew to a record $1.08 trillion in the fall. And the number of people falling behind on credit card bills has been growing. \"I'm a macroeconomist, so I'm pessimistic by my wiring,\" Sahm says. \"We want to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And the way that I can help people prepare is having a good read on what's going on in the economy.\" Many forecasters still think a recession could be on the horizon. But for now at least, there's no rule saying it has to be that way. Claudia Sahm U.S. economy Unemployment Recession Facebook Flipboard Email",

      "According to a rule observed since 1970, a half percentage point increase in unemployment typically signals the start of a recession. However, this increase has not reached that threshold.",
      "The increase in unemployment is partly attributed to more people entering or re-entering the workforce. Personal spending remains strong, but there are concerns about its sustainability. The Federal Reserve's interest rate increase and rising credit card debt could also impact the economy."

    "originBody": "FORBESASIA China’s Deflation Makes Jerome Powell’s Job Harder China exporting deflation is perhaps the last thing the global economy needs. And it’s a data point that Powell and fellow Fed policymakers must consider very cautiously. William Pesek Senior Contributor I write about economics, markets and policymaking throughout Asia. Nov 12, 2023,05:05am EST Jerome Powell would be wise to increase China-related surveillance efforts. ANNA MONEYMAKER/GETTY IMAGES As Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plots the next move by the most powerful central bank, he might want to confer with officials in Beijing. China slipped back into deflation in October. A mild drop into the red, admittedly—consumer prices fell just 0.2% year on year. But students of Japan’s 1990s will remember that it’s best not to downplay such inflection points. As Chinese officials head to San Francisco, they can expect to be peppered with questions about Beijing’s plans to avoid a prolonged deflationary funk. Not since the late 1990s, arguably, has an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit been more preoccupied by Chinese weakness than its strength. The last time, again arguably, was in 1997 when the APEC circus unfurled its tents and communiques in Vancouver. That was amidst the chaos of Asia’s financial crisis, and wow was it a frenetic scene. Surreal, too. At the time, I was a young Washington-based reporter covering the Fed and U.S. Treasury Department. I’d just spent a week in Hong Kong, where the International Monetary Fund held its annual meeting. There, U.S. and IMF officials scrambled to keep turmoil in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand from spreading—especially to China. The worry at the time was that Beijing, too, would devalue its currency. That, officials feared, would kick off a fresh race to the bottom on exchange rates. And pull nations like Malaysia and the Philippines into the brink, too. This explains why, days earlier, then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and deputies Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner stopped in Beijing to discourage Chinese leader Jiang Zemin from tossing lifter fluid on an already raging financial fire. Chariman Shoji Saotome and President Shohei Nozawa of Yamaichi Securities apologize during a press conference at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on November 24, 1997. SANKEI ARCHIVE VIA GETTY IMAGES China didn’t devalue, thankfully. But a month later, when Asian officials landed in Vancouver, worries about China devaluing to prop up the economy followed then. Adding to the sense of doom in the air: worries that Japan, then Asia’s biggest economy, would be pulled into the crisis. The 1997 APEC confab had barely begun when news broke that Yamaichi Securities had collapsed. The spectacular demise of the then-100-year-old institution, one of Japan’s fabled big-four brokerages, absolutely panicked officials gathered in Vancouver. None more so that Rubin and his boss President Bill Clinton. The days to come saw Clinton and fellow Asia-Pacific leaders cajoling then-Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to get a handle on Tokyo’s financial system. All the while, officials there also kept a firm watch on China’s intentions. The events of 26 years ago are instructive as APEC again hits the North American west at a moment of maximum paranoia about Chinese fragility. Fresh signs of deflation hardly help. No member of the financial intelligentsia has more riding on China’s trajectory than Fed leader Powell. As he prepares for San Francisco, Powell is reminding markets that the Fed won’t hesitate to hike interest rates again if conditions warrant. A disproportionate number of those conditions may rely on China, where growth is slowing almost as fast as risks of debt defaults are rising. Few serious economists are betting on a Chinese crash. We can debate whether 10 years of Xi Jinping’s leadership have left the second-biggest economy better off. What’s not debatable is that Team Xi is skilled at circling the financial wagons and taming runaway markets. Still, China’s property market is clearly in crisis. The fact it can generate as much as 30% of gross domestic product makes the sector a clear and present danger to local government finances. Hence Beijing’s pivot from championing deleveraging to ramping up fresh stimulus. The calculus for Powell is knowing the point where too much Fed tightening becomes a major threat to developing economies, including China. In 1997, the Fed’s fingerprints were all over Asia’s reckoning. It was the dollar’s rally following a hyper-aggressive 1994-1995 tightening cycle that destabilized Asia. Over time, currency pegs in Bangkok, Jakarta and Seoul became impossible to defend. The dollar’s current rally is luring capital that Asia desperately needs to finance growth and cap bond yields. The Japanese yen’s tumble to 33-year lows is one data point. So is a 5.5% drop in the yuan this year. Further declines would make it harder for China’s property developers to make payments on offshore debt. China exporting deflation is perhaps the last thing the global economy needs. And it’s a data point that Powell and fellow Fed policymakers must consider very cautiously. Yes, the Fed conducts rate policies in America’s best interest. And it’s far from clear where the Fed might take rates next. The latest from Powell is that his team is proceeding “carefully.” Some Fed governors, including Michelle Bowman, a governor at the Fed, suggest another rate hike is needed to ensure inflation moves toward the 2% target. Fair enough. But tipping China into deeper turmoil might boomerang back on the U.S. in dramatic ways. Powell would be wise to increase China-related surveillance efforts. Trouble in China will rapidly show up on America’s economic shores, too.
