Among those leading the charge is Kelly Metzgar, the co-founder and executive director of the Adirondack North Country Gender Alliance. Advertisement For Metzgar, advocating for transgender rights has been a lifelong mission. On Wednesday, she brought her activism to the SUNY Plattsburgh campus, commemorating recent transgender lives lost. According to reports from police departments nationwide, 44 transgender individuals were reported murdered in the U.S. over the last year. Metzgar emphasizes the importance of remembering the names and faces of these victims. \"These people paid the ultimate sacrifice of their lives just wanting to live as themselves, as their authentic persons that they knew they were. Everybody has a right to live their life as they see fit,\" Metzgar said. Dr. Connie Oxford, chair of SUNY Plattsburgh Gender & Woman Studies, brought her class to the event, emphasizing the significance of educating students about transgender issues. \"One of the things that's very important to us is educating students about these issues,\" Oxford said. ANCGA collaborates with local organizations like Behavior Health Services North to provide essential support to the transgender community. While BHSN offers housing and various services, officials stress the importance of seeking all available support. Kaitlyn Goodwin, emergency response advocate at BHSN, said, \"Any support that you can find, whether that would be STOP Domestic and Sexual Violence or anybody outside from us, it's always helpful and definitely good to take care of yourself.\" Metzgar's overarching message is clear. \"Eliminate the hate, eliminate the bias, eliminate the stigma and the bias. We are people just like any other group of people. We're only looking to live our lives,\" Metzgar said. ANCGA will host a larger Transgender Day of Remembrance event over Zoom this Sunday at 2 p.m. Interested participants can register for the event on their Facebook page.
