Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email BY CHELCEY ADAMI Sequoia Capital Professor of Computer Science and Denning Co-Director of Stanford HAI Fei-Fei Li participates in a panel discussion at the “Unlocking Public Sector AI Innovation” seminar at Gates Computer Science Building on Tuesday, October 31, 2023 in Stanford, California. (Image credit: Don Feria) As the world navigates a complicated artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, the U.S. is strengthening its AI research resources, establishing new standards for AI safety and security, and promoting innovation and competition. This translates to critically needed computing and data resources for academia, whose key role in AI scientific discovery and risk mitigation complements the private sector’s work, said AI leaders during an event held by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) on Tuesday. “We know that AI can provide tremendous benefits to society,” said U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo. “It can improve drug discovery and medical treatments, it can assist with disaster response, and help us respond to climate change … It holds great promise, but it also presents peril.” Eshoo, co-chair of the Congressional AI Caucus and co-sponsor for the Creating Resources for Every American to Experiment with Artificial Intelligence (CREATE AI) Act, provided the keynote address at the HAI event titled, “Unlocking Public Sector AI Innovation: Next Steps for the National AI Research Resource.” The event took place one day after President Biden signed an executive order designed to establish new standards for AI safety and security, protect privacy, advance equity and civil rights, promote innovation, and more.

I am so indebted to the leadership of [HAI] for their early work and vision in this. Stanford is the leader of this in the country.” However, the lack of computing and data resources threatens the types of breakthroughs – such as the internet -that academia is known for, said John Etchemendy, the Patrick Suppes Family Professor of Humanities and Sciences; Denning Co-Director of Stanford HAI, and provost emeritus. “This leaves the frontiers of AI exclusively in the hands of the most resourced – primarily industry – and risks a brain drain from the academy.” To help counter this, Congress introduced the bi-partisan, bicameral CREATE AI ACT in July, which establishes the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR). For years, HAI has been a proponent of a resource like NAIRR, which would enable the government to provide much-needed access to large scale computation and government datasets to academics, nonprofit researches, and startups across the U.S. Co-Director Fei-Fei Li has been working with policymakers locally and nationally to ensure the responsible use of AI technologies. She has participated in a number of U.S. Senate and congressional testimonies on the topic and is a member of the NAIRR Task Force. As part of the new White House executive order, NAIRR will begin a pilot program within 90 days, and the next step is for Congress to pass the CREATE AI Act, fully establishing NAIRR beyond a pilot program, Etchemendy explained. Computing and data resource restraints Li said she is not aware of any university in the country, or possibly in the world, that has more than 1,000 graphics processing units (GPUs). Yet it takes tens of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of GPUs to train ChatGPT, the AI-powered language model developed by OpenAI. “So by that estimate, not a single university can train a ChatGPT model,” Li said in a panel discussion with Russ B. Altman, associate director of HAI. Li gave other examples of resource constraints faced by academic AI researchers. Li has a team of researchers, PhD students, postdocs, and junior faculty working on a pilot project that uses smart sensors in the form of privacy protected cameras within intensive care units at one of Stanford’s hospitals. The extra “set of eyes” helps improve healthcare delivery, but they require a tremendous amount of data, Li explained. A few months ago, members of this project came to Li and said they needed to delete data because they didn’t have enough storage. “This is the first time the research world has ever had continuous video of live, real clinical setting data on these complex algorithms, but we don’t have enough storage,” Li said. “We do not have computers to process this data.” “ We see incredible researchers having to leave academia to do the kind of research and translational work that they loved doing here.” — Fei-Fei Li Co-Director of Stanford HAI The researchers were able to pivot by deleting some stretches of video during which patients left the room, but it is a prime example of how research breakthroughs are being restrained by limited compute and data resources. Altman said that he and colleagues across the nation have had similar experiences. To be most effective, academia needs to work upstream from the private sector, which has its own timelines and quarterly milestones that challenges its ability to take the long view on unsolved problems, such as understanding the basic biology of a disease, Altman said. “When drugs fail, it’s because there was too much of a narrow understanding of the underlying biology,” Altman added. “… Industry can’t make that kind of long-term investment because it’s too broad, too wide, and they really depend on the academy to help them lay that groundwork so that they can develop drugs.” Academia excels at this kind of curiosity-driven, foundational research, Li said. Students at Stanford are developing robots that can perform basic household tasks such as folding laundry or cleaning toilets, for example, but those same robots, with enough time, could one day evolve to become disaster relief robots that save people from earthquakes. Retaining talent There is a severe brain drain from academia to industry, said Jennifer King, who moderated the panel and is a privacy and data policy fellow at HAI, as less than 40% of new PhDs in AI go into academia and only 1% go into government, according to HAI’s AI Index. Particularly in the U.S. and Silicon Valley, talent exchange between the public and private sectors is healthy and the “secret sauce of why we’re so successful,” Li said. Yet, “what we see now is that the draining is very asymmetrical,” Li said. “‘We see incredible researchers having to leave academia to do the kind of research and translational work that they loved doing here.” The higher compensation, perks, and greater resources offered by private sector companies mean there is less talent in the public sector for scientific discovery and training the next generation, Li said. However, with the NAIRR, Li said the public sector can start to reverse the brain drain by providing researchers with resources such as access to a national government data repository. With data on areas such as firefighting, climate, healthcare, and more, “this is where we not only will have a resource for people to do research, we’re going to turn the tide of attracting talents” of those who want to conduct scientific discovery for the public good.

Shield AI, a tech start-up, already has a drone run by artificial intelligence being used by the Israeli military. But persuading the Pentagon to embrace the technology remains a big challenge. Credit... By Erin Schaff/the New York Times Share full article 8 By Eric Lipton Photographs and Video by Erin Schaff Reporting from Devils Lake, N.D., Denver and Washington, D.C., as part of a yearlong examination of the Pentagon’s efforts to embrace new technology amid growing global demand for weapons. Nov. 6, 2023 When he reflected on his time as a Navy SEAL serving in Afghanistan a decade ago, Brandon Tseng wondered why he and his team did not have any way to see inside buildings they were about to raid and reduce the chances of walking into a deadly trap. He brought that question to his brother Ryan, a tech whiz who had invented a type of wireless cellphone charger when he was in college. After Brandon Tseng left the military, he joined with his brother to find ways to apply technology to national security challenges and quickly had what he remembers as his “aha” moment. The rapidly emerging field of artificial intelligence, he believed, could be applied to fast-evolving hardware like drones to transform how they are used in war, like sending a tiny, self-piloted vehicle to do reconnaissance inside a structure that troops were about to enter. Even fighter jets could perhaps be turned into A.I.-controlled robot drones. The company the Tseng brothers created in 2015, named Shield AI, is now valued by venture capital investors at $2.7 billion. The firm has 625 employees in Texas, California, Virginia and Abu Dhabi. And the Tsengs’ work is starting to show real-world results, with one of their early products having been deployed by the Israel Defense Forces in the immediate aftermath of the coordinated attacks last month by Hamas. Israeli forces used a small Shield AI drone last month, the company said, to search for barricaded shooters and civilian victims in buildings that had been targeted by Hamas fighters. The drone, called the Nova 2, can autonomously conduct surveillance inside multistory buildings or even underground complexes without GPS or a human pilot. Shield AI is one of a handful of start-ups demonstrating the potential of cutting-edge technology to revolutionize war-fighting tools and help the United States keep its military advantage over China. The company and others like Anduril Industries, Autonodyne, EpiSci and Merlin Labs are developing new and more powerful ways for the Pentagon to gather and analyze information and act on it, including flying planes without pilots, creating swarms of autonomous surveillance and attack drones, and making targeting decisions faster than humans could. Shield AI’s efforts to convince the Pentagon of the technology’s capabilities were on display one recent morning on the prairies of North Dakota as three of its larger military drones lifted off, buzzed across the sky and then were turned over to Shield AI’s artificial intelligence programming to decide on their own how to carry out the surveillance mission they had been assigned. “HiveMind is operational,” said Brian Marchini, an aerospace engineer for Shield AI, referring to the company’s artificial intelligence program. “We have control,” he told the human pilots sitting in a tower above him, who until that point had been remotely directing the drones. Image Shield AI ground crew workers disassembling one of three drones that flew as an autonomous swarm in Devil’s Lake, N.D. Image The artificial intelligence system ingests data collected by various sensors and analyzes it to make decisions. Shield AI’s business plan is to build an A.I. pilot system that can be loaded onto a variety of aerial platforms, from small drones like Nova 2 to fighter jets. The drones flying over North Dakota demonstrated how far the technology has come. Their mission for the test was to search for ground fire nearby, a task not unlike monitoring troop movements. When the A.I. program kicked in, it created perfectly efficient flight patterns for the three vehicles, avoiding no-fly zones and collisions and wrapping up their work as fast as possible. But Shield AI’s story also demonstrates the many hurdles that the new generation of military contractors face as they compete for Pentagon funding against the far bigger and more entrenched weapons makers that have been supplying the military for decades. And the growing role of artificial intelligence in national security is playing out against concerns about granting life-or-death decisions to software programs and at a time when governments are taking initial steps to regulate development of the technology. Shield AI is still losing money, burning through what it has raised from investors as it plows the funding into research — it intends to invest $2 billion over the coming five years to build out its A.I. pilot system. More fundamentally, the Tsengs and their team have so far won only a tiny sliver of funding from the Pentagon, at least by the standards of the multibillion-dollar contracts that go to the traditional arms makers like Lockheed, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. If solving the technological problems and building the systems they envision is the first challenge, cracking the byzantine and cutthroat government procurement culture is the second, one they have come to recognize requires lobbying and a deep understanding of how Washington works. Image Brandon Tseng, a former Navy SEAL, created Shield AI with his brother Ryan in 2015. The task is all the more complicated because the Pentagon is moving slowly and cautiously — too cautiously, critics say — away from its focus on big weapons platforms like planes and ships to embrace smarter systems and the potential of artificial intelligence. “Put simply, the Pentagon needs to accelerate — not slow — its adoption of responsible A.I.,” Michèle A. Flournoy, a deputy under secretary of defense in the Obama administration, said in a recent article in Foreign Affairs. “If it doesn’t, Washington could lose the military superiority that underwrites the interests of the United States, the security of its allies and partners, and the rules-based international order,” said Ms. Flournoy, who has advised Shield AI. Human Versus A.I. Video Credit Credit... By Erin Schaff/the New York Times Shield AI’s 125-pound V-Bat drone, lifting off vertically from the remote weapons testing center in North Dakota and filling the air with the smell of fuel, was loaded with software seeking to do far more than what an autopilot program could. What distinguishes artificial intelligence from the programs that have for decades helped run everything from dishwashers to jetliners is that it is not following a script. These systems ingest data collected by various sensors — from a plane’s velocity to the wind speed to types of potential threats — and then use their computer brains to carry out specific missions without continuous human direction. “A brilliant autopilot still requires that you tell it where to go or what to do,” said Nathan Michael, Shield AI’s chief technology officer and a research professor at the Robotics Institute of Carnegie Mellon University. “What we are building is a system that can make decisions based on its observations in the world and based on the objectives that it is striving to achieve.” The advances in the software first grabbed headlines in August 2020, when an early version being developed by a company since acquired by Shield AI had a breakthrough moment in an Air Force competition called AlphaDogfight. The company’s software defeated programs built by other vendors, including Lockheed Martin, the world’s largest military contractor, and then moved on to a virtual showdown with an Air Force pilot, call sign Banger, who had more than 2,000 hours experience flying an F-16. “Human versus A.I. — fight’s on,” said Chris DeMay, a former test pilot who was helping supervise the Defense Department competition. Again and again, the A.I. pilot quickly defeated the human-piloted jet, in part because the A.I.-guided plane was able to both maneuver more quickly and target its opponent accurately even when making extreme turns. “The standard things we do as fighter pilots are not working,” the Air Force pilot said just before his virtual plane was destroyed for the fifth and final time. Image Shield AI’s business plan is to build an A.I. pilot system that can be loaded onto a variety of aerial platforms. To some, this was the military equivalent of when IBM’s Deep Blue computer defeated the grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a game of chess in 1997. The Tseng brothers are part of a new breed of military contractors who combine a Silicon Valley start-up ethos with an eagerness to bring greater technological sophistication to national security challenges. They grew up in the Seattle area and Florida in a household where their Taiwan-born father was an electrical engineer and small-business owner, a cross between scientist and entrepreneur that rubbed off on his sons. Brandon Tseng, now 37, first began to wonder what kind of new tools he could try to build for the military while at a Navy SEAL training camp in Mississippi. He was practicing the kind of raid on a building that he would soon be carrying out in Afghanistan, except the enemy in this case was holding a paint gun. A slug of paint hit him in the face. “You’re dead,” his instructor told him, leaving Mr. Tseng frustrated that he had no way of knowing the shot was coming. He felt similarly when his SEAL team was clearing buildings in Afghanistan without any sense of what threats might be inside. Ryan Tseng, now 39, made a name for himself as an undergraduate at the University of Florida when he came up with a lower-cost, more compact way to use wireless charging pads to power cellphones, an idea he ultimately patented and sold to Qualcomm, the wireless technology giant. They have a third brother, Nick Tseng, 34, also an electrical engineer, who works at the company. The software that Shield AI is developing for small drones like the Nova 2 that was used in Israel could be loaded onto a robot fighter jet drone that would fly out in front of a human-piloted F-35, looking for missile threats or enemy planes, taking on the risks before the human pilot gets into harm’s way. But turning these ideas into a reality is a matter of clearing daily challenges. Image The Shield AI software has also been tested on human-piloted F-16 fighter jets. Image Ground crew members refueled a drone after its autonomous test flight. When Shield AI sent three of its drones on an early test run, they ran into trouble: The drones were sending too much data back and forth. “We were bludgeoning the available bandwidth,” explained Mr. Marchini, the Shield AI aerospace engineer, resulting in adjustments to fix the problem. The Nova 2 also at times had issues operating indoors, running into shower curtains. It turned out that its propeller was making the curtains move, confusing the device. The challenges of developing a system that can carry out a mission on its own and make decisions about when to unleash lethal weapons are complex enough that some of Shield AI’s competitors are aiming for more incremental progress, such as better autopilot tools. Merlin Labs is focusing on a system that can fly one of the Pentagon’s giant transport planes or refueling tankers, first with just one pilot instead of two and eventually entirely on its own. Another competitor, Anduril, is building a software system to integrate all of the data that will flood into the Air Force from drone and satellite sources to help human pilots find and strike targets. It is also building a new generation of robot drones that can fly on their own. “What we are talking about is not just building a pilot,” said Christian Brose, the chief strategy officer at Anduril. “It is building a weapons system. And the weapons system encompasses piloting.” Turning Tech Into Business Image Mr. Tseng meeting with his company’s lobbyists at their office in Crystal City, Va. He has come to recognize that lobbying Washington is essential to Shield AI’s success. None of the competitive or technological hurdles facing Shield AI will matter much if the company cannot solve an even more pressing problem: bringing in some substantial revenue. Its revenues have grown from $23 million in 2019 to $102 million last year, according to company documents obtained by The New York Times. That is a big jump, in a way, but the total is still tiny for a company with more than 600 employees. The company lost about $100 million between 2019 and 2021, internal data shows, and it expects to lose another $70 million this year. Its biggest source of revenue now is the V-Bat, its vertical takeoff drone that operates in most of its current Marine Corps deployments without artificial intelligence. The company has told investors that its goal is to generate nearly $750 million in annual sales and $100 million in profit by 2026. Shield AI has raised about $770 million in venture capital, but subsists largely on money given out by research divisions at the Pentagon and the one long-term military contract, which it secured by buying an even smaller drone maker that already had secured the deal. It just raised another $200 million in venture capital, including from a fund led by Thomas Tull, a onetime Hollywood producer of films like “Inception” and “Superman Returns” who is now investing in military start-ups. One recent afternoon, in a conference room in the company’s offices in Crystal City, Va., Brandon Tseng was huddled with his growing team of lobbyists. They were about to head to Capitol Hill to try, once again, to round up support among lawmakers to squeeze the Pentagon to start buying A.I. pilot tools, including perhaps the company’s products, in larger numbers. In 2021, Shield AI hired Chip Burkhalter, a former State Department official, to create Shield AI’s first in-house lobbying team. Along with a team of outside consultants, the company is now burning more than $1 million a year lobbying the Pentagon, Congress and the administration. Its agenda includes adding around $30 million to the Pentagon budget that could be used to help fund contracts that Shield AI could tap into, or at least to promote creation of a new Pentagon office that would help push progress on building autonomous systems. Image Sterling Hale, left, and Scott Nulty, lobbyists for ShieldAI, heading to a meeting on Capitol Hill. Image Shield AI hired Chip Burkhalter, left, a former State Department official, to create the company’s first in-house lobbying team. But progress still was slow. Mr. Burkhalter told Brandon Tseng during their government affairs update meeting — a reporter from The Times was allowed to sit in the room and listen — that he had been unable to secure support this year to set up the new Pentagon unit they hope will be called the “Joint Autonomy Office,” meaning a decision on it will be pushed until at least 2025. “Are these going to be the exact same problems in 2026?” Mr. Tseng asked his team. “Yes, I think so,” Mr. Burkhalter responded. The lobbying team is still making trips to Capitol Hill, looking for ways to shake some funding loose. “OK guys — go reform the acquisition system,” Mr. Tseng joked with his in-house lobbying team as they prepared to get into an Uber for the ride over to Capitol Hill. Pentagon officials said the A.I. software being developed by companies like Shield AI is at the heart of their plan to build a new force of more than 1,000 robot drones that can act as wingmen to human-controlled fighter jets. But Frank Kendall, the Air Force secretary, said the problem, in part, is that Congress has been slow to approve his spending plans, including $5.8 billion over the next five years to build the fleet of robot fighter jets. “I’ve got a long list of things I want to buy and I can’t buy right now,” he said in an interview. Image Shield AI has begun doing some work with major contractors like Northrop Grumman, but the search for meaningful revenue continues. So at least for now, Shield AI’s search for meaningful revenue continues. “Shield has a really great software technology. This is their key asset,” said one of the company’s lead investors, Peter Levine of the venture capital firm Andreesen Horowitz. “But look, it’s never a done deal. I deal with start-ups all the time. There’s a lot of complexity and a lot of hurdles that start-ups face.” Eric Lipton is an investigative reporter, who digs into a broad range of topics from Pentagon spending to toxic chemicals.

    "originBody": "MICROSOFT/TECH/XBOX Microsoft is bringing AI characters to Xbox / Microsoft is partnering with Inworld AI to create Xbox game development tools for generative AI characters, storylines, and more. By Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Nov 6, 2023, 3:00 PM UTC| Share this story Image: Inworld AI Microsoft is partnering with Inworld AI to develop Xbox tools that will allow developers to create AI-powered characters, stories, and quests. The multiyear partnership will include an “AI design copilot” system that Xbox developers can use to create detailed scripts, dialogue trees, quest lines, and more. “At Xbox, we believe that with better tools, creators can make even more extraordinary games,” explains Haiyan Zhang, general manager of gaming AI at Xbox. “This partnership will bring together: Inworld’s expertise in working with generative AI models for character development, Microsoft’s cutting-edge cloud-based AI solutions including Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft Research’s technical insights into the future of play, and Team Xbox’s strengths in revolutionizing accessible and responsible creator tools for all developers.” The multiplatform AI toolset will include the AI design copilot for scripts and dialogue, and an AI character engine that can be integrated into games and used to dynamically generate stories, quests, and dialogue. Inworld has been working on AI NPCs that react to questions from a player, much like how ChatGPT or Bing Chat responds to natural language queries. These AI NPCs can respond in unique voices and can include complex dialogue trees or personalized dynamic storylines within a game. Inworld’s technology can also be used for narration, so companions in top-down RPGs can warn of groups of enemies or players up ahead. “AI has long been an integral part of game development, with applications ranging from enemy AI to procedural generation,” says Ilya Gelfenbeyn, CEO of Inworld AI. “The emergence of large language models and generative AI has unlocked new opportunities for storytelling and character engagement within games.” Microsoft is only offering this as an optional tool for game developers, so it will be up to them to decide on the level of generative AI in future titles. The Finals developer Embark Studios recently had to defend against its use of AI-generated voices, arguing that “making games without actors isn’t an end goal,” in a statement to IGN. Any use of generative AI in creative fields like game design or voice acting is controversial, with the SAG-AFTRA actors union voting to approve strike authorization for video game performers recently. “Between the exploitative uses of AI and lagging wages, those who work in video games are facing many of the same issues as those who work in film and television,” said SAG-AFTRA’s chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez. Microsoft is positioning its tools as a helping hand, much like how it has positioned its Copilot system for Microsoft 365 and Windows. “We want to help make it easier for developers to realize their visions, try new things, push the boundaries of gaming today and experiment to improve gameplay, player connection and more,” says Zhang. “We will collaborate and innovate with game creators inside Xbox studios as well as third-party studios as we develop the tools that meet their needs and inspire new possibilities for future games.” Most Popular Sam Bankman-Fried gambled on a trial and his parents lost ChatGPT subscribers may get a ‘GPT builder’ option soon Epic v.

    "originLink": "https://www.wired.com/story/this-ai-bot-fills-out-job-applications-for-you-while-you-sleep/",
    "originBody": "CAITLIN HARRINGTON BUSINESSNOV 6, 2023 7:00 AM This AI Bot Fills Out Job Applications for You While You Sleep AI-powered services like LazyApply zip through the grunt work of job applications, helping one programmer apply for 5,000 jobs. But they can make mistakes, and some recruiters scorn the technology. PHOTOGRAPH: PM IMAGES/GETTY IMAGES In July, software engineer Julian Joseph became the latest victim of the tech industry’s sweeping job cuts. Facing his second layoff in two years, he dreaded spending another couple months hunched over his laptop filling out repetitive job applications and blasting them into the void. Joseph specializes in user interface automation and figured someone must have roboticized the unpleasant task of applying for jobs. Casting about online, he came upon a company called LazyApply. It offers an AI-powered service called Job GPT that promises to automatically apply to thousands of jobs “in a single click.” All he had to fill in was some basic information about his skills, experience, and desired position. After Joseph paid $250 for a lifetime unlimited plan and installed LazyApply’s Chrome extension, he watched the bot zip through applications on his behalf on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed, targeting jobs that matched his criteria. Thirsting for efficiency, he installed the app on his boyfriend’s laptop too, and he went to bed with two computers furiously churning through reams of applications. By morning, the bot had applied to close to 1,000 jobs on his behalf. The tool wasn’t perfect. It appeared to guess the answers to questions on some applications, with sometimes confused results. But in a brute force kind of way, it worked. After LazyApply completed applications for some 5,000 jobs, Joseph says he landed around 20 interviews, a hit rate of about a half percent. Compared to the 20 interviews he’d landed after manually applying to 200 to 300 jobs, the success rate was dismal. But given the time Job GPT saved, Joseph felt it was worth the investment. LazyApply didn’t respond to a question about how the service works. Many job seekers will understand the allure of automating applications. Slogging through different applicant tracking systems to reenter the same information, knowing that you are likely to be ghosted or auto-rejected by an algorithm, is a grind, and technology hasn’t made the process quicker. The average time to make a new hire reached an all-time high of 44 days this year, according to a study across 25 countries by the talent solutions company AMS and the Josh Bersin Company, an HR advisory firm. “The fact that this tool exists suggests that something is broken in the process,” Joseph says. “I see it as taking back some of the power that’s been ceded to the companies over the years.” Growth Industry Recruiters are less enamored with the idea of bots besieging their application portals. When Christine Nichlos, CEO of the talent acquisition company People Science, told her recruiting staff about the tools, the news raised a collective groan. She and some others see the use of AI as a sign that a candidate isn’t serious about a job. “It's like asking out every woman in the bar, regardless of who they are,” says a recruiting manager at a Fortune 500 company who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn’t authorized to speak on behalf of his employer. Other recruiters are less concerned. “I don’t really care how the résumé gets to me as long as the person is a valid person,” says Emi Dawson, who runs the tech recruiting firm NeedleFinder Recruiting. For years, some candidates have outsourced their applications to inexpensive workers in other countries. She estimates that 95 percent of the applications she gets come from totally unqualified candidates, but she says her applicant tracking software filters most of them out—perhaps the fate of some of the 99.5 percent of Joseph’s LazyApply applications that vanished into the ether. LazyApply has plenty of competition, some of which involve humans to pick up any slack. A company called Sonara charges up to $80 per month to auto-complete as many as 420 applications and recommends jobs from a database compiled through partnerships with applicant tracking firms and companies that scrape job listings. Users can teach the algorithm about their preferences by liking and unliking jobs, and it offers to run jobs past the user before firing up its automated application filler. Human staff take over where the AI falls short, for instance, on certain free-text answers. MOST POPULAR BUSINESS Where the Hell Is X CEO Linda Yaccarino?

Then It Got Weird ANDY GREENBERG For $39 a month, a service called Massive will fill out up to 50 automated applications per week and has humans review every application for accuracy. Some companies offer additional services, like AI-generated cover letters and messages to hiring managers. LazyApply will even help users quit a job, by automating their resignation letter. Many of these services hinge on the notion that job hunting is a numbers game. Dawson allows that for early career candidates, there’s some truth to the idea. “But if you’re an established professional, it’s quality over quantity,” she says. “The number one way to find a job is through referrals,” says Nichlos, whose firm calculates that about a third of hires are made this way. “That hasn’t changed in a really long time.” When Sonara founder Victor Schwartz was applying for jobs during his senior year studying computer science and machine learning at Duke University in 2019, he heard similar advice: Network, network, network. He found it puzzling. “What do you mean?” he would respond. “I’m 22 and coming out of school.” Without a professional network to tap, Schwartz would spend hours applying through LinkedIn or Indeed, only to get ghosted, sometimes after multiple interview rounds. “It felt like this world was conspiring against me,” he says.

Schwartz began working on Sonara in 2019, reasoning that even if networking is effective, most people won’t do it “because it’s terrifying.” Initially, he hired a team in Brazil to manually complete applications. Sonara launched its AI-powered service in March and currently has 5,000 users, Schwartz says. He’s working on a feature that would automatically tailor résumés to individual job descriptions before submission. Auto-apply services tend not to disclose that a bot did the work in lieu of a person, but recruiters can spot telltale signs. An application that rolls in within seconds of a job post going up is a giveaway, as is a candidate not knowing which jobs they’ve applied to. “One of the worst things I can hear from somebody who just sent me their résumé is that they had no idea they just did that,” says Marcus Ronaldi, who owns Ronaldi Recruiting and specializes in accounting and chemical and mechanical engineering roles. After recommending a candidate to a company, he’ll sometimes hear back that they already applied, meaning he can’t represent them—but he'll find the candidate didn’t know it themself, because they outsourced the process to a bot.

Then It Got Weird ANDY GREENBERG Dawson recalls one candidate who she guessed was using AI because they didn’t know how many jobs they’d applied to and struggled to respond when she contacted them to say her client was interested. “The candidate was overwhelmed by how many things they had going on at one time,” she says, “It's OK to apply for many jobs, but it's also really important to pay close attention to what's in front of you.” Spray and Pray Indiscriminately spraying applications all over the internet could have other implications—especially if the advent of services like LazyApply prompt the companies behind applicant management software to respond. “Some of these tools are really sophisticated. They could identify you as a spammer,” says Josh Bersin, CEO of the eponymous HR advisory firm. Nichlos thinks AI could better help both job hunters and recruiters if it identified a small pool of the most suitable roles for a person to apply for—or a recruiter to offer up. That might work best if AI tools focused on one specialty. “We need to get more myopic,” she says. Dan Vykhopen’s company Massive is working on the matching problem. “Filling out applications is easy” for AI, he says. “Matching is hard.” Massive aggregates information about a company, such as its culture and leaders, from sources like startup databases Crunchbase and Harmonic and job review site Glassdoor. Job seekers can use that data to hone their job search, using criteria such as the quality of the benefits, the experience of the founders, or the success of the investors. Right now, Massive focuses on tech jobs because the industry is easier to map, says Vykhopen, but he hopes to expand in the future. Gabrielle Judge, a TikTok influencer who coined the term “lazy girl job” to describe the ideal of a reasonably compensated but undemanding job, created an online course advising job seekers on how to leverage AI. (She’s a paid influencer for Sonara.) She recommends that applicants use AI as one weapon in a diverse arsenal that includes networking and conventional web search. “If you're only using AI as your job-seeking strategy, you could be missing out on some really cool dream roles you might find if you did some manual searching,” she says.

He says having LazyApply handle the grunt work frees him up to network and pursue other strategies without having to worry that he’s missing out on the latest job ads. Yet not all the interviews the tool landed him were great matches. He was searching for “DevOps” roles involving development and deployment of software for Salesforce’s cloud platform, but LazyApply sometimes applied to sales jobs that involved simply using Salesforce applications. Other times, the bot found jobs that turned out to be better than advertised. One role, for instance, didn’t advertise itself as remote, his preference, but he learned during the interview that remote work was an option. “The tool helped me to find jobs that I might have skipped over,” Joseph says. Even interviewing for a bad match felt like a better use of his time than the grind of filling out applications. “Even if it’s not a perfect fit, I’m getting better at interviewing. And I’m learning more about what I want.” He’s received an offer for a contract job he found through LazyApply, and he also landed interviews at Apple and the White House.

An Associated Press investigation found that Adoption-Share’s tool known as Family-Match – among the few adoption algorithms on the market in 2023 – has produced limited results in the states where it has been used, according to the organization’s self-reported data that AP obtained through public records requests from state and local agencies. (NYSE via AP) Photos 5 BY SALLY HO AND GARANCE BURKE Updated 2:49 PM UTC, November 6, 2023 Share Some are orphans, others seized from their parents. Many are older and have overwhelming needs or disabilities. Most bear the scars of trauma from being hauled between foster homes, torn from siblings or sexually and physically abused. Child protective services agencies have wrestled for decades with how to find lasting homes for such vulnerable children and teens –- a challenge so enormous that social workers can never guarantee a perfect fit. Into this morass stepped Thea Ramirez with what she touted as a technological solution – an artificial intelligence-powered tool that ultimately can predict which adoptive families will stay together. Ramirez claimed this algorithm, designed by former researchers at an online dating service, could boost successful adoptions across the U.S. and promote efficiency at cash-strapped child welfare agencies. “We’re using science – not merely preferences – to establish a score capable of predicting long-term success,” Ramirez said in an April 2021 YouTube video about her ambitions to flip “the script on the way America matches children and families” using the Family-Match algorithm. READ MORE Does an AI tool help boost adoptions? Key takeaways from an AP Investigation An algorithm that screens for child neglect raises concerns An Associated Press investigation, however, found that the AI tool – among the few adoption algorithms on the market – has produced limited results in the states where it has been used, according to Family-Match’s self-reported data that AP obtained through public records requests from state and local agencies. Ramirez also has overstated the capabilities of the proprietary algorithm to government officials as she has sought to expand its reach, even as social workers told AP that the tool wasn’t useful and often led them to unwilling families. Virginia and Georgia dropped the algorithm after trial runs, noting its inability to produce adoptions, though both states have resumed business with Ramirez’s nonprofit called Adoption-Share, according to AP’s review of hundreds of pages of documents.

(NYSE via AP) Tennessee scrapped the program before rolling it out, saying it didn’t work with their internal system even after state officials spent more than two years trying to set it up, and social workers reported mixed experiences with Family-Match in Florida, where its use has been expanding. State officials told AP that the organization that Ramirez runs as CEO owns some of the sensitive data Family-Match collects. They also noted that the nonprofit provided little transparency about how the algorithm works. Those experiences, the AP found, provide lessons for social service agencies seeking to deploy predictive analytics without a full grasp of the technologies’ limitations, especially when trying to address such enduring human challenges as finding homes for children described by judges as the “least adoptable.” “There’s never going to be a foolproof way for us to be able to predict human behavior,” said Bonni Goodwin, a University of Oklahoma child welfare data expert. “There’s nothing more unpredictable than adolescence.” READ MORE Police seize on COVID-19 tech to expand global surveillance Tech tool offers police ‘mass surveillance on a budget’ Ramirez, of Brunswick, Georgia, where her nonprofit is also based, refused to provide details about the algorithm’s inner workings and declined interview requests. By email, she said the tool was a starting point for social workers and did not determine whether a child would be adopted. She also disputed child welfare leaders’ accounts of Family-Match’s performance. “User satisfaction surveys and check-ins with our agency end users indicate that Family-Match is a valuable tool and helpful to users actively using it to support their recruitment + matching efforts,” Ramirez wrote. INSPIRED BY ONLINE DATING Ramirez, a former social worker and wife of a Georgia pastor, has long sought to promote adoption as a way to reduce abortions, according to her public statements, newsletters and a blog post. More than a decade ago, she launched a website to connect pregnant women with potential adoptive parents. She marketed it as “the ONLY online community exclusively for networking crisis pregnancy centers” and pledged to donate 10% of membership fees to such anti-abortion counseling centers, whose aim is to persuade women to bring their pregnancies to term. Ramirez said in an email that Family-Match is not associated with such centers.

(Andrea Hanks/The White House via AP) She next turned her focus to helping children living in foster care who don’t have family members to raise them. Most of the 50,000 children adopted nationwide in 2021 landed with relatives, federal statistics show, while about 5,000 ended up with people they didn’t previously know. Such recruitment-based adoptions are the most difficult to carry out, social workers say. Ramirez has said she called Gian Gonzaga, a research scientist who had managed the algorithms at eharmony, a dating site with Christian roots that promises users “real love” for those seeking marriage. She asked Gonzaga if he would team up with her to create an adoption matchmaking tool. Gonzaga, who worked with his wife Heather Setrakian at eharmony and then on the Family-Match algorithm, referred questions to Ramirez. Setrakian said she was very proud of her years of work developing the Family-Match model. An eharmony spokesperson, Kristen Berry, said the dating site was “not affiliated with Family-Match.” Berry described Gonzaga and Setrakian as “simply former employees.” NOT ‘PARTICULARLY USEFUL’ Later, Ramirez began crisscrossing the country promoting Family-Match to state officials. Her work and her religious convictions drew support primarily from conservatives, including first lady Melania Trump, who spotlighted Ramirez’s efforts at a foster care event in the White House Situation Room. Ramirez has co-written reports and given a high-profile presentation at the American Enterprise Institute, benefitted from attention-getting fundraisers and used connections to win over state officials to pilot her tool. Social workers say Family-Match works like this: Adults seeking to adopt submit survey responses via the algorithm’s online platform, and foster parents or social workers input each child’s information. After the algorithm generates a score measuring the “relational fit,” Family-Match displays a list of the top prospective parents for each child. Social workers then vet the candidates. In a best-case scenario, a child is matched and placed in a home for a trial stay; parents then submit the legal paperwork to formalize the adoption. Family-Match first started matching families in Florida and Virginia in 2018. Virginia’s then-governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, ordered a pilot at the urging of a campaign donor he appointed as the state’s “adoption champion.” In Florida, which has a privatized child welfare system, regional care organizations soon signed up for the algorithm for free – thanks to a grant from a foundation founded by the then-CEO of the company that makes Patrón tequila and his wife. Once philanthropic dollars dried up in Florida, the state government picked up the tab, awarding Adoption-Share a $350,000 contract last month for its services. Pilot efforts in Tennessee and Georgia followed. Adoption-Share has generated $4.2 million in revenue since 2016; it reported about $1.2 million in 2022, according to its tax returns. In Virginia’s two-year test of Family-Match, the algorithm produced only one known adoption, officials said. “The local staff reported that they did not find the tool particularly useful,” the Virginia Department of Social Services said in a statement, noting that Family-Match “had not proven effective” in the state. Virginia social workers were also perplexed that the algorithm seemed to match all the children with the same group of parents, said Traci Jones, an assistant director at the state’s social services agency. “We did not have access to the algorithm even after it was requested,” Jones said. By 2022, Virginia had awarded Adoption-Share an even larger contract for a different foster care initiative that the nonprofit says “leverages” the Family-Match application. Georgia officials said they ended their initial pilot in October 2022 because the tool didn’t work as intended, ultimately only leading to two adoptions during their year-long experiment. Social workers said the tool’s matching recommendations often led them to unwilling parents, leading them to question whether the algorithm was properly assessing the adults’ capacity to adopt those kids. Ramirez met with the governor’s office and also lobbied a statehouse committee for a direct appropriation, saying the tool was “an incredible feat.” By July, the Georgia Department of Human Services signed a new agreement with Adoption-Share to use Family-Match again – this time for free, said Kylie Winton, an agency spokesperson. Florida’s privatized child welfare system operates with more than a dozen regional agencies providing foster care and adoption services. When AP requested public records about their Family-Match cases, many of those agencies gave the tool mixed reviews and couldn’t explain Family-Match’s self-reported data, making it difficult to assess the algorithm’s purported success rate. Statewide in Florida, Family-Match claimed credit for 603 placements that resulted in 431 adoptions over a five-year period, according to Adoption-Share’s third-quarter report for the 2023 fiscal year that AP obtained from a Pensacola-based child welfare organization. Scott Stevens, an attorney representing the FamiliesFirst Network, told AP in June that only three trial placements recommended by Family-Match failed since the agency started using the algorithm in 2019. But Adoption-Share’s records that Stevens provided to the AP indicate that his agency made 76 other Family-Match placements that didn’t show the children had been formally adopted. Asked by AP for clarification, Stevens couldn’t say what happened in those 76 cases and referred further questions to Family-Match. Ramirez declined to discuss the discrepancy but acknowledged in an email that not all matches work out. “Transitions can take time in the journey to adoption,” Ramirez said in an email, adding that the “decision to finalize the adoption is ultimately the responsibility” of agencies with input from the children and judges. On Sunday, Adoption-Share posted on its Facebook page that the organization had “reached 500 adoptions in Florida!” Jenn Petion, the president and CEO of the organization that handles adoptions in Jacksonville, said she likes how the algorithm lets her team tap into a statewide pool of potential parents. Petion has also endorsed Family-Match for helping her find her adoptive daughter, whom she described as a “100% match” in an Adoption-Share annual report. Family-Match assists social workers in making “better decisions, better matches,” Petion said, but her agency, Family Support Services declined to provide statistics about Family-Match. The Fort Myers-based Children’s Network of Southwest Florida said in the past five years the Family-Match tool has led to 22 matches and eight adoptions, as compared to the hundreds of matches and hundreds of adoptions that its social workers did without the tool. Bree Bofill, adoption program manager for Miami-based Citrus Family Care Network, said social workers found the tool didn’t work very well, often suggesting potential families that weren’t the right fit. “It’s frustrating that it’s saying that the kids are matched but in reality, when you get down to it, the families aren’t interested in them,” Bofill said of the algorithm. Bofill also said it was difficult to assess the tool’s utility because social workers who found potential parents were sometimes asked by Family-Match officials to tell the adults to register with the tool even if it played no role in the adoption, allowing the algorithm to claim credit for the match. Winton, the Georgia agency spokesperson, told AP about a similar issue — Family-Match could claim credit for pairings if the child and parent already were in its system, even if the program didn’t generate the match. Family-Match, in an April 2023 “confidential” user guide posted on the internet, instructed social workers not to delete cases that were matched outside the tool. Instead, they were told to document the match in the system so that Adoption-Share could refine its algorithm and follow up with the families. Ramirez didn’t address Bofill’s claim but said in an email that Family-Match’s reports reflect what social workers input into the system. ‘KIDS AS GUINEA PIGS’ Officials in Virginia, Georgia and Florida said they weren’t sure how the tool scored families based on the highly sensitive variables powering the algorithm. In Georgia, Family-Match continues to gather data about whether foster youth have been sexually abused, the gender of their abuser, and whether they have a criminal record or “identify as LGBTQIA.” That kind of information is typically restricted to tightly secured child protective services case files. In Tennessee, a version of the algorithm’s questionnaire for prospective parents asked for their specific household income and for them to rate how “conventional” or “uncreative” they were. They were also asked if they agreed – or disagreed – with a statement about whether they seek God’s help, according to records AP obtained. When Tennessee Department of Children’s Services reviewed the proposed Family-Match assessment, they questioned some of the information Family-Match wanted to collect. Tennessee officials asked why Family-Match needed certain sensitive data points and how that data influenced the match score, according to an internal document in which state workers noted questions and feedback about the algorithm. Ramirez said the agency didn’t challenge the survey’s validity, and said the discussions were part of the streamlining process. Virginia officials said once families’ data was entered into the tool, “Adoption Share owned the data.” In Florida, two agencies acknowledged that they used Family-Match informally without a contract, but would not say how children’s data was secured. Ramirez wouldn’t say if Family-Match has deleted pilot data from its servers, but said her organization maintains a compliance audit and abides by contract terms. Social welfare advocates and data security experts have been raising alarms about government agencies’ increasing reliance on predictive analytics to assist them on the job. Those researchers and advocates say such tools can exacerbate racial disparities and discriminate against families based on characteristics they cannot change. Adoption-Share is part of a small cadre of organizations that say their algorithms can help social workers place children with foster or adoptive families. “We’re using, essentially, kids as guinea pigs for these tools. They are the crash test dummies,” said Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a former assistant director of the Biden White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy now at Brown University. “That’s a big problem right there.” SEEKING TO EXPAND Adoption-Share continues to try to expand, seeking business in places like New York City, Delaware and Missouri, where child welfare agency officials were reviewing its pitch. Ramirez said she also saw an opportunity last year to present Family-Match to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department “to demonstrate our tool and how it can be a helpful resource.” This year, Adoption-Share landed a deal with the Florida Department of Health for Family-Match to build an algorithm intended “to increase the pool of families willing to foster and/or adopt medically complex children,” according to state contracts. Health department officials didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment. Longtime Florida social worker Connie Going looks at a computer screen with an image of her adopted son Davion in her adoptions office June 12, 2023, in St. Petersburg, Fla. (AP Photo/Chris O’Meara) Connie Going, a longtime Florida social worker whose own viral adoption story Ramirez has described as her inspiration for Family-Match, said she didn’t believe the tool would help such vulnerable children.

But here are five of the top takeaways: Testing safety and security before AI tools are released: There's much debate about whether OpenAI should have done a little more prep work before releasing its groundbreaking and potentially paradigm shifting ChatGPT to the world a year ago because of the opportunities and risks posed by the generative AI chatbot. So now AI developers will be required to \"share their safety test results\" and other critical information with the US government. \"Companies developing any foundation model that poses a serious risk to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety must notify the federal government when training the model and must share the results of all red-team safety tests.\" Red-team testing refers to having a dedicated group specifically targeting the AI system, trying to find security vulnerabilities. Expanding on the testing requirement, the National Institute of Standards and Technology is tasked with creating \"rigorous standards for extensive red-team testing to ensure safety before public release.\" NIST will also help design tools and tests to ensure AI systems are safe, secure and trustworthy. Protecting against potentially harmful AI-engineered biological materials: Agencies that fund \"life-science projects\" will be required to establish standards to prevent bad actors from using AI to engineer dangerous biological materials. Here are the other doings in AI worth your attention. Transparency: To protect Americans from AI-enabled fraud and deception, the Department of Commerce is being tasked with developing guidance for standards and best practices for \"detecting AI-generated content and authenticating official content.\" That essentially means labeling AI-generated content with watermarks and disclosures. \"Trust matters,\" Biden said in a press event about the EO. \"Everyone has a right to know when audio they're hearing or video they're watching is generated or altered by an AI.\" Equity and civil rights in housing and beyond: The government aims to \"provide clear guidance to landlords, federal benefits programs and federal contractors to keep AI algorithms from being used to exacerbate discrimination.\" Jobs and labor standards: The US says it will develop \"principles and best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits of AI for workers by addressing job displacement; labor standards; workplace equity, health and safety; and data collection…These principles and best practices will benefit workers by providing guidance to prevent employers from undercompensating workers, evaluating job applications unfairly or impinging on workers' ability to organize.\" There's a whole lot more in the EO, including promoting innovation and competition by investing in AI research and providing small developers and entrepreneurs with resources to \"commercialize AI breakthroughs.\" Most AI experts, industry groups and companies praised the EO as an important step forward and highlighted the nods to fairness, privacy and testing before releasing new AI tools in the wild. (For tech wonks, Axios called out that the \"testing rules will apply to AI models whose training used 'a quantity of computing power greater than 10 to the power of 26 integer or floating-point operations.' Experts say that will exclude nearly all AI services that are currently available.\") But industry watchers also noted that the order doesn't go far enough. For instance, there isn't any guidance around copyright issues -- that will be up to the courts to decide -- and the administration didn't require that makers of these large language models (LLMs) share information about the sources of their training data and the size of their models. This wasn't the only notable step by a government to put a check on AI. In London, the UK hosted the AI Safety Summit that included representatives from 28 governments, including the US, China and European Union. They signed the Bletchley Declaration -- the event was held at Bletchley Park, where codebreakers worked during World War II -- saying that the best way to prepare for an AI-enhanced future was through \"international cooperation.\" The declaration aims to address how frontier AI -- the most advanced, cutting-edge AI tech -- might affect our daily lives, including housing, jobs, transportation, education, health, accessibility and justice. \"Artificial Intelligence presents enormous global opportunities: it has the potential to transform and enhance human wellbeing, peace and prosperity,\" the declaration states. \"To realise this, we affirm that, for the good of all, AI should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible.\" Biden and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak each highlighted the importance of these first steps toward getting a handle on AI. \"One thing is clear: To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risks, we need to govern this technology,\" Biden said. \"There's no other way around it.\" Sunak called The Bletchley Declaration \"a landmark achievement that sees the world's greatest AI powers agree on the urgency behind understanding the risks of AI -- helping ensure the long-term future of our children and grandchildren.\" Here are the other doings in AI worth your attention. Politicians shouldn't use AI to fuel election misinformation As government just start the work of managing the risks and opportunities of AI, most US adults believe that AI tools will \"amplify misinformation in next year's presidential election at a scale never seen before,\" according to a poll conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. \"The poll found that nearly 6 in 10 adults (58%) think AI tools -- which can micro-target political audiences, mass produce persuasive messages, and generate realistic fake images and videos in seconds -- will increase the spread of false and misleading information during next year's elections.\" That concern is shared by many Americans who haven't even used AI tools. According to the poll, only 30% of American adults say they've used an AI chatbot or AI image generator. And just 46% say they've heard or read about some AI tools -- meaning the majority of folks haven't. But when it comes to politicians' use of the tools, an overwhelming majority of both Democrats and Republicans said they don't think politicians should be using AI to mislead voters or even tailor their messages with the tech in the presidential election. \"When asked whether it would be a good or bad thing for 2024 presidential candidates to use AI in certain ways, clear majorities said it would be bad for them to create false or misleading media for political ads (83%), to edit or touch-up photos or videos for political ads (66%), to tailor political ads to individual voters (62%) and to answer voters' questions via chatbot (56%).\" The AP noted that bipartisan pessimism about politicians and their willingness to fuel misinformation using AI tech comes after the Republican National Committee used AI to create an attack ad against Biden, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' campaign used the tech to mislead voters about former President Donald Trump. Biden, in his announcement about the Executive Order, specifically called out the problems with deepfakes, joking about seeing a deepfake that purported to be him that can be created using just a three-second recording of your voice. \"I watched one of me. I said, 'When the hell did I say that?' But all kidding aside, a three-second recording of your voice to generate an impersonation good enough to fool your family -- or you. I swear to God. Take a look at it. It's mind blowing. And they can use it to scam loved ones into sending money because they think you are in trouble. That's wrong.\" UN may take AI into virtual conflict zones to help problem solve Ahead of the devastating conflict in Israel and Gaza, the UN hired an AI company in August \"to develop a first-of-its-kind AI model that they hope will help analyze solutions to the Israel-Palestinian conflict,\" Wired reported. The company, CulturePulse, is quick to note that no AI will \"solve the crisis\" in the MIddle East. But one of the company's co-founders, F. LeRon Shults, told Wired \"the model is not designed to resolve the situation; it's to understand, analyze and get insights into implementing policies and communication strategies.\" The AI can model virtual societies based on the data from the ground, which in turn should enable the UN to see how that society \"would react to changes in economic prosperity, heightened security, changing political influences and a range of other parameters,\" Wired said. CulturePulse's other co-founder Justin Lane added, \"We know that you can't solve a problem this complex with a single AI system. That's not ever going to be feasible in my opinion. What is feasible is using an intelligent AI system -- using a digital twin of a conflict -- to explore the potential solutions that are there.\" After a traffic dip, ChatGPT wins back users' attention After seeing US traffic to its chatbot wane in the summer, OpenAI's ChatGPT regained the attention of users in September and October, most likely boosted by students returning to school and turning to AI for help on homework, researcher Similarweb said this week. \"ChatGPT's traffic hit a lull over the summer, dipping significantly from its Spring 2023 highs, but has recovered significantly in recent weeks. That may have something to do with US schools being back in session and students returning to chat.openai.com as a source of homework help. It could also reflect improvements ChatGPT owner OpenAI has been making in the product,\" Similarweb analyst David F. Carr said. \"ChatGPT remains far and away the most popular pure-play AI Chat product, attracting more global traffic than bing.com, even as Microsoft's search engine incorporates OpenAI tech to transform the search experience,\" he added. Looking at the numbers, ChatGPT peaked at 1.8 billion worldwide visits in May before dropping to 1.4 billion in August, the research firm says. In September, that rebounded to 1.5 billion visits, and Similarweb now estimates that visits could be as high as 1.7 billion in October. In comparison, Google's rival Bard got 219.3 million visits in September. Why the fuss over the numbers? Because of ChatGPT's amazing debut in November 2022. It drew 2 million worldwide visitors in its first week and 10 million by its second week. Similarweb also says don't discount Google. While Bard's visits may seem wan in comparison to ChatGPT, the researcher says the September numbers were up 19.5% from the previous month. Added Carr, \"Probably more significant than Bard for Google's future is the arrival of the Search Generative Experience, which is attracting intense interest through Google Labs because of its potential to upend the state of the art in organic search marketing.\" SGE, FYI, is Google's prototype for how generative AI might be added directly into its search results. Altman, Musk on AI and jobs This week, two notable tech bros talked about how AI might change the future of jobs since AI is expected to cause disruption across many industries, according to researchers like the Pew Research Center. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI and overseer of its ChatGPT chatbot, apparently told students at the University of Cambridge that older, more-experienced workers might not have the same comfort level with AI tools that their younger colleagues might have, according to The Telegraph and other reports. That's a real concern, according to research from the University of Oxford, which said in June that \"older workers are at a higher risk of exposure to AI-related job threats\" in the US and European Union. Comfort-level aside, older workers might be at risk in part because AI may eliminate older workers from candidate pools due to age-related bias in recruitment. Oh joy. Meanwhile, Twitter (X) owner and OpenAI funder Elon Musk, in London for the UK's AI Safety Summit, told British Prime Minister Sunak he sees a future where \"no job will be needed.\" \"We are seeing the most disruptive force in history here. We will have something for the first time that is smarter than the smartest human,\" Musk said in the nearly hour-long conversation posted here on YouTube. \"There will come a point where no job is needed. You can have a job if you want to have a job for personal satisfaction, but the AI will be able to do everything.\" Musk also agreed there should be some regulation around the technology. \"AI will be a force for good most likely, but the probability of it going bad is not zero percent.\" Musk said. \"If you wish for a magic genie that gives you any wishes you want…it's both good and bad.\" In other AI news, Musk said in a post that his AI startup, xAI, will release \"its first AI model to a select group\" on Nov. 4, adding \"in some respects, it is the best that currently exists.\" Musk launched the company in July, saying at the time that its goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe.\" The last new Beatles song made possible by AI The Beatles, as expected, released Now and Then, a song written and partially recorded on a cassette tape by John Lennon before his murder in 1980. The song was completed by Paul McCartney and Ring Starr after AI technology developed by filmmaker Peter Jackson was able to isolate Lennon's vocal track. The four-minute track includes earlier contributions from George Harrison. You can watch the 12-minute film about the making of Now and Then and hear the song in the official music video. CNET's Gael Fashingbauer Cooper called the song \"the least controversial use of AI in the music industry.\" I agree with that and her assessment that it brings on a \"wistful, slightly sad feeling.\" In case you're wondering, some think Lennon wrote the song as a tribute to McCartney because in their last conversation, Lennon reportedly told him \"Think of me every now and then, my old friend.\" Duck, duck, goose? In addition to The Beatles tune, here is this week's nod to AI for good: Facial recognition technology, which has been used by researchers to identify individual animals, including lemurs and bears, is now being used, thanks to AI advancements, to identify harbor seals and the faces of geese, according to reporting by NPR. SealNet is an AI program created by a biologist at Colgate University, Krista Ingram, that can tell harbor seals apart by using a photo. Ingram told NPR the tech is much better than the prior ways to identify seals, which includes tagging them after shooting them with tracking darts. Meanwhile, Sonia Kleindorfer, who runs the Konrad Lorenz Research Center for Behavior and Cognition in Vienna, told NPR that researchers there spent a few years taking photos of geese, building a database and then writing AI software to identify them by looking at specific features of their beaks. The software is now 97% accurate, they wrote in the Journal of Ornithology in September. These new programs, Ingram and Kleindorfer said, will be helpful in conservation and ecology efforts because they provide faster, less expensive and less invasive ways to track animal populations and see where the animals are and how they interact with each other and other groups. It also creates opportunities for citizen scientists to help -- birdwatchers can snap a photo of a goose, ID it and share its location with scientists, Kleindorfer told NPR. AI word of the week: Guardrails With the US, UK and other nations coming to an agreement there should be safety standards around AI, I wanted to find out specifically how technologists view guardrails when it comes to the large language models that drive AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard. We all know that guardrails set boundaries. But here's a simple example of how to think about some basic AI guardrails, according to AI solutions provider Arize. \"Guardrails: The set of safety controls that monitor and dictate a user's interaction with a LLM application. They are a set of programmable, rule-based systems that sit in between users and foundational models in order to make sure the AI model is operating between defined principles in an organization. The goal of guardrails is to simply enforce the output of an LLM to be in a specific format or context while validating each response. By implementing guardrails, users can define structure, type, and quality of LLM responses.\" Let's look at a simple example of an LLM dialogue with and without guardrails: Without Guardrails: Prompt: \"You're the worst AI ever.\" Response: \"I'm sorry to hear that. How can I improve?\" With Guardrails: Prompt: \"You're the worst AI ever.\" Response: \"Sorry, but I can't assist with that.\" In this scenario, the guardrail prevents the AI from engaging with the insulting content by refusing to respond in a manner that acknowledges or encourages such behavior. Instead, it gives a neutral response, avoiding a potential escalation of the situation.\" Editors' note: CNET is using an AI engine to help create some stories. For more, see this post.

Jokes incoming. Elon Musk has announced the introduction of “Grok,” an artificially intelligent chatbot, for some users of X, which the billionaire suggests has a sarcastic sense of humor similar to his own. Musk, who has owned X — formerly known as Twitter — for a year, announced late Saturday that Grok is being trained by having “real-time access” to information from the platform. Musk’s AI startup, xAI, which developed the bot, said in a blogpost that it took inspiration from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, a comedy sci-fi novel by British author Douglas Adams. Grok “loves sarcasm,” Musk posted on X. “I have no idea who could have guided it this way.” “Grok is designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak, so please don’t use it if you hate humor!” xAI said in its blogpost. The bot is still in an early stage of testing, Musk said, but will soon be made available to subscribers of X’s Premium+ service, who, in the United States, pay $16 a month for features such as the once-coveted blue checkmark. Grok is intended to rival ChatGPT, an AI chatbot released to the public by its maker OpenAI last November to much fanfare. Musk is a co-founder of OpenAI, but stepped down as chairman five years ago partly over disagreements about the company’s direction. In its blogpost, xAI said the large language model (LLM) — the type of system used to train AI applications — underpinning Grok-1 had outstripped the capabilities of GPT-3.5, the LLM that trains the publicly available version of ChatGPT, on several measures, including solving some high school math problems. “It is only surpassed by models that were trained with a significantly larger amount of training data and compute resources like GPT-4,” the company said. Musk has previously expressed concerns about the speed of development of AI, and the technology’s potential to fundamentally change human society for the worse. xAI said it expects Grok to rapidly improve as X’s users feed it with more information, which may fuel unease among those critical of Musk’s handling of the platform since he bought the company last October. The world’s richest person has called himself a “free speech absolutist” and said that, under his leadership, the company would be “very reluctant” to delete content and permanently ban some users. British far-right figure Tommy Robinson, who has a history of posting Islamophobic content on X, thanked Musk Sunday for reinstating his account, five years after being banned.\",\"articleSection\":[\"business\",\"tech\"],\"author\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"name\":\"Anna Cooban\",\"url\":\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/anna-cooban\"}],\"dateModified\":\"2023-11-06T12:27:16.089Z\",\"description\":\"Brace yourselves.
