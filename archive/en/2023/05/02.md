- Geoffrey Hinton, a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI) development and known as 'The Godfather of A.I.,' has left Google and warns of potential dangers with the AI technology he helped develop.
- Hinton expresses concerns about the possibility of the algorithms behind chatbots, like ChatGPT, becoming too sophisticated and eventually leading to unpredictable behavior that could be harmful.
- Hinton's departure from Google suggests a shift towards prioritizing ethical considerations and caution when it comes to further AI development.

- Language Model AI (LLM) technology poses a potential risk from bad actors manipulating information, causing falsehoods and manipulating people's opinions.
- Liability frameworks need to be established to hold individuals and companies accountable for harm caused by AI, and there must be competent supervision across both AI and human-generated media.

## [Significant breakthrough in search for Parkinson's biomarker](https://www.michaeljfox.org/publication/michael-j-fox-foundation-announces-significant-breakthrough-search-parkinsons-biomarker)

- A new biological test, called the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (Î±Syn-SAA), can now identify Parkinson's pathology by examining spinal fluid from living patients, with over 90% sensitivity in people with typical Parkinson's pathology, even before onset of symptoms.
- The test detects synuclein pathology, one of the two biological hallmarks of Parkinson's disease (alongside dopaminergic transport dysfunction), providing a novel tool for precision medicine approaches, earlier intervention, and improved clinical trial design.
- With the ability to establish objective endpoints for clinical trials of Parkinson's treatments, the test will decrease the risk for industry to invest in potential blockbuster therapies, including preventive agents, and increase the speed and efficiency with which these therapies can be developed, tested, and brought to market.

## [A bacterial culprit for rheumatoid arthritis?](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/a-bacterial-culprit-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-71088)

- Researchers have identified a strain of Subdoligranulum bacteria that may drive the development of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).
- Identifying this bacterium was the result of extensive research as researchers screened blood from people at risk for RA or with early- stage RA for RA- related autoantibodies.
- Mice given this bacterium developed a condition similar to human RA, and scientists have found that this bacterium produced RA- like symptoms in mice without the addition of another immune insult, making it unique among associated bacteria.

- Antibiotics have shown promise in alleviating symptoms of sarcoidosis and RA, but more research needed to confirm a causal link
- Gut biome may play a significant role in autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's disease and uveitis

## [Geoffrey Hinton leaves Google and can now speak freely about his AI concern](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23706311/hinton-godfather-of-ai-threats-fears-warnings)

- Geoffrey Hinton, one of the "Godfathers of AI" who won the 2018 Turing Award for his work on neural networks, has left his job at Google to speak freely about his concerns of AI risks.
- Hinton is concerned about the spread of fake imagery and text, as well as the potential elimination of rote jobs, and believes that AI could eventually write and run its own code, possibly resulting in the end of humanity.
- Hinton was largely happy with Google's stewardship of technology until Microsoft launched Bing, compelling Google to respond in kind, which he believes could lead to a world where "nobody will be able to tell what is true anymore.".

### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35771508)

- There is a debate about the accuracy of the reporting between The Verge article and the NYT article it was based on, with some arguing that the latter was misleading.
- Hinton's departure and comments seem to be linked to concerns over the increasingly intense competition between tech giants in the development of AI technology.
