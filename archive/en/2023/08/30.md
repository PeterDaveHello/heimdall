## [ISPs should not police online speech no matter how awful it is](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/08/isps-should-not-police-online-speech-no-matter-how-awful-it)

- The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) argues that Internet Service Providers (ISPs), particularly Tier 1, should not act as content regulators, warning it could lead to potential power abuse and censorship.
- The EFF referenced Hurricane Electric, a Tier 1 ISP, which partially denied service to disrupt traffic for a controversy-ridden forum, describing it as a concerning precedent for future censorship acts that may block legal speech.
- Instead of ISPs policing content, the EFF advocates for enforcing laws and privacy measures by law enforcement and courts, insisting that protecting human rights shouldn't depend on corporations acting as speech police.
