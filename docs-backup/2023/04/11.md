## Use GitHub Actions to Make Your GitHub Profile Dynamic

[Original](https://www.bengreenberg.dev/posts/2023-04-09-github-profile-dynamic-content/).
GitHub users can make their profile dynamic using GitHub Actions by creating a repository with a README.md file containing desired profile information, adding folders for dynamic content, and adding a new subfolder for the script that scrapes data from a website and modifying it in the README.md file; the content for the profile is found by going to github.com/[username] in a web browser, with the repository being the source of the profile page; the new subfolder for the workflow is installed into [workflows] within the root directory, and a schedule is set to run the script once a week; users can use different languages, including Ruby, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python to make a dynamic profile; this technique enhances the GitHub profile of an individual, making it a more dynamic and ever-changing example.

An Discussion Service user shares their learnings on formal methods, with commenters providing their experiences and opinions. Frama-C and SPARK are recommended, along with TLA+ for quick start. Formal methods are useful for verifying hardware, but are niche for most software. Contract tests and data flow analysis help prevent errors in start. AI systems like ChatGPT can validate code against system requirements. Mathematical notation is more efficient than natural language expressions in formal proofs. Democratizing knowledge is vital in the tech industry.

## Open source LLM for commercial use?

An Discussion Service user asked whether they could legally use an open-source LLM tool for commercial use. Some users recommended checking the specific license of the tool. Others suggested contacting a lawyer or using an alternative tool with a commercial license. One user pointed out that using open source for commercial purposes is possible with some licenses, but it's essential to comply with the terms of the license.

An Discussion Service user searches for commercial open-source LLM for their ML project. Flan models perform slightly worse than GPT-3/4. Other open-source models are available, but training is expensive. Nvidia expected to release initial base models for LLMs. Companies may publish base models but the real value is 5-10 layers up. OpenAI doesn't use customer data to train models, but some companies need secrecy. Machine learning models likely have no IP rights protections. GPT alternatives like BERT and opt series can be fine-tuned cheaply. GPT4all team works on training GPT-J as an open alternative. Concerns exist over the accountability of LLMs.

## Zoomable, animated scatterplots in the browser that scales over a billion points

[Original](https://github.com/nomic-ai/deepscatter).
Deep Scatterplots for the Web is an evolving library for displaying large amounts of data with high performance using the Apache Arrow `feather` format and WebGL. The library also handles most grammar-of-graphics transformations on the GPU, allowing for interpolated transitions with parallel calculations. The examples include over a million documents from arxiv.com and every person in the 2010 and 2020 US Censuses, among others. The library runs in completely static settings which can be hosted on Github Pages. The API mimics Vega-Lite, and the library offers jitter methods such as circle, spiral, and time.

Nomic AI's zoomable, animated scatterplots scale more than one billion points in the browser via webGPU, and GitHub issues are welcomed; however, the background map may not always be accurate, and Highcharts has a similar module but with fewer points. Nomic AI also released gpt4all, and libraries like GRAPE and nodevectors could yield better results for embeddings at scale. Visualization fans may be interested in Galapix, Pix-image-viewer, and GGVec, but rendering issues may arise with mobile devices.
