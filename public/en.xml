The company deploys as many as 20 times a day, with weekly automated pull requests that bump its version to the latest Rails commit, followed by a build and revision review. The benefits of the frequent Rails upgrades include better database connection handling and faster view rendering, improved security and mitigated risk of unknown issues. GitHub's testing of the latest versions also allows the company to identify and fix issues before releasing the software.The post is a link to the GitHub Privacy Statement.

As most TVs nowadays are smart, it is difficult to find options that are not. Wirecutter suggests that rather than trying to find a non-smart TV, readers should focus on securing their smart TV with privacy controls and settings.Privacy and security concerns regarding smart TVs have led many users to opt for disconnected TVs. However, this may cause them to miss out on other useful features such as Bluetooth compatibility or HDR functionality. Our experts recommend opting out of data collection by new TVs, connecting them to Wi-Fi only for firmware updates, and occasionally connecting to streaming apps to opt out. Old TVs, 4K monitors or projectors are also viable alternatives. The article also notes that similar privacy issues persist with other internet-connected devices.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 17:50:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Codeberg – Fast open source alternative to GitHub</title><link>https://codeberg.org/</link><description>Codeberg.orgThis website works better with JavaScript.ExploreAboutFAQDonateHelp Register Sign InSoftware development, but free!Codeberg is a collaboration platform and Git hosting for free and open source software, content and projects.BLOGDOCSNON-PROFITCodeberg is not run by a company, but is in the hands of its users – via the non-profit organization Codeberge.V. based in Berlin, Germany – feel free to join!COMMUNITYCodeberg.org will be more than just Git hosting for your projects: We are a community of like-minded Free Software andContent Creators.RESPECTNo tracking.

About half of the global population depends on it for sustenance. But, like other staples such as wheat and corn, rice is cultivated annually. That means replanting the fields year after year, at huge cost to both the farmers and the land. For years, scientists have been tinkering with rice strains to create a perennial variety – one that would regrow after harvest without the need to be resown. Today, Scientist in Residence Regina G.

Perennial rice can be harvested for successive regrowth seasons, maintaining a relatively stable yield and greatly reducing labor input.            China News Service/China News Service via Getty Ima          Rice is arguably the world's most important staple crop. About half of the global population depends on it for sustenance. But, like other staples such as wheat and corn, rice is cultivated annually. That means replanting the fields year after year, at huge cost to both the farmers and the land. For years, scientists have been tinkering with rice strains to create a perennial variety – one that would regrow after harvest without the need to be resown. For what may be the first time in about ten thousand years of human rice cultivation, the new strains stay productive harvest after harvest.  Over two decades ago, researchers crossed a common Thai rice cultivar with a wild rice from Africa that was especially tenacious. They then spent years breeding for the desired traits until they landed on three new perennial varieties to test in the real world. Since then, some 45,000 farmers, mostly smallholding subsistence farmers, have tried growing the perennial rice. "Now it's gotten on to where it's four years in a row," says Tim Crews, Chief Scientist and Director of the International Program within the Land Institute in Kansas. Tim and his collaborator, Erik Sacks, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, joined Short Wave Scientist in Residence Regina G. Barber for a live conversation at the Sci-Mic stage, during the 2023 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). During that conversation, they explained that with the development of perennial grains could come huge environmental benefits – from healthier soil to a lower carbon footprint – and be a boon for the people who grow them.

The less conservative approach, counting everyone without complications that might prevent an automatic return, puts the number at 73 million returns, or 48 percent. Even if "only" two out of every five returns can be done by the IRS automatically, it could save a huge amount of time and angst every year, and make tax season run much more smoothly.A Catholic Church child sex abuse crisis resurfaces; Tesla's cameras are under scrutiny; and a Texas judge rules against medication abortion.

This is a serious bug that has so far resisted all attempts at a fix. We need to prioritize helping people understand this, not debating the most precise terminology to use to describe it.We accidentally invented computers that can lie to usI tweeted (and tooted) this:We accidentally invented computers that can lie to us and we can’t figure out how to make them stop- Simon Willison (@simonw) April 5, 2023Mainly I was trying to be pithy and amusing, but this thought was inspired by reading Sam Bowman’s excellent review of the field, Eight Things to Know about Large Language Models. In particular this:More capable models can better recognize the specific circumstances under which they are trained. Because of this, they are more likely to learn to act as expected in precisely those circumstances while behaving competently but unexpectedly in others. This can surface in the form of problems that Perez et al. (2022) call sycophancy, where a model answers subjective questions in a way that flatters their user’s stated beliefs, and sandbagging, where models are more likely to endorse common misconceptions when their user appears to be less educated.Sycophancy and sandbagging are my two favourite new pieces of AI terminology!What I find fascinating about this is that these extremely problematic behaviours are not the system working as intended: they are bugs! And we haven’t yet found a reliable way to fix them.(Here’s the paper that snippet references: Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations from December 2022.)“But a machine can’t deliberately tell a lie”I got quite a few replies complaining that it’s inappropriate to refer to LLMs as “lying”, because to do so anthropomorphizes them and implies a level of intent which isn’t possible.I completely agree that anthropomorphism is bad: these models are fancy matrix arithmetic, not entities with intent and opinions.But in this case, I think the visceral clarity of being able to say “ChatGPT will lie to you” is a worthwhile trade.Science fiction has been presenting us with a model of “artificial intelligence” for decades. It’s firmly baked into our culture that an “AI” is an all-knowing computer, incapable of lying and able to answer any question with pin-point accuracy.Large language models like ChatGPT, on first encounter, seem to fit that bill. They appear astonishingly capable, and their command of human language can make them seem like a genuine intelligence, at least at first glance.But the more time you spend with them, the more that illusion starts to fall apart.They fail spectacularly when prompted with logic puzzles, or basic arithmetic, or when asked to produce citations or link to sources for the information they present.Most concerningly, they hallucinate or confabulate: they make things up! My favourite example of this remains their ability to entirely imagine the content of a URL. I still see this catching people out every day. It’s remarkably convincing.Why ChatGPT and Bing Chat are so good at making things up is an excellent in-depth exploration of this issue from Benj Edwards at Ars Technica.We need to explain this in straight-forward termsWe’re trying to solve two problems here:ChatGPT cannot be trusted to provide factual information. It has a very real risk of making things up, and if people don’t understand it they are guaranteed to be mislead.Systems like ChatGPT are not sentient, or even intelligent systems. They do not have opinions, or feelings, or a sense of self. We must resist the temptation to anthropomorphize them.I believe that the most direct form of harm caused by LLMs today is the way they mislead their users. The first problem needs to take precedence.It is vitally important that new users understand that these tools cannot be trusted to provide factual answers. We need to help people get there as quickly as possible.Which of these two messages do you think is more effective?ChatGPT will lie to youOrChatGPT doesn’t lie, lying is too human and implies intent. It hallucinates. Actually no, hallucination still implies human-like thought. It confabulates. That’s a term used in psychiatry to describe when someone replaces a gap in one’s memory by a falsification that one believes to be true—though of course these things don’t have human minds so even confabulation is unnecessarily anthropomorphic. I hope you’ve enjoyed this linguistic detour!Let’s go with the first one. We should be shouting this message from the rooftops: ChatGPT will lie to you.That doesn’t mean it’s not useful—it can be astonishingly useful, for all kinds of purposes... but seeking truthful, factual answers is very much not one of them. And everyone needs to understand that.Convincing people that these aren’t a sentient AI out of a science fiction story can come later. Once people understand their flaws this should be an easier argument to make!Should we warn people off or help them on?This situation raises an ethical conundrum: if these tools can’t be trusted, and people are demonstrably falling for their traps, should we encourage people not to use them at all, or even campaign to have them banned?Every day I personally find new problems that I can solve more effectively with the help of large language models. Some recent examples from just the last few weeks:GPT-4 for API design research—ChatGPT transcriptReading thermometer temperatures over time from a video—transcriptInteractive row selection prototype with Datasette—transcriptConvert git log output to JSON using jq—transcriptEach of these represents a problem I could have solved without ChatGPT... but at a time cost that would have been prohibitively expensive, to the point that I wouldn’t have bothered.I wrote more about this in AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects.Honestly, at this point using ChatGPT in the way that I do feels like a massively unfair competitive advantage. I’m not worried about AI taking people’s jobs: I’m worried about the impact of AI-enhanced developers like myself.It genuinely feels unethical for me not to help other people learn to use these tools as effectively as possible. I want everyone to be able to do what I can do with them, as safely and responsibly as possible.I think the message we should be emphasizing is this:These are incredibly powerful tools. They are far harder to use effectively than they first appear. Invest the effort, but approach with caution: we accidentally invented computers that can lie to us and we can’t figure out how to make them stop.There’s a time for linguistics, and there’s a time for grabbing the general public by the shoulders and shouting “It lies! The computer lies to you!

Lee  - Apr 7, 2023 2:49 pm UTC EnlargeGetty Images | NurPhoto reader comments162 with Share this storyShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on RedditTwitter users on Friday began noticing that they could not retweet or reply to tweets containing links to the Substack.com domain. This behavior seems to have started less than 48 hours after the popular newsletter platform announced a new product called Notes that will compete directly with Twitter.For example, this tweet references my newsletter, understandingai.substack.com. When I try to retweet it, it gives me an error message saying, "Some actions on this tweet have been disabled by Twitter." If I try to reply to the same tweet, I get an error message saying, "Something went wrong, but don't fret—let's give it another shot." Even liking isn't allowed.This tweet is identical, except that I linked to my custom domain, understandingai.org. I have no trouble liking, retweeting, or replying to it.In the last 24 hours, Twitter also appears to have started blocking tweet-embedding in Substack posts."We're investigating reports that Twitter embeds and authentication no longer work on Substack," Substack tweeted on Thursday. "We are actively trying to resolve this and will share updates as additional information becomes available." Advertisement I emailed Twitter's official press email address, press@twitter.com, for comment. Twitter automatically replies to all emails at that account with the message "💩." I don't expect a further response, as Twitter appears to have laid off most of its press shop. Tesla disbanded its PR department three years ago.But it's not hard to guess why Twitter started restricting tweets about Substack. On Wednesday, Substack announced its Notes feature, which sounds an awful lot like Twitter."In Notes, writers will be able to post short-form content and share ideas with each other and their readers," Substack wrote in a blog post. "Like our Recommendations feature, Notes is designed to drive discovery across Substack. But while Recommendations lets writers promote publications, Notes will give them the ability to recommend almost anything—including posts, quotes, comments, images, and links."This wouldn't be the first time Twitter has restricted the reach of rivals on its platform. Back in December, Twitter banned several technology reporters after they reported on the controversy over services that track Twitter-owner Elon Musk's private jet. That led to an exodus of users to Twitter rivals such as Mastodon. A few days later, Twitter started blocking links to Mastodon and other competing social media platforms.As I write this, tweets linking to Mastodon accounts seem to be working again.Substack has yet to respond to an email seeking comment. We'll update the story if we hear back.Tim Lee was on staff at Ars from 2017 to 2021. He recently launched a new Substack newsletter, Understanding AI.

Various sharding schemes and algorithms are discussed, with examples of how different companies have implemented sharding. The article also covers important aspects such as organizing infrastructure, routing layer creation, and migration planning. The maintenance of sharded databases is a crucial part of scaling-out and must be planned accordingly. A brief insight into sharding frameworks and tools is provided towards the end of the article.Vitess and Citus are two open-source tools that provide sharding for MySQL and Postgres, respectively. Vitess, originally built at YouTube, is the most mature and popular sharding layer for relational databases and includes connection pooling, dynamic sharding, and monitoring tools. Citus is designed as a Postgres extension and offers good general advice for picking your sharding scheme. The rise of "serverless" databases like CockroachDB has enabled distributed systems to be native to the database itself, shifting the focus from infrastructure maintenance to developer experience. PlanetScale offers a shard-native database built on MySQL and Vitess, and their website offers useful engineering resources.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 00:32:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hubble sees possible runaway black hole creating a trail of stars</title><link>https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-010</link><description>ERROR: The request could not be satisfied403 ERRORThe request could not be satisfied.Request blocked.We can't connect to the server for this app or website at this time.

Some of the 14 million New Zealand and Australia records taken are up to 18 years old, which isn’t okay.Liz MacPherson, New Zealand’s Deputy Privacy Commissioner says that data retention is emerging as a key issue in several recent domestic and global cyber-attacks including the Latitude Financial breach.“Data retention is the sleeping giant of data security. There are consequences for holding onto data you no longer need. All businesses and organisations can learn from this: don’t collect or hold onto information you don’t need. The risk is simply too high for your customers and your organisation. Don’t risk being a hostage to people who make it their day job to illegally extract data.”There is no place for a “she’ll be right” attitude to privacy and cyber security.  Cyber attackers are active. People are employed to be cyber attackers.“People make their fortunes from hacking the security of agencies. Having sea borders does not protect your very internet-connected agency from being hacked.“A key finding from the NZ Institute of Directors’ Director Sentiment Survey report, released late last year, was that a significant proportion of boards were not sufficiently prepared for a digital future and had an “it won’t happen to us” approach.  The message from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is “wake up to yourselves”. We talk to organisations almost every week who are counting the cost of a cyber data breach. Can you risk the impact to your customers and your reputation?” Agencies should not be collecting or retaining personal information unless it is necessary for a lawful purpose connected with their function or activity.  All agencies should have a personal information retention schedule that they review regularly. The simple discipline of deciding how long information will be retained as you collect it and acting on these decisions will save you and your customers a lot of pain. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner also encourages individuals to challenge hard why an agency needs to collect and retain their personal information.“If ID is being used as means of verification, ask why it needs to be collected or copied rather than simply sighted and recorded. If your information is being collected, ask how long it will be kept for and why.  The more people challenge, the more likely it is that organisations will change their behaviour.”Privacy needs to become a core business issue, as important as health and safety.About the Latitude Finance privacy breachThe Latitude Financial cyber-attack involves New Zealanders and Australians so both privacy regulators for each nation are working together.“We will share each other’s preliminary inquiries as we seek to understand what happened and establish our next steps. This includes the potential for coordinated investigations and joint regulatory action”, says Deputy Privacy Commissioner Liz MacPherson.The Office was first notified of the breach on March 16. Since then, the size and scale of the data theft has grown dramatically as Latitude has undertaken forensic analysis of their systems.The combined total of Australian and New Zealand records is now 14 million, including 6.1 million records that are over 10 years old. Some records are at least 18 years old.“We are continuing to engage with Latitude Financial and our Australian counterparts to understand the nature, causes and consequences of the breach. Unfortunately, the true scale of cyber-security breaches can take some time to be revealed,” says Liz.The Office is currently focussed on the impact of the attack on individual members of the public. But the Privacy Commissioner also wants answers to some key questions.  These include how the cyber-criminal got in, how they managed to penetrate so far and why so many records have been retained for so long. Latitude Financial is progressively contacting all affected customers who have had their personal data stolen to tell them what has been stolen and how Latitude will assist them.People who have been contacted directly by Latitude and told what has been stolen should work with Latitude Financial first to try to get a resolution. “It is Latitude Financial’s responsibility to put things right. It is important that affected customers give Latitude a chance to make good on their commitments to provide support.  However, if after people have worked with Latitude their privacy harms have not been resolved to their satisfaction, we encourage them to make a complaint to our Office.”For both impacted Latitude customers and those who have not yet been told whether their data is impacted the message is to be hyper vigilant. “Keep a close eye on your accounts for any unusual activity. Work with your banks and telco providers and consider checking your credit record”. We encourage you to make use of the free expert ID protection advice being provided through IDCare.Note to editors: Please find the CISCO report attachedhttps://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/products/security/cybersecurity-reports/cybersecurity-readiness-index.html Please find the Institute of Directors New Zealand report belowhttps://www.iod.org.nz/resources-and-insights/research-and-analysis/director-sentiment-survey-report-2022/#Please find attached our press release from January on numbers of data breacheshttps://www.privacy.org.nz/publications/statements-media-releases/notable-increase-in-data-breaches-reported/For media queries ring 021959050PublicationsAdvisory opinionsBrochures, postersCase notes and court decisionsCommissioner inquiriesCorporate reportsGuidance ResourcesInsights reportsPrivacy NewsSubmissions and Briefings to Parliament and GovernmentSpeeches and presentationsStatements and media releasesSurveysBack to topAbout usAskUsContact usRSSSite MapPrivacy statementCopyrightGovt.nzOffice of the Privacy Commissioner © 2013</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 05:07:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>U.S. &amp; China wage war beneath the waves over internet cables</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/us-china-tech-cables/</link><description>A special report by Reuters highlights the battle between the US and China over internet cables that carry the world's data. Undersea cables are central to U.S.-China technology competition as they transmit everything from emails to military secrets. US government officials have thwarted Chinese cable projects abroad and choked Big Tech's cable routes to Hong Kong, raising concerns about espionage and sabotage attacks. American subsea cable company SubCom LLC defeated China's HMN Technologies Co Ltd for the Singapore-to-France cable contract. At least six private undersea cable deals have been intervened in by the US government in the past four years.The US government's efforts to isolate China's high-tech sector and limit Chinese access to US technology have continued, with the White House taking credit for the awarding of a subsea cable contract to US-based SubCom, rather than fastest-growing subsea cable layer, China's HMN Tech. As well as highlighting US success in securing the deal, the article details how diplomatic efforts were made to persuade companies to select SubCom instead of HMN Tech on security grounds, which consortium members cited as the reason for the shift. The US government's aggressive efforts to prevent Chinese espionage through undersea cables are disrupting plans by tech giants and causing turmoil in the subsea cable industry. These efforts are overseen by the inter-agency committee, Team Telecom, which makes cable licensing recommendations to the Federal Communications Commission, and is run by the Department of Justice's National Security Division. Team Telecom has blocked four cables from running directly from the US to Hong Kong, and is preventing China from securing other subsea contracts worldwide. Chinese firm HMN Tech's share in subsea cables has plummeted. China is retaliating by delaying a Meta-backed cable project, the Southeast Asia-Japan 2 cable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 14:06:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Database "sharding" came from Ultima Online?</title><link>https://www.raphkoster.com/2009/01/08/database-sharding-came-from-uo/</link><description>Not Acceptable!Not Acceptable!An appropriate representation of the requested resource could not be found on this server.

Alex R. Rosenblat refused to allow her data to be shared during her pregnancy, but after revisiting a June 2022 article about Phreesia’s privacy practices, she followed up to check they held no record of her consent. Despite providing warnings, companies often continue to use patients' data. Some suggest there is a need for a rule against pressuring patients to provide consent or even a policy against certain kinds of data being shared for advertising purposes even with consent from patients.An expert argues for a default opt-out approach for patients' privacy policies to make opting out clear and easy. The current process of revoking consent can be complicated and burdensome. The author suggests separating ad tech from healthcare to protect patients.

Credit: SpaceXWASHINGTON — SpaceX offered its strongest signals yet that it is nearing the first full-scale launch of its Starship vehicle, now expected for later this month.The company tweeted April 6 that it was planning a launch rehearsal for the vehicle, now fully stacked on the pad at its Starbase facility at Boca Chica, Texas, next week. That will be followed by the first launch attempt about a week later.Starship fully stacked at Starbase. Team is working towards a launch rehearsal next week followed by Starship’s first integrated flight test ~week later pending regulatory approval pic.twitter.com/9VbJLppswp— SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 6, 2023Elon Musk, SpaceX founder and chief executive, later confusingly tweeted that the vehicle is “ready to launch next week.” However, neither the company nor the Federal Aviation Administration appears to be planning for a launch the week of April 10. In an Operations Plan Advisory document by the FAA, used to support flight planning, the agency lists a first launch date of April 17 for the Starship flight, with backup dates of April 18 through 21. All the dates have the same window from 8 to 11:05 a.m. Eastern.There had been speculation that SpaceX would attempt to launch Starship earlier. A maritime warning notice suggested a launch between April 6 and 12, while the FAA planning document earlier this week listed a launch April 10 with backup days of April 11 and 12.Those plans are dependent on both the technical readiness of the vehicle as well as the issuance of a launch license from the FAA. Both SpaceX and Musk noted those schedules were pending “regulatory approval,” and the FAA said the inclusion of the Starship dates on its planning documents did not imply a launch license has been issued.The last major testing milestone for the launch was a static-fire test of the Super Heavy booster Feb. 9. While only 31 of the 33 Raptor engines in the booster fired, the company deemed the test a success. Gary Henry, senior advisor for national security space solutions at SpaceX, said at a conference Feb. 21 that the static-fire test was the “last box to check” before launch, which he estimated at the time to take place “in the next month or so.”“We’re so close” to that launch, said Tom Ochinero, senior vice president of commercial business at SpaceX during a panel at the Satellite 2023 conference March 15. “We’re waiting on our FAA license so that we can announce our launch date.”The company had referred to the test as the first orbital flight demonstration of Starship, although current plans do not call for the vehicle to complete one orbit. Instead, the Starship upper stage will splash down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. It’s unclear if Starship will actually enter orbit, then immediately perform a deorbit burn to splash down, or if instead it is a long suborbital flight.SpaceX, in its tweet about the upcoming launch, referred to the mission as the “first integrated flight test” of Starship without explicitly calling it an orbital launch attempt.Related Tagged: SpaceX, Starship Jeff Foustjfoust@spacenews.comJeff Foust writes about space policy, commercial space, and related topics for SpaceNews.He earned a Ph.D. in planetary sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a bachelor’s degree with honors in geophysics and planetary science...More by Jeff FoustClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Clipboard (Opens in new window)Sign up for a SpaceNews newsletterGet top stories, military space news and more delivered to your inbox.Subscribe to newsletters Back to top AboutAbout usAdvertiseSubscribeSign up for Our NewslettersSubscribe to the MagazineGet Magazine ReprintsEventsView Events CalendarSubmit Your Event Follow us onFacebook PageTwitter UsernameLinkedInYouTubeRSS Feed SpaceNews © 2023.

Here's a web map of the route. Important stuff, clearly. Let me explain.This is a longer straight line than the one belowBack in 2018 someone asked Ordnance Survey a question on Twitter, as follows:"what (and where) is the longest distance you can walk in a straight line in England/Wales/Scotland without crossing a road (defined as a paved surface for vehicular use)??"Note 'a paved surface for vehicular use'. This is the most important bit for me and the reason I'm coming back to it again after years of working with this data and never quite finding time to investigate, until now.It's an excellent question. The answer the OS team provided was then turned into a blog post on the OS website in early 2019, and you can read that here but see below for their map. There's also a fantastic short film of Calum Maclean and Jenny Graham walking the route. 71.5km or 44.43 milesNow, let me say a little bit more. I'm from the Highlands, know lots of this area pretty well from my days cycling around it on my mountain bike when I was a teenager, as well as loads of other trips over the years for all sorts of reasons. I also spend my days looking at map data because that's a big part of my job and because of that one thing troubled me a bit about this answer from Ordnance Survey. To be more precise, once again, it's the 'paved surface for vehicular use' part of the answer. I'll explain all below and my maps are very rough and quick but you'll hopefully see what I mean. The roads dataOrdnance Survey provide loads of great open data these days, and one of those products is their OS Open Roads product. Load it into your GIS software and it looks like the image below. You can see from just eyeballing it where the biggest gaps in the road network are - unsurprisingly, all in the north of Scotland. There are some gaps in England and Wales too but here I'm trying to find the longest straight line between roads in Great Britain so I'm focusing on the north of Scotland. The longest line in Great Britain is also the longest in the whole UK, because the density of roads in Northern Ireland is such that there's nowhere even remotely as long as the line above there.All roads in Great BritainThis OS roads file is about 2GB in size and is really useful. However, when I've run different kinds of network analyses on it I sometimes run into problems because it also includes roads that are not public. These are typically flagged as 'Restricted Local Access Roads', and I've shown some of these in the zoomed-in map below in purple. You may think by looking that these are 'roads' but in reality they are usually unpaved private tracks but more on that further down the page. Restricted 'roads' in purple hereWhat do these restricted roads look like on the ground? Well, you can take a look via Google street view a lot of the time, and you can also get a sense for what public roads are just by hovering the street view icon over the map, like I've done below.A much better representation of public roadsFor example, if you travel down the road along the River Findhorn, you'll eventually get to the end of the public road. You can of course keep going on foot or on your bike because of the laws on access in Scotland but you can't drive down these routes (unless you have permission). The end of the public roadAnother 'Restricted Local Access Road' - see what I mean?If you download the roads file and then make public roads one colour (blue) and then the restricted roads a different colour and then make a head-splitting gif of the result, this is what you get. Study this for a while and then you start to wonder if you can find a longer line than the OS one from 2019. Sometimes restricted access roads are in places like caravan parks, cemeteries, and the like - but in the Highlands they are often in the hills too.Loads of restricted access roads (purple) on the mapUsing what I would consider to be the 'correct' OS roads file - i.e. the one in keeping with the original question and in keeping with the concept of public roads - I can get a longer line in the original Cairngorms route too, see below. Let's worry about distance over undulating ground later on.I can get a distance over 74km (straight line) this wayBut with my glasses on I could see a potentially longer route, that just missed a couple of public roads, this time to the west of the A9 instead of the east. That's the map I posted at the start, and again below.From the A9 to near Fort William, a nice walkI've added terrain to this one, to show how tough this would beHere's a height profile for anyone mad enough to be thinking about doing this route. It looks horrendously tiring and almost certainly quite dangerous unless you're a bit of an expert. Units are in metres below and the max is just about 3,000 feet, with lots of ups and downs. How much distance does this actually add to the straight line? Well, it's never as much as I'd think and it depends upon the accuracy of your terrain model but using the publicly available OS Terrain 50 dataset I get a distance of 77.0 km / 47.8 miles for this so a bit longer than straight line distance. I calculated this in QGIS using the Saga 'Profiles from lines' tool. A nice wee strollAnyway, that's what I get when I look at the data. A bit longer than the OS answer, but that's because I've tried to stick to the spirit of the original question. Get a different result? Found a mistake?

Try searching or go to Amazon's home page." errors, while others list it as "Unavailable."The only listings one can find right now when searching for Flipper Zero on Amazon are accessories like WiFi Devboards, screen protectors, and silicone cases."This product has been identified as a card skimming device. Amazon policy prohibits the sale or listing of card skimming devices," reads a notification sent to one Amazon seller (seen by BleepingComputer) confirming a Flipper Zero sell page was removed from Amazon's catalog."We took this action because this product is not permitted for sale on Amazon.com. It is your obligation to make sure the products you offer comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon's policies."Amazon Flipper Zero ban notification (Dan Ochoa)​The company also warned Flipper Zero sellers to check all their other listings and remove all other restricted products within 48 hours or face account deactivation."Within 48 hours of this warning please review your listings and close delete, or archive any listings that do not comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Amazon's policies.""Failure to properly close or delete all restricted product listings from your inventory may result in the deactivation of your selling account, and funds may be permanently held."However, not all Flipper Zero potential buyers will be upset by the Amazon ban since those selling it on Amazon were doing it at a markup. If you want to buy a Flipper Zero, you can still get one from the maker's official store, which gets restocked regularly.The Brazilian National Telecommunications Agency has also been seizing incoming Flipper Zero purchases based on its alleged use by criminals. Brazilians who bought the devices say the government agency has rejected all attempts to certify the device.An Amazon spokesperson was not available for comment when contacted by BleepingComputer on Thursday, so we don't know yet if this is a temporary ban or if the company will maintain the sale restriction.Related Articles:Hackers inject credit card stealers into payment processing modulesBrazil seizing Flipper Zero shipments to prevent use in crimeRussia bans foreign messaging apps in government organizationsValve “honeypot” used to ban 40,000 Dota 2 players using cheatMalicious Google ads sneak AWS phishing sites into search resultsAmazonBanFlipper ZeroSkimmerSergiu Gatlan  Sergiu Gatlan has covered cybersecurity, technology, and other news beats for more than a decade.

When describing her projects, it’s hard to decide where to begin. However varied her creations may be, one thing can be certain—the craftsmanship and attention to detail in each piece is unmistakeable. Most of Tatjana’s creations have complexities that go far beyond surface appearances. The superb craftsmanship is almost a necessity because of the intricate nature of these objects.In fact, Tatjana’s masterful craftsmanship is evidenced by the mere fact that these projects function properly, because their mechanisms could never be reproduced by an amateur. Whether or not you are able to achieve a full understanding of the function of each object, you will certainly be able to appreciate their surface beauty. As you gain more understanding of the function, additional layers of beauty are revealed.Explanations of the objects are relatively brief. The beauty and purpose is for each individual to discover for themselves. To quote Tatjana, “Verbalisations involve personal semantic reactions, yours and mine. Verbalisations tend to exclude reality. Just look, maintaining internal silence, until the meaning of my work becomes clear. Then share my lifelong joy in the mystery of Reality, with its surprises, limitations and instabilities.”Tatjana’s elaborate Harmonium. (All photos of the Harmonium courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen)An overhead view of the Harmonium.About Tatjana Joëlle van VarkTatjana is someone who, in the period of the renaissance, would have been called homo universalis. A person with interests and skills in many areas: artistic, cultural, mechanical and scientific. As an independent researcher, Tatjana’s work has taken her into many regions of scientific study. She started early, building an oscilloscope from scratch at age 14.For a living, Tatjana worked as a scientific consultant for large technological firms, the government, and military institutions. Using science and instruments as her tools for analysis, she studied complex problems to get to the very root cause, and hopefully offer solutions.Tatjana’s machined plexiglass sample from 1984. There is absolutely no way to hide mistakes here. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)Tatjana built this oscilloscope in 1958, when she was just 14 years old. Her interest in scientific instruments was established at an early age.In doing so, Tatjana has been able to explore many areas of study in electronics, including power systems and logic systems in relays and electronics. In fact, she has a complete operating electromechanical telephone and telex switching system in her home.In the field of cryptology, Tatjana did work that resulted in the design and construction of an improved version of the famous Enigma cipher machine from World War II. She also worked on aircraft avionics, navigational inertial guidance systems, radar, and weapons control systems. In her home, Tatjana has also restored a highly complex, functional navigation and bombing system from the English Vulcan bomber.Tatjana’s work took her into the field of optics, including lens coating by vapor deposition. It also included ventures into organic chemistry with the production of instruments for the pharmacology industry. That included making IR/UV spectrophotometers, and analytical and micro balances.Additionally, Tatjana has also produced working models of historically significant telescopes and other instruments, from barometers to polarimeters. The capture of a famous German Enigma coding machine, and the subsequent breaking of its code, was a key event in WWII intelligence gathering. Tatjana says her cryptograph is not an Enigma machine, but is based on the same principle. (All photos of the Cryptograph courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen)A rebuilt navigation and bombing system (NBS) resides in Tatjana’s home. The NBS includes an H2S Mk 9A, and Navigation, Bombing and Computer (NBC) of the type used in British V-bombers Victor, Vulcan and Valiant. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)Although many of her projects appear to be simple reproductions, these instruments often include improvements that came as a result of Tatjana’s deep analysis and understanding of the underlying principles of the device. One constant in all the projects, however, is the stunning craftsmanship, attention to detail, and fine finishes that make each piece a pleasure to behold and study. This is made possible in part because Tatjana has put together a fine collection of high quality machine tools in her own shop. Following the classical tradition, many of her pieces are signed and dated by the maker: TJvV fecit. With permission and the help of her friend and webmaster, Tim Samshuijzen, we have included images of some of Tatjana’s most impressive projects.Tatjana’s personal website has a more complete selection of detailed photos from Tatjana’s broad array of projects. Her poems often augment the work as well—another aspect of her talents. The most important feature to be honored here, however, is the wonderful craftsmanship with which these projects were constructed. Whether or not you understand the function of the project, take note of the care and precision with which each part was built and presented. This is scientific craftsmanship taken to the highest level.Tatjana’s interpretation of the Antikythera Mechanism has complex gearing, superb finishes, and a classical presentation. Her improved version of the ancient Antikythera Mechanism (left) drives the Hypothetical Planetarium (right), reproducing the movement of the sun and stars.

(Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)Tatjana van Vark’s WorkshopTatjana sent in some photos and a description of her workshop. Her machining skills are completely self-taught. Tatjana’s workshop isn’t large, but the machines are high quality, keeping up with the demands of her precision work. The following is Tatjana’s description of her own machines:“Let me present my cast-iron friends: The lathe (1978) is a non-standard Myford super 7, it has the optional extended and hardened bed.”“I added digital read-outs, in those days not common at all, and a variable DC drive controlled by the hand wheel in front of the stand. Pulling the hand wheel in the zero position before rotating reverses the direction of the motor. In the zero position there is active electrical breaking, a great convenience. Practically all Myford accessories were acquired over the years.”Tatjana built this Newtonian telescope in 1974. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)A vacuumless barometer made in 1977. (Photo courtesy of Tim Samshuijzen.)“The milling machine (1983) is a Deckel FP-1 with a wide range of accessories, some homemade. It is not NC, but is has a system that allows servo positioning from the keyboard, but only on one axis at a time—either to an absolute position or incrementally. The machine is shown in an elementary gear cutting configuration. Please notice the ‘overhead traveling crane’ contraption, a must (for me) to handle the heavier accessories safely.”“Next, a Deckel GK-21, a 3D copying and engraving milling machine acquired a few years ago. Before that I did all engravings on the much older Lienhard machine. For the Deckel there is a small grinder, Deckel SO, to make or sharpen special cutters.”“Then there is the necessary sheet working equipment (1977) of modest size, 65 cm working width. Shears, bending machines, inside corner cutters and a punch.”“Of course there is a collection of measuring equipment of good quality.”“So far the machine shop, as you see is a modest outfit, nothing exotic or supernatural. I do my own electroplating, by the way.” —Tatjana van VarkTatjana noted that her shop contains “nothing exotic or supernatural,” although the projects that come out of it certainly contain a little metalworking magic. Some of her sheet metal bending equipment is shown here.The Deckel FP-1 mill and Myford lathe can be seen here.The projects shown on this page are just a few from Tatjana’s wide range of work. We chose to highlight those that feature her machining skills most prominently. Her own website covers many more projects that delve into other areas of scientific inquiry. We also would like to thank Tim Samshuijzen for permission to reproduce his excellent photographs of Tatjana’s work.Watch a video of Tatjana demonstrating and explaining some of her wonderful projects. The narration is in Dutch, but the video is instructive nonetheless.View more photos of Tatjana J. van Vark’s unique work.

Seven patterns are explored, including throwaway code, piecemeal growth, and sweeping it under the rug. The article also looks at the causes of these patterns, including time constraints, cost, and neglect of architecture. The authors seek to understand these issues and aim to prevent, arrest, or reverse architectural decline by understanding the forces at work and examining alternative ways to resolve them.Premature architecture can hinder evolution and experimentation, making it more detrimental than none at all. The cost of architecture can be a luxury, but it's necessary investment for long-term concerns. Inexperience and employee turnover can limit architectural sophistication. Shantytowns provide a temporary solution to immediate housing needs but lack infrastructure and skilled specialization. A software system's architecture can be upended by new contingencies and prioritize workmanship over its actual needs. Managers often don't prioritize architecture, creating a vicious circle. BIG BALL OF MUD approaches don't require a virtuoso architect, but cultural, process, and resource allocation issues can overwhelm larger projects.The article discusses how programmer comfort is not the only concern for managers and how architecture and code quality might not be their top priority. The focus should be on features and functionality first, then architecture and performance. The article explores how software often turns into BIG BALLS OF MUD and why it happens. The quality of tools, domain experience, and engineers' skill levels also influence a system's architecture. The article recommends the Kent Beck model for building software and emphasizes that a casual approach to architecture during the early stages is acceptable. BIG BALL OF MUD architectures often emerge from throw-away prototypes, gradual maintenance, and piecemeal growth impeding a mature system's structure. Refactoring, repair, and consolidation phases are essential to combat BIG BALL OF MUD structures.Pair programming and code reviews subject code to immediate scrutiny and provide means to disseminate knowledge; without an audience, programmers may focus on line of code metrics and other indirect measurements of quality. There are three ways to deal with BIGBALLS OF MUD: keep the system healthy by alternating periods of refactoring and consolidation, throw the system away and start over, or surrender to entropy. Throwaway code, which is often rationalized as a stopgap measure or used to avoid learning someone else's code, has undocumented and often inefficient code. Both quick-and-dirty code and throwaway code can endure when kept within practical constraints, despite their lack of documentation.The post discusses the importance of incremental growth rather than top-down design in software development. It highlights the flaws in both methods, such as the rigidness of urban planning and analysis paralysis. The article describes how successful software can attract a wider audience, leading to new requirements that run against the original design. The article also notes the danger of uncontrolled growth, which can be a malignant force if not contained. The author suggests addressing the forces that encourage change and growth and consistently refactoring instead of striving for perfection.The article discusses the importance of maintenance and evolution of software systems, drawing parallels with building architecture, and emphasizing the need for continuous adaptation to change. Feedback plays a critical role in driving software evolution, as demonstrated by the principles of Extreme Programming. Successful adaptation requires small, incremental changes that do not undermine the overall structure. Maintenance programming should be a long-term commitment to consolidation and refactoring. Keeping the software working is crucial to avoid system failures that can have severe consequences due to modern society's reliance on the technology. Architects who live in the house they build have a natural incentive to ensure things are done correctly, and software developers should do the same.A software system should be incrementally developed, starting with a working system, with modifications that break the system rejected immediately, allowing for more insidious incorrect paths to be identified and addressed. A commitment to rigorous testing is vital to ensure continued system vitality, and adaptability and stability are in constant tension. Factor the system so that artifacts that change at similar rates are together, and objects help shear layers to emerge. Artifacts that evolve quickly provide dynamism and flexibility, while slowly evolving objects are bulwarks against change. Separating job descriptions and hardware can help make tiers distinct.Software complexity can be pushed into data to provide users with changeable schemas, producing more natural and adaptive software systems. Identifying and isolating disordered code can make it easier to maintain and extend; cordon off the problematic area to prepare for refactoring. Consideration of unexpected requirements can lead to building software components to be specific rather than general. Failure to maintain structured code can lead to its becoming unsalvageable, but architecture obsolescence and popularity of competing solutions can also prompt software replacement.The article explores the idea that it may be easier to discard a system and start over at times. Accounting practices must recognize the value of design experience. Rebuilding a system demands considerable time and resources, making high-level management support necessary. However, refactoring can provide an alternative by gleaning architectural elements from the system. Still, software architecture is about distilling experience into wisdom, and recognizing the forces and pressures that lead to architectural malaise can create durable artifacts. Moderate disorder is a part of software evolution; architectural insight is the product of hard-won experience.The author expresses gratitude to various groups for their input on architecture and reuse, with references to related literature. The text also includes acknowledgments and notes on the work.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 13:22:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Yann LeCun &amp; Andrew Ng: Why the 6-Month AI Pause Is a Bad Idea [video]</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BY9KV8uCtj4</link><description>Yann LeCun and Andrew Ng: Why the 6-month AI Pause is a Bad Idea - YouTubeAboutPressCopyrightContact usCreatorsAdvertiseDevelopersTermsPrivacyPolicy &amp; SafetyHow YouTube worksTest new featuresNFL Sunday Ticket© 2023 Google LLC</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 17:10:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>NSA created online cybersecurity course with 100s of classes</title><link>https://clark.center/c/nccp</link><description>CLARK | Cybersecurity Library</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 13:40:23 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Replacing bad systems with bad systems</title><link>https://seths.blog/2023/04/replacing-bad-systems-with-bad-systems/</link><description>Replacing bad systems with bad systems | Seth's Blog You have unread updates0SearchSearch for:SubscribeEmail Terms &amp; PrivacyLearnWhich workshop?altMBAThe LinkedIn Learning CoursesUdemy CoursesThe Akimbo PodcastConnectNews and updatesSocial MediaBest of the blogStory of the WeekSeth’s Top 100Popular PostsArchiveMore SethBooks, videos, and speaking (oh my!)Free contentAbout Seth GodinFind all the books at seths.store Welcome back.Have you thought about subscribing? It's free.seths.blog/subscribeReplacing bad systems with bad systemsA metaphor involving parking meters.Over the years, parking meters in town have evolved into a cumbersome, awkward system. Coins are heavy and you need to have them handy, meters need to be reinforced against theft and breakage, town employees have to empty the coins and securely deliver them to the bank, meter feeding allows local employees to hog spaces that might be used for shoppers… you get the idea.But replacing all the meters is expensive and because it’s inherently a centralized system, involves a lot of lobbying as well as a group of people making a choice with limited expertise, a choice they’ll only have to make once, they can’t learn from their mistakes…Enter Parkmobile, an app that promises everything to everyone. Except it increases the cost by more than 100% by charging fees, it’s awkward, has a silly password policy that makes it cumbersome to use, sends many many emails to users and it doesn’t generate more revenue or flexibility for the town. It charges people double and gives them less.But you can see how they managed to find the budget to do the difficult and expensive work of lobbying one town after another to gain monopoly status.The network effect is sticky and hard to overcome, and as we move the internet of things from our phones to just about everything we touch, it’s worth thinking about resilience, flexibility and the reason we need something in the first place.Often, we end up compromising about our compromises, maximizing for the wrong outcomes and getting hooked on a new system that forgot what the original system was even for.In this case, the first principles begin with why the meters exist in the first place. There are two goals:keep people from parking in the same place all daygenerate some cash to pay for parking enforcementAt first, having people put a nickel in a meter made sense. It’s just enough of a hassle and just enough of a cost that it all balances out.Thanks to the portable id that a smart phone offers, one simple solution is to have people scan a code that automatically gets them a period of time to park at a spot for free. The dashboard for enforcement is easy to build, and in a typical small town, the revenue loss is pretty small–a few more shoppers more than makes up for the cost of lost meters.If one still wanted to maximize revenue, it wouldn’t be difficult to hook that scanning tool up to any number of online payment services (like Venmo or Paypal) and simply cut out the middleman. Once we see we have cars, spots, drivers and phones, all in a dance, we can make new decisions based on what we want, not what simply polishes what we had.One could also easily sell parking passes, give local discounts, senior discounts or even give merchants codes they could use for employees in certain spots. You could make it so that the first ten minutes are free for fast in and out trips, or have it so local employees pay less in long-term spots, or that shoppers can easily get their parking cost rebated if they make a purchase.Or you could even rethink why cars are taking up so much space in our villages and towns and reconfigure the entire flow of humanity and traffic.But all of this is difficult because of the many constituencies involved and the stakes required in making UX choices in public.Design thinking is simple to describe in two questions:Who’s it for?What’s it for?In the case of a system replacing a previous system, these questions often get replaced with:What’s the easiest way to polish what we compromised on last time?Part of the magic of WordPress and its success is that the open nature and decentralized user experience they offer allows the individuals and organizations using it to embrace their first purposes instead of backward engineering from a centralized monopoly and a bagful of money.And a key benefit of distributed systems is that they improve over time. When you see something that can be made better, make it better.When a system is new, few are watching, so a handful of people with intent can design it and optimize it. As it gains in scale and impact, it calcifies at the same time that new tech arrives to codify the decisions that were made when the conditions were very different.The next time you pose for a photo, keep in mind that we pose for photos because the speed of an exposure used to be so long that if you didn’t pose, the photo was blurred. We changed the tech, but baked in the cultural expectation.Sometimes, we need to take a deep breath and go for better instead of more.

The alkaloids ephedrine, atropine and scopolamine were detected using Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry. Archaeologists have inferred the use of mind-altering substances from artefacts and botanical remains in the archaeological record, but chemical analysis of residues in human remains provides more direct evidence. North America and South America have also documented human hair containing psychoactive alkaloids from Prehispanic mummified individuals. This particular finding offers unique insight into the medicinal and ritual realms of Bronze Age people.A study of ancient hair samples found in a remote cave in Menorca has provided direct evidence that psychoactive plants were used by Late Bronze Age people in Europe. Archaeologists found 13cm-long locks of human hair inside a canister made of olive tree wood dating from between 1100 and 800 BCE in Chamber 5 of the cave of Es Càrritx. The hair contained atropine, scopolamine and ephedrine, three alkaloids found in the native flora of Menorca. The discovery sheds new light on drug use in ancient societies, which has been mainly based on indirect evidence.Bronze Age people on the island of Menorca consumed alkaloid-bearing plants such as tropane-containing Solanaceae and ephedrine, as revealed through the analysis of hair samples from a burial site. The hair samples contained psychoactive substances that are not typically used for pain relief or other medicinal purposes, indicating specialized knowledge and potential shamanic use. The concentration of ephedrine found was lower than in modern users, suggesting the alkaloid was consumed as plant material in the past. The tonsure ritual found at the site could be related to shamanic practices involving psychotropic plants, and the transformation into an animal depicted on carvings may relate to this use.An analysis of a human hair sample (OxA-8263) from a trilobed lid suggests a high probability range in the late 9th and early 8th century cal BCE. The sample was redated as a previous result was considered too modern for its archaeological context. A small fragment of wood from the same trilobed lid dates back to the beginning of the 1st millennium cal BCE. The container was produced and used before it was filled with hair and hoarded under the soil of Chamber 5. The analysis of the hair strands was carried out according to relevant guidelines, and chemical analysis was performed using an LPG-3400RS quaternary pump.Studies reveal evidence of psychoactive plant use in ancient cultures, including cannabis, opium, and tobacco. Researchers have detected alkaloids, such as nicotine and cocaine, in hair, dental calculus, and artifacts dating back to ancient Egypt and South America. The findings provide insight into ancient drug use practices, such as coca leaf chewing and snuff consumption. Some studies even suggest the medicinal use of nicotine in ancient populations. The research highlights the long history of human drug use and the importance of understanding the role of psychoactive plants in past cultures.A new study has reviewed the prehistoric sequence of Balearic prehistory and periodization of the prehistoric sequence through archaeological samples of hair, DNA, and plants. The study shows evidence of the use of psychoactive substances, including opium poppy seeds, in prehistoric humans in Menorca. Anthropologists and archaeologists have noted for years that extinct societies sometimes used intoxicants and inherted knowledge from them for therapeutic uses.Researchers have found evidence of drug use in the Bronze Age in Menorca, an island in the Western Mediterranean, through human hair analysis, according to a study. The hair belonged to two individuals buried between 1600–900 BCE in one of the island's caves. They tested positive for psychotropic drugs such as cocaine or tobacco and ephedra-based brew, suggesting multiple drugs were used in prehistoric Minorca. The study aims to establish a connection between prehistoric drug usage and ideology, demonstrating the presence of psychoactive plants or drugs in funerary and ritual contexts in prehistoric Minorca that has remained largely invisible to the archaeological record.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 20:59:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>NYPD officers brag about milking overtime in accidental recording</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-officers-brag-about-milking-overtime-call-detainees-names-in-accidental-recording</link><description>An accidental recording made by a construction worker during his arrest highlights police officers bragging about "milking overtime" and using derogatory language towards detainees. The recording exposes the daily work of police officers behind closed doors and sheds light on how a number of recent criminal justice reforms have impacted the way officers process arrests and collect overtime. Police officers have exceeded their annual overtime budget, and it's suggested they are taking advantage of changes to bail and discovery laws to accumulate additional overtime. Officers on the recording made insensitive comments about a woman they'd arrested, calling her a "liberal c--t," while officers joked about an accused suspect being designated as an emotionally disturbed person. The NYPD has declined to comment on the recording.No summary can be provided as the given text does not contain any relevant information regarding cutting-edge tech News.</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 21:11:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Show HN: ChatGDB – GPT-Powered GDB Assistant</title><link>https://github.com/pgosar/ChatGDB</link><description>GitHub - pgosar/ChatGDB: Harness the power of ChatGPT inside the GDB debugger!Skip to contentToggle navigation      Sign up          Product    Actions    Automate any workflow   Packages    Host and manage packages   Security    Find and fix vulnerabilities   Codespaces    Instant dev environments   Copilot    Write better code with AI   Code review    Manage code changes   Issues    Plan and track work   Discussions    Collaborate outside of code   Explore   All features     Documentation     GitHub Skills     Blog      Solutions    For   Enterprise     Teams     Startups     Education  By Solution   CI/CD &amp; Automation     DevOps     DevSecOps  Case Studies   Customer Stories     Resources      Open Source    GitHub Sponsors    Fund open source developers   The ReadME Project    GitHub community articles   Repositories   Topics     Trending     Collections  Pricing    In this repository       All GitHub   ↵   Jump to   ↵No suggested jump to results    In this repository       All GitHub   ↵   Jump to   ↵    In this user       All GitHub   ↵   Jump to   ↵    In this repository       All GitHub   ↵   Jump to   ↵        Sign in             Sign up          pgosar /ChatGDBPublic Notifications Fork  4      Star 183     Harness the power of ChatGPT inside the GDB debugger!

Use it to accelerate your debugging workflow by leveraging the power of ChatGPT to assist you while using GDB!It allows you to explain in natural language what you want to do, and then automatically execute the relevant command. Optionally, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the command it just ran or even pass in any question for it to answer. Focus on what's important - figuring out that nasty bug instead of chasing down GDB commands at the tip of your tongue.Installation instructionsFirst, make sure you install pip. ChatGDB alsorequires a python version of 3.3 or above.To install, run the command pip3 install chatgdb. It will create an executable calledchatgdb that you will have to use to set your api key. To do that, run the commandchatgdb -k &lt;API KEY&gt; Without the API key, you won't be able to make requests to OpenAI. The API key is stored intext in the same directory as the installed script, which is currently in your python site packagesfolder along with the main script. You can easily find this location by running the following in your terminal: python -m site --user-siteOptionally, you can also download the compressed files in the releases page to get the scripts directly.If you do this, navigate to the chatgdb folder, and you can install withpip3 install ..How to useI first recommend editing your $HOME/.gdbinit to source the main script automatically on startup. Run the following command:echo "source $(python -m site --user-site)/chatgdb/core.py" &gt; $HOME/.gdbinitWhile inside GDB the command chat appended by your query, for example chat list all breakpoints that I created. There is also a command called explain that you can use with no arguments to explain the previously run command, and optionally, with a query to just ask GPT a question. For example, running explain directly after running break 7 would prompt the tool to explain how breakpoints work. Running explain how input formatting works in gdb would prompt it to explain input formatting (see the image at the top).Run chat help to print out a short tutorial on how to use the tool.About   Harness the power of ChatGPT inside the GDB debugger!
