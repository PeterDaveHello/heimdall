GitHub Actions to Make Your GitHub Profile Dynamic</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/11#use-github-actions-to-make-your-github-profile-dynamic</link><description>GitHub users can make their profile dynamic using GitHub Actions by creating a repository with a README.md file containing desired profile information, adding folders for dynamic content, and adding a new subfolder for the script that scrapes data from a website and modifying it in the README.md file; the content for the profile is found by going to github.com/[username] in a web browser, with the repository being the source of the profile page; the new subfolder for the workflow is installed into [workflows] within the root directory, and a schedule is set to run the script once a week; users can use different languages, including Ruby, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python to make a dynamic profile; this technique enhances the GitHub profile of an individual, making it a more dynamic and ever-changing
