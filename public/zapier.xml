- The rocket was intentionally destroyed by its self-destruct system after multiple engines on the 33-engine booster failed to fire, causing it to lose altitude and tumble
- The rocket reached a maximum speed of about 1,300 mph (2,100 kph) and as high as 24 miles (39 kilometers), before going sideways and dropping
- Despite the failed launch, congratulations poured in from NASA chief Bill Nelson and others in the space industry, with many saying it represented significant progress toward a reusable super-heavy lift rocket
- SpaceX has more boosters and spacecraft lined up for more test flights, with CEO Elon Musk saying they had learned a lot for the next launch in a few months.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:58:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Spinning Diagrams with CSS</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#spinning-diagrams-with-css</link><description>- The spinning diagrams presented do not use JavaScript or animated image formats; rather, just HTML and CSS.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 20:57:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mullvad VPN was subject to a search warrant â€“ customer data not compromised</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#mullvad-vpn-was-subject-to-a-search-warrant--customer-data-not-compromised</link><description>- Mullvad VPN was visited by police officers from the National Operations Department of the Swedish Police with a search warrant to seize computers with customer data.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 12:27:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Shutting down my legal torrent site after 17 years</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#shutting-down-my-legal-torrent-site-after-17-years</link><description>- Legit Torrents, a legal torrent tracking site, shut down after 17 years due to hosting issues.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:09:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Google DeepMind</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#google-deepmind</link><description>- Google DeepMind is a new single, focused unit created by combining the talents and efforts of DeepMind and the Brain team from Google Research.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 17:11:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Only one pair of distinct positive integers satisfy the equation m^n = n^m</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#only-one-pair-of-distinct-positive-integers-satisfy-the-equation-mn--nm</link><description>- The article presents a proof for a number theoretic result, which shows that only one pair of distinct positive integers satisfies the equation n^m = m^n.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 01:59:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Show HN: A 15 min daily stretch routine for desk workers</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#show-hn-a-15-min-daily-stretch-routine-for-desk-workers</link><description>- A free 15-minute stretch routine has been created for desk workers to help them avoid aches and pains.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:46:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rural Americans are importing tiny Japanese pickup trucks</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#rural-americans-are-importing-tiny-japanese-pickup-trucks</link><description>- Rural Americans are importing tiny Japanese pickup trucks known as "Kei" trucks to take advantage of tax laws in Japan that allow smaller vehicles to be taxed less.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 20:10:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Imgur Updates TOS, Banning NSFW Content</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#imgur-updates-tos-banning-nsfw-content</link><description>- Imgur has updated its Terms of Service to ban NSFW (not safe for work) content.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 03:04:28 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>BuzzFeed News is shutting down</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/21#buzzfeed-news-is-shutting-down</link><description>- BuzzFeed News is shutting down, according to the company's CEO Jonah Peretti in a company-wide memo on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 15:18:25 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
