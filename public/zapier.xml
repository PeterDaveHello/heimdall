- Integrating AI tools can enhance efficiency without sacrificing quality 
- Human creativity, expertise, &amp; critical thinking cannot be replaced by AI 
- Software developers should embrace AI while recognizing its unique value.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 13:19:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why some researchers think I'm wrong about social media &amp; mental illness</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#why-some-researchers-think-im-wrong-about-social-media--mental-illness</link><description>- A debate among social scientists is ongoing on whether social media is the primary cause of the teenage mental illness epidemic.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 11:11:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>ChatPDF – Chat with Any PDF</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#chatpdf--chat-with-any-pdf</link><description>- ChatPDF offers a tool for enhanced learning experiences for students, aiding in comprehending textbooks and research papers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 09:59:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>The GTK+3 port of GIMP is officially finished</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#the-gtk3-port-of-gimp-is-officially-finished</link><description>- No meaningful content was found in the provided text.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 17:11:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Satellite takes image of another satellite</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#satellite-takes-image-of-another-satellite</link><description>- No meaningful content present; summary cannot be provided.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 20:10:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How to make good small games</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#how-to-make-good-small-games</link><description>- Making small games with simpler tools can increase the chances of success for new developers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 07:54:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Firefly – A new compiler &amp; runtime for BEAM languages</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#firefly--a-new-compiler--runtime-for-beam-languages</link><description>- Firefly is a compiler and runtime for BEAM languages, written in Rust, that enables compiling Elixir applications targeting WebAssembly
- Firefly can compile executables or libraries that act like OTP releases, but does not manage dependencies
- Firefly consists of three major components: Compiler, Libraries, and Runtimes, and sacrifices some features to enable additional optimizations
- LLVM 15 is required to build Firefly, and contributors should communicate with the core team first before implementing changes
- Firefly is not meant to replace BEAM and may lack required functionality, but offers an alternative implementation of Erlang/OTP with unique features
- The runtime design is the same as OTP but varies on codegen backend used, and Firefly makes it easy to extend the runtime with native functions implemented in Rust
- Firefly was previously named Lumen and is licensed under Apache 2.0.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 00:38:40 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Align Your Latents: High-Resolution Video Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#align-your-latents-highresolution-video-synthesis-with-latent-diffusion-models</link><description>- A team has developed Video Latent Diffusion Models (Video LDMs) for high-resolution video generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance at 512 x 1024 resolution.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 05:22:50 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>NaturalSpeech 2: Zero-shot speech &amp; singing synthesizers</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#naturalspeech-2-zeroshot-speech--singing-synthesizers</link><description>- NaturalSpeech 2, a new TTS system from Microsoft Research Asia and Microsoft Azure Speech, utilizes a latent diffusion model to synthesize natural voices with high expressiveness and strong zero-shot ability.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 13:20:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Qantas is bringing back Airbus A380s from the California desert</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#qantas-is-bringing-back-airbus-a380s-from-the-california-desert</link><description>- Qantas has retrieved their last Airbus A380 from the Victorville boneyard in California after almost 1000 days of storage due to the pandemic-induced grounding of long-haul aircraft.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 19:10:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Building telescopes on the Moon could transform astronomy</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/20#building-telescopes-on-the-moon-could-transform-astronomy</link><description>- Building telescopes on the Moon could transform astronomy
- Lunar exploration is undergoing a renaissance with many missions planned, including NASA's Artemis program which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by the middle of the decade
- The Moon offers advantages for observational astronomy with its stable surface and craters that receive no sunlight
- The far side of the Moon is particularly attractive for radio astronomy as it is permanently shielded from radio signals generated by humans on Earth, making it probably the most "radio-quiet" location in the whole solar system
- The lunar far side is also an ideal location for low-frequency radio astronomy, which can probe the structure of the early universe
- The Moon's low gravity also enables the construction of much larger telescopes than is feasible for free-flying satellites
- The cold, stable environment of permanently shadowed craters may also have advantages for instruments to detect gravitational waves and for studying solar wind and galactic cosmic rays
- However, there is a tension between human activities on the lunar far side and unwanted radio interference, and plans to extract water-ice from shadowed craters might make it difficult for those same craters to be used for astronomy.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 21:23:12 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
