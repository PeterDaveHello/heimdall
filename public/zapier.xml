- Writer believes that new housing should be affordable, as long as it doesn't affect the high selling price of their current home
- Writer acknowledges the high demand for housing, but believes developers should not reap the rewards, instead insisting on personal profits from selling their own home
- Writer is willing to support building new housing to lower prices, but only after their own sale clears escrow
- Writer hopes that all housing will be affordable in the future, excluding their own backyard.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 16:42:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>iOS 17 app sideloading might only be available in Europe</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/23#ios-17-app-sideloading-might-only-be-available-in-europe</link><description>- Rumors suggest iOS 17 app sideloading may only be available in Europe and not the US
- App sideloading allows installing apps from outside an official app store, like on macOS or Android
- Apple is likely adding sideloading due to regulatory pressure from the EU and may introduce the feature quietly without fanfare
- Developers may need to pay extra fees to have apps available outside the iOS App Store
- Apple has previously been under pressure from EU regulators over the issue of the App Store being perceived as a monopoly run by Apple, which could be why they are allowing apps to be installed from other sources.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 23:51:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why the brain's connections to the body are crisscrossed</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/23#why-the-brains-connections-to-the-body-are-crisscrossed</link><description>- Bilaterally symmetrical animals have cross-wired nerves, with nerves crisscrossing from one side of the body to the opposite side of the brain
- The brain's connections to the body are organized somatotopically to create a virtual map of the external world
- Cross-wiring avoids errors in mapping 3D space onto a 2D plane and replaces the need for complex uncrossed connections
- A small physical rotation of the body results in the flipping of perception maps, making it complex to maintain uncrossed connections
- Further biological research may be needed to uncover the connection between the brain and the body.</description><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 15:17:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Finetuning Large Language Models</title><link>https://hn.cho.sh/2023/04/23#finetuning-large-language-models</link><description>- Fine-tuning large language models has become increasingly important in the field of AI
- The article discusses three conventional feature-based and fine-tuning approaches for LLMs along with real-world results on a movie review classifier
- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques can minimize computational costs and resources while achieving high modeling performance
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback uses human ranking or rating to train a reward model that guides the language model's adaptation to human preferences
