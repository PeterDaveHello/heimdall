    "content": "Kashish Bastola, right, hugs fellow Harvard student Nahla Owens outside the Supreme Court in Washington on Thursday after the court struck down race-based affirmative action in college admission decisions. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)BY DAVID G. SAVAGESTAFF WRITER JUNE 29, 2023 UPDATED 6:36 PM PTFacebookTwitterShow more sharing optionsWASHINGTON \u2014 In another major reversal, the Supreme Court on Thursday struck down affirmative action policies at colleges and universities that use race as a factor in deciding who is admitted.In a pair of decisions, the six conservative justices ruled that Harvard, the nation\u2019s oldest private college, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the oldest state university, were illegally discriminating based on race and violating the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said the Constitution forbids treating people differently based on their race.ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThe entire point of the Equal Protection Clause is that treating someone differently because of their skin color is not like treating them differently because they are from a city or from a suburb, or because they play the violin poorly or well,\u201d he wrote.CALIFORNIAA lot of what you\u2019ve heard about affirmative action is wrongJune 29, 2023In dissent, liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson accused the majority of ignoring America\u2019s history as well as continuing racism today. \u201cOur country has never been colorblind,\u201d Jackson wrote.\u201cToday, this court stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress,\u201d Sotomayor wrote, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. \u201cThe court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.\u201dWhile the ruling will force many universities, including their law and medical schools, to change admissions policies, it won\u2019t prevent them from pursuing diversity or giving extra consideration to students who have overcome hardships or discrimination.Affirmative action supporters and opponents trade chants outside the Supreme Court on Thursday. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)School officials are likely to focus on a passage near the end of the chief justice\u2019s 40-page opinion:\u201cNothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant\u2019s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration, or otherwise,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cA benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination, for example, must be tied to that student\u2019s courage and determination. Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student\u2019s unique ability to contribute to the university. In other words, the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual \u2014 not on the basis of race.\u201dThe vote was 6 to 3 in the North Carolina case and 6 to 2 in the Harvard case, from which Jackson, a former member of Harvard\u2019s Board of Overseers, recused herself.Affirmative action, like abortion, has been a target of the conservative legal movement for decades, and the court\u2019s liberal precedents on these two major issues were put in danger when President Trump and Senate Republicans succeeded in appointing three new justices.The impact of the rulings is likely to be limited in California, however. The University of California and the California State University systems are prohibited from using race as an admissions factor under a ballot measure approved by voters in 1996. In 2020, voters rejected a measure that would have overturned the 1996 ban.Eight other states have followed California\u2019s lead in forbidding race-conscious admissions policies at state universities, including Michigan, Florida and Washington.But the ruling in the Harvard case extends that prohibition to private universities, including Stanford and USC.CALIFORNIA\u2018We\u2019re really worried\u2019: What do colleges do now after affirmative action ruling?June 29, 2023President Biden joined many Democrats and progressives in slamming the majority opinion.\u201cI strongly, strongly disagree with the court\u2019s decision,\u201d Biden said in remarks at the White House. \u201cDiscrimination still exists in America. Today\u2019s decision does not change that.\u201dHe proposed new guidance for colleges in the wake of the decision, urging them to take into account the adversity a student has overcome in the admissions process. \u201cWe need a new path forward, a path consistent with the law that protects diversity and expands opportunity,\u201d he said.A protester flies American flag during a rally with other members of the Asian American Coalition for Education outside of the Supreme Court of the United States on Thursday. (Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times)In its opinion, the high court criticized rulings dating to 1978 that held that universities had a compelling interest in seeking racial diversity on campus and could consider the race of Black and Latino students as a plus factor when choosing among well-qualified applicants.Those precedents had remained under challenge from conservatives, who argued that the Constitution and the civil rights law prohibited discrimination based on race, even where the consideration of race was intended to increase diversity and correct past injustices.A group called Students for Fair Admissions, created by financier Edward Blum, accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian American applicants in favor of Black and Latino applicants. He then filed a separate lawsuit against UNC for similar discrimination.Those suits lost in the lower courts. Judges said the two universities had made careful and limited use of race in seeking a diverse class of new students.OPINIONOpinion: Affirmative action isn\u2019t hurting Asian Americans. Here\u2019s why that myth survivesJune 14, 2023But the Supreme Court, with six conservatives, voted last year to take up the appeals.Blum hailed the outcome as a long-sought victory. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion \u201cmarks the beginning of the restoration of the colorblind legal covenant that binds together our multiracial, multiethnic nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe polarizing, stigmatizing and unfair jurisprudence that allowed colleges and universities to use a student\u2019s race and ethnicity as a factor to admit or reject them has been overruled.\u201dTimes staff writer Courtney Subramanian in Washington contributed to this report.",
    "summary": "- The Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action policies at colleges and universities that use race as a factor in admissions decisions, ruling that they are illegally discriminating based on race and violating the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.\n- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. stated that the Constitution forbids treating people differently based on their race and that students should be treated based on their experiences as individuals, not on the basis of race.\n- The impact of the rulings is likely to be limited in California, as the state already prohibits the use of race as an admissions factor in public universities, but the ruling extends the prohibition to private universities as well.",

    "hn_content": "The Supreme Court has struck down affirmative action in college admissions.\n\nThe concept of affirmative action is foreign to the author, who is not from the US, and they ask why race is part of the equation and not just socioeconomic status.\n\nAffirmative action was implemented to address historical discrimination against black Americans and is viewed as a way to promote equality.\n\nThe history of discrimination against black Americans includes slavery, Jim Crow laws, and systemic racism.\n\nSome argue that reparations should be considered for descendants of slaves to address the historical injustices.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling has generated a debate about whether race-based affirmative action is the most effective way to address inequality.\n\nAffirmative action policies have faced criticism for not addressing the broader socioeconomic disparities.\n\nThe US has a history of racism and it remains a contentious issue in politics.- The discussion centers around the topic of affirmative action and its impact on discrimination and identity.\n- The disagreement between individuals is whether perpetuating the logic of groups being advantaged over others through affirmative action is effective in fighting discrimination.\n- Some argue that discrimination persists even without legal enforcement and that affirmative action is necessary to address ongoing disparities.\n- Others believe that perpetuating group-based favoritism only amplifies sectarianism and that discrimination can only be stopped by not accepting the logic of identitarianism.\n- The conversation extends to the broader topics of reparations and historical injustices, with differing opinions on the extent and methods of addressing these issues.\n- The post highlights the importance of understanding the history and context of discrimination in order to work towards a more equitable future.- The discussion thread seems to revolve around the topic of historical wrongs and reparations\n- There is a debate about how to make things right for past suffering and what justice means\n- The concept of assigning blame and victimhood based on appearance is questioned and called unjust\n- The effectiveness and fairness of affirmative action policies are debated, with the suggestion of considering socioeconomic factors instead\n- Historical discrimination and racism in the United States are brought up as factors that still impact the present\n- The importance of addressing systemic issues and inequalities is highlighted\n- The complexity and nuances of addressing past wrongs and achieving equality are acknowledged\n- The need to focus on improving education and opportunities for disadvantaged communities is emphasized\n- The limitations and challenges of creating a racially equitable society are discussed.- The debate is centered around race-conscious policies and their effectiveness in addressing inequalities.\n- The Supreme Court has deemed race-conscious policies unconstitutional, but effectiveness is still subject to debate.\n- Affirmative action policies, specifically in college admissions, have resulted in benefits for underrepresented minority students.\n- Race-conscious admissions programs were previously implemented but have since been discontinued.\n- The ongoing discussion revolves around the goals of achieving equality of outcome versus equality of opportunity.\n- Achieving equality of opportunity is difficult due to the inherited nature of opportunity and wealth.\n- The impact of historical injustices, such as slavery and racial discrimination, is a factor in the debate.\n- Some argue for reparations as a form of compensating for historical injustices.\n- The complexity of the issue requires thoughtful consideration and nuanced solutions.\n- The focus should be on investing in disadvantaged communities and addressing societal issues to promote equality.- There is a heated discussion about affirmative action and its effectiveness in addressing racial inequality.\n- The commenters debate whether affirmative action is an appropriate solution to racial injustice and whether it should prioritize race or socioeconomic status.\n- The conversation touches on the experiences of other countries, like Brazil and India, and how they approach affirmative action.\n- Some commenters argue that focusing on socioeconomic status rather than race would be a fairer approach to addressing inequality.\n- Others argue that affirmative action is a necessary tool to promote diversity and equal opportunities in education and other sectors.\n- There is also a discussion about the Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action and its implications for college admissions.\n- Commenters mention the importance of considering class inequality and the need to improve public education and social infrastructure to uplift marginalized communities.\n- The debate highlights the complexity of the issue, with various perspectives on how to address racial inequality and promote equal opportunities.- Affirmative action programs aim to address systemic disadvantages faced by certain racial and ethnic groups in the United States.\n- The focus on race is intended to rectify historical and ongoing racial discrimination, particularly towards African Americans and Native Americans.\n- Affirmative action is not solely about helping individuals based on their economic status, as poverty is not the only factor contributing to racial disparities.\n- Diversity is a goal of affirmative action, as it seeks to increase representation from underrepresented communities in various fields and institutions.\n- The complex and intertwined nature of race in American society requires a multi-faceted approach to achieve equality and address systemic racism.\n- Affirmative action should not be viewed as a perfect solution, but rather one tool among many to promote equal opportunities and combat racial inequality.\n- It is important to recognize the historical context and ongoing impact of racism in order to understand the need for programs like affirmative action.- Affirmative action is a policy aimed at countering the effects of historical discrimination against certain racial groups in the US.\n- The purpose of affirmative action is to provide opportunities to disadvantaged individuals who have been historically marginalized.\n- Poor people of color, in particular, face significant challenges in accessing education and economic opportunities.\n- There is a correlation between race and socioeconomic status in the US, with minority groups often facing higher levels of poverty.\n- Affirmative action is a way to address this correlation and provide equal opportunities for underrepresented groups.\n- The effectiveness and fairness of affirmative action policies have been debated, with critics arguing for a more merit-based approach.\n- Some argue that income-based admission policies could be a more equitable alternative, but challenges such as segregated communities and systemic racism continue to hinder equal access to education.\n- Affirmative action is a complex issue with political, social, and historical implications that elicit diverse opinions and perspectives.",
    "hn_summary": "- The Supreme Court ruling on affirmative action in college admissions has generated a debate about its effectiveness in addressing inequality.\n- Some argue that race should not be the sole focus and that socioeconomic factors should be considered instead.\n- The discussion highlights the complexity of addressing historical injustices, the importance of understanding the context of discrimination, and the need to improve education and opportunities for disadvantaged communities."

My plan was to just submit a rougher version of the game, with 2-3 assets/sprites that were admittedly obviously AI generated from the hands, and to improve them prior to actually releasing the game as I wasn't aware Steam had any issues with AI generated art. I received this messageHello,While we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights.After reviewing, we have identified intellectual property in [Game Name Here] which appears to belongs to one or more third parties. In particular, [Game Name Here] contains art assets generated by artificial intelligence that appears to be relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties. As the legal ownership of such AI-generated art is unclear, we cannot ship your game while it contains these AI-generated assets, unless you can affirmatively confirm that you own the rights to all of the IP used in the data set that trained the AI to create the assets in your game.We are failing your build and will give you one (1) opportunity to remove all content that you do not have the rights to from your build.If you fail to remove all such content, we will not be able to ship your game on Steam, and this app will be banned.I improved those pieces by hand, so there were no longer any obvious signs of AI, but my app was probably already flagged for AI generated content, so even after resubmitting it, my app was rejected.Hello,Thank you for your patience as we reviewed [Game Name Here] and took our time to better understand the AI tech used to create it. Again, while we strive to ship most titles submitted to us, we cannot ship games for which the developer does not have all of the necessary rights. At this time, we are declining to distribute your game since it\u2019s unclear if the underlying AI tech used to create the assets has sufficient rights to the training data.App credits are usually non-refundable, but we\u2019d like to make an exception here and offer you a refund. Please confirm and we\u2019ll proceed.Thanks,It took them over a week to provide this verdict, while previous games I've released have been approved within a day or two, so it seems like Valve doesn't really have a standard approach to AI generated games yet, and I've seen several games up that even explicitly mention the use of AI. But at the moment at least, they seem wary, and not willing to publish AI generated content, so I guess for any other devs on here, be wary of that. I'll try itch io and see if they have any issues with AI generated games.Edit: Didn't expect this post to go anywhere, mostly just posted it as an FYI to other devs, here are screenshots since people believe I'm fearmongering or something, though I can't really see what I'd have to gain from that.Screenshots of rejection message452 commentssharesavehidereporttop 200 commentsshow all 452sorted by: bestWant to add to the discussion?Post a comment!CREATE AN ACCOUNT[\u2013]fisj[M] [score hidden] 19 hours ago stickied comment Please follow the subreddit guidelines and be respectful.

Modern AI is basically advanced automation. I know of no prior social action that has succeeded in getting advancements like this halted, and don't view one as likely. I suspect you don't view one as likely, either, if we are being honest. So fast forward a decade, artists will have AIs as part of their production line as a tool. \"You hear that, Mr. Anderson? That's the sound of inevitability.\"This is just going to be how it is, although you could also see some interests in authentic original works in and of their own right, especially things like buying original manual productions.You don't have to be an \"AI bro\" to see the trend developing and progressing here, my friend.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]Jacksaur -1 points 18 hours ago It's already being declared as theft by artists, by companies, and some courts have ruled you can't claim copyright over pieces.It will never replace actual artists.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]Ashmedai 2 points 18 hours ago* Inability to claim a copyright isn't an issue. You make a game with a piece of art that is in the public domain without any legal complexity. You can also modify the art, and if you do, the derivative work is protectable.I don't think artists are likely to prevail on their theft claims, unless a replicated piece meets the same tests as any previous court standards already in place (i.e., the AI produces an actual copy). The stylistic claims they are claiming would be a disaster for artists everywhere, if they were approved. Think about Disney's style inventory, and follow that to the inevitable conclusion (artists could suddenly find their own current works infringe a style held by Disney from an earlier date; what a nightmare).Anyway, do you know about any actual litigation where an artist has prevailed on a stylistic claim or a generative AI claim of any kind?permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (4 replies)load more comments (1 reply)[\u2013]hollowstrawberry 1 point 19 hours ago I mean yeah that guy is delusional but AI has a real use and provides real value unlike crypto scamsThe problem is copyright, and leaving artists without a jobpermalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]dyslexda 6 points 18 hours ago The problem is copyright, and leaving artists without a jobIf I'm in a fine arts class and am told to make a painting in the style of a given artist, and I do so by studying their works and mimicking them, nobody accuses me of \"copyright infringement.\" Nobody claims I stole that artist's work.

You would presumably say from which works of that artist you drew your inspiration, how you adapted their style, why you made the choices you did, and how your work therefore is transformative, not derivative. A generative AI cannot do any of that, so its work will at best be a shallow copy and at worst be an actual copy.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]dyslexda 2 points 18 hours ago A: humans can't overfitSo because I inherently can't be as great, it's fine? That seems a pretty shaky standard; do we single out art prodigies that can \"overfit\" as you term it and deem them copyright infringement? No, that would be ridiculous.B: you can cite your sources.In this ultra limited scenario, sure. But what about later on in my career? The whole point of the exercise in school is to teach you to use certain techniques and styles. Down the line I may create a work that is absolutely influenced by that original style, but at that point in time, I can't cite all the different works that went into my learning process.Ability to cite might be relevant for \"I created this piece explicitly to mimic this style.\" It's impossible for anyone to record the entirety of their learned experience observing other artists' works.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]Captain_Nipples 2 points 17 hours ago It does do that.

My favorite example is using rectified linear units as a network's activation function. It's such a simple concept, but didn't start making inroads until (roughly) a decade ago, at which point it was rapidly adopted and revolutionized the field. Who knows what the next such one is? Another is on ChatGPT itself, using its human reinforcement learning, then supplemented with its own reinforcement learning (went from humans writing appropriate responses for training, to itself generating responses and humans just had to mark them as good/bad).If the field never improves again, sure, we've mostly plateaued. I see no reason to believe the field won't have more advancements and produce stuff in 5 or 10 years we can't meaningfully imagine today, just like the idea of asking a bot on Discord to make images based on text was nothing but sci fi 15 years ago.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]cruiser-bazoozle 3 points 18 hours ago Hands was solved two months ago.

It would really suck if they got hit with a class action or had to take down thousands of games from their library, issuing refunds for all of them.They're doing the legally smart thing by rejecting AI generated content. As it currently stands, all AI generated content is essentially public domain, meaning that the game developer does not have exclusive rights to it and therefore can't sign a standard contract with Valve for distribution. Valve needs to write new contracts, and they clearly want to wait to see how the laws change before doing that.It seems like they're willing to risk it with developers who use open source AI and train it exclusively off of data that they control the copyright of.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]Numai_theOnlyOne 1 point 4 hours ago Oh yes it will. There aren't as many asset flips as everyone thought when unity and unreal went free, but back then with greenlight it was plagued with every game being low quality. I get the impression steam is now doing the same.AI is great as a tool but you indeed own nothing and are completely liable to any copyright claim, putting a tremendous risk on AI usage in final products. Not only this it favors cheap and fast content output and not quality. Like asset flips.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]pseudorandom 10 points 23 days ago In most the world (including the US where valve is), violations of copyright are penalized in an absurdly harsh manner. A few thousand sales by valve could result in liability that exceeds the value of the entire company. I disagree with valve's position, but I can understand how they wouldn't want to bet the company on smaller games.Eventually the issue of whether AI training data violates copyright will be resolved, but until it is I expect many companies to follow Valve's direction.permalinkembedsavereportreply[\u2013]dementedsnake 1 point 20 hours ago They're basically saying that they're afraid of legal battles, so they're not allowing any of the content until that's settled.Sucks, especially since I was making a game with small AI generated textures and stuff.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]namelessted 3 points 18 hours ago Having a blanket ban on all AI generated content could also open them up to lawsuit for being anti-competitive in some way.Like, what if a dev trained their own AI model based on their own art or based on a dataset that they can prove that they have the rights to use?Maybe some sort of class action lawsuit of small indie devs being unfairly blocked from releasing games on steam because they use AI tools. What is the difference between an artist using content fill in Photoshop vs an indie dev using Stable Diffusion?Valve should just let people publish, and if somebody claims copyright infringement against a game then deal with it on a case by case basis. It's not like somebody at Valve is currently going through every single asset in every single video game and determining if they absolutely have the right to use every single asset in every single game.It's just as easy to outright steal assets that aren't AI generated and put them in a game and publish it in steam as it is to use AI tools, it might actually be even easier, right?permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]Ann_Tique 3 points 15 hours ago Valve owns the marketplace, they can decide what and whatnot gets put on it. It won't open them up to a lawsuit. This was decided in Apple vs. Epic games, and that had more ground to stand on.A developer can still publish their game, they just have to make sure the assets they make are owned by them (I.E. can claim copyright on them) which you can't currently do for AI generated art. So they either pick up the tablet and make them themselves or they pay someone to make it for them, it's a requirement for the marketplace they wish to post on.If they steal assets, that's on them, Valve can operate under faith they were lied too, and in cases where that has been true, Valve has removed them and sometimes even banned the dev from publishing on Steam, but it's common knowledge that AI generated content was likely trained on various, unconsenting, unpaid artists, so Valve knowing that and allowing publishing, would be liable if an artist can ultimately prove they had copyright over the image that was used to train the data, (which will eventually happen), Valve will be liable as much as the developer.Valve is simply choosing to avoid it all together.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]MVRKHNTR 0 points 17 hours ago That's not how any of that works.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (1 reply)[\u2013]platypus_plumba 0 points 17 hours ago Let me know which dev has enough art to train a model like StableDiffusion.

They will need to obtain these licenses from whoever owns the 'master'.If our legislators were doing their job, they would mandate that any AI output would also have to list its sources.AI might be new, but intellectual property law is not.permalinkembedsavereportreply[\u2013]SexDrugsAndWhatEver 7 points 15 hours ago this take is very .. reliant on precedent that may not apply. more likely this is still undecided law and it will take a court case that goes all the way to the supreme court to settle it. generative AI isn't 'sampling' any more than you or I are 'sampling' when creating output after consuming various media - so long as there is significant difference between the samples and the output.for someone to successfully bring a case, they would have to be able to point to work A produced by AI and then point to work B that they have rights to and prove that A is a derivative work of B in some meaningful way. for some AI generated content im sure that's doable, but it isn't clear that every work produced by AI should be impacted.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]sarahlwalks 4 points 14 hours ago This.

We're not talking about taking one work and modifying it so that it is slightly different, we're talking about using a million works, none of them saved directly, to train a general algorithm that is good at art.The obvious ethics and hopeful legal status should be that de minimis use of any piece of work should have zero OP obligations. Possibly contributing 1/1000000th to a final work is not something we should give rights to, as keep in mind that all IP rights are at the expense of freedom of expression rights.Even if we're going to say on the net that it's good that Marvel can control Spiderman, we shouldn't go so far as to prohibit all coming of age stories that involve someone with spider based powers. Hell, coming of age stories and spirit animals / animal based powers or kinship are older than most civilizations.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]ogrestomp 2 points 12 hours ago It\u2019s not sampling though. In sampling, parts of the original are used in the derivative work. I work with ai models, not using them to generate art or stories, the actual models. I containerize them and build apis so that data scientists can offer their models as a micro service.I want to preface this by saying I do think there will be laws written and rules to deter works from being included in datasets. For instance maybe new laws around data privacy may inadvertently make it so that data sets need explicit and recorded permission to include anything that isn\u2019t in the public space, including copy written content, but as it stands the laws are not written yet to include what actually happens when these things are trained. AI ethics is a huge talking point in the space, and I know first hand that companies are trying to navigate this because everyone knows it\u2019s just a matter of time before laws and rules come through. At my startup for instance, we implemented a mandatory documentation workflow before uploading any models. Part of that documentation is an explicit statement of what types of datasets were used to train the model. An uploaded can refuse to document, but we put that they refused on record with the model details so that users can decide for themselves.Now to my point. The popular opinion of how AI generates content is woefully ignorant due to media oversimplifying the concepts so that their audience, who aren\u2019t experts, can follow along. AI models do not sample anything. There actually is a completely different program used to \u201ctrain a model\u201d than the one used to generate content. The one generating is called the inference. Training occurs and data is fed in. None of the original data becomes part of the model. Instead, the data is used to trigger data flows. Those flows then store whether they were activated by a particular piece of the data. The data itself is only used to trigger those flows. In this way, there is no way to recreate anything that was fed into it. You can\u2019t claim copyright on weighted values stored. A ruling against this would open pandoras box on restricting a whole lot of things that are already established. AI learns patterns, similar to how certain tropes exist through different shows or movies. Then it applies those patterns into a completely new canvas. Once the model is trained, there are files that get passed to the inference. The inference then takes new input, say a prompt, and creates a new image by feeding the prompt through the flows and with a random seed generator, flows are activated based on the new prompt and a new image is generated.

But using publicly available models that use copyrighted work as training data is a HUGE legal grey area that you frankly shouldn't be exploring if you're trying to make a commercially licensed product.Going back and modifying something generated with such a model doesn't make it original either. The burden of proof that your changes are transformative falls on you in a legal case.permalinkembedsavereportreply[\u2013]Godphila -1 points 19 hours ago Yeah!

They are obviously staying on the safe side of the IP bomb that is generative ai. You may think it's bad for you to reject your game containing ai art, even after it's been modified, but what would be a lot worse for them would be to have steam accept the games, then be sued for hosting IP theft, lose, and have to take way more drastic actions, such as deleting games already bought by its clients.Until IP rights are clarified regarding ai generated data this is the safe approach: accept only content generated by ai trained on assetMaybe cuz it's already available, maybe they add these rules right now for future games, and in a second time going back on every games they allowed in the past and say \"Hey, nont possible anymore, sry dude\"permalinkembedsaveparentreportreplyload more comments (1 reply)[\u2013]jecowa 1 point 16 hours ago That game might be part of the reason for the ban.permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[\u2013]goswym 1 point 22 hours ago You (purposely?) ignored the \"relying on copyrighted material owned by third parties\"Valve's intention as a platform is remaining a safe harbor.

AAA studios would need to actually start trying and not make such awful choices. To go deeper here, AAA studios have had a track record of making bad games and charge a lot of money for them, not to mention how abusive they could be towards their own employees. Giving AAA a chance to \"catch up\" and set up a foundation for AI in the field of game development would be in their best interest.This resistance towards AI in general though will halt some serious progress.We really needed people like Andrew Yang to help get things moving, and give people a new way forward. If we already had some form of UBI, many wouldn't be as worried about their \"job being lost.\"Sad really.I assumed, in light of AI, creating, working, living itself, what have you, would be smooth sailing from here on out... but I see... we still have a ways to go.permalinkembedsavereportreply[\u2013]SawnFx 1 point 10 hours ago I guess that involved games are very small \"indie\" games, which represent nothing to Valve & steam.

AI generated content was only possible because it was trained off of others existing artwork without consent.I get it, the work generated is technically new, but at the end of the day it was built off others hard work. It can take decades to perfect a style, anatomy, color theory, etc... And all of that is taken without permission to advance an AI. When all of this was open source, I had plenty of friends finding their content in the training model.Screw that, I'm okay with it if it is trained off of licensed content, but beyond that it needs a hard reset.We can debate the difference between inspiration between man and robot, but at the end of the day copyright exists to protect people, not programs.AI's end goal and purpose is to replace people for corporate profit. \ud83e\udee4So you're just going to have to hire an artist.permalinkembedsavereportreplyload more comments (2 replies)[\u2013]Samuraiking 1 point 8 hours ago Do you not have rights to AI art you generate?

The first edition was written by Al Aho, Brian Kernighan and Peter Weinberger in 1988. Awk has evolved since then, there are multiple implementations, and of course the computing world has changed enormously. The new edition of the Awk book reflects some of those changes.The book will be available by the end of September. In the meantime, we will add material that we hope will be of interest -- historical documents, bits of code, and occasional essays on Awk and related topics.Awk Source and DocumentationAwk source is maintained at https://github.com/onetrueawk/awk.Gawk releases are at https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk; the Gawk manual is here.Arnold Robbins has compiled a list of other implementations of Awk.Historical DocumentsThe citations in the original Awk book have by now become quite dusty, but some of the material is still interesting and potentially useful. Here are references to some of the documents, perhaps updated.AWK - A Pattern Scanning and Processing Language, the original Awk paper from Software Practice and Experience, 1979.CSTR 118: An internal technical report on Awk, dated June 1985, so it's not the original language but more or less the one described in the Awk book in 1988.dformat: Dformat is an Awk program, originally written by Jon Bentley, for drawing data-format diagrams. The version here comes from Arnold Robbins (to whom thanks), who has fixed it up and made it work properly in today's environments.chem: Chem was an experiment in little languages, a language for describing chemical structure diagrams. (Think benzene rings on steroids.) It wasn't much used but it was a good exercise. The link above is to a somewhat blurry but complete PDF of the original chem paper by Bentley, Lynn Jelinski and bwk, published in Computational Chemistry in 1987.indexing programs: One of the examples in the original Awk book was a simplified version of indexing tools first created by Jon Bentley, and used both for both editions of the book. The link above provides the code; the paper published in Electronic Publishing -- Origination Dissemination and Design in 1988 is temporarily unavailable.Algorithm animation: by Jon Bentley and bwk. The paper A System for Algorithm Animation (1991) describes a system for embedding simple graphics commands in program output that could be used to display an \"animated\" version of the output. It all worked on monochrome displays, so it's totally dated now, but it was neat at the time. The original Computing Science Technical Report (CSTR) 132 is here.Netlib's typesetting collection Includes some links to chem and indexing programsInterview with Al Aho about Awk in Computerworld, May 2008Interview with Brian Kernighan about Awk and AMPL, Computerworld, October 2009",

There's a fair bit of the original content (which is still great), but Kernighan's done a great job with some good restructuring and some significant updates, too. The early chapters are very hands-on, with something of a focus on \"exploratory data processing\", particularly with CSV files. Big data with AWK, you could say.Gawk and awk will soon have a new \"--csv\" option that enables proper CSV input mode (parsing files with quoted and multiline fields per the CSV RFC). I'm really glad Arnold Robbins added a robust \"--csv\" implementation to Gawk, too, because that's really the most-heavily used version of AWK nowadays. I've already got CSV support in my own GoAWK implementation, and I'll be adding \"--csv\" to make it compatible.I'm really glad this new updated version is coming out!replySimon_O_Rourke 21 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]> Gawk and awk will soon have a new \"--csv\" option that enables proper CSV input modeAwesome!!!!

You see a bunch of ugly not really structured text 500 MB files that you can't pull into pandas, or easily parse into python dicts?

Often, they see programming in python, as part of their \u201cidentity\u201d - so they\u2019re overly invested in it, to the detriment of other wonderful languages, like awk.I used to code perl myself, back in the day - but I came to appreciate the simplicity of awk, and now it\u2019s one of my favourites. I no longer code perl, as a consequence, as I believe awk to be far more elegant! I wouldn\u2019t have done so, if I was overly invested in being a \u201cperl programmer\u201d.replyineedasername 11 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Amazing, takes me back.~One of my first big projects at my first job fresh out of college was using sed & awk to semi-automate the transformation of semi-unstructured data into a database.IIRC I couldn't completely automate because it contained author names, from global naming conventions. (parsing names correctly is deceptively complex) They had somewhat arbitrary #'s of initials ranging from 0-3.Again, IIRC, I could easily accommodate 0 or 1 initial (followed by \\.) but trying for more would make the regex I was using too greedy and pull in part of the article abstract. These were scientific books and journals.So I scripted a sed & awk program to detect the possibility of > 1 initials and when that occured, I'd pipe the record into nano for a quick review where I manually inserted the correct \\. characters for the initials.It was decades of back-catalogue publications for digitization so I sat there for days, listening to music on an original 1st gen iPod, waiting for my duct-taped kludge of a program to pipe one of thousands of records into a nano session every few minutes. This was on an Apple G4 workstation running OS X, where I earned my real bash scripting chops. It was an awful hack by today's standards, but at the time, accomplishing what was expected to be a 1-year long project in ~1 month, it was seen as nearly miraculous.replyasicsp 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Have to wait, as \"The book will be available by the end of September\"See https://hn.algolia.com/?q=The+AWK+Programming+Language for discussion on the first editionDidn't know there was a list of `awk` implementations: https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Other-Ver...replykar1181 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]One of the first utilities I had to get to grips with way back was awk, and it serves me well to this day.

I scratched my itch and built my own shell, marcel: https://github.com/geophile/marcel.I mention this specifically, here, because of the CSV point. Marcel handles CSV, e.g. \"read --csv foobar.csv\" reads the foobar.csv file, parses the input (getting quotes and commas correct), and yields a stream of Python tuples, splitting each line of the CSV into the elements of the output tuples.Marcel also supports JSON input, translating JSON structures into Python equivalents.

    "content": "Simon Willison\u2019s TILsCLI tools hidden in the Python standard librarySeth Michael Larson pointed out that the Python gzip module can be used as a CLI tool like this:python -m gzip --decompress pypi.db.gzThis is a neat Python feature: modules with a if __name__ == \"__main__\": block that are available on Python's standard import path can be executed from the terminal using python -m name_of_module.Seth pointed out this is useful if you are on Windows and don't have the gzip utility installed.This made me wonder: what other little tools are lurking in the Python standard library, available on any computer with a working Python installation?Finding them with ripgrepI decided to take a sniff around the standard library and see what I can find.Jim Crist-Harif pointed me to python -m site, which outputs useful information about your installation:python3.11 -m sitesys.path = [  '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11',  '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python311.zip',  '/opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload',  '/opt/homebrew/lib/python3.11/site-packages',  '/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages',]USER_BASE: '/Users/simon/Library/Python/3.11' (doesn't exist)USER_SITE: '/Users/simon/Library/Python/3.11/lib/python/site-packages' (doesn't exist)ENABLE_USER_SITE: TrueThis showed me that the standard library itself for my Homebrew installation of Python 3.11 is in /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11.So I switched there and used ripgrep to find likely packages:cd /opt/homebrew/Cellar/python@3.11/3.11.4_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11Then ran rg:rg 'if __name__ =' -l | grep -v 'test/' \\ | grep -v 'tests/' | grep -v idlelib | grep -v turtledemoThe -l option causes ripgrep to list matching files without showing the context of the match.I built up those grep -v exclusions over a few iterations - idlelib/ and turtledemo/ have a bunch of matches that I wasn't interested in.Update: Here's an alternative way of expressing that search:rg 'if __name__ =' -l | grep -v -e 'test/' -e 'tests/' -e idlelib -e turtledemogrep -v still means \"everything that doesn't match this\" - but then the multiple -e '...' patterns are used to construct a \"this pattern or this pattern or this pattern\" filter. This saves on having to pipe through grep -v multiple times.

It's a regex-based tokenizer[1] in the `re` module, that for reasons is completely missing from any official documentation.You give it a pattern for each token type, and a function to be called on each match, and you get back a list of processed tokens.Importantly, it processes the list in one pass and ensures the matches are contiguous, where a naive `re.findall` with capture groups will ignore unmatched characters. You also get a reference to the running scanner, so you can record the location of the match for reporting errors.  import re  scanner = re.Scanner([   (r\"[0-9]+\",    lambda scanner, token:(\"INTEGER\", int(token))),   (r\"[a-z_]+\",   lambda scanner, token:(\"IDENTIFIER\", token)),   (r\"[,.]+\",    lambda scanner, token:(\"PUNCTUATION\", token)),   (r\"\\s+\", None), # None == skip token.  ])  results, remainder = scanner.scan(\"45 pigeons, 23 cows, 11 spiders.\")  assert not remainder  print(results)  [('INTEGER', 45),   ('IDENTIFIER', 'pigeons'),   ('PUNCTUATION', ','),   ('INTEGER', 23),   ('IDENTIFIER', 'cows'),   ('PUNCTUATION', ','),   ('INTEGER', 11),   ('IDENTIFIER', 'spiders'),   ('PUNCTUATION', '.')][0]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/693818/252218[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#TokenizationreplyTimon3 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]It seems like the discussion of whether to document it died in April of 2003: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2003-April/0350...Bummer, it's a cool feature, but I don't feel safe relying on undocumented features.replybombolo 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Especially now that they are on a crusade against their own stdlib.They regret including most modules\u2026 it seems they regret making python altogether instead of sticking with C? :DreplyZnafon 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This is quite an oversimplification.

You have to do a little more stitching to get the `Scanner` behavior. But it does everything the Python does: a single scan (using finite automata and not backtracking like Python), skip certain token types and guarantees that the entirety of the haystack is consumed.replyfastasucan 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]'A bit more verbose' = 2,5 times as many characters.

When I learned kotlin, I read through their official docs, and knew about most language features in a day.

For instance decorators was (still is?) not mentioned at all in the official tutorial.replyroelschroeven 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The tutorial is not supposed to cover all language features: \"This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python\u2019s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language\u2019s flavor and style.\"But then I don't know how you're supposed to learn the features that are not in the tutorial. You can have a look at the table of contents of the standard library documentation for modules that might interest you, but that doesn't cover language features. Those are documented in The Python Language Reference, but that document is not really suited for learning from.There are lots of websites and Youtube channels and so on, but you have to find them, and filter out the not-so-good ones which is not easy, especially for a beginner. I think there is room for some kind of official advanced tutorial to cover the gap.replyfastasucan 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I agree.

For example, if you have a directory my_pkg/ with files mod1.py and mod2.py, then  # In my_pkg/mod2.py  import my_pkg.mod1will work if you run `python -m my_pkg.mod2` but will fail if you run `python my_pkg/mod2.py`However, the script syntax does work properly with absolute paths if if you set the enviornment variable `PYTHONPATH=.` (I don't know about relative paths - I don't use those). That would presumably allow pdb to work (but, shame on me, I've never tried it).replyscruple 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I also develop and run projects this way.

People who have experience with Julia and Matlab are very used to a trial and error programming style in a console and bare python does not address this needreplyjohnnymellor 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Not supporting multi-line statements is just because pdb doesn't bother to parse the statement to work out if it is an incomplete multi-line statement. That could be easily fixed (I have a prototype patch for that using `code.compile_command`).The scope problems are more fundamental:The pdb REPL calls[1] the exec builtin as `exec(code, frame.f_globals, frame.f_locals)`, which https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec documents as:\"If exec gets two separate objects as globals and locals, the code will be executed as if it were embedded in a class definition.\"And https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#reso... documents that:\"The scope of names defined in a class block is limited to the class block; it does not extend to the code blocks of methods - this includes comprehensions and generator expressions since they are implemented using a function scope.\"This is a fundamental limitation of `exec`. You can workaround it by only passing a single namespace dictionary to exec instead of passing separate globals and locals, which is what pdb's interact command does[2], but then it's ambiguous how to map changes to that dictionary back to the separate globals and locals dictionaries (pdb's interact command just discards any changes you make to the namespace). This too could be solved, but requires either brittle ast parsing or probably a PEP to add new functionality to exec. I'll file a bug against Python soon.[1]: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/25a64fd28aaaaf2d21fae...[2]: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/25a64fd28aaaaf2d21fae...replyjohnnymellor 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Oh, and multi-line statements will be supported from Python 3.13 (https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103124)replymejutoco 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]After triggering pdb by having \"breakpoint()\" in tour python code and dropping in the debugger you can type \"interactive\" in the console to enter multiline strings.replyBiteCode_dev 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]TIL again.

The approach tracks changes in the distances between Earth and beacon stars in its Galactic neighbourhood called pulsars, which reveal how the space in between is stretched and squeezed by the passage of gravitational waves.Whereas the original discovery spotted waves originating from the collision and merger of two star-sized black holes, the most likely source of the latest finding is the combined signal from many pairs of much larger black holes \u2014 millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun \u2014 slowly orbiting each other in the hearts of distant galaxies. These waves are thousands of times stronger and longer than those found in 2015, with wavelengths of up to tens of light years. By contrast, the ripples detected since 2015 using a technique called interferometry are just tens or hundreds of kilometres long.\u201cWe can tell that the Earth is jiggling due to gravitational waves that are sweeping our Galaxy,\u201d says Scott Ransom, an astrophysicist at the US National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Charlottesville, Virginia, and a senior member of NANOGrav, one of four collaborations that announced separate results on 29 June1\u20134.\u201cWe\u2019re not using the \u2018d\u2019 word \u2014 for detection \u2014 yet,\u201d says Ransom. \u201cBut we do think this is strong evidence.\u201d Each group has seen hints of an expected signature of gravitational waves, but without the statistical certainty of a firm discovery, Ransom and others say. Researchers will now pool their data to see if they can reach that threshold together.\u201cIf this is confirmed, we\u2019ll have 20 years of work studying this new background,\u201d says Monica Colpi, who studies the theory of gravitational waves and black holes at the University of Milan\u2013Bicocca in Italy. \u201cIt will put an army of astrophysicists to work.\u201dCatching a waveThree collaborations have amassed decades\u2019 worth of pulsar data and are reporting similar results: the North American group NANOGrav; the European Pulsar Timing Array, with the contribution of astronomers in India; and the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array in Australia. A fourth collaboration, the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array, says it has found a signal with merely three years of data, owing to the exceptional sensitivity of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), which opened in 2016 in the Guizhou region.Keija Lee, a radio astronomer at Peking University in Beijing who led the FAST study, says he was not surprised by the result4. \u201cMy calculation for the gravitational-wave sensitivity of FAST observation was done back in 2009, when I was a PhD student.\u201dAn artist\u2019s impression of gravitational waves caused by supermassive black holes.Credit: Danielle Futselaar, MPIfRAll the groups use massive radio telescopes to monitor \u2018millisecond\u2019 pulsars. These are incredibly dense neutron stars that spew radio waves from their magnetic poles. Each time a pulsar rotates on its axis, its radio beam travels in and out of the line of sight to Earth, resulting in a pulse with regular intervals. Millisecond pulsars rotate the fastest, up to several hundred times per second.\u201cWe can use them basically as clocks,\u201d says Andrew Zic, a radio astronomer at the Australia Telescope National Facility in Sydney and a lead author of the Parkes paper3. Slight changes in the arrival time of a pulsar\u2019s signals can mean that the space between the star and Earth has been altered by the passage of a gravitational wave.The timing of a single pulsar would not be reliable enough to detect gravitational waves. Instead, each collaboration monitors an array of dozens. As a result, they have found a signature called the Hellings\u2013Downs curve, which predicts how, in the presence of gravitational waves coming from all possible directions, the correlation between pairs of pulsars varies as a function of their separation in the sky. NANOGrav was first to spot the signal1, and reported it to colleagues in 2020. But the team decided to wait for the other collaborations to see hints of the curve before publishing.The Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia is another radio telescope used in the pulsar-monitoring effort.Credit: Jay Young for Green Bank Observatory\u201cSeeing the Hellings\u2013Downs curve actually appear for the first time in a real way \u2014 that was a beautiful moment,\u201d says Chiara Mingarelli, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and a member of NANOGrav. \u201cI\u2019m never tiring of seeing it.\u201dAlberto Vecchio, an astrophysicist at the University of Birmingham, UK, and a member of the European team, says his first reaction when he saw his group\u2019s results2 was, \u201cBloody hell, there could be something interesting here.\u201dThe long gameEinstein first predicted gravitational waves in 1916. On 14 September 2015, the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in Louisiana and Washington State confirmed his prediction by detecting a burst of waves from the merger of two black holes. Physicists have since captured gravitational waves from dozens of such events.If the latest signal is from the combined gravitational waves of thousands of pairs of supermassive black holes across the Universe, it would be the first direct evidence that such binaries exist and that some have orbits tight enough to produce measurable gravitational waves. Colpi says a major implication is that each of the pairs will ultimately merge \u2014 creating bursts similar to the ones seen by LIGO, but on a much larger scale. The signals of some of these collisions will be detected in space by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), a European Space Agency mission due to launch in the 2030s.Researchers hope that they will eventually go beyond the Hellings\u2013Downs curve and see signals of individual supermassive-black-hole binaries close enough to our Galaxy \u2014 and therefore loud enough, in gravitational-wave terms \u2014 to stand out of the background signal. \u201cTo see an isolated source, it has to be really strong,\u201d says Vecchio.But for now, other origins of these waves cannot be ruled out, including possible residual gravitational noise from the Big Bang.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long and patient game,\u201d says Zic. \u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to open the window into this ultra-low-frequency gravitational-wave spectrum.\u201ddoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02167-7ReferencesAgazie, G. et al.

Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersHealthAspartame sweetener to be declared possible cancer risk by WHO, say reportsArtificial sweetener used in thousands of products reportedly to be labelled \u2018possibly carcinogenic to humans\u2019Andrew Gregory Health editor@andrewgregoryThu 29 Jun 2023 10.02 EDTFirst published on Thu 29 Jun 2023 08.16 EDTA popular artificial sweetener used in thousands of products worldwide including Diet Coke, ice-cream and chewing gum is to be declared a possible cancer risk to humans, according to reports.The World Health Organization\u2019s cancer research arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), has conducted a safety review of aspartame and will publish a report next month.It is preparing to label the sweetener as \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d, Reuters reported on Thursday. That would mean there is some evidence linking aspartame to cancer, but that it is limited. The IARC has two more serious categories, \u201cprobably carcinogenic to humans\u201d and \u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d.Artificial sweeteners linked to increased risk of heart disease, study findsRead moreRevealed: Christian \u2018hate group\u2019 funds USThe move is likely to prove controversial. The IARC has faced criticism for causing alarm about hard-to-avoid substances or situations.It previously put working overnight and consuming red meat into its probably cancer-causing class, and listed using mobile phones as possibly cancer-causing.The IARC safety review was conducted to assess whether or not aspartame is a potential hazard, based on all the published evidence, a person familiar with the matter told the Guardian. However, it does not take into account how much of a product a person can safely consume.That advice comes from a separate WHO expert committee on food additives, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (Jecfa), which has also been reviewing aspartame use this year. It is due to announce its findings on the same day the IARC makes public its decision, on 14 July.\u201cIARC has assessed the potential carcinogenic effect of aspartame (hazard identification),\u201d an IARC spokesperson confirmed to the Guardian. \u201cFollowing this, the joint FAO/WHO expert committee on food additives will update its risk assessment exercise on aspartame, including the reviewing of the acceptable daily intake and dietary exposure assessment for aspartame. The result of both evaluations will be made available together, on 14 July 2023.\u201dAspartame has been widely used since the 1980s as a table-top sweetener, and in products such as diet fizzy drinks, chewing gum, breakfast cereals and cough drops.It is authorised for use globally by regulators who have reviewed all the available evidence, and major food and beverage makers have for decades defended their use of it.The food industry expressed serious concerns about the reports on Thursday.\u201cIARC is not a food safety body,\u201d said Frances Hunt-Wood, the secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association. \u201cAspartame is one of the most thoroughly researched ingredients in history, with over 90 food safety agencies across the globe declaring it is safe, including the European Food Safety Authority, which conducted the most comprehensive safety evaluation of aspartame to date.\u201dThe International Council of Beverages Associations executive director, Kate Loatman, suggested the move \u201ccould needlessly mislead consumers into consuming more sugar rather than choosing safe no- and low-sugar options\u201d.There is existing evidence that raises questions about the potential impact of aspartame on cancer risk. A study in France involving about 100,000 adults last year suggested those who consumed larger amounts of artificial sweeteners including aspartame had a slightly higher cancer risk. A study from the Ramazzini Institute in Italy in the early 2000s reported that some cancers in mice and rats were linked to aspartame.The price of \u2018sugar free\u2019: are sweeteners as harmless as we thought?Read moreThe Guardian understands the IARC collected 7,000 research references to aspartame, and included 1,300 studies in the package of materials assessed by experts. \u201cWe really need to wait and see the full IARC evaluation before we can make any firm conclusions,\u201d said Oliver Jones, a professor of chemistry at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cWithout that we are really shooting in the dark.\u201dProf Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, said an IARC label of being possibly carcinogenic \u201cdoes not mean that a substance actually presents a risk to humans in normal circumstances\u201d.The more important finding would be what Jecfa concluded about aspartame intake, he said.\u201cBack in 1981 they established an acceptable daily intake of aspartame, of 40 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. To consume over that limit would require a very large daily consumption of Diet Coke or similar drinks. On 14 July, Jecfa may change that risk assessment, or they may not.\u201dI hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I wondered if you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian\u2019s journalism. With this year\u2019s session coming to an end, the supreme court\u2019s approval ratings are at record lows and its legitimacy is in crisis.That should come as no surprise: a far-right movement has helped seat justices who have redefined public life through precedent-shattering decisions that most Americans do not support. In addition to taking away the right to abortion from half the country and ending affirmative action, the supreme court has enabled a deluge of money into politics, the proliferation of guns in public spaces, the gutting of environmental protections and more.As recent revelations have made clear, some supreme court justices do not follow basic ethical standards, and an absence of limits on their power means they can operate, in many ways, above the law. That makes the job of journalists all the more important. At the Guardian, our reporting is produced to serve the public interest; we have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. And our unique, reader-supported model means that readers around the world can access the Guardian\u2019s paywall-free journalism \u2013 whether they can afford to pay for news, or not.Help us hold power to account by supporting the Guardian\u2019s journalism today.

There may be various metrics around what requires an update, and there may be one or more layers of approval needed.Problems: Delayed or missed updates. Customers complain that you're not being honest about outages.Stage 2: Status is automatically set based on the outcome of some monitoring check or functional test.Problems: Any issue with the system that performs the \"up or not?\" source of truth test can result in a status change regardless of whether an actual problem exists. \"Override automatic status updates\" becomes one of the first steps performed during incident response, turning this into \"status is manually set, but with extra steps\". Customers complain that you're not being honest about outages and latency still sucks.Stage 3: Status is automatically set based on a consensus of results from tests run from multiple points scattered across the public internet.Problems: You now have a network of remote nodes to maintain yourself or pay someone else to maintain. The more reliable you want this monitoring to be, the more you need to spend. The cost justification discussions in an enterprise get harder as that cost rises. Meanwhile, many customers continue to say you're not being honest because they can't tell the difference between a local issue and an actual outage. Some customers might notice better alignment between the status page and their experience, but they're content, so they have little motivation to reach out and thank you for the honesty.Eventually, the monitoring service gets axed because we can just manually update the status page after all.Stage 4: Status is manually set. There may be various metrics around what requires an update, and there may be one or more layers of approval needed.Not saying this is a great outcome, but it is an outcome that is understandable given the parameters of the situation.replyben0x539 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think as an external user I'd be happiest if they just provided multiple indicators on the status page?

The whole value of github is more than just git commits.replywahern 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> But remember, that also a large part of what github offers is not directly available in git. e.g. pull requests [...]Some of the earliest features and subcommands in Git were for generating and consuming patches sent and received via e-mail. Git can even send e-mail messages itself; see git-send-email(1). On open source mailing-lists when you see a long series of posts with subject prefixes like '[foo 1/7]', it's likely that series is being sent by the send-email subcommand, directly or indirectly.While I've long known that Git has such capabilities, was originally designed around the LKML workflow, and that many traditionally managed open source projects employ that workflow on both ends (sender and receiver), I've never used this feature myself, even though I actually host my own e-mail as well as my own Git repositories.[1] In fact it was only the other day while reading the musl-libc mailing list when it clicked that multiple contributors had been pushing and discussing patches this way--specifically using the built-in subcommands as opposed to manually shuttling patches to and from their e-mail client--even though I've been subscribed to and following that mailing list for years.The open source community has come to lean too heavily on Github and Gitlab-style, web-based pull request workflows. It's not good for the long-term health of open source as these workflows are tailor made for vendor lock-in, notwithstanding that Github and Gitlab haven't yet abused this potential. Issue ticket management is a legitimate sore point for self hosting open source projects. But Git's patch sharing capabilities are sophisticated and useful and can even be used over channels like IRC or ad hoc web forums, not simply via personal e-mail or group mailing-lists.[1] Little known fact: you can host read-only Git repositories over HTTP statically, without any special server-side software. The git update-server-info subcommand generates auxiliary files in a bare repository that the git client automatically knows to look for when cloning over HTTP. While I use SSH to push into private Git repositories, each private Git repository has a post-receive hook that does `(cd \"${M}\" && git fetch && git --bare update-server-info)`, where '${M}' is a bare Git mirror[2] underneath the document root for the local HTTP server. (I would never run a git protocol daemon on my personal server; those and other niche application servers are security nightmares. But serving static files over HTTP is about as safe and foolproof as you can get.)[2] See git clone --mirror (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.t...)EDIT: Regarding note #1, in principle one could implement a web-based Git repository browser that is implemented purely client-side. Using WASM one could probably quickly hack pre-existing server-side applications like gitweb to work this way, or at least make use of libgit2 for a low-level repository interface.

    "content": "Dr. David J. PearceBlog Projects Publications Talks HomeProgramming Languages Going Above and BeyondTuesday, June 27th, 2023Having been a programmer for a long time now, I have experienced my fair share of programming languages. What strikes me the most is that programming languages have not improved much over the years. Java, for example, has certainly improved from when I started using it in the mid-nineties \u2014 but only in pretty minor ways. We still get buffer overflows and integer overflows. The compiler still cannot tell when our loops will terminate (yes, this is possible). Aliasing is still a complete unbridled mess. Even Rust, my favourite language du jour, only offers a minor improvement on the status quo. These are not stop-the-world everything has changed kinds of improvements.Still, big improvements are possible. I now use, on a daily basis, a language (Dafny) which often genuinely amazes me. I\u2019ll admit, its not super easy to use and perhaps not ready yet for mainstream \u2014 but, it gives a glimpse of what is possible. Dafny\u2019s ability to statically check critical properties of your program goes well beyond what mainstream languages can do (that includes you, Rust). Here\u2019s a simple example:function Gcd(a:nat, b:nat) : (g:nat,x:int,y:int)// Bezout's identityensures (a*x)+(b*y) == g{  if a == 0 then (b,0,1)  else    var (g,x,y) := Gcd(b%a,a);    (g,y-((b/a)*x),x)}This is a recursive implementation of Euclid\u2019s extended GCD algorithm (i.e. an integral part of modern cryptography, including RSA and ECC). Using the ensures clause I\u2019ve specified a postcondition \u2014 that is, a property that should always hold of the return value. This particular postcondition corresponds to B\u00e9zout\u2019s identity. That is, a theorem about numbers proved by \u00c9tienne B\u00e9zout in the 18th century. The amazing thing is that, in order to check my program is correct, Dafny has reproved this theorem for me.Bits and BytesThe above example was taken from our DafnyEVM codebase. Here\u2019s another example which is, perhaps, more concrete:function ToBytes(v:nat) : (r:seq<u8>)ensures |r| > 0 { // Extract the byte var byte : u8 := (v % 256) as u8; // Determine what's left var w : nat := v/256; if w == 0 then [byte] else  ToBytes(w) + [byte]}The above is a straightforward (recursive) function for converting an arbitrary-sized unsigned integer (nat) into a sequence of one or more bytes (following a big endian representation). Here, ToBytes() has an ensures clause clarifying it always returns a non-empty sequence. Dafny checks at compile time that this is always true.Now, here is a function taking us in the opposite direction:function FromBytes(bytes:seq<u8>) : (r:nat) { if |bytes| == 0 then 0 else  var last := |bytes| - 1;  var byte := bytes[last] as nat;  var msw := FromBytes(bytes[..last]);  (msw * 256) + byte}There isn\u2019t anything too special going on here (yet). But, now the magic begins! What we want to know is that these two functions are \u201copposites\u201d of each other. We can do this like so:lemma LemmaFromToBytes(v: nat)ensures FromBytes(ToBytes(v)) == v { // Dafny does all the work!}This might not seem like much, but it represents something you cannot easily do in other languages. This lemma asks Dafny to check that, for any possible nat value v, it always holds that FromBytes(ToBytes(v)) == v. Again, Dafny checks this at compile time \u2014 no testing required!Finally, an interesting puzzle remains. For an arbitrary sequence bs of bytes, does ToBytes(FromBytes(bs)) == bs always hold? Again, Dafny can answer this for us almost immediately. If you\u2019re interested to know the answer, take a look at the lemma we came up with.Follow the discussion on Twitter",
