    "content": "AuthorNameKurt MackeySocial Media@mrkurtView Twitter ProfileThis past July, we raised $25MM from A16Z and our existing investors, including Intel Capital and Dell. Recently, we raised an additional $70MM led by EQT Ventures.Why do startups write announcements like these? We went back and forth on it. There are lots of reasons, most of them dumb.Our first reason is obvious, and mercenary. It\u2019s the same reason we write anything: to woo customers. We\u2019re all adults here, we can talk about this stuff, right? There are customers who are comfortable engaging with tiny Fly.io, and others who are comfortable engaging with the Fly.io that raised an additional $70MM led by EQT ventures. Alcoa: ring us up!More compellingly, it's an opportunity to gaze deeply into our own navels. We\u2019ve been talking to users, fans, and detractors about what we\u2019ve been doing, for years. We evolved, and got religion about a particular vision of what we\u2019re building. We shared that with investors, and they bought it (suckers). Now we'll share with you.The Two Hour ProblemHere\u2019s what we believed in 2020: apps work better when they run closer to their users. Some kinds of apps, like video or real-time presence, can't be done without physical locality. So, that\u2019s what we expected to talk about on our HN launch thread: WebRTC, edge caching, game servers.What people actually wanted to talk about, though? Databases.Here\u2019s what we missed: we thought there was a particular kind of \u201cedgy\u201d app that demanded global deployment. But it turns out, most apps want to be edgy\u2026 if it's easy.What's going on here? Why is edge deployment table stakes for a game server and an untenable science project for an online bookstore? We think it's because game servers have to be edgy, and online bookstores don't. The game server team will bang on edge deployment until it's solved. The bookstore team will try for about two hours, not find a clear path forward, and then give up and move on to other things.The result of this is an Internet where all of the world's CRUD apps are hosted in Loudoun County, VA (motto: \"where tradition meets innovation\"), at Amazon's us-east-1 in Ashburn, a city with so many Rails apps that one of them was elected to the county Board of Supervisors.We think everybody understands that it'd be better to run close to users rather than in the Internet's least worst data center. But with ordinary tooling, getting an app running in more than one city at the same time isn't a two-hour problem: in two hours, you'll learn that it's possible to run simultaneously in Sydney, Frankfurt, and Dallas, but not how to do it, or how long it'll take.So our bet is simple: with the right platform and toolchain, people building bookstores, sandwich rating apps, music recommenders, mailing list managers for churches, and every other kind of app will build apps that run fast globally. Not just walking distance from Carolina Brothers BBQ in Ashburn, but in Chicago, or Sydney, or Singapore, or S\u00e3o Paulo. Because being fast in more than one city at the same time is a super valuable feature!We think this pattern holds for a lot of things. We're going to track those things down and build them.For example: sandboxing, code editors and REPLs, and CI/CD applications all have to figure out how to run untrusted customer code. They all figure out how to spin up locked down containers on demand. But being able to spin up a VM on the fly is a super valuable feature for all kinds of apps (as anyone who's ever debugged a stuck job queue can attest). Why doesn't everybody do it? Because it isn't clear after two hours of investigation how to do it. So we built Fly Machines, which makes spinning up a VM as straightforward as calling a function.We've got more things like this coming. Real-time features and user presence are two-hour features. So is encryption and secret storage. And clustered databases. And hardware-accelerated inferencing.There are other companies looking to solve \"two hour window\" problems for developers: distributed databases, data locality, storage, AI, app frameworks. If we get Fly.io right, we'll give those platforms new primitives to build on top of, get new ideas in front of users faster, and ratchet up the quality of every application anywhere.Sounds like an investment pitch? Well, yeah, it was.Why We Raised A Bunch Of MoneyHere's what we think it takes to build this kind of platform:A hardware fleet. Fly.io has always run on its own hardware. There are fun, technical, \u201ccontrol your own destiny\u201d reasons to rack hardware instead of layering on top of commodity clouds. But it's really just economics. If you want to get people to build apps on your platform, you need a shot at being around 10 years from now. Hardware is what makes the margins work.All the regions. This is subtle! We launched with 19 regions, which, if you\u2019re just serving individual application developers, is plenty. But alongside individual apps, we want other platforms running on us \u2014 managed databases, developer tools. And those companies need all the regions. We\u2019re up to 33 regions now, and we\u2019re getting much faster at lighting new ones up.Support and reliability. We\u2019re under no illusions about the platform reliability task we\u2019re facing, or about our ability to clever our way through it (we\u2019re not that clever to begin with).Those things are all capital intensive, and alongside them we\u2019d like to place more bets: on advanced storage, on security capabilities, on new kinds of hardware. So you see where the money goes.Here\u2019s What\u2019s Not Changing\ud83c\udfb6 There are two kinds of platform companies \ud83c\udfb6 : the kind where you can sign up online and be playing with them in 5 minutes, and the kind where you can sign up online and get a salesperson to call and quote you a price and arrange a demo.\ud83c\udfb6 There are two kinds of platform companies \ud83c\udfb6 : the kind you can figure out without reading the manual, and the kind where publishers have competing books on how to use them, the kind where you can get professionally certified in actually being able to boot up an app on them.\ud83c\udfb6 There are two kinds of platform companies \ud83c\udfb6 : the kind where you can get your Python or Rust or Julia code running nicely, and the kind where you find a way to recompile it to Javascript.The kind of platform company we want to be hasn\u2019t changed since 2020. Our features are all generally a command or two in flyctl, and they work for any app that can packaged in a container.You can take our word for that, but if you\u2019ve already got a working Docker container for your app, you can put us to the test. From a standing start, you should be able to get it running on Fly.io in single digit minutes, and on every continent in just a minute or two more.LAST UPDATED\u2022JUN 27, 2023Share this post on TwitterShare this post on Hacker NewsShare this post on RedditPrevious post \u2193Python Async Workers on Fly Machines",

    "content": "Well, that was unexpected. I recorded a couple of crappy videos in 5 minutes, posted them on a Twitter thread, and went viral with 8.8K likes at this point. I really could not have predicted that, given that I\u2019ve been posting what-I-believe-is interesting content for years and\u2026 nothing, almost-zero interest. Now that things have cooled down, it\u2019s time to stir the pot and elaborate on those thoughts a bit more rationally.To summarize, the Twitter thread shows two videos: one of an old computer running Windows NT 3.51 and one of a new computer running Windows 11. In each video, I opened and closed a command prompt, File Explorer, Notepad, and Paint. You can clearly see how apps on the old computer open up instantly whereas apps on the new computer show significant lag as they load. I questioned how computers are actually getting better when trivial things like this have regressed. And boom, the likes and reshares started coming in. Obviously some people had issues with my claims, but there seems to be an overwhelming majority of people that agree we have a problem.To open up, I\u2019ll stand my ground: latency in modern computer interfaces, with modern OSes and modern applications, is terrible and getting worse. This applies to smartphones as well. At the same time, while UIs were much more responsible on computers of the past, those computers were also awful in many ways: new systems have changed our lives substantially. So, what gives?The original comparisonLet\u2019s address the elephant in the room first. The initial comparison I posted wasn\u2019t fair and I was aware of that going in. That said, I knew repeating the experiment \u201cproperly\u201d would yield the same results, so I plowed ahead with whatever I had right then. The videos were unplanned because the idea for the Tweets came to mind when I booted the old machine, clicked on Command Prompt, and was blown away by the immediacy to start the app.The original comparison videos showed:An AMD K7-600 with 128MB of RAM and a 5400 RPM HDD running Windows NT 3.51. This was a machine from the year 1999-2000 with an OS that was about 5 years older than it. Hardware was experiencing really fast improvements back then, particularly in CPU speeds, and you were kinda expected to keep up with the 2-year upgrade treadmill or suffer from incredibly slowness. All this is to say that this machine was indeed overpowered for the OS I used.Please remind me how we are moving forward. In this video, a machine from the year ~2000 (600MHz, 128MB RAM, spinning-rust hard disk) running Windows NT 3.51. Note how incredibly snappy opening apps is. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/YEO824vIqI\u2014 Julio Merino (@jmmv) June 22, 2023A Surface Go 2 with an Intel Core m3 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and an SSD running Windows 11. This is a 3-year old machine that shipped with Windows 10, but Windows 11 is officially supported on it\u2014and as you know, that means you are tricked into upgrading. This is not a powerful machine by any means, but: first, it\u2019s running the verbatim Microsoft experience, and second, it should be much more powerful than the K7 system, shouldn\u2019t it? We are continuously reminded that any computer or phone today has orders of magnitude more power than past machines.Now look at opening the same apps on Windows 11 on a Surface Go 2 (quad-core i5 processor at 2.4GHz, 8GB RAM, SSD). Everything is super sluggish. pic.twitter.com/W722PNEGv0\u2014 Julio Merino (@jmmv) June 22, 2023Oh, and yes, I quoted the wrong hardware specs in the original tweet. Looking again on how I made that mistake: I searched for \u201cSurface Go 2\u201d in Bing, I landed on the \u201cSurface Laptop Go 2\u201d page, and copied what I saw there without noticing that it wasn\u2019t accurate.All apps had been previously open, so they should all have been comfortably sitting in RAM.The better comparisonObviously various people noticed that there was something off with my comparison (unfair hardware configurations, wrong specs), so I redid the comparison once the thread started gaining attention:Windows 2000 on the K7-600 machine (see installation thread). This is an OS from 1999 running on hardware from that same year. And, if you ask me, this was the best Windows release of all times: super-clean UI on an NT core, carrying all of the features you would want around performance and stability (except with terrible boot times). As you can see, things still fare very well for the old machine in terms of UI responsiveness.For those thinking that the comparison was unfair, here is Windows 2000 on the same 600MHz machine. Both are from the same year, 1999. Note how the immediacy is still exactly the same and hadn\u2019t been ruined yet. pic.twitter.com/Tpks2Hd1Id\u2014 Julio Merino (@jmmv) June 23, 2023Windows 11 on a Mac Pro 2013 (see installation instructions) with a 6-core Xeon E5-1650v2 at 3.5GHz, 32GB of RAM, dual GPUs, and an SSD that can sustain up to 1GB/s. I know, this is a 10-year old machine at this point running a more modern OS. But please, go ahead, tell me with a straight face how hardware with these specs cannot handle opening trivial desktop applications without delay. I\u2019ll wait.Oh, and one more thing. Yes, yes, the Surface Go 2 is underpowered and all you want. But look at this video. Same steps on a 6-core Mac Pro @ 3.5GHz with 32GB of RAM. All apps cached. Note how they get painted in chunks. It's not because of animations or mediocre hardware. pic.twitter.com/9TOGAdaTXO\u2014 Julio Merino (@jmmv) June 23, 2023The reason I used the Mac Pro is because it is the best machine I have running Windows right now and, in fact, it\u2019s my daily driver. But again, I do not care about how running this comparison on an \u201cold\u201d machine might be \u201cinaccurate\u201d. Back when I left Microsoft last year, I was regularly using a Z4 desktop from 2022, a maxed-out quad-core i7 ThinkPad with 32GB of RAM, and an i7 Surface Laptop 3 with 16GB of RAM. Delays were shorter on these, of course, but interactions were still noticeably slow.So, in any case: I agree the original comparison was potentially flawed, but as you can see, a better comparison yields the same results\u2014which I knew it would. After years upon years of computer usage, you gain intuition on how things should behave, and trusting such intuition tends to work well as long as you validate your assumptions later, don\u2019t get me wrong!Computer advancementsLet\u2019s put the tweets aside and talk about how things have changed since the 2000s. I jokingly asked how we are \u201cmoving forward\u201d as an industry, so it\u2019s worth looking into it.Indeed, we have moved forward in many aspects: we now have incredible graphics and high-resolution monitors, super-fast networks, real-time video editing, and much more. All of these have improved over the years and it is very true that these advancements have allowed for certain life transformations to happen. Some examples: the ability to communicate with loved ones much more easily thanks to great-quality videoconferencing; the ability to have a streaming \u201ccinema at home\u201d; and the painless switch to remote work during the pandemic1.We have also moved forward on the I/O side. Disk I/O had always been the weakest spot on past systems. Floppy disks were unreliable and slow. CDs and DVDs were slightly-more-reliable but also slow. HDDs were the bottleneck for lots of things: their throughput improved over time, allowing things like higher-resolution video editing and the like, but random I/O hit physical limits\u2014and fast random I/O is what essentially drives desktop responsiveness.Then, boom, SSDs appeared and started showing up on desktops. These were a game-changer because they fixed the problem of random I/O. All of a sudden, booting a computer, launching a heavy game, opening folders with lots of small photos, or simply just using your computer\u2026 all improved massively. It\u2019s hard to explain the usability improvements that these brought if you did not live through this transition, and it\u2019s scary how those improvements are almost gone; more on that later.Other stuff also improved, like the simplicity to install new hardware, the pervasiveness of wireless connections and devices, the internationalization of text and apps (Unicode isn\u2019t easy nor cheap, I\u2019ll grant that)\u2026 all providing more usable machines in more contexts than ever.So yeah, things are better in many areas and we have more power than ever. Otherwise, we couldn\u2019t do things like ML-assisted photo processing on a tiny phone, which was unimaginable in the 2000s.Terrible latencyYet\u2026 none of these advancements justify why things are as excruciatingly slow as they are today in terms of UI latency. Old hardware from the year 1999, combined with an OS from that same year, shows that responsive systems have existed2. If anything, all these hardware improvements I described should have made things better, not worse, shouldn\u2019t they?Some replied to the comparison telling me that graphical animations and bigger screens are \u201cat fault\u201d because we have to draw more pixels, and thus the fact that we have these new niceties means we have to tolerate slowness. Well, not quite. Witness for yourself:And... one more thing? To those saying: \"it's the higher 4K resolution!\" or \"it's the good-looking animations!\" or \"it's the pretty desktop background!\"\u2014no, they aren't at fault. See, the slowness is still visible with all of these disabled. In the end... blog post coming soon. pic.twitter.com/9BQy6IpK6a\u2014 Julio Merino (@jmmv) June 26, 2023GPUs are a commodity now, and they lift the heavy burden of graphics management from the CPU. The kinds of graphical animations that a desktop renders are extremely cheap to compute, and this has been proven by macOS since its launch: all graphical effects on a macOS desktop feel instant. The effects do delay interactions though\u2014the desktop switching animation is particularly intrusive, oh god how I hate that thing\u2014but the delays generally come from intentional pauses during the animation. And when the effects introduce latency because the GPU cannot keep up, such as when you attach a 4K display to a really old Mac, then it\u2019s painfully obvious that animations stutter due to lack of power. I haven\u2019t encountered the latter in any of the videos above though, which is why animations and the like have nothing to do with my concerns.So, please, think about it with a critical mind. How is the ability to edit multiple 4K video streams in real time or the ability to stream a 4K movie supposed to make starting apps like Notepad slower? Or opening the context menu in the desktop? Or reading your email? The new abilities we acquired much more power from the CPU and GPU, but they shouldn\u2019t remove performance from tasks that are essentially I/O-bound. Opening a simple app shouldn\u2019t be slower than it was more than 20 years ago; it really shouldn\u2019t be. Yet here we are. The reasons for the desktop latency come from elsewhere, and I have some guesses for those. But first, a look at a couple of examples.ExamplesOn Windows land, there are two obvious examples I want to bring up and that were mentioned in the Twitter thread:Notepad had been a native app until very recently, and it still opened pretty much instantaneously. With its rewrite as a UWP app, things went downhill. The before and after are apparent, and yet\u2026 the app continues to be as unfeatureful as it had always been. This is extra slowness for no user benefit.As for Windows Terminal, sure, it is nicer than anything that came before it, but it is visibly much, much heavier than the old Command Prompt. And if you add PowerShell into the mix, we are talking about multiple seconds for a new terminal window to be operational unless you have top-of-the-line hardware.macOS fares better than Windows indeed, but it still has its issues. See this example contributed by @AlexRugerMusic. Even the mighty M1 has trouble opening up the system settings app:Another example:Left: 2006 MBP (2GHz Core 2 Duo, 2GB DDR2 RAM, Max OS X 10.6.8; has SSD)Right: 2021 MacBook Air (M1, 16GB RAM, macOS 13)Apps open about twice as fast on the Pro as they do on the Air (most, not just System Preferences/Settings). pic.twitter.com/PjMX1DI4uz\u2014 rewgs (@AlexRugerMusic) June 27, 2023Linux is probably the system that suffers the least from these issues as it still feels pretty snappy on modest hardware. Fedora Linux 38, released in April 2023, runs really well on a micro PC from 11 years ago\u2014even if Gnome or KDE had been resource hogs back in the day. That said, this is only an illusion. As soon as you start installing any modern app that wasn\u2019t developed exclusively for Linux\u2026 the slow app start times and generally poor performance show up.Related, but I feel this needs saying: the biggest shock for me was when I joined Google back in 2009. At the time, Google Search and GMail had stellar performance: they were examples to follow. From the inside though\u2026 I was quite shocked by how all internal tools crawled, and in particular by how slow the in-house command line tools were. I actually fault Google for the situation we are in today due to their impressive internal systems and their relentless push for web apps at all costs, which brings us to\u2026CausesHow does this all happen? It\u2019s easy to say \u201cBloat!\u201d, but that\u2019s a hard thing to define because bloat can be justified: what one person considers as bloat is not the same as what another person considers as bloat. After all, \u201c80% of users only use 20% of the software they consume\u201d (see Pareto principle), but the key insight is that the 20% that each user consumes is different from one another. So bloat isn\u2019t necessarily in the features offered by the software; it\u2019s elsewhere.So then we have frameworks and layers of abstraction, which seem to introduce bloat for bloat\u2019s sake. But I\u2019m not sure this is correct either: abstraction doesn\u2019t inherently have to make things slower, as Rust has proven. What makes things slower are priorities. Nobody prioritizes performance anymore unless for the critical cases where it matters (video games, transcoding video, and the like). What people (companies) prioritize is developer time. For example: you might not want to use Rust because its steep learning curve means you\u2019ll spend more time learning than delivering, or its higher compiler times mean that you\u2019ll spend more time waiting for the compiler than shipping debugging production. Or another example: you might not want to develop native apps because that means \u201cduplicate work\u201d, so you reach out for a cross-platform web framework. That is, Electron.I know it\u2019s easy to dunk on Electron, but there are clear telltale signs that this platform is at fault for a lot of the damage done to desktop latency. Take 1Password\u2019s 8th version, which many of users that migrated from the 7th version despise due to the slowness of the new interface. Or take Spotify, which used to prioritize startup and playback latency over anything else in its inception and, as you know if you use it, that\u2019s not true any more:2009 version: 20MB fully native cocoa app, launches in less than a second, instant feedback when you click stuff, playback usually starts within 50ms pic.twitter.com/Enzi40PDCX\u2014 Rasmus Andersson (@rsms) May 10, 2023These apps were rewritten in Electron to offer a unified experience across desktops and to cut down costs\u2026 but for whom? The cost cuts were for the companies owning the products, not for the users. Such cuts impose a tax on every one of us due to our day-to-day frustrations and the need to unnecessarily upgrade our hardware. Couple these rewrites with the fact that OSes cannot reuse the heavy framework across apps (same idea as how using all RAM as a cache is a flawed premise)\u2026 and the bloat quickly adds up when you run these apps concurrently.Leaving Electron aside, another decision that likely introduces latency is the mass adoption of managed and interpreted languages. I know these are easy to dunk on as well, but that\u2019s because we have reasons to do so. Take Java or .NET: several Windows apps have been slowly rewritten in C# and, while I have no proof of this, I\u2019m convinced from past experience that this can be behind the sluggishness we notice. The JDK and the CLR do amazing jobs at optimizing long-running processes (their JIT can do PGO with real time data), but handling quick startup times is not something they manage well. This is why, for example, Bazel spawns a background server process to paper over startup latency and why Android has gone through multiple iterations of AOT compilation. (Edit: there must be other reasons though that I have not researched. As someone pointed out, my assumption that Windows Terminal was mostly C# is not true.)More on this in Wirth\u2019s law.One-off improvements eaten awayTo conclude, let me end with a pessimistic note by going back to hardware advancements.The particular improvement that SSDs brought us was a one-off transformation. HDDs kept getting faster for years indeed, but they never could deliver the kind of random I/O that desktops require to be snappy. The switch to SSDs brought a kind of improvement that was at a different level. Unfortunately\u2026 we could only buy those benefits once: there is no other technology to switch to that provides such a transformative experience. And thus, once the benefits brought by the new technology were eaten away by careless software, we are almost back to square one. Yes, SSDs are getting faster, but newer drives won\u2019t bring the kind of massive differences that the change from HDDs to SSDs brought.You can see this yourself if you try using recent versions of Windows or macOS without an SSD: it is nigh impossible. These systems now assume that computers have SSDs in them, which is a fair assumption, but a problematic one due to what I mentioned above. The same applies to \u201cbloat\u201d in apps: open up your favorite resource monitor, look for the disk I/O bandwidth graph, and launch any modern app. You\u2019ll see a stream of MBs upon MBs being loaded from disk into memory, all of which must complete before the app is responsive. This is the kind of bloat that Electron adds and that SSDs permitted, but that could be avoided altogether with different design decisions.Which makes me worried about Apple Silicon. Remember all the rage with the M1 launch and how these new machines had superb performance, extremely long battery life, and no fan noise? Well, wait and see: these benefits will be eaten away if we continue on the same careless path. And once that has happened, it\u2019ll be too late. Retrofitting performance into existing applications is very difficult technically, and almost impossible to prioritize organizationally.So\u2026 will computer architects be able to save us with other revolutionary technology shifts? I wouldn\u2019t want to rely on that. Not because the shifts might not exist, but because we shouldn\u2019t need them.Oh wait: remote work does not qualify.

    "content": "Annals of ScienceJuly 3, 2023 IssueHow Plastics Are Poisoning UsThey both release and attract toxic chemicals, and appear everywhere from human placentas to chasms thirty-six thousand feet beneath the sea. Will we ever be rid of them?By Elizabeth KolbertJune 26, 2023Annual production of plastic exceeds eight hundred billion pounds; much of it ends up as microplastics, spreading across the ocean.Illustration by Daniel Li\u00e9vanoListen to this storyIn 1863, when much of the United States was anguishing over the Civil War, an entrepreneur named Michael Phelan was fretting about billiard balls. At the time, the balls were made of ivory, preferably obtained from elephants from Ceylon\u2014now Sri Lanka\u2014whose tusks were thought to possess just the right density. Phelan, who owned a billiard hall and co-owned a billiard-table-manufacturing business, also wrote books about billiards and was a champion billiards player. Owing in good part to his efforts, the game had grown so popular that tusks from Ceylon\u2014and, indeed, elephants more generally\u2014were becoming scarce. He and a partner offered a ten-thousand-dollar reward to anyone who could come up with an ivory substitute.A young printer from Albany, John Wesley Hyatt, learned about the offer and set to tinkering. In 1865, he patented a ball with a wooden core encased in ivory dust and shellac. Players were unimpressed. Next, Hyatt experimented with nitrocellulose, a material made by combining cotton or wood pulp with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acids. He found that a certain type of nitrocellulose, when heated with camphor, yielded a shiny, tough material that could be molded into practically any shape. Hyatt\u2019s brother and business partner dubbed the substance \u201ccelluloid.\u201d The resulting balls were more popular with players, although, as Hyatt conceded, they, too, had their drawbacks. Nitrocellulose, also known as guncotton, is highly flammable. Two celluloid balls knocking together with sufficient force could set off a small explosion. A saloon owner in Colorado reported to Hyatt that, when this happened, \u201cinstantly every man in the room pulled a gun.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear that the Hyatt brothers ever collected from Phelan, but the invention proved to be its own reward. From celluloid billiard balls, the pair branched out into celluloid dentures, combs, brush handles, piano keys, and knickknacks. They touted the new material as a substitute not just for ivory but also for tortoiseshell and jewelry-grade coral. These, too, were running out, owing to slaughter and plunder. Celluloid, one of the Hyatts\u2019 advertising pamphlets promised, would \u201cgive the elephant, the tortoise, and the coral insect a respite in their native haunts.\u201dHyatt\u2019s invention, often described as the world\u2019s first commercially produced plastic, was followed a few decades later by Bakelite. Bakelite was followed by polyvinyl chloride, which was, in turn, followed by polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, polyester, polypropylene, Styrofoam, Plexiglas, Mylar, Teflon, polyethylene terephthalate (familiarly known as pet)\u2014the list goes on and on. And on. Annual global production of plastic currently runs to more than eight hundred billion pounds. What was a problem of scarcity is now a problem of superabundance.In the form of empty water bottles, used shopping bags, and tattered snack packages, plastic waste turns up pretty much everywhere today. It has been found at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, thirty-six thousand feet below sea level. It litters the beaches of Svalbard and the shores of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, in the Indian Ocean, most of which are uninhabited. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a collection of floating debris that stretches across six hundred thousand square miles between California and Hawaii, is thought to contain some 1.8 trillion plastic shards. Among the many creatures being done in by all this junk are corals, tortoises, and elephants\u2014in particular, the elephants of Sri Lanka. In recent years, twenty of them have died after ingesting plastic at a landfill near the village of Pallakkadu.How worried should we be about what\u2019s become known as \u201cthe plastic pollution crisis\u201d? And what can be done about it? These questions lie at the heart of several recent books that take up what one author calls \u201cthe plastic trap.\u201d\u201cWithout plastic we\u2019d have no modern medicine or gadgets or wire insulation to keep our homes from burning down,\u201d that author, Matt Simon, writes in \u201cA Poison Like No Other: How Microplastics Corrupted Our Planet and Our Bodies.\u201d \u201cBut with plastic we\u2019ve contaminated every corner of Earth.\u201dSimon, a science journalist at Wired, is especially concerned about plastic\u2019s tendency to devolve into microplastics. (Microplastics are usually defined as bits smaller than five millimetres across.) This process is taking place all the time, in many different ways. Plastic bags drift into the ocean, where, after being tossed around by the waves and bombarded with UV radiation, they fall apart. Tires today contain a wide variety of plastics; as they roll along, they abrade, sending clouds of particles spinning into the air. Clothes made with plastics, which now comprise most items for sale, are constantly shedding fibres, much the way dogs shed hairs. A study published a few years ago in the journal Nature Food found that preparing infant formula in a plastic bottle is a good way to degrade the bottle, so what babies end up drinking is a sort of plastic soup. In fact, it is now clear that children are feeding on microplastics even before they can eat. In 2021, researchers from Italy announced that they had found microplastics in human placentas. A few months later, researchers from Germany and Austria announced that they\u2019d found microplastics in meconium\u2014the technical term for an infant\u2019s first poop.The hazards of ingesting large pieces of plastic are pretty straightforward; they include choking and perforation of the intestinal tract. Animals that fill their guts with plastics eventually starve to death. The risks posed by microplastics are subtler, but not, Simon argues, any less serious. Plastics are made from by-products of oil and gas refining; many of the chemicals involved, such as benzene and vinyl chloride, are carcinogens. In addition to their main ingredients, plastics may contain any number of additives. Many of these\u2014for example, polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFASs, which confer water resistance\u2014are also suspected carcinogens. Many of the others have never been adequately tested.As plastics fall apart, the chemicals that went into their manufacture can leak out. These can then combine to form new compounds, which may prove less dangerous than the originals\u2014or more so. A couple of years ago, a team of American scientists subjected disposable shopping bags to several days of simulated sunlight, in order to mimic the conditions that they\u2019d encounter flying or floating loose. The researchers found that a single bag from CVS leached more than thirteen thousand compounds; a bag from Walmart leached more than fifteen thousand. \u201cIt is becoming increasingly clear that plastics are not inert in the environment,\u201d the team wrote. Steve Allen, a researcher at Canada\u2019s Ocean Frontier Institute who specializes in microplastics, tells Simon, \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an IQ above room temperature, you have to understand that this is not a good material to have in the environment.\u201dVIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKERDad Can Dance: My Father\u2019s Secret Ballet CareerMicroplastics, meanwhile, don\u2019t just leach nasty chemicals; they attract them. \u201cPersistent bioaccumulative and toxic substances,\u201d or PBTs, are a hodgepodge of harmful compounds, including DDT and PCBs. Like microplastics, which are often referred to in the scientific literature as MPs, PBTs are everywhere these days. When PBTs encounter MPs, they preferentially adhere to them. \u201cIn effect, plastics are like magnets for PBTs\u201d is how the Environmental Protection Agency has put it. Consuming microplastics is thus a good way to swallow old poisons.Then, there\u2019s the threat posed by the particles themselves. Microplastics\u2014and in particular, it seems, microfibres\u2014can get pulled deep into the lungs. People who work in the synthetic-textile industry, it has long been known, suffer from high rates of lung disease. Are we breathing in enough microfibres that we are all, in effect, becoming synthetic-textile workers? No one can say for sure, but, as Fay Couceiro, a researcher at England\u2019s University of Portsmouth, observes to Simon, \u201cWe desperately need to find out.\u201dWhatever you had for dinner last night, the meal almost certainly left behind plastic in need of disposal. Before tossing your empty sour-cream tub or mostly empty ketchup bottle, you may have searched it for a number, and if you found one, inside a cheerful little triangle, you washed it out and set it aside to be recycled. You might also have imagined that with this effort you were doing your part to stem the global plastic-pollution tide.The British journalist Oliver Franklin-Wallis used to be a believer. He religiously rinsed his plastics before depositing them in one of the five color-coded rubbish bins that he and his wife kept at their home in Royston, north of London. Then Franklin-Wallis decided to find out what was actually happening to his garbage. Disenchantment followed.\u201cIf a product is seen as recycled, or recyclable, it makes us feel better about buying it,\u201d he writes in \u201cWasteland: The Secret World of Waste and the Urgent Search for a Cleaner Future.\u201d But all those little numbers inside the triangles \u201cmostly serve to trick consumers.\u201dFranklin-Wallis became interested in the fate of his detritus just as the old order of Britain\u2019s rubbish was collapsing. Up until 2017, most of the plastic waste collected in Europe and in the United States was shipped to China, as was most of the mixed paper. Then Beijing imposed a new policy, known as National Sword, that prohibited imports of yang laji, or \u201cforeign garbage.\u201d The move left waste haulers from California to Catalonia with millions of mildewy containers they couldn\u2019t get rid of. \u201cplastics pile up as china refuses to take the west\u2019s recycling,\u201d a January, 2018, headline in the Times read. \u201cIt\u2019s tough times,\u201d Simon Ellin, the chief executive of Britain\u2019s Recycling Association, told the paper.Trash, though, finds a way. Not long after China stopped taking in foreign garbage, waste entrepreneurs in other nations\u2014Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka\u2014started to accept it. Mom-and-pop plastic-recycling businesses sprang up in places where they were regulated laxly, if at all. Franklin-Wallis visited one such informal recycling plant, in New Delhi; the owner allowed him inside on the condition that he not reveal exactly how the business operates or where it is situated. He found workers in a fiendishly hot room feeding junk into a shredder. Workers in another, equally hot room fed the shreds into an extruder, which pumped out little gray pellets known as nurdles. The ventilation system consisted of an open window. \u201cThe thick fug of plastic fumes in the air left me dazed,\u201d Franklin-Wallis writes.Nurdles, which are key to manufacturing plastic products, are small enough to qualify as microplastics. (It\u2019s been estimated that ten trillion nurdles a year leak into the oceans, most from shipping containers that tip overboard.) Usually, nurdles are composed of \u201cvirgin\u201d polymers, but, as the New Delhi plant demonstrates, it is also possible to produce them from used plastic. The problem with the process, and with plastic recycling more generally, is that a polymer degrades each time it\u2019s heated. Thus, even under ideal circumstances, plastic can be reused only a couple of times, and in the waste-management business very little is ideal. Franklin-Wallis toured a high-end recycling plant in northern England that handles pet, the material that most water and soda bottles are made from. He learned that nearly half the bales of pet that arrive at the plant can\u2019t be reprocessed because they\u2019re too contaminated, either by other kinds of plastic or by random crap. \u201cYield is a problem for us,\u201d the plant\u2019s commercial director concedes.Franklin-Wallis comes to see plastic recycling as so much (potentially toxic) smoke and mirrors. Over the years, he writes, \u201ca kind of playbook\u201d has emerged. Under public pressure, a company like Coca-Cola or Nestl\u00e9 pledges to insure that the packaging for its products gets recycled. When the pressure eases, it quietly abandons its pledge. Meanwhile, it lobbies against any kind of legislation that would restrict the sale of single-use plastics. Franklin-Wallis quotes Larry Thomas, the former president of the Society of the Plastics Industry, who once said, \u201cIf the public thinks recycling is working, then they are not going to be as concerned about the environment.\u201dRight around the time that Franklin-Wallis started tracking his trash, Eve O. Schaub decided to spend a year not producing any. Schaub, who has been described as a \u201cstunt memoirist,\u201d had previously spent a year avoiding sugar and forcing her family to do the same, an exercise she chronicled in a book titled \u201cYear of No Sugar.\u201d The year of no sugar was followed by \u201cYear of No Clutter.\u201d When she proposes a trash-free annum to her husband, he says he doubts it is possible. Her younger daughter begs her to wait until she goes away to college. Schaub plunges ahead anyway.\u201cAs the beginning of the new year loomed, I was feeling pretty good about our chances,\u201d she recalls in \u201cYear of No Garbage.\u201d \u201cI mean, really. How hard could it be?\u201dWhat Schaub means by \u201cno garbage\u201d is not exactly no garbage. Under her scheme, refuse that can be composted or recycled is allowed, so her family can keep tossing out old cans and empty wine bottles along with food scraps. What turns out to be hard\u2014really, really hard\u2014is dealing with plastic.At first, Schaub divides plastic waste into two varieties. There\u2019s the kind with the little numbers, which her trash hauler accepts as part of its \u201csingle stream\u201d recycling program and so, by her definition, doesn\u2019t count as trash. Then, there\u2019s the kind with no numbers, which isn\u2019t supposed to go in the recycling bin and therefore does count. Schaub finds that even when she purchases something in a numbered container\u2014guacamole, say\u2014there\u2019s usually a thin sheet of plastic under the lid that\u2019s numberless. A lot of her time goes into rinsing off these sheets and other stray plastic bits and trying to figure out what to do with them. She is excited to find a company called TerraCycle, which promises\u2014for a price\u2014to \u201crecycle the unrecyclable.\u201d For a hundred and thirty-four dollars, she purchases a box that can be returned to TerraCycle filled with plastic packaging, and for an additional forty-two dollars she buys another box that can be filled with \u201coral care waste,\u201d such as used toothpaste tubes. \u201cI sent my TerraCycle Plastic Packaging box as densely packed with plastic as any box could be,\u201d she writes.Eventually, though, like Franklin-Wallis, Schaub comes to see that she\u2019s been living a lie. Midway through her experiment, she signs up for an online course called Beyond Plastic Pollution, offered by Judith Enck, a former regional administrator for the E.P.A. Only containers labelled No. 1 (pet) and No. 2 (high-density polyethylene) get melted down with any regularity, Schaub learns, and to refashion the resulting nurdles into anything useful usually requires the addition of lots of new material. \u201cNo matter what your garbage service provider is telling you, numbers 3, 4, 6 and 7 are not getting recycled,\u201d Schaub writes. (The italics are hers.) \u201cNumber 5 is a veeeery dubious maybe.\u201dTerraCycle, too, proves a disappointment. It gets sued for deceptive labelling and settles out of court. A documentary-film crew finds that dozens of bales of waste sent to the company for recycling have instead been shipped off to be burned at a cement kiln in Bulgaria. (According to the company\u2019s founder, this is the result of an unfortunate mistake.)\u201cI had wanted so badly to believe that TerraCycle and Santa Claus and the Easter bunny were real, that I had been willing to overlook the fact that Santa\u2019s handwriting looks suspiciously like Mom\u2019s,\u201d Schaub writes. Toward the end of the year, she concludes that pretty much all plastic waste\u2014numbered, unnumbered, or shipped off in boxes\u2014falls under her definition of garbage. She also concludes that, \u201cin this day, age and culture,\u201d such waste is pretty much impossible to avoid.A few months ago, the E.P.A. issued a \u201cdraft national strategy to prevent plastic pollution.\u201d Americans, the report noted, produce more plastic waste each year than the residents of any other country\u2014almost five hundred pounds per person, nearly twice as much as the average European and sixteen times as much as the average Indian. The E.P.A. declared the \u201cbusiness-as-usual approach\u201d to managing this waste to be \u201cunsustainable.\u201d At the top of its list of recommendations was \u201creduce the production and consumption\u201d of single-use plastics.Just about everyone who contemplates the \u201cplastic pollution crisis\u201d arrives at the same conclusion. Once a plastic bottle (or bag or takeout container) has been tossed, the odds of its ending up in landfill, on a faraway beach, or as tiny fragments drifting around in the ocean are high. The best way to alter these odds is not to create the bottle (or bag or container) in the first place.\u201cSo long as we\u2019re churning out single-use plastic . . . we\u2019re trying to drain the tub without turning off the tap,\u201d Simon writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to cut it out.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t rely on half-measures,\u201d Schaub says. \u201cWe have to go to the source.\u201d Her own local supermarket, in southern Vermont, stopped handing out plastic bags in late 2020, she notes. \u201cDo you know what happened? Nothing. One day we were poisoning the environment with plastic bags in the name of ultra-convenience and the next? We weren\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWe now know that we can\u2019t start to reduce plastic pollution without a reduction of production,\u201d Imari Walker-Franklin and Jenna Jambeck, both environmental engineers, observe in \u201cPlastics,\u201d forthcoming from M.I.T. Press. \u201cUpstream and systemic change is needed.\u201dOf course, it\u2019s a lot easier to talk about \u201cturning off the tap\u201d and changing the system than it is to actually do so. First, there are the political obstacles. For all intents and purposes, the plastics industry is a subsidiary of the fossil-fuel industry. ExxonMobil, for instance, is the world\u2019s fourth-largest oil company and also its largest producer of virgin polymers. The connection means that any effort to reduce plastic consumption is bound to be resisted, either openly or surreptitiously, not just by companies such as Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 but also by corporations like Exxon and Shell. In March, 2022, diplomats from a hundred and seventy-five nations agreed to try to fashion a global treaty to \u201cend plastic pollution.\u201d At the first negotiating session, held later that year in Uruguay, the self-described High Ambition Coalition, which includes the members of the European Union as well as Ghana and Switzerland, insisted that the treaty include mandatory measures that apply to all countries. This idea was opposed by major oil-producing nations, including the U.S., which has called for a \u201ccountry-driven\u201d approach. According to the environmental group Greenpeace, lobbyists for the \u201cmajor fossil fuel companies were out in force\u201d at the session.There are also practical hurdles. Precisely because plastic is now ubiquitous, it\u2019s difficult to imagine how to replace all of it, or even much of it. Even in cases where substitutes are available, it\u2019s not always clear that they\u2019re preferable. Franklin-Wallis cites a 2018 study by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency which analyzed how different kinds of shopping bags compare in terms of life-cycle impacts. The study found that, to have a lower environmental impact than a plastic bag, a paper bag would have to be used forty-three times and a cotton tote would have to be used an astonishing seventy-one hundred times. \u201cHow many of those bags will last that long?\u201d Franklin-Wallis asks. Walker-Franklin and Jambeck also note that exchanging plastic for other materials may involve \u201ctradeoffs,\u201d including \u201cenergy and water use and carbon emissions.\u201d When Schaub\u2019s supermarket stopped handing out plastic shopping bags, it may have reduced one problem only to exacerbate others\u2014deforestation, say, or pesticide use.\u201cIn the grand scheme of human existence, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that we got along just fine without plastic,\u201d Simon points out. This is true. It also wasn\u2019t all that long ago that we got along just fine without Coca-Cola or packaged guacamole or six-ounce bottles of water or takeout everything. To make a significant dent in plastic waste\u2014and certainly to \u201cend plastic pollution\u201d\u2014will probably require not just substitution but elimination. If much of contemporary life is wrapped up in plastic, and the result of this is that we are poisoning our kids, ourselves, and our ecosystems, then contemporary life may need to be rethought. The question is what matters to us, and whether we\u2019re willing to ask ourselves that question. \u2666",

Compare to entirely random global ids, like UUIDv4, that generally suffer from poor database locality.Thoughtful encoding: the base32 encoding is URL safe, case-insensitive, avoids ambiguous characters, can be selected for copy-pasting by double-clicking, and is a more compact encoding than the traditional hex encoding used by UUIDs (26 characters vs 36 characters).ImplementationsLanguage StatusGo \u2713 ImplementedPython ...

    "content": "Background Removal in the BrowserRemove backgrounds from images directly in the browser environment with ease and no additional costs or privacy concerns. Explore an interactive demo.Overview@imgly/background-removal is a powerful npm package that allows developers to seamlessly remove the background from images directly in the browser. With its unique features and capabilities, this package offers an innovative and cost-effective solution for background removal tasks without compromising data privacy.The key features of @imgly/background-removal are:In-Browser Background Removal: Our one-of-a-kind solution performs the entire background removal process directly in the user's browser, eliminating the need for additional server costs. By leveraging the computing power of the local device, users can enjoy a fast and efficient background removal process.Data Protection: As @imgly/background-removal runs entirely in the browser, users can have peace of mind knowing that their images and sensitive information remain secure within their own devices. With no data transfers to external servers, data privacy concerns are effectively mitigated.Seamless Integration with IMG.LY's CE.SDK: @imgly/background-removal provides seamless integration with IMG.LY's CE.SDK, allowing developers to easily incorporate powerful in-browser image matting and background removal capabilities into their projects.The Neural Network (ONNX model) and WASM files used by @imgly/background-removal are hosted on UNPKG, making it readily available for download to all users of the library. See the section Custom Asset Serving if you want to host data on your own servers.InstallationYou can install @imgly/background-removal via npm or yarn. Use the following commands to install the package:NPMnpm install @imgly/background-removalUsageimport imglyRemoveBackground from \"@imgly/background-removal\"let image_src: ImageData | ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array | Blob | URL | string = ...;imglyRemoveBackground(image_src).then((blob: Blob) => { // The result is a blob encoded as PNG. It can be converted to an URL to be used as HTMLImage.src const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);})Note: On the first run the wasm and onnx model files are fetched. This might, depending on the bandwidth, take time. Therefore, the first run takes proportionally longer than each consecutive run. Also, all files are cached by the browser and an additional model cache.Advanced ConfigurationThe library does not need any configuration to get started. However, there are optional parameters that influence the behaviour and give more control over the library.type Config = { publicPath: string; // The public path used for model and wasm files debug: bool; // enable or disable useful console.log outputs proxyToWorker: bool; // Whether to proxy the calculations to a web worker. (Default true) model: 'small' | 'medium'; // The model to use. (Default \"medium\")};Download Size vs QualityThe onnx model is shipped in various sizes and needs.small (~40 MB) is the smallest model and is in most cases working fine but sometimes shows some artifacts. It's a quantized model.medium (~80MB) is the default model.Download Progress MonitoringOn the first run, the necessary data will be fetched and stored in the browser cache. Since the download might take some time, you have the option to tap into the download progress.let config: Config = { progress: (key, current, total) => {  console.log(`Downloading ${key}: ${(current} of ${total}`); }}PerformanceThe performance is largely dependent on the feature set available. Most prominently, ensure that SharedArrayBuffer is available MDN. Due to the security requirements of SharedArrayBuffer two headers need to be set to cross-origin isolate your site:'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin','Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp'Custom Asset ServingCurrently, the wasm and onnx neural networks are served via unpkg. For production use, we advise you to host them yourself. Therefore, copy all .wasm and .onnx files to your public path $PUBLIC_PATH and reconfigure the library.cp node_modules/@imgly/background-removal/dist/*.wasm $PUBLIC_PATHcp node_modules/@imgly/background-removal/dist/*.onnx $PUBLIC_PATHimport imglyRemoveBackground, {Config} from \"@imgly/background-removal\"const public_path = \"https://example.com/assets/\" ; // the path assets are served fromlet config: Config = { publicPath: public_path, // path to the wasm files};let image_src: ImageData | ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array | Blob | URL | string = ...;imglyRemoveBackground(image_src, config).then((blob: Blob) => { // result is a blob encoded as PNG. // It can be converted to an URL to be used as HTMLImage.src const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);})Debug OutputsEnable debug outputs and logging to the consolelet config: Config = { debug: true};Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)If you are running into CORS issues you might want to pass additional parameters to the fetch function vialet config: Config = { fetchArgs: {  mode: 'no-cors' }};fetchArgs are passed as second parameters to the fetch function as described in MDN.Who is it for?@imgly/background-removal is ideal for developers and projects that require efficient and cost-effective background removal directly in the browser.

    "content": "A bookstore owner in Islamabad shows off a copy of one of National Geographic's most famous covers, featuring Afghan refugee Sharbat Gula in 1984. (B.K. Bangash/AP)Listen4 minShare this articleShareComment1423Like one of the endangered species whose impending extinction it has chronicled, National Geographic magazine has been on a relentlessly downward path, struggling for vibrancy in an increasingly unforgiving ecosystem.On Wednesday, the Washington-based magazine that has surveyed science and the natural world for 135 years reached another difficult passage when it laid off all of its last remaining staff writers.The cutback \u2014 the latest in a series under owner Walt Disney Co. \u2014 involves some 19 editorial staffers in all, who were notified in April that these terminations were coming. Article assignments will henceforth be contracted out to freelancers or pieced together by editors. The cuts also eliminated the magazine\u2019s small audio department.The layoffs were the second over the past nine months, and the fourth since a series of ownership changes began in 2015. In September, Disney removed six top editors in an extraordinary reorganization of the magazine\u2019s editorial operations.AdvertisementDeparting staffers said Wednesday the magazine has curtailed photo contracts that enabled photographers to spend months in the field producing the publication\u2019s iconic images.In a further cost-cutting move, copies of the famous bright-yellow-bordered print publication will no longer be sold on newsstands in the United States starting next year, the company said in an internal announcement last month.National Geographic writer Craig Welch noted the moment in a tweet on Wednesday: \u201cMy new National Geographic just arrived, which includes my latest feature \u2014 my 16th, and my last as a senior writer. \u2026 I\u2019ve been so lucky. I got to work w/incredible journalists and tell important, global stories. It\u2019s been an honor.\u201dThe magazine\u2019s current trajectory has been years in the making, set in motion primarily by the epochal decline of print and ascent of digital news and information. In the light-speed world of digital media, National Geographic has remained an almost artisanal product \u2014 a monthly magazine whose photos, graphics and articles were sometimes the result of months of research and reporting.AdvertisementAt its peak in the late 1980s, National Geographic reached 12 million subscribers in the United States, and millions more overseas. Many of its devotees so savored its illumination of other worlds \u2014 space, the depths of the ocean, little-seen parts of the planet \u2014 that they stacked old issues into piles that cluttered attics and basements.It remains among the most widely read magazines in America, at a time when magazines are no longer widely read. At the end of 2022, it had just under 1.8 million subscribers, according to the authoritative Alliance for Audited Media.National Geographic was launched by Washington\u2019s National Geographic Society, a foundation formed by 33 academics, scientists and would-be adventurers, including Alexander Graham Bell. The magazine was initially sold to the public as a perk for joining the society. It grew into a stand-alone publication slowly but steadily, reaching 1 million subscribers by the 1930s.AdvertisementThe magazine was eventually surpassed for profits and attention by the society\u2019s video operations, including its flagship National Geographic cable channel and Nat Geo Wild, a channel focused on animals. While they produced documentaries equal in quality to the magazine\u2019s rigorous reporting, the channels \u2014 managed by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox \u2014 also aired pseudoscientific entertainment programming about UFOs and reality series like \u201cSharks vs. Tunas\u201d at odds with the society\u2019s original high-minded vision.The magazine\u2019s place of honor continued to dim through a series of corporate reshufflings that began in 2015 when the Society agreed to form a for-profit partnership with 21st Century Fox, which took majority control in exchange for $725 million. The partnership came under the Disney banner in 2019 as part of a massive $71 billion deal between Fox and Disney.Among those who lost their jobs in the latest layoff was Debra Adams Simmons, who only last September was promoted to vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion at National Geographic Media, the entity that oversees the magazine and website.AdvertisementAt the time, David Miller, executive vice president of National Geographic Media, said the magazine was \u201crealigning key departments to help deepen engagement with our readers while also nurturing existing business models and developing new lines of revenue.\u201dIn an email to The Post on Wednesday, National Geographic spokesperson Chris Albert said staffing changes will not affect the company\u2019s plans to continue publishing a monthly magazine \u201cbut rather give us more flexibility to tell different stories and meet our audiences where they are across our many platforms.\u201d1423CommentsShareView more",

However, its popularity has declined over the years.\nThe magazine is transitioning to using more freelancers to write articles, rather than employing staff writers, raising concerns about the quality and depth of future content.\nThe decline of legacy media organizations reflects changing consumer habits and the rise of digital platforms, which offer cheaper or free content.- Many people are no longer paying for content and are watching more pulpy stuff.\n- The problem with the media landscape is that people are now the product, even when they pay.\n- Compensation is set by the law of supply and demand, not by equity.\n- The supply of top positions is artificially constrained, but workers should also be able to demand fair compensation.\n- It's hypocritical to complain about the decline of print journalism while not supporting it financially.\n- It's hard to justify paying for a single source unless you are a regular reader.\n- A possible solution is to have a payment aggregator for news that allows users to pay for articles from multiple sources.\n- The dream of a world where all content is available on all platforms is not feasible with the current networking physics and intellectual property enforcement.\n- Micropayments for news have been attempted before and have not been successful.\n- A possible solution is to create a compulsory licensing system for video and news.\n- There are challenges in implementing such a system, including enforcing equal payment for content and pricing when content creators gain popularity.\n- The payment process for online news needs to be simplified and made more seamless to encourage micropayments.\n- People are not willing to pay for small amounts of content because the payment flow is often cumbersome and time-consuming.\n- People are resistant to micropayments because they don't like spending money, even small amounts, for content they consider \"free.\"\n- A microtransaction model for news would need to address issues such as friction in the payment process and standardizing prices.\n- An alternate model is an all-you-can-read aggregated subscription service that allows access to content from multiple news sources.\n- Micropayments may not be the best solution for news articles, as people are hesitant to pay for individual articles.\n- The challenge is finding a balance between access to high-quality journalism and affordable pricing for users.\n- A micro-transactions model for news could benefit content creators by allowing them to monetize their work and incentivize quality journalism.\n- The difficulty lies in designing a payment flow that is user-friendly and efficient, with high levels of security and convenience.\n- People have had many ideas for micro-payment models for news, but the challenge lies in building a standard process that can onboard large news sources and gain user acceptance.\n- Micropayments have been tried in the past, but they have not gained widespread adoption due to various challenges such as payment friction and reluctance to pay for small amounts of content.\n- The viability of micropayments for news depends on the willingness of readers to pay for individual articles and the ability of news organizations to justify the value of their content.\n- Existing systems such as Apple News and Blendle offer alternatives to traditional subscription models, but they have not gained significant traction.\n- The challenge lies in finding a business model that balances user affordability, content quality, and the financial sustainability of news organizations.\n- Users are generally hesitant to pay for individual articles and prefer bundled subscription models.\n- The challenge lies in creating a payment model that benefits both users and content creators, taking into account factors such as quality, access, and affordability.\n- The micro-payments model for news content has been tried before with limited success, but improved user experience and standardized processes could make it more viable.\n- The main issue with micropayments is balancing the cost for readers and the revenue for content creators, while ensuring a seamless and accessible payment process.\n- A potential solution is compulsory licensing, which would allow multiple platforms to offer all content and distribute revenue among content creators.\n- The challenge lies in implementing a system that ensures fair compensation for content creators, prevents exclusivity, and provides flexibility for pricing and revenue distribution.\n- The idea of micropayments for news has been explored in various ways, but the challenge lies in finding a scalable and user-friendly solution that meets the needs of both readers and

Its purpose is to attract skilled people whose talents are in short supply stateside, thus adding flexibility to the economy, but the visa is believed to be widely abused \u2013 by employers who use it to find employees willing to work for less than their American peers.But the visa is vey popular in India \u2013 one of the main sources of H-1B applicants. Indeed it's so popular that the Biden Administration last week announced moderate reforms to the program during the state visit by Indian prime minster Narendra Modi.The H-1B also made news early in 2023 amid mass layoffs in the tech sector, because visa holders who don't have jobs have just 90 days to leave the Land of the Free.Canada has clearly spotted an opportunity to nab some talent that needs a bolt-hole \u2013 and can get that talent safe in the knowledge that its southern neighbor has vetted H-1B holders, and they already have some experience of working in North America.Uncle Sam probes H-1B abuse surge: What do our vultures make of it?Uncle Sam sounds like it may actually do something about rampant visa H-1B fraudGermany to court Indian IT talent \u2013 starting with easier visa application processesChina, India face tech brain drain through US universitiesCanada has created 10,000 places for H-1B holders, which must be filled within a year as of July 16.

Canada's revamped talent acquisition program is therefore not unusual, but is doubtless designed with the hope of giving it an edge.One audience the strategy doesn't explicitly address is Russians.

And it's not a pretty picture.A trio of compelling reports \u2014 the Greenhouse Candidate Experience Report, the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED), and Unispace's \"Returning for Good\" report \u2014 collectively paint a stark picture of this brewing storm.Unispace finds that nearly half (42%) of companies that mandated office returns witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated. And almost a third (29%) of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment. Imagine that \u2014 nearly half! In other words, they knew it would cause some attrition, but they weren't ready for the serious problems that would result.Perhaps they should have. According to the same Greenhouse report, a staggering 76% of employees stand ready to jump ship if their companies decide to pull the plug on flexible work schedules. Moreover, employees from historically underrepresented groups are 22% more likely to consider other options if flexibility goes out the window.In the SHED survey, the gravity of this situation becomes more evident. The survey equates the displeasure of shifting from a flexible work model to a traditional one to that of experiencing a 2 to 3% pay cut.Related: You Should Let Your Team Decide Their Approach to Hybrid Work. A Behavioral Economist Explains Why and How You Should Do It.The talent hunt: A game of chess with flexibility as the queenIn the game of talent acquisition and retention, flexible work policies have swiftly emerged as the queen on the chessboard \u2014 commanding, decisive and game-changing. The Greenhouse, SHED, and Unispace reports \u2014 when viewed together \u2014 provide compelling evidence to back this assertion.Greenhouse finds that 42% of candidates would outright reject roles that lack flexibility. In turn, the SHED survey affirms that employees who work from home a few days a week greatly treasure the arrangement. It's like enjoying a day at the beach while still being connected to the digital world.Curious about what's luring employees away? The Greenhouse report has cracked the code:Increased compensation (48%)Greater job security (34%)Career advancement opportunities (32%)Better flexible work policies (28%)A more positive company culture (27%)In other words, excluding career-centric factors such as pay, security and promotion, flexible work policies shine brighter than the Vegas Strip in employee desires.Interestingly, Unispace throws another factor into the mix \u2014 choice. According to their report, overall, the top feelings employees revealed they felt towards the office were happy (31%), motivated (30%) and excited (27%). However, all three of these feelings decrease for those with mandated office returns (27%, 26% and 22% respectively). This highlights that staff are more open to returning to the office if it is out of choice, rather than forced.Case studies of attrition with the return to officeTake, for example, a regional insurance company with a workforce of around 2000 employees. The company enforced a return to the office policy, causing waves of unrest. It soon became evident that their attrition rates were climbing steadily. It echoed the Greenhouse report's findings: a majority of employees, 76%, would actively seek a new job if flexible work policies were retracted. The underrepresented groups were even more prone to leave, making the situation more daunting.At that point, they called me to help as a hybrid work expert that The New York Times called the \"Office Whisperer.\" We worked on adapting their return-to-office plan, switching it from a top-down mandate to a team-driven approach, focusing on welcoming staff to the office for the sake of collaboration and mentoring. As a result, their attrition rates dropped and the feelings of employees toward the office improved, in line with what the Unispace report suggests.In another case study, a large financial services company began noticing employee turnover despite offering competitive salaries and growth opportunities. Upon running an internal survey, they realized that, aside from better compensation and career advancement opportunities, employees were seeking better flexible work policies. This aligned with the Greenhouse and SHED findings, which ranked flexible work policies as a crucial factor influencing job changes. After consulting with me, they adjusted their policies to be more competitive in offering flexibility.A late-stage SaaS startup decided to embrace this wave of change. They worked with me to introduce flexible work policies, and the result was almost immediate - they noticed a sharp decrease in employee turnover and an uptick in job applications. Their story echoes the collective message from all three reports: companies must adapt to flexible work policies or risk being swept away.Related: Why Empowering Your Hybrid Workers to Co-Create a Winning Return to Office Plan Leads to Longterm GainThe brain factor: How cognitive biases play a roleAs we navigate these shifting landscapes of work, we cannot ignore the human elements at play. Like unseen puppeteers, cognitive biases subtly shape our decisions and perceptions. In the context of flexibility and retention, two cognitive biases come into sharp focus: the status quo bias and anchoring bias.Imagine a thriving tech startup, successfully operating in a hybrid model during the pandemic. As the world normalized, leadership decided to return to pre-pandemic, in-person work arrangements. However, they faced resistance and an unexpected swell of turnover.This situation illustrates the potent influence of the status quo bias. This bias, deeply entrenched in our human psyche, inclines us towards maintaining current states or resisting change. Employees, having tasted the fruits of flexible work, felt averse to relinquishing these newfound freedoms. The Greenhouse report bears testament to this, with 76% of employees open to job hunting if their company rolled back flexible work policies.Consider a large financial institution that enforced a full return to office after the pandemic. Many employees, initially attracted by the brand and pay scale, felt disgruntled. The crux of the problem lies in the anchoring bias, which leads us to heavily rely on the first piece of information offered (the 'anchor') when making decisions.When initially joining the company, the employees were primarily concerned with compensation and job security, the \"anchors\" in their decision-making process. However, once within the fold, the pandemic caused them to shift their focus to work-life balance and flexibility, as confirmed by both the Greenhouse and SHED reports. Unfortunately, the rigid return-to-office policy made these new anchors seem less attainable, resulting in dissatisfaction and an increased propensity to leave.So, as we steer our ships through these tumultuous waters, understanding these cognitive biases can help illuminate our path. Recognizing and accounting for the status quo and anchoring biases can enable us to create a workplace that not only attracts but also retains its employees in this age of flexibility. After all, success in the world of business is as much about understanding people as it is about numbers and strategy.Embracing the wave of changeIf there's one overarching theme resonating from the Greenhouse, SHED, and Unispace reports, it's this: Companies need to embrace the wave of flexible work policies or risk being left adrift. As we set sail into the future of work, flexibility isn't just a passing trend; it's a necessity, the new standard. After all, the key to not just attracting talent, but retaining it, lies in one simple word: flexibility. To ignore it is like trying to run a marathon with one shoe. Possible, perhaps, but far from comfortable or efficient.",

The Online Safety Bill poses a serious threat to this protection, and could put UK citizens at greater risk.\"Apple urges the government to amend the bill to protect strong end-to-end encryption for the benefit of all.\"But the government told the BBC that \"companies should only implement end-to-end encryption if they can simultaneously prevent abhorrent child sexual abuse on their platforms.\"We will continue to work with them to seek solutions to combat the spread of child sexual abuse material while maintaining user privacy.\"The Online Safety Bill, currently going through Parliament, contains powers that could enable communications regulator Ofcom to direct platforms to use accredited technology to scan the contents of messages.The government said these powers would only be used as \"a last resort, and only when stringent privacy safeguards have been met\".Recently Home Office ministers have also been highly critical of Facebook's roll-out of the tech for messaging.IMAGE SOURCE,SOPA IMAGESImage caption,WhatsApp also opposes weakening the privacy of its encrypted appSeveral messaging platforms, including Signal and WhatsApp, have previously told the BBC they will refuse to weaken the privacy of their encrypted messaging systems if directed to do so.Signal said in February that it would \"walk\" from the UK if forced to weaken the privacy of its encrypted messaging app.Apple's statement now means that some of the most widely used encrypted apps oppose this part of the bill.The government argues it is possible to provide technological solutions that mean the contents of encrypted messages can be scanned for child abuse material.The only way of doing that, many tech experts argue, would be to install software that would scan messages on the phone or computer before they are sent, called client-side scanning.This, critics say, would fundamentally undermine the privacy of messages.In 2021 Apple announced plans to scan photographs on people's iPhones for abusive content before they were uploaded to iCloud but these were abandoned after a backlash. It has now clearly signalled its opposition to any measure that weakens the privacy of end-to-end encryption.'Routine scanning'Its announcement comes as the digital civil liberties campaigners The Open Rights Group sent an open letter to minister Chloe Smith.The letter, signed by more than 80 national and international civil society organisations, academics and cyber-experts, says: \"The UK could become the first liberal democracy to require the routine scanning of people's private chat messages, including chats that are secured by end-to-end encryption.\"As over 40 million UK citizens and 2 billion people worldwide rely on these services, this poses a significant risk to the security of digital communication services not only in the UK, but also internationally.\"Element, a British tech company whose products using E2EE are used by government and military clients, has previously told the BBC measures in the bill that are seen to weaken the privacy of encrypted messages would make customers less trustful of security products produced by UK firms.There is a growing expectation, the BBC has learned, that changes may be made to part of the bill which critics say could be used to mandate scanning. These could be included in a package of amendments to be revealed in the coming days.But it is not clear what the detail of those changes might be, or if they will satisfy the concerns of campaigners.Related TopicsEncryptionEnd-to-end encryptionAppleMore on this storyMinister attacks Meta boss over encryption planPublished24 MaySignal to quit UK if law changes on encryptionPublished24 February",

    "content": "OPINION>TECHNOLOGYTHE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY CONTRIBUTORS ARE THEIR OWN AND NOT THE VIEW OF THE HILLCongress doubles down on explosive claims of illegal UFO retrieval programsBY MARIK VON RENNENKAMPFF, OPINION CONTRIBUTOR - 06/27/23 7:30 AM ETSHARETWEETAsked June 26 about allegations of secret UFO retrieval and reverse-engineering programs, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made several stunning statements.In an exclusive interview, Rubio told NewsNation Washington correspondent Joe Khalil that multiple individuals with \u201cvery high clearances and high positions within our government\u201d \u201chave come forward to share\u201d \u201cfirst-hand\u201d UFO-related claims \u201cbeyond the realm of what [the Senate Intelligence Committee] has ever dealt with.\u201dRubio\u2019s comments provide context for a bipartisan provision adopted unanimously by the Senate Intelligence Committee, which would immediately halt funding for any secret government or contractor efforts to retrieve and reverse-engineer craft of \u201cnon-earth\u201d or \u201cexotic\u201d origin.This extraordinary language added to the Senate version of the Intelligence authorization bill mirrors and adds significant credibility to a whistleblower\u2019s recent, stunning allegations that a clandestine, decades-long effort to recover, analyze and exploit objects of \u201cnon-human\u201d origin has been operating illegally without congressional oversight.Additionally, the bill instructs individuals with knowledge of such activities to disclose all relevant information and grants legal immunity if the information is reported appropriately within a defined timeframe. Moreover, nearly 20 pages of the legislation appear to directly address recent events by enhancing a raft of legal protections for whistleblowers while also permitting such individuals to contact Congress directly.Researcher and congressional expert Douglas Johnson first reported on and analyzed the remarkable bill language, which, if it passes the House, could become law this calendar year.Beyond the Senate Intelligence Committee, the powerful investigative body that oversees the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies found the aforementioned whistleblower\u2019s allegations \u2014 that secret UFO-related programs are illegally withheld from Congress \u2014 to be \u201ccredible and urgent.\u201dMoreover, according to two reports, multiple military, intelligence and contractor officials corroborated claims that the U.S. government or private companies possess multiple craft of possible \u201cnon-human\u201d origin.Importantly, this intelligence bill is not the first instance of Congress addressing the possible existence of surreptitious UFO retrieval and reverse engineering programs.The 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden last December, established robust whistleblower protections for individuals with knowledge of secret UFO programs engaged in \u201cmaterial retrieval, material analysis, reverse engineering [and] research and development.\u201dBut the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s legislation goes significantly further than previous laws. If enacted as drafted, the legislation would immediately halt funding for any secret, unreported programs that engage in \u201canalyzing\u201d retrieved UFOs \u201cfor the purpose of determining properties, material composition, method of manufacture, origin, characteristics, usage and application, performance, operational modalities, or reverse engineering of such craft or component technology.\u201dAt the same time, the legislation would cease funding for any personnel engaged in \u201ccapturing, recovering, and securing [UFOs] or pieces and components of such craft.\u201dFunding would also be cut for \u201cthe development of propulsion technology, or aerospace craft that uses propulsion technology, systems, or subsystems, that is based on or derived from or inspired by inspection, analysis, or reverse engineering of recovered [UFOs] or materials.\u201dPerhaps more importantly, the bill language prohibits legal prosecution of individuals with knowledge of surreptitious retrieval and reverse engineering of \u201cnon-human\u201d craft. To avoid legal jeopardy, such individuals would have two months after passage of the legislation to inform the director of the Pentagon\u2019s new UFO analysis office of the existence of relevant UFO-related information.These individuals would then have six months to turn over \u201call such material and information,\u201d as well as \u201ca comprehensive list of all non-earth origin or exotic [UFO] material.\u201dImportantly, the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s legislation contains a \u201csense of Congress\u201d provision. Such resolutions typically convey a particular message from either the House or the Senate or, as in this case, from Congress as a whole.The \u201csense of Congress\u201d is that any illegally hidden craft of \u201cnon-earth\u201d or \u201cexotic\u201d origin must be brought out of the shadows for broader scientific and industrial analysis. In particular, the goal of the legislation is to \u201cavoid technology stovepipes\u201d \u2014 a reference to the non-sharing of information due to excessive secrecy and compartmentalization \u2014 and to integrate any recovered \u201cexotic technology\u201d into the nation\u2019s broader \u201cindustrial base.\u201dThe \u201csense of Congress\u201d provision aligns closely with concerns expressed by multiple officials that extraordinary secrecy prevents the robust scientific analysis required to make sense of the advanced, \u201cnon-human\u201d craft allegedly retrieved in recent decades.Of note, there are indications that at least one law enforcement entity is engaged in a sweeping investigation of the U.S. government\u2019s handling of UFOs.Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests are one of the few pathways through which private citizens can obtain government information on UFOs. Official documents and other data released under FOIA are frequently redacted to prevent the release of classified information. Importantly, each redaction must be grounded in a legal justification for why the relevant information is withheld.Recently, the U.S. government denied in full five FOIA requests encompassing a broad range of UFO-related topics. In a striking departure from previous practice, the government denied the requests on the grounds that release of the information may interfere with \u201cenforcement proceedings\u201d and \u201claw enforcement investigations or prosecutions.\u201dA rebellion at the Federal Reserve \u2014 can it avoid the next bank collapse?\u2018General Armageddon\u2019 may be the key to Putin\u2019s survivalThe application of such novel justifications for withholding government UFO information is circumstantial evidence that a law enforcement entity, such as the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, is engaged in a broad, and possibly criminal, investigation of the U.S. government\u2019s involvement with UFOs.After all, what government oversight body, explicitly charged with preventing unlawful activities, would fail to initiate a sweeping investigation of extraordinary and seemingly credible allegations of illegality?Marik von Rennenkampff served as an analyst with the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, as well as an Obama administration appointee at the U.S. Department of Defense.

    "summary": "- Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Marco Rubio has stated that individuals with high clearances and positions in the US government have come forward with first-hand claims of UFO-related activities beyond what the committee has dealt with before.\n- The Senate Intelligence Committee has adopted a provision in an intelligence authorization bill that would halt funding for any secret government efforts to retrieve and reverse-engineer craft of non-earth or exotic origin. The legislation also grants legal immunity to individuals who disclose relevant information within a defined timeframe.\n- This legislation goes further than previous laws and aims to bring illegal UFO-related programs out of the shadows for scientific and industrial analysis, while also enhancing legal protections for whistleblowers.",

    "hn_content": "- The US Congress is investigating claims of illegal UFO retrieval programs.\n- Leslie Kean and David Grusch made claims about non-human origin technology, but their sources lack firsthand knowledge and include proponents of questionable theories.\n- The \"Gimball Video\" has been cited but has not been conclusively discredited.\n- Congress is taking action based on mounting evidence for the existence of UFO-related programs.\n- Rubio's involvement in the investigation does not necessarily imply belief in the claims.\n- The bill focuses on Congress' authority to control funding and perform oversight.\n- There is a history of disinformation and deception related to UFO phenomena.\n- The topic generates widespread interest and discussion, but skepticism is warranted.\n- The existence of extraterrestrial life is a possibility, but extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\n- Finding evidence of intelligent extraterrestrial life would be a significant scientific discovery.\n- Critiques of the claims and evidence should be evaluated based on the expertise and credibility of the sources.- There is ongoing speculation and debate about the existence of extraterrestrial life and whether intelligent, technological civilizations exist beyond Earth.\n- Detecting intelligent non-technological life is likely impossible without actually visiting such a planet, and the development of technological civilizations is uncertain.\n- The recent discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) and the possibility of extraterrestrial visitation have generated interest and debate among the public and the government.\n- Some believe that the government may be using the UFO narrative as a distraction or to maintain the perception of military and intelligence superiority.\n- There is no clear evidence to support the claim that advanced extraterrestrial technologies are secretly being studied by the government.\n- The existence of advanced alien technology would raise significant questions about its implications, including energy solutions and advancements that could benefit humanity.\n- The government may have incentives to keep such technologies secret, such as maintaining military advantage or avoiding potential chaos and societal upheaval.",
