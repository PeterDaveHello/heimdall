    "hn_content": "The post discusses the advantages and disadvantages of using htmx, a technology that allows developers to create efficient web applications without using traditional single-page applications (SPAs) or multi-page applications (MPAs). The comments section includes debates on the benefits of client-side validation, front-end/back-end as separate teams, using development standards, and more. The post highlights the importance of considering user requirements in building complex UIs and whether decoupling the client and server would lead to bloated UIs. However, there is no significant news or exciting development mentioned in the post.Developers debate the merits of single-page applications versus multi-page applications (MPAs), with some arguing that MPAs are less bloated, faster, and easier to work with. Others argue that SPAs offer a better user experience, making them ideal for applications like mail. React is generally preferred to Ember and Angular, although the latter has become popular with .NET and Python back-end developers due to its similarity to C# and support for dependency injection. Issues with SPAs include breaking browser functionality, such as the back button, and blamed for producing badly-written applications that become needlessly difficult to maintain. The HTMX framework is seen by some as a good compromise between MPAs and SPAs because it offers the best of both worlds.The post is a thread discussing the comparison between Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) and Single-Page Applications (SPAs). The topic is that bad websites are the result of bad developers, not the tool and different developers prefer different frameworks based on their needs. The concept of SPA and MPA and the advantages of client-side caching in SPAs are discussed. There is a debate regarding the future of HTMX and the return of the \"backend frontender.\" The discussion covers that important verification of data need to be done on the server-side, and relying on client-side validation is insecure. Lastly, the bloat in SPAs mostly comes from Analytics and binary data, rather than functional code.- Web designers add analytics to websites despite its negative impact on website performance\n- Blocking unnecessary traffic can save more than half the data traffic\n- React's virtual DOM can impact website performance on mobile battery life \n- Node.js is a popular backend framework that allows reusing the same code for client and server-side code validation\n- HTML lacks tools for tracking user behavior, which makes SPAs important for tracking\n- SPAs need several server interactions, which can connect to several microservices and result in various requests \n- Combining client-side and server-side validation codes is challenging due to differences in shape, type, content, and constraints.- The discussion revolves around the validation of data on the client and server sides of web applications.\n- Some argue that all validation should be done on the server side for security reasons, while others say client-side validation improves user experience.\n- Password strength meters and caps lock warnings are examples of client-side validation that can improve UX but are not necessary for server-side validation.\n- SPA (Single Page Applications) are discussed, with some arguing that they offer better performance than MPA (Multi-Page Applications) but require more development effort to be implemented properly.\n- Some disagreement surrounds the creation of React versus Angular and whether NIH syndrome played a role in its development.Developers discuss the pros and cons of MPAs and SPAs for developing web applications. Some argue that HTMX provides a middle ground between the two, offering simplicity and a nice user experience without requiring a full data model on the client side. Others agree that all approaches have trade-offs and that the developer's skill is key to managing complexity. Additionally, the discussion touches on technology trends, such as the push towards server-side rendering and the use of JavaScript on both client and server. Overall, the conversation emphasizes the importance of considering the specific needs of an application when choosing a development framework rather than simply following the latest trend.The discussion revolves around the challenge of web app development, specifically the complexity of web frameworks and the difficulty of maintaining state in a multi-tiered system. HTMX, a hypermedia library, is presented as a potential solution, allowing for server-side rendering and reducing the need for JavaScript on the backend. The benefits of HTMX include simplicity, efficiency, and the elimination of the two-codebase problem. The creator of HTMX discusses state management, HATEOAS, and the implications for serverless apps. The challenges of web development and the need to select the right tools for the job are emphasized. Angular and React are also discussed, with some commenters highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.HTMX, a JavaScript library that uses HTML for a REST API to transfer state across the wire, allows web applications to create a smoother experience by enabling progressive enhancement. The library enables developers to structure their applications with HTML as a hypermedia, satisfying the hypermedia constraint of REST, and offers many features for smoother user experience. Its use of hypermedia ensures that the client and server are decoupled through a uniform interface, which allows the deployment of a new version of a mobile app without updating the client. While htmx can work without JavaScript enabled, the library is built to be used as progressive enhancement. Although HTMX is a JavaScript library, it is possible for HTML to implement similar functionalities without requiring JavaScript.",

    "content": "Home Writings About Twitter GitHub LinkedInHeisting 20 Million Dollars' Worth of Magic: The Gathering Cards in a Single RequestTLDRWith a little bit of math, decompilation, and understanding of computer architecture, we are going to force a user-controlled arithmetic overflow to occur in Magic: The Gathering Arena, and use it to buy millions of card packs for \"free\" (only using the starting amount of in-game currency given to new accounts).But the millions of dollars worth of digital cards isn't the reward here. The reward, hopefully, is knowledge.Tell 'em Tai:IntroDigital trading card games have put nerds in a bind. With physical TCGs, we used to be able to convince our life partners, and ourselves, that in some vague way we were really \"investing\" in collectibles that could be liquidated if needed. In recent years, though, digital card games like Hearthstone and its ilk have laid the facts bare for all to see: us card-game nerds are just gambling addicts with extra steps. It is about the rush of opening the packs, baby! Not ownership of the cards.Games like Magic: The Gathering Arena (MTGA) and Hearthstone are still massively popular and huge financial successes without any illusion of scarcity or value in a secondary market. The cards \"owned\" and \"opened\" by each account are all just numbers in a database somewhere. That change in ownership model is a double-edged sword though. We nerds can change numbers in a database much more easily than we can rob a board game shop. So, let's take advantage of that!Casing the jointMTGA is a Unity game, meaning that it is written in C#. C# decompiles extremely cleanly, making reverse engineering and manipulating the game logic a breeze. I covered this in more of a how-to format in my last post, so I will skip it here and just get to the interesting part. Looking at the purchasing logic for in-game store items, the following function is used by the game to submit a purchase request using in-game currency:...// PurchaseV2Req is essentially a JSON dictionary that later // gets marshalled and sent to the game server to make a purchasePurchaseV2Req purchaseV2Req = new PurchaseV2Req();purchaseV2Req.listingId = item.PurchasingId;// IMPORTANT LINE 1 - Sets quantity being orderedpurchaseV2Req.purchaseQty = quantity;purchaseV2Req.payType = Mercantile.ToAwsPurchaseCurrency(paymentType, this._platform);Client_PurchaseOption client_PurchaseOption = item.PurchaseOptions.FirstOrDefault(  (Client_PurchaseOption po) => po.CurrencyType == paymentType);// IMPORTANT LINE 2 - Calculates cost of orderpurchaseV2Req.currencyQty = (  (client_PurchaseOption != null) ? client_PurchaseOption.IntegerCost : 0) * quantity;purchaseV2Req.customTokenId = customTokenId;PurchaseV2Req request = purchaseV2Req;...}When I took a look at this, it stood out to me that a request to purchase something from the store includes both the quantity being ordered and a calculated price of what the order should cost. What's more, the price is calculated by the client(!) by multiplying the unit price of whatever is being purchased by the quantity being ordered. If that second important line is confusing to you, here it is in a more readable way:if (client_PurchaseOption != null) {  purchaseV2Req.currencyQty = client_PurchaseOption.IntegerCost * quantity;} else {  purchaseV2Req.currencyQty = 0 * quantity;}Seeing a client-side price calculation, I began the classic QA-engineer-beer-ordering workflow:A QA engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd.First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames, killing everyone.\u2014 Brenan Keller (@brenankeller) November 30, 2018First I tried messing with the purchaseQty field by setting it to a negative number, just to see if there was any weird behavior there. My hope was that the logic for deducting a payment from my account serverside would look something like this:accountBalance -= client_PurchaseOption.IntegerCost * quantityIf I purchased -1 card packs from the store, at a price of 200 gems (MTGA's in-game currency), purchaseV2Req.currencyQty would equal -200. Subtracting that from my account balance would give me more money!This did not work. The server checks to make sure that you are ordering a quantity greater than 0, and prevents the purchase from going through if not.I then tried messing with currencyQty, the calculated price. I thought this was going to be a winner and that I would be able to purchase whatever I wanted for 0 gems. No dice there either. If I tried to change the calculated price, I would get the following error back, due to a mismatch with a price calculation performed server-side:{ \"code\": \"Store_IncorrectCurrency\", \"message\": \"Failed to purchase listing because currencyQuantity is not equal to calculated price\"}Ok, weird. That means that the client has to send a correctly calculated price in the purchase order, because the server validates the order by performing its own price calculation. While this left me stumped as to why the client-side calculation even exists, it meant I couldn't just tell the game to give me free cards, or cards at a negative price, or anything else.But I wasn't ready to give up yet. The fact that I could see the logic of how this price calculation was made allowed me to make some assumptions about the server-side check:The same arithmetic is likely used server-side to validate a purchase requestIt is potentially the exact same implementation, meaning whatever server-side application is receiving my requests is also written in C#Now that second bullet is a pretty big jump in reasoning, but I was willing to roll with it because it opened up the opportunity to make a purchase that was technically correct, but still let me make out like a bandit.The heistArithmetic overflow occurs when the output of an operation is a value bigger than can be stored in the destination data type. It is like chubby bunny, but with bits. In our case, the destination is the int data type.In C#, an int is represented under the hood as 4 bytes, or 32 bits. In hex, the max value of the 4-byte value is 0xFFFFFFFF, or 11111111111111111111111111111111 in binary.What happens when you add 1 to 11111111111111111111111111111111? 11111111111111111111111111111111+ 00000000000000000000000000000001--------------------------------- 100000000000000000000000000000000It should become 100000000000000000000000000000000, but that is 33 bits - one bit more than what our data type allows. So instead, the most significant bit is dropped, leaving us with 00000000000000000000000000000000. It rolls back over to zero.Small aside: the int representation of 0xFFFFFFFF is actually -1 in C# due to the use of two's complement to allow the data type to store negative numbers. This means that the overflow kind of works as intended. When you add 1 to -1, both the underlying binary and the int representation zero out. 0x00000000 = 0. But you don't need to worry about that. All you need to know is that if the output of an operation is greater than 0xFFFFFFFF, the output value will essentially be output % 0xFFFFFFFF.So, with our new knowledge of arithmetic overflows, do you see how we are going to heist our Magic cards? Looking back at this line of code, I see two things:purchaseV2Req.currencyQty = client_PurchaseOption.IntegerCost * quantity;There aren't any checks for overflowsThe user controls one of those variablesAssuming that the server logic is similar to what is done on the client, we should be able to overflow this integer by ordering an astronomically high number of packs. Let's plug some numbers in!One pack of cards costs 200 gems, and we know the max underlying value is 0xFFFFFFFF. Therefore, we can figure out how many packs we'd need to order to overflow our order price back around past 0, and only pay for the remainder. A Python interpeter will do just fine:>>> (0xFFFFFFFF/200) + 1 # add one to round up to the nearest int that will overflow21474837We add 1 to the quotient to get the largest whole number that will surpass the overflow, since Python always rounds down when casting floats to ints. This means while we are ordering 21 million packs, our payment will be as close to 0 as feasibly possible. Potentially under the price of a single pack!We could order a number of packs higher than 21474837 as well, but all that is going to do is make the remainder, the price we are going to pay, higher. That is, until you order a number that, when modded with 0xFFFFFFFF, will wrap around to 0 again - which would essentially be around the area of multiples of 21474837.Pulling it offThere's something else I forgot to mention. There's no way to actually submit bulk orders for an arbitrary number of packs in the UI. There's just a big button to buy a pack (and preset quantities of 10, 25, etc):But that's no problem, now that we know the order quantity needed to perform the overflow, we can just patch our binary with the appropriate opcodes to have the quantity hardcoded into our order! In C# it would look like this:...// PurchaseV2Req is essentially a JSON dictionary that later // gets marshalled and sent to the game server to make a purchasePurchaseV2Req purchaseV2Req = new PurchaseV2Req();purchaseV2Req.listingId = item.PurchasingId;// Important Line 1 - Sets quantity being orderedpurchaseV2Req.purchaseQty = quantity * 21474837;purchaseV2Req.payType = Mercantile.ToAwsPurchaseCurrency(paymentType, this._platform);Client_PurchaseOption client_PurchaseOption = item.PurchaseOptions.FirstOrDefault(  (Client_PurchaseOption po) => po.CurrencyType == paymentType);// Important Line 2 - Calculates cost of orderpurchaseV2Req.currencyQty = (  (client_PurchaseOption != null) ? client_PurchaseOption.IntegerCost : 0) * quantity * 21474837;purchaseV2Req.customTokenId = customTokenId;PurchaseV2Req request = purchaseV2Req;...}(And in case you're wondering why I didn't just recreate the purchase request in python or something, it is because the shop communication is over some sort of socket. It wasn't just a REST api and it didn't seem worth figuring out.)So with the binary patched, lets click our button and buy a pack...Bada-bing, bada-boom. With a single click, over 20 million dollars worth of Magic cards has been deposited to my account (if you calculate the gems-to-dollars exchange rate, a conservative estimate is each pack costs a little over a dollar).How much did that put us back? Well, we can do the math ourselves:>>> (200 * 21474837) % 0xFFFFFFFF105105 gems! Less than the cost of a single pack. We can check the purchase logs just to be sure though:{ { \"InventoryInfo\": {  \"SeqId\": 5,  \"Changes\": [   {    \"Source\": \"MercantilePurchase\",    \"SourceId\": \"Packs-KHM-1-Listing\",    \"InventoryGems\": -104,    \"InventoryCustomTokens\": {},    \"ArtStyles\": [],    \"Avatars\": [],    \"Sleeves\": [],    \"Pets\": [],    \"Emotes\": [],    \"Decks\": [],    \"DecksV2\": [],    \"DeckCards\": {},    \"Boosters\": [     {      \"CollationId\": 100022,      \"SetCode\": \"KHM\",      \"Count\": 21474837     }    ],  ...Yup! In fact we get an extra gem off compared to our Python calculation. Not sure where that one got added or lost between the two calculations.Each account in MTGA starts with 250 gems which can be used to get hooked on the delicious sensation of opening packs. That means you could perform this exploit right off the bat with a new account, without spending any money. Now that's how you really start filling out your collection fast!A final twistAnother twist here, that I wasn't expecting, is that there are a finite number of cards per set. There is also a cap on the number of copies of each card you can own: you can only open 4 copies of each card before they become useless since you can't use more than 4 copies of a card in a deck. So what happens when you open so many packs that you reach the limit? I set up my autoclicker and found out. Once you cannot collect any more cards, the packs instead refund you gems.And let me tell you, you hit the card limit looooooong before you are even through your first 10,000 packs for whatever set you bought. This then gives you an nigh-infinite trove of gems to go out and buy 21 million packs of each of the other sets with! Or buy cosmetics, or participate in events, or whatever. MTGA just became truly free-to-play!(Except not, because I reported this vulnerability to them and it has been patched. Shoutout to the WotC security and engineering teams for being lovely to work with and patching this bug in a timely manner!)ConclusionI hope this has been an illustrative example of the power of a simple bug. Just because a bug is simple, don't assume that it isn't there. Most of the crazy zero-click remote code execution exploits used by government agencies today also stem from simple missed checks on user-controlled variables. Ian Beer, one of the most talented vulnerability researchers in the world, sometimes just sits down and looks for memmove calls in the iOS kernel with controllable input. This led to him discovering a wormable, zero-click, remote code execution exploit over radio. But that stuff is the big leagues. For now, I am content just being able to build some new decks with my bug hunting :)P.S. -- There is also something to be said here about the value of digital goods. Frankly, I am ambivalent. The reality is that digital goods do and will continue to exist, and things like this are a side effect of that reality.

    "content": "May 5, 2023I am frequently away from home (whether on family vacation, a business trip, or out around town), but I have a number of important resources on my home network\u2014as any homelabber does.There are services I like to access remotely like my NAS with my giant media library, my edit server with all my active projects, and especially Home Assistant, which lets me monitor all aspects of my home.Some people rely on individual cloud services from IoT vendors and have a bunch of apps to connect to each type of device independently. As someone who has dealt with numerous security breaches for numerous services, I know not to trust 50 different cloud-connected devices in my home.That's why I'm a 'self-hosted' homelabber, and why I try to find devices that don't leave my local network.But that creates a conundrum: it is nice to be able to connect to everything from afar. Enter PiVPN: in the olden days, when Raspberry Pis could be found at your corner drugstore for $35, it was probably the cheapest way to get yourself a fully-self-hosted VPN, assuming you have a public IP address.PiVPN, luckily, runs on any other Pi-like device, though, as long as it's running a Debian or Pi-OS-like distro. Something like a Libre Computer Le Potato should work in a pinch, without breaking the bank\u2014though if you want faster networking, you'll have to pony up a little more cash, at least until the Pi shortage abates.And PiVPN lets you pick one of two tried-and-true VPN stacks: OpenVPN or WireGuard. In my case, I already have a Pi that I bought way back in the fairy-tale times of 2019, and I wanted to try out WireGuard\u2014mostly because I have managed OpenVPN before and found it... not fun.VideoI have a full video which runs through the entire setup process, and shows a demo of me using it both in my Dad's radio studios and over in the UK. If you prefer to read instead of watch, just keep scrolling ;)DNS and IP setupBecause WireGuard likes to have stability when it comes to DNS and IP addresses, I needed to give my Pi a stable DNS name and IP address on my home network.So the first thing I did was use my router's software to statically assign an IP address to the Pi based on it's MAC address. Then, purely for convenience on my local network, I set up the DNS assignment pivpn.geerli.net on the Pi-hole that runs DNS on my home network (geerli.net is a domain I purchased and use only for devices on my home network).Then, I used sudo raspi-config to set the hostname for my Pi to pivpn.geerli.net.Now that the Pi had a persistent IP address and an easy-to-remember local DNS name, I moved ahead with the PiVPN install.Note: You don't have to do this step\u2014you could try setting a static IP in the install wizard later. But I like managing all my static IP assignments on my router, centrally, in its DHCP settings.Silencing the PoE HAT FansSince I'm running this Pi in my rack, I'm using a PoE HAT with it's annoying little fan. I decided to take control of the overly-aggressive fan and only have it run when the Pi was getting a bit hot, instead of having it run nearly all day.PiVPN InstallationMost of the time, I'll write an Ansible playbook to automate my entire server build, but this time, I'm trusting the PiVPN installer\u2014for now at least\u2014which can be run with the command:curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bashI followed the install wizard, and chose WireGuard when prompted. I kept the default port (51820), and since I run Pi-hole on my network and use it as my local DNS server, I chose the 'Custom' option for DNS Provider, and input the IP address of the server running Pi-hole.For the 'DNS or IP' option, I chose to assign a public DNS name to my VPN server, since I point a few public DNS records (e.g. servicename-subdomain.example.com) to cover my home network. To make that work, I added a DNS A record for my home's IP address to my domain settings, pointing pivpn-subdomain.example.com at my home's public IP address (which I found by running curl icanhazip.com).Then on my router, I configured port forwarding for external UDP port 51820 to the assigned internal IP address of PiVPN. Now, external traffic from the public Internet can route through the Pi to PiVPN.Note: Security is a major concern here\u2014don't set up a VPN if you don't know what you're doing. If someone gets access through the VPN to your home network, they can (and will) hack into your house!Since I already enable automated updates using my geerlingguy.security role for Ansible in my homelab playbook, I skipped that part of the Pi VPN setup wizard, then completed the installation process with a reboot.Setting up a VPN ProfileThe next step is to connect to the VPN from another device\u2014in my case, my Mac laptop.After the Pi rebooted, I logged back in, and ran:pivpn addI set a name for the client profile (I generally use a format like username-devicetype-id, and once it generated the .conf file, I copied that over to my laptop.Connecting from my MacWhen I used to use OpenVPN, I used Viscosity since I liked the simple UI. But as I'm switching to WireGuard, I installed the official Wireguard app from the App Store.In Wireguard, I clicked \"Import Tunnel(s) from File...\" and chose the .conf file I copied from PiVPN.From that point, it was a matter of testing it on an external network. I switched my MacBook Air to connect via my iPhone's hotspot, and then connected with Wireguard by clicking the 'Activate' button (you can also enable the connection from the Wireguard menu bar item).If you are able to ping other devices on your home network, congratulations! You have successfully built your own private VPN!Sadly, due to overhead, you'll get a little less bandwidth than if you were on the network directly. But bandwidth is adequate for my purposes, assuming I'm on a stable Internet connection.You can test the overhead from the VPN connecting while you're on your home LAN. Try this, and run a speed test on https://speed.cloudflare.com, once without the VPN connected, and once connected. Compare the two speeds and that's the overhead of the VPN connection.On my LAN, the download speed goes from around 600 Mbps to 237 Mbps, but upload remains close to the measly 35 Mbps Spectrum gives me.And connected through my iPhone on AT&T over a pretty poor signal (2/4 bars), I can get 32 Mbps down and 4 up through the VPN\u2014not too bad! That's a little under line speed on the iPhone through AT&T directly, but it's workable, and has saved me a few times when I needed to grab something from the LAN remotely!Connecting from my iPhoneIt's also convenient to be able to browse my NAS or access my servers from my iPhone directly, and Wireguard has apps for both Android and iOS to make the connection easy.To set up a new mobile VPN connection:Make sure the Wireguard app is installed on your phoneCreate a new client for your phone (like username-iphone-id) with pivpn addRun pivpn -qr to display a QR code in the terminal:$ pivpn -qr:: Client list ::1) jgeerling-mba-home2) jgeerling-iphone-homePlease enter the Index/Name of the Client to show: 2::: Showing client jgeerling-iphone-home below=====================================================================[QR CODE WILL DISPLAY HERE]In the phone app, add a new VPN connection and scan the QR code. Name it the same as you named the client in PiVPN, and it should work! You can test by disabling WiFi on your phone and connecting to the VPN.If it's working, visiting a site like icanhazip.com should show you your home IP address, not the IP address of your mobile phone carrier.Troubleshooting PiVPNIf you have any issues, the first thing to do is run pivpn -d, which outputs a bunch of debug information, and runs some self-tests. If everything checks out, it could be you have DNS issues\u2014it's almost always DNS.Another handy command is pivpn -c, which shows a list of all clients and their last connection times, with data transfer stats.Backing up your VPN configurationIt's a good idea to back up your VPN configuration, in case PiVPN ever nukes itself. Run pivpn backup, and that will generate a backup tarball inside ~/pivpnbackup. Copy that off to a safe place, and a full restore will be as simple as restoring all the files to the proper location on a fresh install of PiVPN.Dealing with Dynamic DNSMy ISP doesn't provide a static IP address for my home, so I have to deal with the fact that the public IP changes sometimes. And it's weird, sometimes it changes a couple times a day, other times once a month. As luck would have it, my IP changed literally minutes after I first set up PiVPN, which threw me for a loop as I thought it was irrevocably broken!The problem is, whenever my home's public IP address changes, I have to make sure the DNS A record for pivpn-subdomain.example.com is updated in my domain registrar account. And that's not as simple as you'd hope.The common way of dealing with this 'Dynamic DNS' or DDNS problem is to use a DDNS service like DynDNS or No-IP. These require a service running on your router or a device on the network that periodically updates their server with your home IP.In my case, since I'm a little guarded and don't like pushing my IP address anywhere out of my control, I publish my IP address to one of my webservers running on DigitalOcean, to a file where I can retrieve it should the IP change and my VPN connection fails.I have a custom shell script set up for that, running on one of my Pis, but I haven't had time to clean it up and put it in one of my public Git repos. I'll do that... someday.But doing that could be as simple as creating a file named update-ip.sh:#!/bin/bashwget -O /tmp/ip.txt icanhazip.com# Command to push this file up to one of your servers goes here.And adding a cron job like:*/10 * * * * /usr/local/share/update-ip.shThis would update your IP address every 10 minutes. Have update-ip.sh push it up to a server you can access anywhere, and bingo! You just created yourself a self-hosted DDNS service!For bonus points, have the script only detect a change in IP addresses, and have it shoot you an email or ping you via [Slack|Discord|SMS|Signal|Telegram|Email|IRC|Skype|whatever the cool chat app of the day is], only when it changes!Dealing with CGNATIf your ISP uses CGNAT (Carrier-Grade NAT), then you will not have a publicly-reachable IP address on your home network.Unfortunately, that limits the ability to run a private VPN, since you effectively don't have a direct gateway to the public Internet.In this case, you can either see what it takes to get a publicly routable IP address from your ISP (sometimes business plans offer this feature), or consider using a service like Tailscale, Cloudflare Tunnel, or Twingate.Further readingSSH and HTTP to a Raspberry Pi behind CG-NATMonitor your Internet with a Raspberry PiUsing 4G LTE wireless modems on a Raspberry Piraspberry pi vpn wireguard pivpn how-to tutorialAdd new commentCommentsPeter Nikolow \u2013 14 hours agoOr you can use ZeroTier if you need to deal with CGNAT.

Due to this setup and both using different docker networks I can't see even in full detailed Pi-hole log-mode which devices queried which domain/host - which is very privacy-friendly and nice for my users (mainly family and friends).

Any advice?replytim \u2013 5 hours agointeresting article. my broadband is over mobile, so no static ip. I used to have a vpn which provided a static ip and allowed port forwarding so I could host some web sites and email locally, but the vpn stopped working, and I can't find another vpn provider that offers static ip and ability for port forwarding. I do have a vps with a couple of static ip's so thought I could set up my own vpn host on it to provide my lan router (which has vpn client capablilty) a public static ip. Any chance of a video on how to do that for all us people stuck with mobile broadband, a \"home lab\" and a public vps?

    "hn_content": "The post discusses building your own private VPN with PiVPN using Raspberry Pi, with suggestions from users on different hardware options and their pros and cons. One user expresses a preference for using Intel mini PCs over ARM chips for homelab purposes, while another argues that Raspberry Pi's popularity and brand recognition make it a good choice for compatibility among project contributors. Various hardware options and performance metrics are discussed, with some users noting alternatives to Raspberry Pi, including Rock5B, Orange PI 5, Khadas VIM1S, and NanoPi R6S, and recommending websites like Ameridroid for more options.The Tech Times comments section discusses options for personal servers, with some users recommending old laptops or Celeron mini pcs over Mac Minis due to cost and reliability concerns. One user also shares their positive experience using WireGuard on a Raspberry Pi as a VPN while traveling overseas. The conversation touches on reasons why some US business sites block overseas IP addresses due to security concerns or laws such as GDPR, but one user notes that small, local businesses may not have any international footprint and so blocking IP addresses may be unnecessary.US-based Home Depot blocks foreign traffic to avoid GDPR issues. While some commenters support this approach, others argue that it can inconvenience genuinely interested US-based customers traveling abroad and that it is not the most effective way to comply with GDPR. A discussion arises around user tracking and data privacy laws, with mentions of California's strict data privacy laws, GDPR, and CCPA. Some suggest using VPNs to access HD services while traveling abroad. Despite this discussion, one commenter points out that PiVPN can run on any Pi-like device, which can be a cost-effective solution for those willing to set up their own VPN.Software engineer and university students reading Tech Times would know that Wireguard is a VPN protocol that is easier to use than traditional VPNs. Tailscale is a VPN service that uses Wireguard as its VPN protocol and simplifies the setup process. PiVPN is a simple open-source VPN server based on Wireguard and created for Raspberry Pi devices but can also run on other devices. GL.iNet GL-SFT1200 is an alternative device that can run PiVPN. OpenWRT is another alternative with a web UI that makes it easier to generate configuration files for client devices. Tailscale is battery-heavy on iOS but its developers are addressing this. Nebula is an alternative to Tailscale with built-in mesh-style direct routing. Troubleshooting firewall issues when trying to use UDP from publicly accessible Wi-Fi networks can be resolved by changing the protocol being used. If you need TCP traffic, OpenVPN is a good option. Outline/Shadowsocks is an alternative to VPN when dealing with state-wide censorship.This article discusses various options and tools available for setting up a WireGuard VPN. It includes comments from users discussing their preferred tools and methods, including using Raspberry Pi with WireGuard and PiVPN, setting up on a cloud server with Outline or deploying on existing servers via easy-wg-quick or ZeroTier. Users also discuss adding a Pi-Hole for ad blocking and using DDNS services. Some comments provide insights into the potential risks and challenges with using these VPN setups, such as fingerprinting and detection by China's Great Firewall. Additionally, users discuss alternative VPN options and improving security with post-quantum key exchanges.An individual used a basic method for working from home called the 'poor man's VPN,' allowing access to internal devices at work without requesting any firewall changes. The method involved using SSH access to one machine at work, named ssh.example.com, that could reach all internal machines. The author's requirements were that they could refer to work machines by the same names and that it only had to support explicitly specified host: port combinations. The author had to add configuration files on the Mac OS to redirect ports to local machines, and this method worked well until the author upgraded to MacOS Yosemite, which removed the ipfw feature. Another commentator on the post suggested using Wireguard, rather than using the 'curl | bash' method.",

Some mention existing laws that protect proprietary code like Windows, and others argue it is unrealistic to expect private firms to give away their code in exchange for government contracts. The original poster of the article, however, clarified that \"Public Money, Public Code\" refers to state governments, not the federal or private sector.The US government is introducing a new open source initiative to encourage government agencies to share their code publicly. The Code.gov scheme will allow governments to select certain code to be open sourced under specified licences. Critics have questioned whether all government software will be made open source, however, US citizens are in favour of the move as it seeks to use the money of taxpayers in a more efficient way, and it allows private citizens to verify code that affects their daily life. Many other countries, including the UK and Australia, have similar initiatives in place. The government may opt to buy existing systems and use the code rather than going to the expense of building brand new ones.A discussion on whether municipalities and counties should collaborate on open source software or use closed source software. Some argue that open source software would result in higher quality services at lower costs, while others are skeptical about unmaintainable and slightly different open projects. The post suggests that publicly funded software should be open source, but this may not always be possible due to outsourcing and security risks. The benefits of open source software include potential tax savings, collaboration, and serving the public, while fostering innovation and transparent processes.

The concept of embeddings is explained in relation to natural language processing and machine learning. Contributors are paid for their open-source work, and some vector databases offer cloud-based hosting with free trials. There is some discussion surrounding the potential for copycat services and the challenges of scaling. Finally, some users express satisfaction with various vector databases and ask for more detailed comparisons and use cases.An embedding is a collection of learned vectors that represent items in a high-dimensional space based on similarity. The vectors can represent any type of thing, and are learned using a machine learning algorithm from examples. The idea is to put items that are similar into similar parts of the vector space, so they can be processed by ML algorithms. Embeddings are useful for tasks such as search, recommendations, similarity measurement etc. For example, you could generate an embedding of face photos or words based on visual or semantic similarity and use it to group similar items. To generate recommendations for a product, you take the vector for that product and then search through the set of all product vectors to find those that are closest to it in the vector space. In practice, embeddings are used to perform vector similarity queries or nearest-neighbor searches on databases of items.A vector database is used for querying similar images or text through machine learning models, which produce an embedding that describes the content. These embeddings are stored in a vector database, which can then be used to find the closest vectors and their primary keys to the queried vector. This method is the basis of \"search by image\" tools, such as Google's. While some readers criticized the article for being a thinly-veiled advertisement, it still provides a valuable explanation of vector databases and embeddings. There are also various libraries and software available for implementing vector databases. Implementing such databases yourself is possible, but it is difficult to scale to large datasets and queries with real-time constraints.The article discusses the use of vector databases for storing and searching through embeddings created and consumed by AI models. These databases offer scale and convenience for dealing with large amounts of embeddings and strict performance requirements. Pinecone is a managed vector database that is discussed in the article, along with other alternatives such as Milvus and Typesense. The use of binary embeddings is also mentioned, which can save space and have been successfully used by companies such as Pinterest. Lastly, the article touches on the difficulties of working with high-dimensional algorithms and the challenges of optimizing performance and stability.The article discusses vector databases used for similarity searches of embeddings used in various ML applications. They are typically designed to store embeddings, which can be generated practically with OpenAI API, representing various features of image or text as a list of numbers. It offers a different approach to organizing data than traditional SQL tables and supports fast querying with near-perfect accuracy. The linked comments provide readers with additional information, including alternative lightweight open-source vector database solutions, and discussions on vector database basics and applications, architecture, and indexing. The article also mentions that vector databases are increasingly popular with AI applications due to the success of GPT-3 and NLP.This post contains no meaningful content.",

    "content": "See all postsGo to full siteIndia bans flagship client for the Matrix networkMay 05, 2023MATRIXOnce again we see bureaucrats with a poor understanding of how modern technology works deny ordinary people their right to privacy, as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 12).This time it\u2019s India, where Element is one of 14 messaging apps blocked by the Central Indian Government which - we believe from media reports - relates to Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Element is a small company, so we concentrate our Legal, Compliance and Trust & Safety functions in the UK. We will, of course, respect local laws where we are obligated to and have always made it clear that we cooperate with authorities where required by law. As we understand it, Indian government officials claim to have approved the ban due to Element (and other apps) not having representatives in India.That is a bit of guesswork on our part, because we did not receive any prior notice of the decision; clarification from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology would be most welcome.While Element never compromises end-to-end encryption or user privacy, we have been contacted by Indian authorities in the past and addressed them in a constructive fashion (typically responding same-day). Indeed our Trust & Safety team works with governments to build safer secure communications for everyone; while ensuring user privacy and protecting end-to-end encryption.As much as people in India will be able to trivially circumvent the blocking of the 14 messaging apps, we want to resolve this situation and be available as usual in India. That resolution will have to be, of course, in a way that respects our users and understands our commitment to everyone\u2019s right to private and secure communications. We look forward to talking with the Ministry about how to make that happen.Delisted for being decentralised?We assume that this ban on Element is a result of a misunderstanding around decentralised and federated services such as Matrix (an open standard for real time communication). The Element app is just one of many apps that give access to the Matrix network. A simple parallel is that banning Element because it gives access to the Matrix network is the equivalent to blocking Google Chrome because it gives people access to the web, or Gmail because it gives people access to email.Some governments see undermining encryption as the most effective way to combat the ills of terrorism or other illegal behaviour. That approach is completely flawed; it just removes ordinary people\u2019s ability to communicate in private which leaves them vulnerable to all types of surveillance, crime and subjugation.In actual fact, end-to-end encryption strengthens national security which is why Element has various parts of the French, German, Swedish, UK and US governments as customers.Undermining end-to-end encryption is an attack on people\u2019s basic human right to privacy and security of communications. Rather than accept that as a cost to pay, we look to preserve and protect those rights, and to work with governments, journalists, non-profits, academic researchers and the rest of the tech industry to rise to the challenge of reducing those harms.So, as always, we will proactively engage with the authorities - in this case the Central Indian Government - to champion the importance of secure and private communications. The right to private communication is an essential part of democracy, and protects against oppressive regimes. Technology should protect those rights, not destroy them.Denise AlmeidaRelated PostsGOVERNMENTdSam and eSam endorse Matrix for secure and federated communications in the Swedish public sectorMagnus Hult1/12/2022VOIPIntroducing Native Matrix VoIP with Element Call!Hopefully in-person meet-ups will proveJake Bowen-Bate4/03/2022INTEROPERABILITYWhat is App Fog?

    "hn_content": "The Central Indian Government has blocked 14 messaging apps, including Element, for not having a representative in India. Some speculate that this is due to the government's desire for backdoor access to messaging platforms. However, experts argue that end-to-end encryption (E2EE) still provides confidentiality of message content, which is the primary purpose of E2EE. While auditing the source code and recompiling apps to ensure binaries have not been tampered with is essential, it wouldn't change the inability to verify backend servers' metadata and other details. Indian citizens affected by the ban can access other messaging clients and servers. The ban raises concerns about governments' control over IT and internet services and the impact of such regulations on free speech.The Indian government is requiring messaging apps with more than 5 million users to monitor their platforms for \"unlawful information\" and to appoint a \"grievance officer\". In response, some smaller messaging apps have shut down their services in India. The move has raised concerns about privacy, freedom of speech, and government control. BJP, India's ruling party, is accused of authoritarianism and hindering democracy. The government has defended the new rules, saying they are designed to protect national security and prevent criminal activity. Some commenters suggest that the messaging apps affected may have backdoors with access from governments. It is noted that WhatsApp has previously resisted Indian government requests for access to encrypted messages.The Indian government has blocked 14 messenger mobile apps used by terrorists in Pakistan for transmitting information to Jammu & Kashmir. Some of the banned apps include Crypviser, Enigma, and Safeswiss. Element, a popular communication app using Matrix open standard, was also banned, leading the company to issue a statement saying they are \"disappointed\" and that \"decentralization is the key to privacy, security and open communication.\" Critics claim that these bans won't deter terrorists and instead infringe on normal communication and privacy for the public. There is also criticism of Indian politicians and their corruption, internal bickering, and lack of democracy within their parties. India's politics are compared to other countries with similar issues and whether democracy can prevent authoritarianism and extremist ideologies from taking root.The Indian government has banned 13 apps, including the Element app, which gives access to the Matrix network, an open standard for real-time communication. The ban is due to national security concerns. However, Matrix is a federated network, and banning Element for giving access to Matrix is equivalent to blocking Google Chrome for accessing the web. The ban is not illegal for citizens, but the app could be removed from app stores, and ISPs might be directed to block the network. The Indian government has been found hostile to an open and free internet. India has strong laws on books, multi-party politics, well-run elections, and identification with party ideology-building work, which form signs of democratic, functional governance. Nevertheless, India is ranked #46 among \"flawed democracies\" by The Economist 2022 Democracy Index. Modi created a fund called \"PM Cares\" during Covid, collecting thousands of crores of money on the name of providing coronavirus relief, which is considered one of the biggest scams by the Modi government.The Indian government has banned 14 messaging apps, including Signal and Element, citing national security concerns related to a specific terrorist plot. The ban has caused outrage and accusations of censorship, with many questioning the effectiveness of such a move. The ban highlights the importance of encryption and freedom of speech, particularly in countries with authoritarian tendencies. It also highlights the growing popularity of alternative messaging apps, such as Signal and Element, that prioritize user privacy. However, some criticize the ban for its impact on free speech, suggesting that legitimate communication may be impacted. Overall, the ban raises important questions about the balance between national security and individual privacy and freedom of expression.",

The bill's broad potential for censorship and impact on online innovation is also a concern.The EARN IT Act threatens end-to-end encryption, which is relied upon by billions of people worldwide for secure communication, leading to increased risk of harm online. The Act would permit states to seek liability against service providers who offer encryption, and create a Commission to recommend \"best practices\" which could cause reputational harm if not complied with. The Act also risks undermining child abuse prosecutions by transforming providers into agents of the government, and could discourage smaller providers who cannot afford legal risks and compliance costs. Advocates urge Congress to explore more tailored approaches to deal with online harm, and to conduct a full independent internet impact assessment before voting on any related legislation.",

(The Webster's headword list was available online.)This was easy to do, even at the time, when the word list itself, at 2.5 megabytes, was a file of significant size. Perl and its cousins were not yet common; in those days I used Awk. But the task is not very different in any reasonable language: # Process word list while (my $word = <>) {  chomp $word;  my $sorted = join \"\", sort split //, $word; # normal form  push @{$anagrams{$sorted}}, $word; } for my $words (values %anagrams) {   print \"@$words\\n\" if @$words > 1; }The key technique is to reduce each word to a normal form so that two words have the same normal form if and only if they are anagrams of one another. In this case we do this by sorting the letters into alphabetical order, so that both megalodon and moonglade become adeglmnoo.Then we insert the words into a (hash | associative array | dictionary), keyed by their normal forms, and two or more words are anagrams if they fall into the same hash bucket. (There is some discussion of this technique in Higher-Order Perl pages 218\u2013219 and elsewhere.)(The thing you do not want to do is to compute every permutation of the letters of each word, looking for permutations that appear in the word list. That is akin to sorting a list by computing every permutation of the list and looking for the one that is sorted. I wouldn't have mentioned this, but someone on StackExchange actually asked this question.)Anyway, I digress. This article is about how I was unhappy with the results of the simple procedure above. From the Webster's Second list, which contains about 234,000 words, it finds about 14,000 anagram sets (some with more than two words), consisting of 46,351 pairs of anagrams. The list starts withaal alaand ends withzolotink zolotnikwhich exemplify the problems with this simple approach: many of the 46,351 anagrams are obvious, uninteresting or even trivial. There must be good ones in the list, but how to find them?I looked in the list to find the longest anagrams, but they were also disappointing:cholecystoduodenostomy duodenocholecystostomy(Webster's Second contains a large amount of scientific and medical jargon. A cholecystoduodenostomy is a surgical operation to create a channel between the gall bladder (cholecysto-) and the duodenum (duodeno-). A duodenocholecystostomy is the same thing.)This example made clear at least one of the problems with boring anagrams: it's not that they are too short, it's that they are too simple. Cholecystoduodenostomy and duodenocholecystostomy are 22 letters long, but the anagrammatic relation between them is obvious: chop cholecystoduodenostomy into three parts:cholecysto duodeno stomyand rearrange the first two:duodeno cholecysto stomyand there you have it.This gave me the idea to score a pair of anagrams according to how many chunks one had to be cut into in order to rearrange it to make the other one. On this plan, the \u201ccholecystoduodenostomy / duodenocholecystostomy\u201d pair would score 3, just barely above the minimum possible score of 2. Something even a tiny bit more interesting, say \u201cabler / blare\u201d would score higher, in this case 4. Even if this strategy didn't lead me directly to the most interesting anagrams, it would be a big step in the right direction, allowing me to eliminate the least interesting.This rule would judge both \u201caal / ala\u201d and \u201czolotink / zolotnik\u201d as being uninteresting (scores 2 and 4 respectively), which is a good outcome. Note that some other boring-anagram problems can be seen as special cases of this one. For example, short anagrams never need to be cut into many parts: no four-letter anagrams can score higher than 4. The trivial anagramming of a word to itself always scores 1, and nontrivial anagrams always score more than this.So what we need to do is: for each anagram pair, say acrididae (grasshoppers) and cidaridae (sea urchins), find the smallest number of chunks into which we can chop acrididae so that the chunks can be rearranged into cidaridae.One could do this with a clever algorithm, if one were available. There is a clever algorithm, based on finding maximum independent sets in a certain graph. (More about this tomorrow.) I did not find this algorithm at the time; nor did I try. Instead, I used a brute-force search. Or rather, I used a very small amount of cleverness to reduce the search space, and then used brute-force search to search the reduced space.Let's consider a example, scoring the anagram \u201cabscise / scabies\u201d. You do not have to consider every possible permutation of abscise. Rather, there are only two possible mappings from the letters of abscise to the letters of scabies. You know that the C must map to the C, the A must map to the A, and so forth. The only question is whether the first S of abscise maps to the first or to the second S of scabies. The first mapping gives us:and the second gives usbecause the S and the C no longer go to adjoining positions. So the minimum number of chunks is 5, and this anagram pair gets a score of 5.To fully analyze cholecystoduodenostomy by this method required considering 7680 mappings. (120 ways to map the five O's \u00d7 2 ways to map the two C's \u00d7 2 ways to map the two D's, etc.) In the 1990s this took a while, but not prohibitively long, and it worked well enough that I did not bother to try to find a better algorithm. In 2016 it would probably still run quicker than implementing the maximum independent set algorithm. Unfortunately I have lost the code that I wrote then so I can't compare.Assigning scores in this way produced a scored anagram list which began2 aal alaand ended4 zolotink zolotnikand somewhere in the middle was3 cholecystoduodenostomy duodenocholecystostomyall poor scores. But sorted by score, there were treasures at the end, and the clear winner was14 cinematographer megachiropteranI declare this the single best anagram in English. It is 15 letters long, and the only letters that stay together are the E and the R. \u201cCinematographer\u201d is as familiar as a 15-letter word can be, and \u201cmegachiropteran\u201d means a giant bat. GIANT BAT! DEATH FROM ABOVE!!!And there is no serious competition. There was another 14-pointer, but both its words are Webster's Second jargon that nobody knows:14 rotundifoliate titanofluorideThere are no score 13 pairs, and the score 12 pairs are all obscure. So this is the winner, and a deserving winner it is.I think there is something in the list to make everyone happy. If you are the type of person who enjoys anagrams, the list rewards casual browsing. A few examples:7 admirer married7 admires sidearm8 negativism timesaving8 peripatetic precipitate8 scepters respects8 shortened threnodes8 soapstone teaspoons9 earringed grenadier9 excitation intoxicate9 integrals triangles9 ivoriness revisions9 masculine calumnies10 coprophagist topographics10 chuprassie haruspices10 citronella interlocal11 clitoridean directional11 dispensable piebaldness\u201cClitoridean / directional\u201d has been one of my favorites for years. But my favorite of all, although it scores only 6, is6 yttrious touristyI think I might love it just because the word yttrious is so delightful. (What a debt we owe to Ytterby, Sweden!)I also rather like5 notaries senoritawhich shows that even some of the low-scorers can be worth looking at. Clearly my chunk score is not the end of the story, because \u201cnotaries / senorita\u201d should score better than \u201cabets / baste\u201d (which is boring) or \u201cAcephali / Phacelia\u201d (whatever those are), also 5-pointers. The length of the words should be worth something, and the familiarity of the words should be worth even more.Here are the results:38333 anagrams, scoredIn former times there was a restaurant in Philadelphia named \u201cSoupmaster\u201d. My best unassisted anagram discovery was noticing that this is an anagram of \u201cmousetraps\u201d.[ Addendum 20170222: There is a followup article comparing the two algorithms I wrote for computing scores. ][ Addendum 20170222: An earlier version of this article mentioned the putative 11-pointer \u201cendometritria / intermediator\u201d.

    "content": "CORPORATE STUPIDITY \u2014TikTok spied on me. Why?A Financial Times journalist writes about discovering she\u2019d been surveilled by TikTok.CRISTINA CRIDDLE, FINANCIAL TIMES - 5/5/2023, 6:35 AMEnlargeCelina Pereira via Financial Times139WITHOne evening in late December last year, I received a cryptic phone call from a PR director at TikTok, the popular social media app. I\u2019d written extensively about the company for the Financial Times, so we\u2019d spoken before. But it was puzzling to hear from her just before the holidays, especially since I wasn\u2019t working on anything related to the company at the time.The call lasted less than a minute. She wanted me to know, \u201cas a courtesy,\u201d that The New York Times had just published a story I ought to read. Confused by this unusual bespoke news alert, I asked why. But all she said was that it concerned an inquiry at ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, and that I should call her back once I\u2019d read it.The story claimed ByteDance employees accessed two reporters\u2019 data through their TikTok accounts. Personal information, including their physical locations, had been used as part of an attempt to find the writers\u2019 sources, after a series of damaging stories about ByteDance. According to the report, two employees in China and two in the US left the company following an internal investigation. In a staff memo, ByteDance\u2019s chief executive lamented the incident as the \u201cmisconduct of a few individuals.\u201dWhen I phoned the PR director back, she confirmed I was one of the journalists who had been surveilled. I put down my phone and wondered what it meant that a company I reported on had gone to such lengths to restrict my ability to do so. Over the following months, the episode became just one in a long series of scandals and crises that call into question what TikTok really is and whether the company has the world-dominating future that once seemed inevitable.During the Internet era that roughly began with the dominance of Google Search, most of us have implicitly traded access to our data in exchange for often marginal digital conveniences. By the time ByteDance was founded in Beijing in 2012, Google had been reading our emails over our shoulders, Amazon had been watching us shop, and Twitter and Facebook had been mediating our messages to friends and foes for years. Indeed, Zhang Yiming, the millennial software engineer who set up ByteDance, modeled himself and aspects of his new company on Silicon Valley. Zhang, who briefly worked for Microsoft before going out on his own, was once fond of quoting Steve Jobs and Jack Welch.His first hit app, an endlessly scrolling news site called Toutiao (Today\u2019s Headlines), built the foundations for the company\u2019s future growth. Existing platforms such as Facebook and Instagram relied on users manually following friends, celebrities, and companies, whose posts then made up the content they saw on their feeds. Toutiao wasn\u2019t interested in who its users knew, just what they clicked on, which articles they read the whole way through, and which ones they commented on. ByteDance\u2019s underlying technology began generating a profile of what each reader liked and refined that picture every time they opened the app. Within four months of Toutiao\u2019s launch in 2012, it had a million users, and ByteDance had a blueprint for a new kind of non-social social network.In 2016, ByteDance released Douyin, an app for watching short videos in China. It quickly grew to have more than 100 million users and was launched internationally with a new name: TikTok. The app only took off after ByteDance merged it with another Chinese social site, Musical.ly, which it acquired for $1B in 2017. TikTok\u2019s ever-learning algorithm, which collected location and information on the content of videos (as well as biometric data such as faceprints and voice recognition in the US) was combined with Musical.ly\u2019s video editing tools, which allowed users to easily replicate and repost clips.All of it went into a product perfectly suited for a generation raised on smartphones. (Sixty percent of users are between 16 and 24 years old, but many are younger.) TikTok\u2019s content is more minutely tailored than other platforms\u2019, meaning each user can feel like they\u2019re finding their own little corner of the site in the form of their \u201cFor You\u201d page. My 17-year-old sister has BookTok; I get cooking videos, Marie Kondo-style organization tips, and cats. (When I originally set up my TikTok account to test features on the app I did it in the guise of my fluffy black and white cat, named Buffy after the Vampire Slayer. Technically, it was Buffy\u2019s account that TikTok employees accessed on my phone.)Almost overnight, TikTok became one of the fastest growing companies in an industry famous for growing fast. It has been downloaded more than three billion times. In 2021, TikTok had more site visits than Google and more watch minutes in the US than YouTube. Globally, users spend 52 minutes per day on TikTok, almost double the time spent per day on Instagram. That made TikTok China\u2019s first app to break out on a truly global scale.It also made it a target for Beijing\u2019s recent crackdown on Big Tech. In 2018, one of ByteDance\u2019s other apps was accused of promoting immoral content by state media. When it was eventually pulled down, Zhang wrote a public letter of apology, pledging greater censorship of ByteDance content. Along with other prominent tech founders, Zhang stood down as chairman in 2021. (He retains a 20 percent stake in ByteDance, with a separate class of shares that give him additional voting rights and veto powers.)China possesses considerable power over technology companies. It controls export of ByteDance algorithms, including TikTok\u2019s, and can mandate that companies disclose user data to the state. TikTok has said it has never given data to the Chinese government and wouldn\u2019t do so if it was asked.Yet, around the world and particularly in the US, TikTok\u2019s biggest market, there is alarm about the security of this data. \u201cThis is a tool that is ultimately within the control of the Chinese government\u2026 to me, it screams out with national security concerns,\u201d was the assessment of FBI director Christopher Wray earlier this year. In October 2022, Forbes journalist Emily Baker-White reported that a China-based team at ByteDance \u201cplanned to use the TikTok app\u201d to pinpoint the precise locations of \u201cspecific US citizens.\u201d After the story was published, the company posted a tweet that read: \u201cTikTok has never been used to \u2018target\u2019 any members of the US government, activists, public figures or journalists.\u201d As The New York Times made clear a couple of months later, employees at TikTok had already accessed Baker-White\u2019s phone, as well as my own.Page: 1 2 3 Next \u2192READER COMMENTS139WITHChannel Ars Technica\u2190 PREVIOUS STORYNEXT STORY \u2192Related StoriesToday on Ars",

    "hn_content": "An article on Ars Technica discusses how TikTok surveils its users. ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming modeled his company on Silicon Valley, popularizing the app with the integration of machine learning algorithms. The company provides valuable insight into its users' data and interactions, including their most watched videos, frequently used settings, and email contacts. Many comments criticize China's human rights record, opposing Xi Jinping's henchmen spying on them over their own government, as they tend to extrajudicial executions. Some mention that CCP does not limit its wrongdoings to Chinese citizens. One of the discussions critiqued the legitimacy of the US Patriot act, insinuating that the US government engages in similar activities. However, a debate ensued, expressing that although the US isn't as oppressive as the CCP, it still possesses its own issues.The post discusses restrictions on VPN use and the proposed Restrict Act in the US. Some commenters compare the situation in the US to that in China, including issues of racism and mass incarceration in the US. Others discuss the incarceration of Japanese-Americans during WWII and its differences from what is currently happening to the Uighur people in China. There is also a conversation about drug laws, profit in the prison system, and the treatment of Julian Assange. Overall, the discussion revolves around the differences between how the US and China treat their citizens and how various laws impact different groups of people.No meaningful content to summarize.A discussion on the differences between government control in the US and China, particularly in terms of checks and balances and National Security Letters. One user notes that NSLs are an exception, not a rule, and are overseen by Congress. Another highlights the likelihood of misinformation involved in corporate pushback against government control in the US. The conversation meanders through several topics, including incarceration rates of certain populations and whether accusations of hypocrisy undermine regulatory efforts. One user suggests that the current lack of privacy laws is due to their potential impact on both US corporate profitability and national security.Discussions focused on privacy laws, fines, and data collection in response to a journalist's experience using a second phone for TikTok; EU's GDPR legislation and loopholes are mentioned. One commentator suggests journalists should use separate devices for work and personal use, while another recommends using anonymous sources for their reports and keeping a low profile. Despite privacy concerns, some commentators praise TikTok for its unique and delightful content, with comparisons to HN's early days, though others caution against overlooking the app's data collection and state-affiliation.The discussion revolves around the similarities between TikTok and HN, addiction, and the sociopolitical implications of the app. Some users argue that TikTok's association with the CCP makes it untrustworthy, while others defend its entertainment value. The article's journalist installed TikTok on their primary phone, raising questions about appropriate cybersecurity practices. A potential ban of the app in the US is mentioned, although it is speculated that it may be sold to a US company instead. Overall, the discussion highlights the complex issues surrounding TikTok and its relationship with political and economic forces.- ByteDance employees were reportedly using TikTok to track and monitor critics, similar to the eBay stalking scandal.\n- Some individuals are calling for a ban on TikTok due to concerns about Chinese surveillance, while others argue that a ban is unnecessary.\n- A proposed surveillance bill in the US could give intelligence organizations access to TikTok data, but it is unclear how this could affect user privacy.\n- Some commenters suggest that banning all spy apps or limiting apps from certain countries could be a potential solution.",

    "hn_content": "A preprint paper titled 'Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input' has gained attention on Hacker News. The paper proposes the use of k-nearest neighbors to retrieve the top-k most similar tokens, out of an \"unlimited-length input\" to approximate attention. However, comments suggest that this approach is similar to previously-known retrieval transformers and Hopfield networks. Some comments criticize the misleading title, which could create hype around the idea of \"transformer with unlimited context length.\" There is a debate on the value of public forums like HN comments compared to formal peer-review processes. Nonetheless, some HN users suggest other software alternatives to deal with long sequences that explicitly use token-token interactions.Researchers have developed an approach, Unlimiformer, that enables computers to summarize long pieces of text using a technique called k-nearest-neighbor indexing. Unlimiformer can handle an unlimited amount of text, while conventional programs can only handle limited amounts. The technique helps computers to pay attention to the most critical parts of the text, enabling them to summarize even lengthy documents without losing important information. Though marginal, the Unlimiformer benchmark scores could significantly improve natural language processing technology. However, some ML teams may not be aware of the latest innovations in high-data sequence modeling, such as Unlimiformer, leading to missed opportunities. Finally, evaluating preprint publications like Unlimiformer's relies on outsourced critiques.A new preprocessor and post-processor method can help existing GPT models handle unlimited tokens. The attention mechanism may not scale well as it doesn't handle state in a way that scales well, and RNN/LSTM state handling may be revisited to advance past transformers. Transformers have a limit input size due to scaling problems and the baked-in attention mechanism, resulting in higher training costs. Theoretical ideas like Hopf algebraic convolution could be useful in improving attention mechanisms' efficiency. There are questions around the model performance and boundary limits with the method currently proposed. The length of inputs is theoretically bounded by the memory limitations of the computer used, although a CPU datastore is much slower than a GPU datastore.",
