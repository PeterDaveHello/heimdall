It is just amazing that society rewards such a lack of integrity.replyfiloleg 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Any celebrity should familiarise themselves with the companies and products they endorse.There is a difference between endorsing a product and acting in an ad for a product. The latter is an acted out sketch.To be ultra-pedantic, one can same the same (just in a different way) for paid endorsements. But I hope the factual difference between the two is obvious enough to not need further explanation.replygmt2027 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I do not believe the line is so clear cut for a recognisable face. Brands seek out these celebrities and pay a premium for the aura. The endorsement is implicit.Consider that the relationship works both ways, the celebrity's own brand is tarnished by involvement with a product hit by scandal. See the celebrities that promoted FTX as an example. It is in their own interest to do some due diligence.Conversely, the ads would be dropped if the celebrity actor became toxic. If Kelly Rowland made Kanye-style comments about Nazis or Jews, the ad would be buried. Are Kevin Spacey ads still airing?The entire celebrity/influencer marketing system intentionally exploits a failure mode of human cognitive bias for profit. Transactional endorsements are morally bankrupt. A family member or friend that blindly recommended a product or service for pay would lose respect for that breach of trust. Celebrities that people respect should be held to the same or higher standards.Consider this, if John Carmack regularly did ads playing a generic software engineer at BigCo and it turned out he didn't even know what the products were, would this community hold him in the same high regard?replyflohofwoe 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Ads uncovered as exploitation scheme, news at 11 !!Or as the old capitalist saying goes: We know they are telling us bullshit, they know they are telling us bullshit, they know we know they are telling us bullshit, we know they know we know they are telling us bullshit, but we are still buying their product ;)replyruined 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]why aren't you in commercialsreplyarp242 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]In that interview she is definitely \"proud\" not knowing what Excel is.

But having data about the network was a new thing.)(Oh yeah, someone complained that the author of rrdtool's name appeared on all the charts, so I patched it to not do that. Sorry.

    "content": "DISPLAYPORT: A BETTER VIDEO INTERFACE46 Commentsby: Arya VoronovaJuly 11, 2023Over the years, we\u2019ve seen a good number of interfaces used for computer monitors, TVs, LCD panels and other all-things-display purposes. We\u2019ve lived through VGA and the large variety of analog interfaces that preceded it, then DVI, HDMI, and at some point, we\u2019ve started getting devices with DisplayPort support. So you might think it\u2019s more of the same. However, I\u2019d like to tell you that you probably should pay more attention to DisplayPort \u2013 it\u2019s an interface powerful in a way that we haven\u2019t seen before.By [Belkin+Abisys], CC BY-SA 3.0The DisplayPort (shortened as DP) interface was explicitly designed to be a successor to VGA and DVI, originating from the VESA group \u2013 an organization created by multiple computer-display-related players in technology space, which has previously brought us a number of smaller-scale computer display standards like EDID, DDC and the well-known VESA mount. Nevertheless, despite the smaller scale of previous standards, DisplayPort has since become a hit in computer display space for a number of reasons, and is more ubiquitous than you might realize.You could put it this way: DisplayPort has all the capabilities of interfaces like HDMI, but implemented in a better way, without legacy cruft, and with a number of features that take advantage of the DisplayPort\u2019s sturdier architecture. As a result of this, DisplayPort isn\u2019t just in external monitors, but also laptop internal displays, USB-C port display support, docking stations, and Thunderbolt of all flavors. If you own a display-capable docking station for your laptop, be it classic style multi-pin dock or USB-C, DisplayPort is highly likely to be involved, and even your smartphone might just support DisplayPort over USB-C these days.VIDEO DONE RIGHTJust like most digital interfaces nowadays, DisplayPort sends its data in packets. This might sound like a reasonable expectation, but none of the other popular video-carrying interfaces use packets in a traditional sense. VGA, DVI, HDMI and laptop panel LVDS all work with a a stream of pixels at a certain clock rate. HDMI is way more similar to VGA than it is to DP. With DisplayPort, the video is treated like any regular packetized data stream, making the interface all that much more flexible! Physically, desktop/laptop DisplayPort outputs come in two flavors: full-size DisplayPort, known for its latches that keep the cable in no matter what, and miniDisplayPort, which one would often encounter on MacBooks, ThinkPads, and port-space-constrained GPUs.By [Jena Selle], CC BY-SA 2.0There are a number of cool features of DisplayPort that set it apart from all the other modern display interfaces. On the low level in particular, DisplayPort is way more flexible. For a start, unlike HDMI and VGA, DP doesn\u2019t need a separate clock diffpair or wire. The full version of DisplayPort needs five diffpairs: four for the four lanes of the main link, and one for AUX link.However, if you don\u2019t need the full bandwidth that four lanes can give you, a DP link can consist of only one or two main lanes resulting in two and three diffpairs respectively, with less bandwidth but also less wiring. This is perfect for laptop and embedded applications, where DisplayPort has taken hold, and certainly beats HDMI\u2019s \u201cfour diffpairs at all costs\u201d requirement. The advantages don\u2019t end here, but I\u2019d like to note that DisplayPort is also way more hackable \u2013 of course, I\u2019ll show you!For more advantages, the DisplayPort sideband channel, AUX, is a great improvement over I2C, which we\u2019ve been using as a sideband interface for VGA and HDMI. It\u2019s a lower-speed bidirectional single-diffpair link that doesn\u2019t just bring backwards compatibility with EDID (display identification) and DDC (display control), but is also used for DisplayPort link training communications, as well as gives developers control over a number of low-level aspects from the DP transmitter side. Audio travels over AUX too, and it\u2019s future-proof. For instance, features like CEC can be implemented over the AUX layer, instead of the single-wire kludge that is HDMI CEC.All of these aspects have resulted in an interface that\u2019s pretty friendly for modern-day tech. Thunderbolt has coexisted with DisplayPort in particular \u2014 TB1 and TB2 have been using miniDisplayPort connectors that you might\u2019ve encountered on Apple laptops, bearing the lightning bolt symbol. When it comes to TB3 and TB4, those coexist with DisplayPort on USB-C connectors, and DisplayPort is a first-class guest in the Thunderbolt ecosystem, with DisplayPort tunneling being an omnipresent feature in Thunderbolt peripherals.By [Heavysilence], CC0 1.0 Public DomainAlso, packetized transfers gave DisplayPort an ability to embed multiple video streams within a single link, a feature called Multi-Stream Transport (MST). Often, your GPU might have four video ports in total, but the GPU chip itself will support a larger number of displays \u2014 and if it supports MST, you can buy an MST hub and make use of those extra display outputs. Some DisplayPort monitors have an MST-enabled chip inside and have a DisplayPort output socket, which lets you chain monitors. If you\u2019re running MacOS, however, watch out \u2014 MacOS doesn\u2019t support MST, neither on DisplayPort outputs nor through Thunderbolt, which incapacitates extra display outputs of docking stations, for instance. This is ironic, since it makes Apple\u2019s expensive fancy laptops not fully support expensive fancy docking stations.EMBRACE, EXTEND, EMBEDDisplayPort isn\u2019t just for consumer-use monitors, however \u2014 remember the flexibility about number of lanes? This alone is a big win for DisplayPort when it comes to internal connectivity, and, considering the sheer number of features already making it embedding-friendly and low-power, the embedded DisplayPort standard (eDP) was developed, compatible with DP in almost every aspect. If you have a laptop or an iPad, it\u2019s highly likely to be using eDP under the hood \u2013 in fact, the first time we mentioned eDP over on Hackaday, was when someone reused high-res iPad displays by making a passthrough breakout board with a desktop eDP socket. Yes, with DisplayPort, it\u2019s this easy to reuse laptop and tablet displays \u2013 no converter chips, no bulky adapters, at most you will need a backlight driver.eDP came in handy right as we started pushing against the limits of FPD-Link, which you might have heard called LVDS in the laptop panel space. Ever since mid-2010s, you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find any newly designed laptop that still has an LVDS panel, and nowadays it\u2019s all eDP. The advantage is noticeable \u2013 what LVDS needs six or eight diffpairs for, eDP can do with two or three, letting designers use cheaper wiring and freeing up PCB space, and enabling extremely high resolution displays with just four pairs. Unlike classic LVDS implementation laptops which aren\u2019t required to use I2C for EDID purposes, the AUX channel provides EDID for free \u2013 which also might mean that your laptop might just work if you are to plug in a display with a higher or lower than factory resolution; something that isn\u2019t a guarantee with LVDS.Oh, and all this flexibility didn\u2019t just help with laptop displays \u2013 it also made DisplayPort a perfect match for the video backbone of USB-C, to the point where, if you see a USB-C dock with any kind of video output connector, you can basically be sure that the video output capability is powered by DisplayPort. We will talk more later about the DisplayPort altmode in way more depth in the next weeks. Until then, I\u2019ll note that all those strengths of DisplayPort, undoubtedly, contributed to the HDMI altmode dying out \u2013 especially the ability to run an extra USB3 link alongside DisplayPort through the same USB-C cable. I\u2019d like to assure you, however, that the HDMI altmode dying out is a win for us all.PLUS, IT\u2019S NOT HDMIAnother large advantage of DisplayPort is that it\u2019s not HDMI. We\u2019ve all gotten used to HDMI, but if you\u2019ve been lurking in related tech discussions, you\u2019ll know that HDMI has got a few nasty aspects to it. The reason is fundamental \u2013 HDMI is backed by media interests vested in things like home theater and TV, as opposed to the personal computing field where the VESA group comes from. The HDMI group claims to value interoperability when, say, protesting against the sale of certain products, but the recent HDMI 2.1 debacle has shown us that it isn\u2019t truly a focus of theirs. My observation so far has been that the HDMI group is averse to competition, marketing and branding considerations are significant driving forces in their decisionmaking, and so is extracting per-device royalties from manufacturers \u2013 steep for players small and large alike. Bringing a good product appears to be secondary.Neither DP nor HDMI standards are openly available \u2014 however, HDMI is restricted way more NDA-wise, to the point where AMD is unable to implement features like FreeSync and higher resolutions in their open-source Linux drivers specifically in HDMI; DisplayPort isn\u2019t burdened to such an extent. When it comes to devices we buy, especially from a hacker viewpoint, certain HDMI certification requirements may bring us worse products when they\u2019re included. A carefully shaped money-backed lever over the market is absolutely part of reason you never see DisplayPort inputs on consumer TVs, where HDMI group reigns supreme, even if the TV might use DisplayPort internally for the display panel connection.By [Pittigrilli], CC BY-SA 4.0Oh, and given all these, it should be no surprise to read that HDMI isn\u2019t hacker-friendly either \u2014 the HDMI group is known to strongarm chip manufacturers into requiring HDMI IC and devboard buyers to cough up the HDMI adopter fee first \u2013 if you\u2019re not in the club, you don\u2019t even get to play with a devboard.Sure, the Raspberry Pi CM4 might have two HDMI links exposed, but if you aren\u2019t careful while marketing your board or the product it goes in, you\u2019re in legal limbo at best \u2014 DisplayPort has no such issue. That cool $10 open-source HDMI capture card we covered a few months ago? If you want to manufacture and sell them, you better talk to a competent lawyer first, and lawyers savvy in HDMI licensing issues aren\u2019t quite commonplace \u2013 putting this idea out of reach for a hobbyist who just wants to order a few open-source boards and sell them to others.If you see a DisplayPort interface on your board where you\u2019d usually expect HDMI, that might just be because the company decided to avoid HDMI\u2019s per-device royalties, and do firmly believe that this is a good thing. Consider this \u2013 if your monitor has HDMI, but your GPU or laptop has DisplayPort, you\u2019re way better off than you might expect, for a very interesting reason.THE SHAPESHIFTING INTERFACEWhen it comes to DisplayPort connectors on our GPUs and laptops, there\u2019s an even cooler thing you can do \u2013 switch it into HDMI compatibility mode, a feature called DP++. All you need is a dongle that has a logic level shifter inside so that the signals are re-shaped as needed, presents those signals on a HDMI connector, and shorts two pins on the DisplayPort connector, signaling the GPU to do a mode switch. Oh, and if you\u2019re wondering how AUX could be compatible with I2C in case of DP++ \u2013 the GPU puts an I2C bus on the AUX pins instead. We buy these dongles as DisplayPort to HDMI converters, but in reality, the dongle doesn\u2019t do much on its own, mostly telling the GPU to start outputting HDMI \u2013 it\u2019s cheap, efficient and has low power consumption as a side effect.By [PantheraLeo1359531], CC BY 4.0As a result, you can get a desktop/laptop DisplayPort to HDMI adapter for $3, and the reason for that is that it likely costs 50 cents to manufacture. HDMI can\u2019t do that \u2013 HDMI to DP port converts must be active, they\u2019re less ubiquitous, and more expensive as a result. On the other hand, if you ever need active DP to HDMI conversion specifically for whatever reason, it can be tricky to find it among the sea of passive adapters- though, still not impossible, as DisplayPort to HDMI active conversion chips are actively being made for embedded use and therefore more available. All in all, if you have a DisplayPort output, you can easily get to HDMI; HDMI to DisplayPort isn\u2019t as rosy.As you might see now, DisplayPort is a friendly interface, perhaps way friendlier than you might have expected! Since its introduction, Intel and AMD have made big bets on DisplayPort \u2013 and now, it\u2019s basically a staple of portable devices, even if you don\u2019t see a DisplayPort connector on the outside. Not even talking about eDP or the DP altmode \u2013 nowadays, even for a typical HDMI connector on your modern-day laptop, the backbone is DP, or a lower-level interface like Intel and AMD\u2019s DDI interfaces tailored towards producing DP first and foremost, with HDMI being a bit of a second-class citizen. After all, DisplayPort has enough advantages to deserve such first-class treatment.Now, these are mostly consumer-facing benefits of DisplayPort, but I hope that they can give you insights on what makes modern DisplayPort tick. Next time, I\u2019d like to show you all the new things that a hacker can get out of DisplayPort \u2013 more in-depth about eDP aka embedded DisplayPort, a bit of insight into the AUX channel, designing our own PCBs with DisplayPort links, and some of the intricacies of cabling.Posted in Featured, hardware, Interest, Original ArtTagged computer, display, display port, hdmi, monitor, standards, video",

    "content": "Linux enthusiasts rejoice! After a long journey, according to StatCounter\u2019s data, by June 2023, Linux has achieved a 3% desktop market share.Linux has a long history that dates back more than 30 years. However, it has never been as popular among regular computer users as other operating systems such as Microsft\u2019s Windows or Apple\u2019s macOS.Of course, for many years, Linux has emerged as a dominant force in the realm of server operating systems. Due to its exceptional performance, stability, reliability, and security, it has been widely adopted in server/cloud/IoT environments.However, these days, Linux is no longer limited to these environments alone; it is rapidly gaining momentum as an operating system of choice for many desktop users, especially developers.And the most recent figures confirm this, giving all advocates of Linux and open source in general reason to rejoice.Linux Operating System Achieved a 3% Desktop Market ShareAccording to StatCounter, a web analytics company, by June 2023, Linux has reached a 3% market share in the desktop segment. This is a remarkable achievement considering its fierce competition from other operating systems.Desktop Operating System Market Share WorldwideWhile someone may seem the figure modest, it signifies a growing acceptance and recognition of the power and versatility of Linux.In any case, the achievement of a 3% market share by Linux is undoubtedly a cause for celebration among its dedicated community. It reflects the growing recognition of Linux\u2019s strengths and the efforts to overcome its historical barriers.Moreover, with the continued development and innovation within the Linux ecosystem, its market share will continue growing in the coming years.The growing importance of cloud computing and the rise of server infrastructure have also contributed to Linux\u2019s success. Still, the main reason for reaching this figure is the operating system\u2019s growing popularity among desktop users.With exceptionally easy-to-use and entirely user-centric Linux desktop distributions, the operating system is no longer what it was 20 years ago \u2013 a complex equation available only to highly technically enlightened hackers.Linux Growing Popularity among Desktop UsersLinux with GNOME Desktop.Yes, I know. Over the last 10+ years, each one has often been heralded as \u201cLinux on the Desktop,\u201d although it turns out that\u2019s not quite the case. But still, we\u2019re close to that point now. And for good reasons.Free, Lightweight & CustomizableThe main appealing aspect of Linux for desktop users is its lightweight nature, free from corporate bloatware, and especially the limitless customization options.It allows users to tailor their desktop environment to suit their preferences and workflow. With a vast selection of desktop environments like GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and many others, users can choose the one that best aligns with their needs.Valuing User PrivacyAnother important factor driving Linux\u2019s growing popularity among desktop users is privacy. Compared to other mainstream operating systems, Linux generally collects no user data.While some distributions may try to collect basic telemetry data for improvement purposes, the level of data collection is typically minimal and can be disabled or opted out of entirely. This aspect appeals to privacy-conscious individuals who prefer more control over their personal information.Linux is a Developer\u2019s Dream Come TrueLinux has long been the operating system of choice for developers worldwide, and its allure continues to grow.First and foremost, Linux\u2019s open-source nature empowers developers with unparalleled freedom.

This is because Google submitted to a DMCA takedown notice from a French record label, \u201cBecause Music\u201d. The notice demands removing our homepage newpipe.net from their search listings along with a set of other domains completely unrelated to our project. The DMCA takedown notice was published in the Lumen database by Google themselves.While worse things could have happened as the result of such a takedown request, Google\u2019s unlisting of our homepage creates a variety of problems. Given the fact that Google no longer counts visits to our site, it will lose relevance. As a result, websites for fake clones of NewPipe that mimic our homepage will tend to rank higher in the results. This could ultimately cause users to fall for such scams.The team is currently discussing what to do about the situation. We are considering taking legal action. If you are a lawyer and have experience with this and would like to help us, please contact us via email (team(at)newpipe.net).Regards, SchabiSee also: pinned announcement",

Is there even a rudimentary secret, that never gets served to clients typically but that apps like Newpipe figured out?Unofficial cable TV descramblers are illegal despite simply reconstructing the missing sync signal, but that's because they facilitate theft of services that are normally paid.

It's completely unworkable, as has been known since before it was passed.Suppose Bob is in the business of duplicating public domain US government works. He downloads videos from the NASA website, presses them onto DVDs and sells them on eBay. He can do this without anybody's permission because DVDs are from the mid-90s and the patents are expired. He uses the same DVD format as Hollywood so people can watch them on their existing DVD players, but he also makes a free DVD player app for Linux so people can watch his DVDs or rip them or do whatever they want because they're in the public domain. It can also do the same with any other DVDs, because it's the exact same format. Is Bob breaking the law?Now suppose Bob is a jerk who is doing this with public domain works without providing anyone a way to exercise their right to copy them, or doing it to enforce contractually unlawful license terms or something like that. Is someone who makes a tool to thwart Bob breaking the law? If so the law could have (more) First Amendment problems, to say nothing of the obvious unreasonableness. But if not then it's a worthless law because anyone could use that as a justification to break anything. Which it is regardless because it has never been effective at suppressing the availability circumvention tools, only at should-be-impermissible abuses like prohibiting interoperability to prop up existing monopolies.It's also notable that NASA publishes many videos on YouTube. As in, only on YouTube.replykmeisthax 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]DVD supports both encrypted and unencrypted video, so Bob is only breaking the law if he's releasing a decryption tool. The entire DeCSS case hinged on video decryption specifically, everything else was already implemented by other parties.Now, if Bob decides to encrypt those DVDs, then you have an interesting legal area where half the law applies and the other half doesn't. DMCA 1201 only applies to things that protect copyrighted works[0], not just any kind of access control measure. And it comes in two parts: one that makes it illegal to break encryption, and another that makes it illegal to provide tools to break encryption. So if you put uncopyrightables behind DVD CSS's encryption algorithm, you can't sue someone for decrypting that particular DVD. But if you distribute a DVD decryption tool, then you're harming the protection of copyrighted DVDs, so you can't distribute a decryption tool even though some jackass might try to functionally recopyright public domain material with DVD CSS.More interesting than the NASA case would be Kevin MacLeod. He releases Creative Commons music under a CC-BY license, and that license has a clause specifically prohibiting the distribution of Creative commons material with DRM on it. A lot of YouTubers use his music, probably didn't know about this clause, and definitely didn't know that the music industry would rugpull everyone by claiming that dynamic download URLs are a DMCA 1201 technical protection. So if these music industry cases succeed, it also means that a lot of YouTubers are open to some copyleft trolling on Kevin's part. I doubt he'd actually do that, but it's still shitty that this is possible.[0] See Chamberlain Group v.

They have a server that speaks ordinary HTTPS and has a standard HTML page that serves content to anyone, but their proprietary client will filter the page on the client side and only show content after a user signs in and buys a license. The content is encrypted with ordinary TLS. If you visit the page using a standard browser instead of the vendor's proprietary client, it doesn't know anything about the filtering system but does implement the \"encryption\" (i.e. TLS/HTTPS) so it will \"bypass\" the DRM. Are web browsers now illegal?Suppose someone implements a DRM system that works like this. The content comes unencrypted on a hard drive inside a computer that asks for a login. The computer is screwed shut with pentalobe screws. Are pentalobe screwdrivers now illegal? What if they sealed the computer with phillips screws?Suppose I got saddled with a contract with someone saying I would encrypt their content, but I'm lazy so instead of designing a DRM system I just copy the on-disk format of Bitlocker and use a key of all zeros for everything. Anyone with a copy of Windows can decrypt all the content. Do I get to sue Microsoft?Suppose a ransomware organization uses the same DRM system as a copyright holder.

It comes up all the time when RIAA in particular sues YouTube stream-rippers.https://torrentfreak.com/deciphering-youtubes-rolling-cypher...replyhunter2_ 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Very interesting. I feel like any type of digital storage or transmission format (PCM audio formats like CD Audio, packet switched networks like Internet Protocol, etc.) could also be described thusly, given that a typical human can't readily consume it. We use a tool that parses it using some algorithm, not a tool that avoids/breaks the algorithm. The error correction of a CD or the sequence number of a packet surely rolls way more rapidly than those DASH slices, too. Are those more common formats also considered effective access controls, since humans have severe difficulty interacting with them without the help of a tool?Granted, I suppose the difference there is that the creators of those formats/protocols did publish the spec, whereas YouTube didn't. Or did they, though? The JavaScript that YouTube serves is the instruction for parsing the DASH response, available publicly, hardly different from publications like IEC 60908 (\"Red Book\" CD-DA spec) or an RFC 791 (IP spec) -- a different language, is all.What a mess.replyMindwipe 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The difference is also intent.YouTube implemented the rolling cypher to satisfy music industry demands that the files were not permanently downloadable (and it appears they were able to provide abundant evidence that Google has communicated that to them in court, I don't think this is a controversial point).That wasn't the point of the red book spec.Intent matters significantly, legally.replyhunter2_ 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Off-topic: happy 10k, 1k!replybragr 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]>What aspect of the YouTube servers' behavior can be construed as an effective access control?

I haven't grasped fully how that works for Youtube but it is certainly more than 'increment a counter'. I believe it is something like 'read a variable in the previous packet and decode it'.If they wanted any semblance of an argument, decoding that variable should require a session key that is set on log-in or after a captcha.

Advertising has corrupted every public medium since the dawn of print media, arguably even before that.In the 19th century, it was quackery and false advertising in newspapers, making snake oil salesmen rich.In the first half of the 20th century, advertising started using propaganda tactics to psychologically manipulate consumers, as pioneered by Edward Bernays[1], making tobacco companies rich.Radio and television amplified their reach and power, fueling modern consumerism. People were hooked on tobacco, corn products, sugar, fast food, and a million other mass produced products. Whether the products were harmful to society was irrelevant. The spice must flow.The internet was another major frontier, where ads could precisely target specific consumer profiles. Adtech was born to give this power to advertisers by facilitating data collection and creating the multi-billion dollar dark data broker market.Adtech was then (ab?)used by local and foreign agents to spread propaganda, disinformation, and conduct psyops at an unprecedented scale, disrupting democratic processes, toppling governments, causing social unrest, and boosting intolerance, xenophobia and racism on a global scale to levels unseen since WWII.And we haven't seen the worst of it yet. Once everyone has their own personal AI that is trained on the most intimate details of each personality, ads will become even more personal and manipulative. Advertisers are salivating at this opportunity, and adtech is surely experimenting with this right now.So, no, I refuse to participate in this perverse system, and subject myself to being psychologically manipulated. Companies and creators who depend on advertising don't deserve my business, attention or respect.[1] This man was evil beyond words.

    "content": "By Invitation | PrivatisationMathew Lawrence on why privatisation has been a costly failure in BritainThe energy transition further strengthens the argument for state ownership, says the think-tank headimage: dan williamsJul 10th 2023ShareThe british economy has been subject to a giant experiment: privatisation on a scale more extensive than in almost any other oecd country. Perhaps most strikingly, following the lead of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s Chile, in 1989 the Conservative government privatised the water industry in England and Wales. This outlier status remains to this day: the majority of water infrastructure in other countries is held and managed by the public. To see the disastrous effects of this experiment, one need only look at England\u2019s crisis-ridden water companies\u2014or brave a swim in an English river flooded with sewage.Emblematic of these failures is Thames Water, England\u2019s largest water company. Having accumulated debts of \u00a314bn ($18bn), in part the legacy of a leveraged buy-out by Macquarie, an Australian investment group, it is now precariously exposed to higher interest rates. But the problem extends beyond one company.Already have an account?

    "hn_content": "- Privatization of public services in Britain has been a costly failure, according to the Economist and commenters on Hacker News.\n- Privatization does not lead to efficient operations for essential public commodities that rely on a shared network infrastructure.\n- Critics argue that privatized entities are solely focused on extracting profits from the public, rather than providing the best service.\n- The issue is the tension between generating returns for investors and providing high-quality, affordable infrastructure to the public.\n- Some point out that utilities, such as electricity and water, have high profit margins, indicating that extracting profits is a priority.\n- Privatized companies have been accused of borrowing large sums of money while distributing funds to shareholders, leading to higher rates and inadequate infrastructure investments.\n- Critics argue that low interest rates have incentivized companies to acquire appreciating assets through debt and prioritize shareholder returns over long-term investments.\n- The UK water industry is often cited as an example of the failure of privatization, with rising prices, declining investments, and environmental issues.\n- The privatization of public services has sparked a debate about the role of profit in delivering essential services and the trade-offs between private ownership and public control.- The discussion revolves around the privatization of public services, such as transportation and utilities.\n- Multiple comments criticize the inefficiencies and negative consequences of privatization, including higher costs, degraded services, and lack of competition.\n- Privatization of certain industries, such as telecommunications, is cited as a successful example due to competition and equitable access to infrastructure.\n- Arguments are made for the necessity of government regulation and intervention in specific sectors to ensure fair pricing and quality service.\n- The impact of privatization on consumer satisfaction and public interest is questioned, with examples of poor service and inadequate infrastructure investment.\n- The need for a balanced approach to combining private and public involvement in critical sectors is highlighted.\n- The importance of considering the specific characteristics and demands of industries when determining the appropriateness of privatization is emphasized.- Free markets are considered the most effective way to facilitate technological progress and economic growth, but they may not be suitable for all industries, such as train networks.\n- Train networks in the UK are not seen as the ideal place for free markets to thrive.\n- Natural monopolies, like train networks, may require regulation due to the lack of competition.\n- Lobbying in regulated markets can undermine the principles of a free market.\n- Enterprise owners may prefer monopolies because they generate higher profits.\n- Examples of countervailing forces to monopoly power include military action in drug wars.\n- Market competition, not free markets, should be the goal to benefit society.\n- Privatization doesn't necessarily lead to free markets and can result in the socialization of losses and the privatization of profits.\n- Public utilities, like water and electricity, can be managed by publicly elected boards for better oversight.\n- Public services like transportation and healthcare have goals beyond maximizing profits and can be incompatible with free markets.\n- Publicly distributed goods and services, especially necessities, should be carefully regulated to maximize societal well-being.\n- Price hikes in water resources may lead to less waste, but they may not address leaks or infrastructure failures.\n- Privatization efforts should differentiate between infrastructure and service providers, allowing for public ownership of the former and private competition among the latter.\n- The state should restructure and run service companies until they become profitable, with the eventual goal of widespread employee and local government ownership.\n- Free markets require strong and socially conscious regulation to ensure fair competition and benefit society.\n- Regulation is often a fig leaf that allows businesses to exert power and evade taxes.\n- Free markets can work well for non-essential services like cosmetic surgery and vision correction.\n- Free markets fail to provide affordable healthcare because of inelastic demand and the lack of consumer choice.\n- Private capital predominates in capitalism and influences laws and the commons.\n- State-run companies can provide market discipline on private actors in utilities markets.\n- The phrase \"free market\" can be misleading as it implies anarchy when what is needed are regulations to prevent market failures.\n- A market-based alternative would require the separation of infrastructure and services and the auctioning of service contracts to private companies with government oversight.\n- The cult of the free market has led to the export of Ireland's food during the Great Famine and has grown in influence over time.\n- The form and culture of government, including professional politicians and mass-scale elections, contribute to corruption in the system.\n- Regulation and oversight are necessary to prevent private companies from extracting profits at the expense of quality and service improvement.\n- The free market does not work well for essential services like healthcare and transportation.",

    "content": "ProductAnnouncementsClaude 2Jul 11, 2023\u25cf4 min readWe are pleased to announce Claude 2, our new model. Claude 2 has improved performance, longer responses, and can be accessed via API as well as a new public-facing beta website, claude.ai. We have heard from our users that Claude is easy to converse with, clearly explains its thinking, is less likely to produce harmful outputs, and has a longer memory. We have made improvements from our previous models on coding, math, and reasoning. For example, our latest model scored 76.5% on the multiple choice section of the Bar exam, up from 73.0% with Claude 1.3. When compared to college students applying to graduate school, Claude 2 scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly to the median applicant on quantitative reasoning.Think of Claude as a friendly, enthusiastic colleague or personal assistant who can be instructed in natural language to help you with many tasks. The Claude 2 API for businesses is being offered for the same price as Claude 1.3. Additionally, anyone in the US and UK can start using our beta chat experience today.As we work to improve both the performance and safety of our models, we have increased the length of Claude\u2019s input and output. Users can input up to 100K tokens in each prompt, which means that Claude can work over hundreds of pages of technical documentation or even a book. Claude can now also write longer documents - from memos to letters to stories up to a few thousand tokens - all in one go.In addition, our latest model has greatly improved coding skills. Claude 2 scored a 71.2% up from 56.0% on the Codex HumanEval, a Python coding test. On GSM8k, a large set of grade-school math problems, Claude 2 scored 88.0% up from 85.2%. We have an exciting roadmap of capability improvements planned for Claude 2 and will be slowly and iteratively deploying them in the coming months.We've been iterating to improve the underlying safety of Claude 2, so that it is more harmless and harder to prompt to produce offensive or dangerous output. We have an internal red-teaming evaluation that scores our models on a large representative set of harmful prompts, using an automated test while we also regularly check the results manually. In this evaluation, Claude 2 was 2x better at giving harmless responses compared to Claude 1.3. Although no model is immune from jailbreaks, we\u2019ve used a variety of safety techniques (which you can read about here and here), as well as extensive red-teaming, to improve its outputs.Claude 2 powers our chat experience, and is generally available in the US and UK. We are working to make Claude more globally available in the coming months. You can now create an account and start talking to Claude in natural language, asking it for help with any tasks that you like. Talking to an AI assistant can take some trial and error, so read up on our tips to get the most out of Claude.We are also currently working with thousands of businesses who are using the Claude API. One of our partners is Jasper, a generative AI platform that enables individuals and teams to scale their content strategies. They found that Claude 2 was able to go head to head with other state of the art models for a wide variety of use cases, but has particular strength for long form low latency uses. \"We are really happy to be among the first to offer Claude 2 to our customers, bringing enhanced semantics, up-to-date knowledge training, improved reasoning for complex prompts, and the ability to effortlessly remix existing content with a 3X larger context window,\" said Greg Larson, VP of Engineering at Jasper. \"We are proud to help our customers stay ahead of the curve through partnerships like this one with Anthropic.\"Sourcegraph is a code AI platform that helps customers write, fix, and maintain code. Their coding assistant Cody uses Claude 2\u2019s improved reasoning ability to give even more accurate answers to user queries while also passing along more codebase context with up to 100K context windows. In addition, Claude 2 was trained on more recent data, meaning it has knowledge of newer frameworks and libraries for Cody to pull from. \u201cWhen it comes to AI coding, devs need fast and reliable access to context about their unique codebase and a powerful LLM with a large context window and strong general reasoning capabilities,\u201d says Quinn Slack, CEO & Co-founder of Sourcegraph. \u201cThe slowest and most frustrating parts of the dev workflow are becoming faster and more enjoyable. Thanks to Claude 2, Cody\u2019s helping more devs build more software that pushes the world forward.\u201dWe welcome your feedback as we work to responsibly deploy our products more broadly. Our chat experience is an open beta launch, and users should be aware that Claude \u2013 like all current models \u2013 can generate inappropriate responses. AI assistants are most useful in everyday situations, like serving to summarize or organize information, and should not be used where physical or mental health and well-being are involved. Please let us know if you\u2019d like to talk to Claude in a currently unsupported area, or if you are a business who would like to start working with Claude.Related",

    "content": "gpt-prompt-engineerOverviewPrompt engineering is kind of like alchemy. There's no clear way to predict what will work best. It's all about experimenting until you find the right prompt. gpt-prompt-engineer is a tool that takes this experimentation to a whole new level.Simply input a description of your task and some test cases, and the system will generate, test, and rank a multitude of prompts to find the ones that perform the best.FeaturesPrompt Generation: Using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, gpt-prompt-engineer can generate a variety of possible prompts based on a provided use-case and test cases.Prompt Testing: The real magic happens after the generation. The system tests each prompt against all the test cases, comparing their performance and ranking them using an ELO rating system.ELO Rating System: Each prompt starts with an ELO rating of 1200. As they compete against each other in generating responses to the test cases, their ELO ratings change based on their performance. This way, you can easily see which prompts are the most effective.Classification Version: The gpt-prompt-engineer -- Classification Version notebook is designed to handle classification tasks. It evaluates the correctness of a test case by matching it to the expected output ('true' or 'false') and provides a table with scores for each prompt.Weights & Biases Logging: Optional logging to Weights & Biases of your configs such as temperature and max tokens, the system and user prompts for each part, the test cases used and the final ranked ELO rating for each candidate prompt. Set use_wandb to True to use.SetupOpen the notebook in Google Colab or in a local Jupyter notebook. For classification, use this one.Add your OpenAI API key to the line openai.api_key = \"ADD YOUR KEY HERE\".If you have GPT-4 access, you're ready to move on. If not, change CANDIDATE_MODEL='gpt-4' to CANDIDATE_MODEL='gpt-3.5-turbo'. If you're using the classification version, and don't have GPT-4 access, change model='gpt-4' in the second cell to `model='gpt-3.5-turbo'.How to UseDefine your use-case and test cases. The use-case is a description of what you want the AI to do. Test cases are specific prompts that you would like the AI to respond to. For example:description = \"Given a prompt, generate a landing page headline.\" # this style of description tends to work welltest_cases = [  {    'prompt': 'Promoting an innovative new fitness app, Smartly',  },  {    'prompt': 'Why a vegan diet is beneficial for your health',  },  {    'prompt': 'Introducing a new online course on digital marketing',  },  {    'prompt': 'Launching a new line of eco-friendly clothing',  },  {    'prompt': 'Promoting a new travel blog focusing on budget travel',  },  {    'prompt': 'Advertising a new software for efficient project management',  },  {    'prompt': 'Introducing a new book on mastering Python programming',  },  {    'prompt': 'Promoting a new online platform for learning languages',  },  {    'prompt': 'Advertising a new service for personalized meal plans',  },  {    'prompt': 'Launching a new app for mental health and mindfulness',  }]For the classification version, your test cases should be in the format:test_cases = [  {    'prompt': 'I had a great day!',    'output': 'true'  },  {    'prompt': 'I am feeling gloomy.',    'output': 'false'  },  // add more test cases here]Choose how many prompts to generate. Keep in mind, this can get expensive if you generate many prompts. 10 is a good starting point.Call generate_optimal_prompt(description, test_cases, number_of_prompts) to generate a list of potential prompts, and test and rate their performance. For the classification version, just run the last cell.The final ELO ratings will be printed in a table, sorted in descending order. The higher the rating, the better the prompt.For the classification version, the scores for each prompt will be printed in a table (see the image above).Contributions are welcome! Some ideas:have a number of different system prompt generators that create different styles of prompts, to cover more ground (ex. examples, verbose, short, markdown, etc.)automatically generate the test casesexpand the classification version to support more than two classes using tiktokenLicenseThis project is MIT licensed.ContactMatt Shumer - @mattshumer_Project Link: https://github.com/mshumer/gpt-prompt-engineer",

Instead, it trusts GPT4 to rank prompts simply in terms of how well it imagines they will perform head-to-head. Thus, there\u2019s no way to tell if the chosen \u2018best prompt\u2019 actually is the best, because there\u2019s no ground truth against actual responses.Why is this so popular, then (more popular than promptfoo, which I think is a much better tool in the same vein)? AI devs seem enamored with the idea of LLMs evaluating LLMs \u2014everything is \u2018auto-\u2018 this and that. They\u2019re in for a rude awakening.

The question then becomes, how do you grade the prompt grading, objectively? At the bottom, there has to be a ground truth.You can't use the thing you're testing to evaluate its own performance. This applies to rulers, speedometers, and AI. It's the difference between a \"subjective\" and \"objective\" metrics. If you want an objective metric, you need to have it based on something external, based on reality, objective. Otherwise, you have metrics and ideas that have to held themselves up.Source: My day job is test and measurement. These concepts go back centuries.

There is nothing to learn, there are only magic incantations that change drastically if the model is updated.Worse yet, the incantations cannot be composed. E.g. take the SQL statement \"SELECT column FROM table WHERE column = [%s]\". For any given string you insert here, the output is predictable. You can even know which characters would trigger an injection attack.With prompts you cannot predict results. Any word, phrase, or sequence of characters may upset the faeries and cause the model to misbehave in who knows what way. No processing of user-input will stop injection attacks.Whilst it's dubious to call current software development practices \"engineering\", it's utterly ridiculous to do so for prompt-writing.replybroast 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I don't get where this sentiment comes from. I build software specifically on the concept of predictable results from llm's being composable.Sure, the results are not deterministic in that 100% of the time the exact prompt returns the exact same result, but you can tune your prompts so that 100% of the time they give you a valid result in the result category you were seeking, and with a specific probability distribution of available choices.Prompts are functions that can take concrete input and create a probabilistic output that can be automated upon. Especially if you only need to output one token, i.e a number, boolean, word, object reference. And for obvious reasons - the further you forecast out in a sequence the less accurate you will be.As long as you don't change the underlying model, in a massive model with billions of parameters, there are definitely mechanisms and behaviors to discover that you can reason about.replyFishInTheWater 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]but you can tune your prompts so that 100% of the time they give you a valid result in the resultYou can't though, that's the issue. Illustrative here are tokens like \"SolidGoldMagikarp\", but this does happen to \"normal\" sequences of tokens as well.There is no filter you can build to keep out such mistakes, any set of otherwise normal tokens could trigger the model to produce wrong output.Because of how large these models and most prompts are, even slight changes in things like attention can cascade into extremely different results.there are definitely mechanisms and behaviors to discover that you can reason about.It's faerie logic. The behaviours are mere trends and observations, not underlaying truth.The faeries reward you for offering them fruit. But offer them apple which fell from the tree exactly 74 hours ago down to the second and they'll kill you. There is no way to know ahead of time which things will upset them.The risk here is that you're fooled into believing these systems are understandable, that you know how they work, and that you'll mistakenly use them for something where the wrong results have consequences. You'll stop double-checking the output, all humans are lazy like that, and then you'll have disaster on your hands.replypenjelly 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]you could do a sort of validation of output by prompting the llm repeatedly with the same prompt and then compare the responses to eliminate outliers.

Languages evolve over time; Python, for instance, with its various imports that constantly disrupt my code, serves as a good example. This is perhaps the reason behind the emergence of containers to ensure code consistency.While some elements may be more \"composable\" than others, it appears increasingly unrealistic in today's world to encapsulate thought processes or interactions with systems within a rigid logical framework. Large Language Models (LLMs) will keep evolving and improving, making continual interaction with them unavoidable.

The process is highly iterative - parts of the process often need to be repeated many times before another can be entered - though the part(s) that get iterated and the number of such cycles in any given project may vary.It is a decision making process (often iterative) in which the basic sciences, mathematics, and engineering sciences are applied to convert resources optimally to meet a stated objective. Among the fundamental elements of the design process are the establishment of objectives and criteria, synthesis, analysis, construction, testing and evaluation.[1]\"It is not dependent on the problem domain, rather on how the work is performed.replyhospitalJail 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Ahh I forgot to put my usual caveat.Assembly and safety critical C can be considered software engineering.Anything with abstraction, no.replySirMaster 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I agree that far too many people call themselves software engineers when they really aren't.But I just mean to say that software engineering itself is definitely still a real thing and there are many people out there that can and should call themselves software engineers.replyedgyquant 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]\u201cReal engineer,\u201d is such an insufferable way to make your point.

Anytime you give someone freedom to create (anything), you will end up with a penis drawing. Just scrolling through quickly I see that Frame #13122 delivers on this law of the universe. After watching the movie preview, I only watched the first 45-50 seconds and counted about 4-5 drawings of the bodypart and 6-8 additional frames that just contain the word \"penis\". I wouldn't be surprised if 2-4% of the total frames submitted contain this specific content.2. It says that all frames have been drawn, but in fact they are far from complete. Many people have submitted blank frames or frames with one line scribble. There really should be a minimum \"ink\" or \"coverage\" amount before determining that a frame has been given a proper amount of effort in the drawing.3. People have wildly different artistic capabilities. Which sounds like part of the fun, but in practice many of these frames are so bad, that watching them back to back just looks like a static mess.4. Not a problem, but there are also some AMAZING submissions in here that are awesome to see. I wish those people could be allowed to submit additional frames. Maybe enough \"upvotes\" on their existing frames and they get to create another frame.5. We need to crowdsource a review process. It would be good to allow people to either A) draw a frame, which is a smaller portion of the population or B) review an existing frame for content and quality. This allows everyone to contribute to the movie in a way that they are capable. Reviewers could be shown a frame with a few buttons such as: blank, low effort drawing, inaccurate drawing, inappropriate drawing (see #1). If a frame gets a high ratio of similar negative reviews then we know to put it back into the rotation to be redrawn.5. Just because all frames have been drawn, there should be the option to resubmit an alternative for low-effort or blank frames. These are easy to find, so I should be able to submit a second drawing that gets queued behind the original in case the original gets rejected through the review system (which a blank frame easily would).Overall the concept is really cool. These tips above would solve most of the core problems and make it a better experience for everyone.replyConscat 5 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]From now on I'm calling this Jacurtis' Lawreplysigg3 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]2-4% of unreviewed content shall be phallic..?replybbstats 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]These are not problems.replySanderNL 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I agree.

They should do a simple distance check to throw out frames that don't overlap much with the original frame.

Generate a version of the movie using the best available frames, but continue allowing people to redraw frames. The movie would continue getting better and better over time.Then, when you watch the movie, maybe you could have a slider to control which \"generation\" of the movie you're watching.
