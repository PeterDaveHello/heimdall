However, I have personal concerns since that while EME in theory is vendor-neutral, in practice there is only three vendors which are widely-recognized: Google Widevine (which is used by Firefox in most platforms plus in Chrome and Android), Microsoft PlayReady (used by Microsoft Edge and Windows plus in some Android devices alongside Widevine), and Apple FairPlay (used in Safari and everything Apple).It is reasonable that the current situation in EME would translate into this specification. This may hinder users of other browsers since while in theory websites would just try to verify the identity by other means in practice this would lead to websites requiring pre-approved browsers.92Nicksil, dfgshdsfh, alex-kinokon, gmesml, PodcastGuru74, JWesorick, proudmuslim-dev, Railander, reactormonk, erlend-sh, and 82 more reacted with thumbs up emojiteh-maxh commented 5 days agoJul 21, 2023While such a \"feature\" would be great marketing for Firefox, I still think it should be opposed.Zipdox2 commented 4 days agoJul 22, 2023This API offers nothing to the end user, and can only be used to restrict the user. It is not in users' interests to implement it.Furthermore, this specification is vague and the underlying mechanism is unclear.173dfgshdsfh, Klaster1, PodcastGuru74, aeharding, flockonus, proudmuslim-dev, Naadiyaar, jongpie, eddex, ialexryan, and 163 more reacted with thumbs up emojiMemberbgrins commented yesterdayJul 25, 2023Mozilla opposes this proposal because it contradicts our principles and vision for the Web.Any browser, server, or publisher that implements common standards is automatically part of the Web:Standards themselves aim to avoid assumptions about the underlying hardware or software that might restrict where they can be deployed. This means that no single party decides which form-factors, devices, operating systems, and browsers may access the Web. It gives people more choices, and thus more avenues to overcome personal obstacles to access. Choices in assistive technology, localization, form-factor, and price, combined with thoughtful design of the standards themselves, all permit a wildly diverse group of people to reach the same Web.Mechanisms that attempt to restrict these choices are harmful to the openness of the Web ecosystem and are not good for users.Additionally, the use cases listed depend on the ability to \u201cdetect non-human traffic\u201d which as described would likely obstruct many existing uses of the Web such as assistive technologies, automatic testing, and archiving & search engine spiders. These depend on tools being able to receive content intended for humans, and then transform, test, index, and summarize that content for humans. The safeguards in the proposal (e.g., \u201choldback\u201d, or randomly failing to produce an attestation) are unlikely to be effective, and are inadequate to address these concerns.Detecting fraud and invalid traffic is a challenging problem that we're interested in helping address.

I myself have reduced my golf outings to every other week, and you, undoubtedly, noticed that your mother\u2019s car is no longer the current model year. Unfortunately, even these deep cuts, painful as they are, have not been enough. After much deliberation, we feel the best course of action is to eliminate the redundancies in our family. Consequently, your family membership has been terminated, effective immediately.I know this may come as a shock. But, while your mother and I have enjoyed seeing you grow these last six years, the family must remain focused on our strategic initiatives if we are to remain competitive against the Joneses. We have weathered storms in the past; I am confident that we will make it through this one.To help you through this transition, we are pleased to offer you a severance package with 80% of your allowance for the next three months. We will also extend the option of purchasing the family health insurance for the rest of the calendar year. Enclosed with this letter is a list of adoption agencies to help you in your search for a new family.I ask that you refrain from discussing your termination with any social contacts made through your membership in the family. You are also reminded not to damage or steal any family property on your way out of the house (this includes, but is not limited to, games, toys, and electronics). Failure to comply may result in your severance being terminated early or withheld entirely.On a personal note, your mother and I want you to know how wonderful we feel to have been able to give you life.Regards,Robert and Sue SmithP.S. Your (former) sister will be contacting you to schedule an exit interview. Please be open and honest. Your feedback is the best way for us to improve!",

Any negatives to using something like that? It seemed awfully convenient for one offs/corrections for large customers when things done need to be slick and automated.replypeterbhnews 21 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]A lot of the complexity of invoicing isn't in the PDF generation (which this tool does a wonderful job of doing, nice work!) but on the side of tracking which invoices are open vs. paid, which ones are aging, whether there are discounts that can be applied for early payment, and of course integration with whatever accounting tools you're using.But this looks like a great, simple tool for people who need to occasionally send an invoice or two.

But, my perception is that a lot of people are indeed spending much less time on Twitter. Twitter competitors are not only Mastodon or Threads.

Some people are still \u201con\u201d twitter but post much less than they do on mastodon, like Daniel Stenberg (you might know him as the maintainer of curl.)To be honest, as someone who doesn\u2019t care about the twitter culture war and still sees a lot of value in the site, mastodon is steadily becoming a better place for actual technical content.

I work with implementing ERP systems, focusing on accounting and financials. Most systems I see use the ERP system to generate the invoice data and for tracking the invoice status with a separate service to create the PDF (and electronic) invoices through an integration with the ERP system. The ERP system is usually pretty good at invoice tracking but customising the invoices can be both time consuming and expensive. Among larger enterprises there's definitely a market for software that can produce PDF invoices, even without tracking, although they would probably have to support creating PEPPOL BIS compliant XML documents as well.replyconductr 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I could be wrong, but if the business is using ERPs (to the extent of hiring implementation specialists), they're likely already too big for this type of software. In it's current form anyways, this feels like something small business uses to appear professional, big and/or well polished. The bigger company would use the ERP solution because it integrates with their general ledger, etc. and at that scale putting any focus on 'pretty invoices' is probably just a waste of time. It's really better to focus on getting them paid quickly.replynoufalibrahim 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I concur. And I have some insight into this. I wrote a command line invoicing tool[1] which I referenced on an earlier thread since I knew a bit about generating PDFs and thought that was the \"hard part\" of this.The real value is in being able to respond quickly to queries like \"What were the invoices numbers for client X in Jan, Feb 2022?\" when your accountant asks them. Managing that, timesheets etc. in a way that can give you insight into business financials is what's really useful once you cross a (low) volume of invoices.That being said, the output of the tool is extremely good looking.References:1: https://github.com/hamon-in/invoicereplyrmnclmnt 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Also in some (most?) countries, regulations impose a strict versioning of invoices and a strict irrevocability process (meaning you cannot edit an invoice after its been delivered). To be compliant with the laws, as a company you need to prove you are using a system which is compliant with theses constraints.For instance in France, it has been mandatory to use such compliant software since 2018 for all companies.replyivanhoe 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Many EU countries still allow for individuals/small companies to choose to use simpler book keeping, without going through all that bureaucracy. And realistically this types of tools are probably targeting that population...replytraceroute66 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> Many EU countries still allow for individuals/small companies to choose to use simpler book keeping, without going through all that bureaucracy.Not really. Well, only if you are a really really small company (read below VAT threshold).Once you're VAT registered the tax authorities will want the irrevocability.replyRoark66 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]There is no such thing as irrevocability in IT(unless we talk about physical retail sale registers every retail business has to have - these are certified standalone hardware devices that print receipts and store the transaction details in write once memory). At least in this EU country the requirement is that you keep the original file for the retention period and you present it on request. If you mess with it in the meantime and you get caught you're essentially falsifying financial tax records. It doesn't matter if you keep your invoices in .txt files on a hard drive or in a cloud based \"irrevocable\" system But if you're doing retail your accounting data better matches with the printout from that hardware device that logs all the sales.However, having said that the complexity in doing small business accounting (at least here in Poland) is not in generating invoices, but in accounting for them correctly with regards to VAT. Is this just a domestic sale/purchase? Is it an EU goods or services purchase/sale? Is it the same but for outside EU? Is the client a company or an individual? Does he/she want to return a item. Did you send an invoice, but never got paid? (you're still on the hook for the VAT) All those things matter and affect how you're supposed to record your VAT. In many cases of cross border transactions you end up recording VAT in a special way so it cancels out, but you need to report the right amounts. The logic to not mess this up is what makes people pay for this software. There is nothing stopping you doing all of it in Excel if you want, but if you mess up... It might be expensive.replyponderings 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]At least in NL, the final version becomes irrevocable when it is send to the customer (or supplier). Corrections are done with a new number (or more than one) Sometimes you need more than one sequence.replyOtomotO 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Nothing is irrevocable, when it's on my machinereplymongol 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]In Sweden, this applies to the accounting system - bookings need to be immutable but there is no certification of the software. The invoice generation is not covered, they need to state due date, VAT number etc, and the invoices need to be booked in the accounting system but can be typed on a typewriter, or written by hand even, as far as I know.replyverytrivial 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I would assume this would be for cases where your are using that same software to report income, expenses, tax etc. But in Invoice Dragon (i.e. just a template) case you would be keeping a copy of the invoice for later reference in calculations, the same as a handwritten invoice, no? It's just \"typing it up\" for you. This isn't accounting software, just a template.replyelric 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Who ensures the software is compliant?

Each line item was updated throughout the day, with very quick notes to myself of what I did.At the end of each day, I'd print a draft invoice of the unbilled hours thus far, as backup.When it came time to invoice, GnuCash supports/ed custom invoice scripts, so I'd copied&modified a stock invoice script to do what I want, including hiding the notes to myself, and complying with the occasional format change requests from client. I'd print to PDF or paper.For a client that also wanted a separate summary of what I did, I'd copy&paste the hidden notes into an editor, and then rewrite that as a concise one-to-few sentences.As soon as I emailed/mailed the invoice, the GnuCash accounts-receivable functionality would take over. The complexity in how it represented the data was a little scary, but it worked.replyunfocused 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You are correct. I'm in the process of trying to find software to manage the collection of 1000s of fines. It's a very niche area.

As you say, it\u2019s a separate function relative to invoice generation and payment.It\u2019s not an overly complex problem to solve in the general sense but it is very easy to underestimate the complexity, and this often leads to half baked systems.I\u2019ve got a ton of experience in this area, reach out via my profile if you would like to connect.replybombcar 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]A quick and dirty invoice generator is great for people who usually do point of sale or cash transactions and once in a while need to produce an invoice so a business can pay (vs it being expensed).reply2Gkashmiri 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]i never understood the difference between a \"bill\" and an \"expense\". my confusion in understanding comes from the idea that a small retail trader for example, pays for 2-3 things.either capital goods, or purchases of trading goods or expenses.

Now, all of these require \"invoice\", at least in india, that means you can't just say \"i paid inr 500 for fuel\" without a receipt/invoice. So what is a bill and how is it different than being expensed?replyesquivalience 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The difference is that a bill is saying \"I've done this work for you: now pay me\".

This \u201cinvoice\u201d might be as simple as a docket from a cash register.If you receive an invoice from someone, it can be classified as an expense if it\u2019s legitimately part of your business - depending on local law. If it is an expense then it\u2019s deducted from your income so that you don\u2019t get taxed on it - you should only be taxed on profit, not revenue.If it\u2019s not a legitimate business expense then you can\u2019t deduct it from your income and the tax you pay is higher.replybombcar 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It\u2019s a case of before or after the payment occurs - some businesses want it all handled via invoice so they can check things first.Usually it\u2019s just internal processes - Uber can be expensed, gas cannot.replyFredPret 20 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This would be a fantastic way to give your customers a bear-hug and slowly pull them into a full ERP system.I have personally seen myself and other business owners issue invoices that are unconnected to any system early on - just generating it using some ill-suited tool like Word.But once your customer enter their invoice data in Invoice Dragon, it's a simple matter for you to set up a \"payment due\" reminder for them.

That means you're not in the \"invoicing\" business, you're in the flipping business- so optimizing for the best case, well, you don't need to really track this stuff, or offer discounts for early payment or whatever> of course integration with whatever accounting tools you're using.Of course, you could be charging enough money that you don't really have to think about your costs.The kind of person doing that has the bandwidth to install and use open source tools.So ironically, the person who is arguably the best B2B customer, making tons of money, lots of bandwidth, pretty sophisticated, is the person most likely to use a simple open source invoice PDF generating tool.

If you have a thriving profitable business you usually just pay for invoicing software. Why would you invest time fiddling around with an OSS tool? just because you have the bandwidth doesn't mean you'll use it on that.

I had built a really simple HTML template for my invoices and I generated them using some CLI scripts and Airtable as a database (to keep track of customer addresses, invoice IDs, etc.).I didn't want to use a full-on accounting tool where everything is kept in the cloud with expensive monthly subscriptions and using Word or something along those lines also didn't work for me.replymanifoldgeo 20 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]If anyone is looking for a comprehensive accounting tool for personal finance or small business, GnuCash also has the ability to generate invoices.In my opinion, the PDF generator made by OP makes way more beautiful invoices than GnuCash. However, generating is only part of the story; tracking invoice balances and knowing who still owes you is another. GnuCash does both in one place, which is why I am plugging it here. It's worked well for my small business. It even gives you a nice pop-up reminder when you open the program that reminds you about unpaid Accounts Receivable.replyISL 19 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Without checking for compatibility between the licenses -- if they are both open source, it is possible to combine the best of both tools.replymanifoldgeo 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Totally true! I would love to see that. In practice, I doubt that will happen because contributing to GnuCash seems to require a lot of nuanced understanding of their very old codebase and build system. OP's PDF generator is a web app, while GnuCash has basically no way to run in a browser.That's actually why I built GnuCash-Helper[0]. It's a web-based personal finance tool written with Python and Flask that works with GnuCash files. It's not nearly ready for prime time, but I use it daily, and I don't even open GnuCash anymore.In general, I really wish that GnuCash would get a visual refresh and some more modern features.

Most of the description lines we used are larger than what is accepted in this field.* Missing a \"product reference id\" column* Probably not intended for B2B EU users as a few important pieces of information are missing like company number (the one of the invoicing company and the one of the company being invoiced, payment conditions, bank account, payment reference to be used with the bank transfer and, most importantly, no automatic computation and display of the VAT.Best of luck with your project !replyimagetic 4 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I like where this is going.

And congrats for releasing.Some feedback from someone who recently built a very similar PoC invoice-generator[1].1. I'd prefer to have it live-update an HTML view. When I stop typing, it shows what the invoice will look like (by approx.) instead of ending up with 15+ temp pdfs in my Downloads folder.2. In the EU there's strict rules for invoices. E.g. on numbering, VAT inclusion and so on. Getting this right, is the hard part. A tool like this that works out-of-the-box for e.g. French Invoices or Dutch Invoice to EU company. Getting this right requires a lot of research and domain knowledge. Something that e.g. a French plumber or Dutch Webdesigner will not have.3. The hard parts of invoicing is not generating the PDF. Nor filling in the blanks in a template[2]. The hard part is getting all the data for point 2 above and then tracking (paid, overdue, reminded, retracted) the invoices correctly. Most online bookkeeping already does all this. Integrated.4. Including some VAT or Tax lines is a requirement in many (most?) jurisdictions. It now cannot handle it without some weird hacks (desc: \"VAT 21%\", amount: 1, price: \"insert manually calculated number and don't forget to update it\"). I understand and applaud not including these calculators. It's impossible to make this general; no software has done this properly; e.g. invoice-ninja requires the user to set this up, but still misses many use-cases/jurisdiction-requirements which then require hacks anyway. But there should really be a way to include specialised line-items. Discount, VAT, WhateverTax, Travelling-costs. That can be in- or excluded from subtotal, but do add up to the total.I send maybe 10 invoices each year, so I'm probably your target audience. But I am only allowed (by law) to use such a tool if its either flexible enough to make it fit my local requirements, or opiniated and tailored for these local requirements. And for me, the real value would be in tracking these invoices (which most bookkeeping tools already do).[1] my ultimate goal is to manage invoices in a web-base tool, have plain-text-accounting (beancount/ledger) as its \"database\" and PDF as export; something I'm now managing with a terrible hodge-podge of scripts, latex and whatnot. Where \"manage\" is to add medatadata&add line-items, then track them in overviews, and consolidate or book them accordingly.[2] e.g. https://extensions.libreoffice.org/?q=invoice&action_doExten...replysubw00f 12 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I just tried it and loved the templates.

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36862494",
    "content": "Apple already shipped attestation on the web, and we barely noticedThere's been a lot of concern recently about the Web Environment Integrity proposal, developed by a selection of authors from Google, and apparently being prototyped in Chromium.There's good reason for anger here (though I'm not sure yelling at people on GitHub is necessarily the best outlet). This proposal amounts to attestation on the web, limiting access to features or entire sites based on whether the client is approved by a trusted issuer. In practice, that will mean Apple, Microsoft & Google.Of course, Google isn't the first to think of this, but in fact they're not even the first to ship it. Apple already developed & deployed an extremely similar system last year, now integrated into MacOS 13, iOS 16 & Safari, called \"Private Access Tokens\":Private Access Tokens are powerful tools that prove when HTTP requests are coming from legitimate devices without disclosing someone's identity.The focus here is primarily on removing captchas, and as such it's been integrated into Cloudflare (discussed here) and Fastly (here) as a mechanism for recognizing 'real' clients without needing other captcha mechanisms.Fundamentally though, it's exactly the same concept: a way that web servers can demand your device prove it is a sufficiently 'legitimate' device before browsing the web.How do Private Access Tokens work?The mechanism is a fairly simple exchange over HTTP, handled by built-in browser APIs, which in turn integrate with operating system components to confirm that the browser & OS are 'legitimate' (the exact definition of that is left to the attester - i.e. Apple).The flow looks like this:A browser makes an HTTP request from a web server.The web server refuses the request, and returns an HTTP 401 response with a PrivateToken challenge:HTTP/1.1 401 UnauthorizedWWW-Authenticate:  PrivateToken challenge=<base64 challenge data>,    token-key=<base64 public-key>(Newlines added for readability)The browser recognizes this, and sends parts of the challenge, in addition to verified details of your device provided by the OS, to an attester (e.g. Apple).The attester verifies your device is real & unmodified (depends on the device, but both Android & iOS have existing ways to check this) and works with a token issuer (somebody trusted by the origin & that trusts the attester, e.g. Cloudflare/Fastly) to return a signed token, proving that your device has been verified as legitimate.The browser resends the request, with the signed token in their Authorization header:GET /protected-content HTTP/1.1Host: example.comAuthorization: PrivateToken token=<signed token>The server now knows that the client has been verified by a trusted provider (but nothing more) and can treat the client differently on that basis.This all happens on Apple devices today when using Safari, any time a service using this (such as Fastly & Cloudflare) is concerned about the legitimacy of your requests.The privacy protections in here appear fairly strong (I'm not an expert on this, but that's a very clear goal of the proposal and the separation of the origin/issuer/attester flow) but the core issue from Web Environment Integrity remains: your treatment on the web depends on whether Apple says your device, OS & browser configuration are legitimate & acceptable.How bad is this?This feature is largely bad for the web and the industry generally, like all attestation (see below).That said, it's not as dangerous as the Google proposal, simply because Safari isn't the dominant browser. Right now, Safari has around 20% market share in browsers (25% on mobile, and 15% on desktop), while Chrome is comfortably above 60% everywhere, with Chromium more generally (Brave, Edge, Opera, Samsung Internet, etc) about 10% above that.With Safari providing this, it can be used by some providers, but nobody can block or behave differently with unattested clients. Similarly, Safari can't usefully use this to tighten the screws on users - while they could refuse to attest old OS versions or browsers, it wouldn't make a significant impact on users (they might see statistically more CAPTCHAs, but little else).Chrome's usage is a larger concern. With 70+% of web clients using Chromium, this would become a major part of the web very quickly. With both Web Environment Integrity & Private Access Tokens, 90% of web clients would potentially be attested, and the \"oh, you're not attested, let's treat you suspiciously\" pressure could ramp up quickly.Why is attestation bad generally?This has been covered extensively elsewhere, so I won't dig into it too deeply, but as a quick summary:Attestation means you can only use approved clients, which is terrible for competition and innovation (sorry, it's now impossible to make a new browser or OS!) particularly for open-source, community & smaller indie efforts that are consistently excluded from these mechanisms. If attestation was around in the days of IE6, it would've been a major roadblock in the rise of Firefox & Chrome.Attestation blocks users' control of their own devices, by design. A key goal is that users using modified software should not be attested as legitimate. I would like to be able to browse the web on my rooted Android phone please. There's no way any fully user-modifiable OS or hardware can ever be attested in the way these proposals intend.Attestation opens dangerous doors that allow the approved providers to freely tighten the rules later. \"Sorry, we only attest devices during their 2 year official support window\", and \"Sorry, we don't attest browsers with ad-block extensions installed\" are both perfectly plausible and thoroughly problematic next steps.Proponents would argue that none of this applies to the Web Environment Integrity proposal, as it suggests 'holdbacks', i.e. refusing attestation a small percentage of times to make blocking based on attestation impossible. I suspect business pressures will make that unworkable in practice (there's already strong industry pushback from a closely involved F5 / Shape Security representative) and it's notable that Google's existing Android Play Integrity attestation does not do this.Free usage of different clients & servers on the web is what has built the open web, and is a large part of why it's so successful. Attestation breaks this by design.All of this has already played out on Android, where you technically can create and run your OS, and Android distributions like LineageOS are perfectly functional, but attestation features mean that this implies the constant risk of key apps (like your bank!) blocking you as suspicious.Fundamentally, attestation is anti-competitive. Blocking competition between different Android versions is already problematic. Blocking competition for both browsers & OSs on the web would be catastrophic.ShitQuite.If you're concerned about all this, you might also be interested in the other proposals from the Anti-Fraud Community Group, discussing various other potential web 'features' along the same lines.Fraud & bots on the web are a real problem, and discussion on ways to defend against that is totally reasonable, and often very valuable! It's a hard problem. That said, this has to be carefully balanced against the health of the web itself. Blocking competition, hamstringing open-source and the open web, and removing all user control over their own devices is not a reasonable tradeoff.Have thoughts or comments?

    "content": "A comprehensive guide to running Llama 2 locallyPosted July 22, 2023 by @zekeWe\u2019ve been talking a lot about how to run and fine-tune Llama 2 on Replicate. But you can also run Llama locally on your M1/M2 Mac, on Windows, on Linux, or even your phone. The cool thing about running Llama 2 locally is that you don\u2019t even need an internet connection.Here\u2019s an example using a locally-running Llama 2 to whip up a website about why llamas are cool:It\u2019s only been a couple days since Llama 2 was released, but there are already a handful of techniques for running it locally. In this blog post we\u2019ll cover three open-source tools you can use to run Llama 2 on your own devices:Llama.cpp (Mac/Windows/Linux)Ollama (Mac)MLC LLM (iOS/Android)Llama.cpp (Mac/Windows/Linux)Llama.cpp is a port of Llama in C/C++, which makes it possible to run Llama 2 locally using 4-bit integer quantization on Macs. However, Llama.cpp also has support for Linux/Windows.Here\u2019s a one-liner you can use to install it on your M1/M2 Mac:curl -L \"https://replicate.fyi/install-llama-cpp\" | bashHere\u2019s what that one-liner does:#!/bin/bash# Clone llama.cppgit clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.gitcd llama.cpp# Build it. `LLAMA_METAL=1` allows the computation to be executed on the GPULLAMA_METAL=1 make# Download modelexport MODEL=llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.binif [ ! -f models/${MODEL} ]; then  curl -L \"https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML/resolve/main/${MODEL}\" -o models/${MODEL}fi# Set promptPROMPT=\"Hello!

Ollama already has support for Llama 2.To use the Ollama CLI, download the macOS app at ollama.ai/download. Once you've got it installed, you can download Lllama 2 without having to register for an account or join any waiting lists. Run this in your terminal:# download the 7B model (3.8 GB)ollama pull llama2# or the 13B model (7.3 GB)ollama pull llama2:13bThen you can run the model and chat with it:ollama run llama2>>> hiHello! How can I help you today?Note: Ollama recommends that have at least 8 GB of RAM to run the 3B models, 16 GB to run the 7B models, and 32 GB to run the 13B models.MLC LLM (Llama on your phone)MLC LLM is an open-source project that makes it possible to run language models locally on a variety of devices and platforms, including iOS and Android.For iPhone users, there\u2019s an MLC chat app on the App Store. MLC now has support for the 7B, 13B, and 70B versions of Llama 2, but it\u2019s still in beta and not yet on the Apple Store version, so you\u2019ll need to install TestFlight to try it out.

What I've seen help, especially with chat models, is to use a prompt template. Some tools (e.g. https://ollama.ai/ \u2013 mentioned in the article) use a default, model-specific prompt template when you run the model. This is easier for users since they can just input your chat messages and get answers. The hard part is every model is trained (and behaves) differently.With llama.cpp you'd need wrap your prompt text with the right template. For llama 2, the facebook developers' generation code wraps the system prompt and user prompts in specific tags (<<SYS>>{system prompt}<</SYS>> and [INST]{user prompt}[/INST]) respectively): https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/ge....Worth noting that customizing prompt templates can be fun \u2013 you don't have to use \"prescribed\" one \u2013 I've had a model generate a conversation between a few characters that talk to each other for example \u2013 it's pretty entertaining!replylhl 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As a followup on LLama2's prompting, here's a good thread with some more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/155po2p/get_lla... (see also: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1561vn5/here_is... - it's a bit complex and people are still wrapping their heads around it)Note, it is possible to reinject <<SYS>> prompts during the conversation to keep the LLM on target: https://twitter.com/overlordayn/status/1681631554672513025 (but obviously this should be the first thing you filter and track if you are running an LLM that is accessible to end-users - rebuff is a lib w/ some good ideas to start with)With new fine tunes coming out, it's worth noting again that different datasets/models all use slightly different prompt formats (many are using multiple datasets these days, so it's hard to say just how much it matters now): https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/13lwwux/comment...Ideally, fine tunes for LLama2 would regularize all datasets to the official tokens/format and inference interfaces could standardize too (or there could be some metadata collected for what model uses what, but some of the low hanging fruit that's out for the future I guess). One other thing to keep in mind is that all the benchmarks/leaderboards don't use instruct formatting at all, and don't really represent capabilities for a model. IMO, ELO-style rankings against models for specific tasks would probably be more representative.replyjawerty 9 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Some you may have seen this but I have a Llama 2 finetuning live coding stream from 2 days ago where I walk through some fundamentals (like RLHF and Lora) and how to fine-tune LLama 2 using PEFT/Lora on a Google Colab A100 GPU.In the end with quantization and parameter efficient fine-tuning it only took up 13gb on a single GPU.Check it out here if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYgtG2Th6fIreplysoultrees 1 hour ago | parent | next [\u2013]Can you do more videos on preparing the data and scraping data?

It will drop to CPU speeds whenever the context window is full: https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/1730#issuecomm... - while sure this might be fixed in the future, it's been an issue since Metal support was added, and is a significant problem if you are actually trying to actually use it for inferencing. With 192GB of memory, you could probably run larger models w/o quantization, but I've never seen anyone post benchmarks of their experiences. Note that at that point, the limited memory bandwidth will be a big factor.* If you are planning on using Apple Silicon for ML/training, I'd also be wary. There are multi-year long open bugs in PyTorch[1], and most major LLM libs like deepspeed, bitsandbytes, etc don't have Apple Silicon support[2][3].You can see similar patterns w/ Stable Diffusion support [4][5] - support lagging by months, lots of problems and poor performance with inference, much less fine tuning. You can apply this to basically any ML application you want (srt, tts, video, etc)Macs are fine to poke around with, but if you actually plan to do more than run a small LLM and say \"neat\", especially for a business, recommending a Mac for anyone getting started w/ ML workloads is a bad take. (In general, for anyone getting started, unless you're just burning budget, renting cloud GPU is going to be the best cost/perf, although on-prem/local obviously has other advantages.)[1] https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3A...[2] https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues/1580[3] https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/issues/485[4] https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/disc...[5] https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ai-generated-art-stable...replyrobotnikman 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Llama.cpp has been fun to experiment around with.

Getting around 9 tokens/sec, which is very usable. I also have the 65B version of the same model [1] and it's good for around 3.6 tokens/second, but it uses 44GB of RAM. Not unusably slow, but more often than not I opt for the 30B because it's good enough and a lot faster.Haven't tried the llama2 70B yet.[0] https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/upstage-llama-30b-instruct-2...

The bash script then downloads the 13 billion parameter GGML version of LLaMA 2. The GGML version is what will work with llama.cpp and uses CPU for inferencing. There are ways to run models using your GPU, but it depends on your setup whether it will be worth it.I would highly recommend looking into the text-generation-webui project (https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui).

It would read through the whole conversation and would provide the right output you expect, exactly as if it would \u201cremember\u201d the conversation. In reality there are all kind of issues which can crop up as the input grows longer and longer. One is that it takes more and more processing power and time for it to \u201cread through\u201d everything previously said. And there are things like what jmiskovic said that the output quality can also degrade in perhaps unexpected ways.But that also doesn\u2019t mean that \u201c refinement of output is arrived at through conversation isn't possible\u201d. It is not that black and white, just that you can run into troubles as the length of the discussion grows.I don\u2019t have direct experience with long conversations so I can\u2019t tell you how long is definietly too long, and how long is still safe. Plus probably there are some tricks one can do to work around these. Probably there are things one can do if one unpacks that \u201cblack box\u201d understanding of the process. But even without that you could imagine a \u201cconsolidation\u201d process where the AI is instructed to write short notes about a given length of conversation and then those shorter notes would be copied in to the next input instead of the full previous conversation. All of these are possible, but you won\u2019t have a turn-key solution for it just yet.replycjbprime 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The limit here is the \"context window\" length of the model, measured in tokens, which will quickly become too short to contain all of your previous conversations, which will mean it has to answer questions without access to all of that text. And within a single conversation, it will mean that it starts forgetting the text from the start of the conversation, once the [conversation + new prompt] reaches the context length.The kind of hacks that work around this are to train the model on the past conversations, and then rely on similarity in tensor space to pull the right (lossy) data back out of the model (or a separate database) later, based on its similarity to your question, and include it (or a summary of it, since summaries are smaller) within the context window for your new conversation, combined with your prompt. This is what people are talking about when they use the term \"embeddings\".replynomand 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]My benchmark is having a peer programming session spanning days and dozens of queries with ChatGPT where we co-created a custom static site generator that works really well for my requirements.

It's ready to use by the intrepid, either with our supported integrations, or within your own tools, using one of our supported language bindings.PRQL still has some minor bugs and some missing features, and probably is only ready to be rolled out to non-technical teams for fairly simple queries.Here's our current Roadmap and our Milestones.Our immediate focus for the code is on:Building out the next few big features, including types and modules.Ensuring our supported features feel extremely robust; resolving any priority bugs.We're also spending time thinking about:Making it really easy to start using PRQL. We're doing that by building integrations with tools that folks already use; for example our VS Code extension & Jupyter integration. If there are tools you're familiar with that you think would be open to integrating with PRQL, please let us know in an issue.Making it easier to contribute to the compiler.

    "content": "Best PracticesTracking HackerNews' Shifting Preferences for Remote Jobs Over 5 Years7 days ago \u2022 6 min readBy Dany ChepenkoIn the previous post, we shared the reasons for the deception of a universal remote work environment. Many creative collaborations happen outside the scheduled interactions, and collocation speeds up the collaboration exchange. In real life, collaboration often happens spontaneously and informally, and working in close physical proximity can facilitate this exchange. That motivates some leaders believe that remote work can result in a loss of creativity.The covid-19 pandemic has drastically changed the landscape of work in the tech industry. Many companies have had to quickly transition to remote work, which has presented a unique set of challenges. Companies have had to adjust to new communication protocols, manage distributed teams, and ensure secure remote access to data and applications. To fully understand the impact of remote work, it is necessary to look beyond the surface level and examine how the remote environment has become entrenched over time.Unraveling 5-Year Hiring Patterns and InsightsWe decided to start with a tech market and examine the reaction to the post-Covid era, delve into the data, and extract insights that shed light on the changing preferences of remote work within the HackerNews community. We analyzed thousands of job listings at Ask HN: Who is hiring? section to better understand the preferences of candidates and the requirements of the employees. We analyzed the data from 2018 to June 2023Based on the data, we can observe the following trends:In 2018, approximately 23% of job listings on HackerNews were for remote work positions. In 2019, there was a slight increase in the percentage of remote work positions, with approximately 29% of job listings being for remote work.In 2020, the trend continued with a further decrease in job postings for non-remote positions (3,087) and a significant increase in job postings for remote positions (4,277). This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a surge in remote work across various industries, also influenced the HackerNews community's preferences. May was the first month the number of remote work outperformed the onsite positions, and the trend remained strong until thees days.There was no single month where number of onsite position was greater than remote.Continuing the upward trend, in 2021, the percentage of remote work positions climbed to 79% of all job listings on HackerNews. This significant increase indicates a strong preference for remote work within the community.Despite experiencing a significant drop in the number of job openings, nearly halving year-over-year since June 2022, the community's preference for remote work has remained relatively unaffected.As of 2023, up to June, the percentage of remote work positions remained high at 69% of all job listings. However the data presents a slight decline in the percentage of remote work positions within the HackerNews community. On average, only 70% of job postings were remote, marking a decrease compared to previous years. The trend reached its lowest point in May, with remote work positions comprising just 57% of job listings.In addition to remote work preferences, another crucial aspect of the job market within the HackerNews community is the prevalence of location-specific or citizenship requirements.Location-Restricted Remote Work TrendsWhile remote work offers the flexibility to work from anywhere, certain positions and industries may still necessitate candidates to be based in specific locations or possess specific citizenship qualifications. Understanding the dynamics of these requirements is essential for professionals seeking job opportunities and employers looking to attract suitable candidates.The percentage of job descriptions with location-specific or citizenship requirements within the HackerNews community has steadily increased from 16% in 2018 to 37% in 2023 (up to June). This trend highlights a growing emphasis on hiring individuals who can be physically present in specific locations or possess the required citizenship, indicating a sustained demand for candidates with specific geographical qualifications.The increase in job descriptions with location-specific or citizenship requirements within the HackerNews community can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, it is likely driven by companies adhering to legal obligations, especially those with government contracts or restrictions on hiring non-residential full-time employees due to jurisdictional limitations. Additionally, concerns about preserving company culture may prompt organizations to prioritize candidates who can be physically present in a specific location or possess specific citizenship, ensuring a cohesive organizational environment.It is worth noting that the initial adopters of remote work were likely companies that had the ability to hire globally, as the supply of remote workers was relatively limited at that time. These companies recognized the benefits of accessing a larger talent pool and offering remote work options, which allowed them to attract skilled professionals from different parts of the world.Unsurprisingly, the majority of location requirements correspond to the United States, followed by Canada and the European Union (EU).Indeed, the migration trend away from expensive cities is not limited to specific regions but has been observed across the United States.As the concept of work becomes increasingly decoupled from traditional office spaces, individuals are finding the freedom to reside in locations farther away from urban centers or explore new regions. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work had already facilitated a notable migration of employees away from the most expensive cities:In the years 2018 and 2019, approximately 40,000 remote workers relocated from the New York metropolitan area, while 20,000 departed from San Francisco.While some may eventually return, a significant majority of these individuals are expected to establish permanent residences in their new locations.Which programming languages are popular for remote work?At the end we'd love to analyse the remote preferences of the programming language requirements in job positions:React, Python, and Java are the most frequently mentioned programming languages in job postings within the HackerNews community, with high total job counts for each language.The programming languages with the highest percentage of remote jobs out of all jobs that require the language / skills are TypeScript (70%), Postgres (61%), GraphQL (62%), and React (60%). These languages have a higher proportion of remote work opportunities compared to others. Python, JavaScript, Go, Ruby, and Node.js also have many remote jobs available.Java and C++, have a relatively lower percentage of remote jobs, ranging from 45% to 58%. Professionals specializing in these languages may find more on-site or location-specific employment opportunities within the HackerNews community.Exploring the relationship between compensation and remote work, as well as delving into specific industries, adds further depth to understanding the dynamics of remote work but that requeres a more carefull data gatherings. Very few positions openly share the compensation ranges and mapping the industry requires intense human touchIndeed, exploring the relationship between compensation and remote work, as well as analyzing specific industries, can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of remote work. The availability of detailed compensation information for remote positions is often limited, as companies may not openly disclose salary ranges in job postings.ConclusionBased on the analysis of the data provided, it is evident that remote work has gained significant popularity within the HackerNews community, particularly in the field of computer science and entrepreneurship. The number of job postings for remote positions has shown a consistent increase over the years, with a substantial surge observed in 2021. This suggests that remote work has become an attractive option for both employers and job seekers at least within the community.The COVID-19 pandemic is likely a contributing factor to the increased preference for remote work, as it accelerated the adoption of remote work practices globally. However, it is important to note that even before the pandemic, remote work was already being considered by a considerable number of employers within the HackerNews community.If you're the researcher and interested to play around the data, contact d@spatial.chat to request the dataset. We plan to open-source the dashboards and the dataset in the nearest future. Stay tuned!Disclaimers:The report, created by SpatialChat, the company that designs a virtual office product specifically for remote teams. Therefore, we are particularly interested in the growing abundance of remote job opportunities.This data highlights that a majority of job postings within the HackerNews community have specified locations within the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Germany. Therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions about global market trends.Data primarily reflects the preferences and practices of tech companies, which are often at the forefront of work flexibility In 2022, the U.S. had a working population of around 160 million people, of which less than 5% worked in the tech industry.",
