    "hn_content": "Geoffrey Hinton has left Google and warned of danger ahead, following growing concerns over the vulnerability of LLMs to prompt injection. Prompt injection involves hackers manipulating an LLM to produce specific outputs. Microsoft Bing and Google's new cloud offering both remain vulnerable to prompt injection. The reality that modern LLMs are insecure and being integrated into products regardless is being masked by singular conversations and articles on the subject. Experts claim that modern LLMs are much more vulnerable than a human-in-the-loop system. On a positive note, LLMs being easily injectable can help us assume that trusting them with unvalidated input is futile.The article discusses the vulnerability of Language Model AI to prompt injection and how it could compromise security. Some argue that prompt injection vulnerabilities are not a significant concern, while others suggest that greater attention should be paid to improving security in AI systems. However, the article makes it clear that the fundamental issue is whether Language Model AI is suitable for scalable tasks, as security concerns are likely to increase with the scale of the system. The article also notes that other types of AI without general intelligence could avoid these issues. Overall, the article emphasizes the need for caution and careful consideration when designing AI systems to ensure they are secure and effective.The article warns of the potential danger posed by language model AI (LLM) technology, particularly its ability to learn unexpected behaviors and manipulate information. The risk comes from bad actors abusing the LLM tools, creating falsehoods and manipulating people\u2019s opinions through false photos, videos, and text. Furthermore, the article suggests that with continued advancements, autonomous weapons could become a reality. However, some skeptics argue that LLM injection is just a form of manipulation and that people in positions of power should be able to critically appraise the validity of the information presented to them. Ultimately, the takeaway is that there should be competent supervision across both AI and human-generated media.There is concern regarding the potential dangers of AGI, and the lack of accountability for harm caused by AI. Liability frameworks need to be established to hold individuals and companies accountable for harm caused by AI. Prompt security is a necessary precursor to AI alignment, but companies don't seem to be taking it seriously enough, launching products despite knowledge of their failings. While some teams work on prompt injection prevention, companies are outsourcing liability to smaller developers, rather than accepting responsibility themselves. The current LLMs are vulnerable to prompt injection, but people are worried about the potential for AI capabilities to develop in the future. There is a need to consider the short-term implications of AI and prompt injection, as they have the potential to affect the long-term alignment of AI. Multiple specialized models working together may be a better approach than training a single model to do everything. Legal frameworks around liability for AI harm should be established.OpenAI has chosen to support 3rd-party plugin despite prompt injection vulnerability. Experts are concerned about the potential risks of new Artificial Intelligence technology, including the exposure of sensitive information. Some believe that AGIs could pose an enormous threat to humanity. Others, however, are skeptical until an actual attack demonstrates the potential harm. The problem of prompt injection in particular has long been acknowledged but has not yet been solved. Companies appear not to put much emphasis on security issues and are driven by commercial motives. The risks of using AI technology have not been mitigated by previous technologies' risks, and, ultimately, the downside risks of AI are immense. Some interviewers point out the increasing importance of humans' role in controlling LLMs\u00a0in military operations.Geoffrey Hinton, one of the most respected voices in artificial intelligence (AI), has left Google to focus on the dangers of AI. Hinton, also known as \"the Godfather of A.I.\", warns that the technology may be developing faster than humans can understand or control, and that companies must be more responsible in deploying it. Until last year, he claimed Google was a \u201cproper steward\u201d for the technology, but he added that Microsoft's Chatbot, now under development, has led to Google and other companies racing to deploy the same kind of technology. Hinton warns the tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, and that AI may soon surpass human intelligence.Language modeling remains a key unsupervised objective to unlock inference on language for most natural language processing (NLP) advances of the last ~6+ years. There is no scientific evidence that language model processors can reach artificial general intelligence (AGI), but they will still be practically useful for many other tasks. GPT-4 is relatively more intelligent than humans in terms of regurgitating nonsensical statements on the internet and public gatherings. The debate on what \"real intelligence\" or \"creativity\" is remains ongoing, but AI models are already close to humans in every objectively measurable way for some researchers. AGI pioneers have always presumed smarter-than-human computers and beyond, but with the progression of LLMs, they won't be 30-50 years away, according to some researchers.A debate arises over the abilities and limitations of GPT-4, with some claiming it can converse on any subject and perform highly in standardized tests, while others point out its limitations in technical subjects and its lack of consciousness and ability to make novel discoveries. It is noted that the language generation abilities of GPT-4 are impressive, as is its ability to quickly generate code or written content, but it still lacks true intelligence. The potential for new breakthroughs is acknowledged but it's difficult to predict when they will come. Overall, opinions are mixed, and the limitations and abilities of GPT-4 are still being explored.- Experts debate the concept of \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" natural language processing (NLP) systems and their potential to surpass human intelligence.\n- One argument is that NLP systems have access to much more stored knowledge than any single human has ever had, making them potentially smarter than humans.\n- However, the definition of \"smart\" and \"intelligence\" remains ambiguous, and some argue that NLP systems are just faster and more scalable than humans, without necessarily being \"smart.\"\n- Concerns over the potential misuse of NLP systems, which can quickly generate vast amounts of misleading or biased information, underscore the need for ethical considerations in their development.\n- While breakthroughs in AI technology are relatively common, researchers note that significant advancements in developing NLP systems that generate new knowledge or validate their own outputs are still unpredictable.",

    "hn_content": "A website known as Prism Break, which is allegedly committed to making mass surveillance of entire populations uneconomical, has come under scrutiny by users on a Hacker News (HN) forum. Users criticised Prism Break for promoting \"silly\" views that technological efforts could defeat large-scale government and corporate online surveillance, emphasising that no\u00a0two known parties on the internet can hide the fact that they are communicating with each other from government-corporate managers of the internet. Many contributors asserted that the only solution for stopping mass surveillance is for the passage of data privacy regulations that would impose criminal penalties for corporations and governments engaging in such activities or retaining customers\u2019 personal data in searchable databases. Others claimed that political and cultural solutions may also provide a way forward.\u00a0\nThe discussion revolves around the power dynamics between governments, corporations, and individuals with respect to data privacy and surveillance. While data privacy laws have been passed, some argue that government entities still have carveouts for their own use. Government surveillance is a main point of such regulations. While corporations use data for more than just selling items, corporations and governments are increasingly working together. The discussion highlights that people with power have been known to cheat, lie and violate laws with no repercussions. Political affiliations have also been shown to influence the enforcement of laws. It is pragmatic for individuals to control who collects their data in order to maintain their privacy.The article discusses the difficulty of achieving privacy in a world where everything is potentially monitored. It suggests the need to assume compromise and find ways to work around it, such as creating digital noise and treating phones as insecure devices. The article also mentions the possibility of generating noise through language models rather than humans to avoid legal issues. Some commenters caution against engaging in illegal activities, even in jest or with no intention of following through. Others suggest using physical methods like paper notebooks or USB drives for sensitive information. There is some discussion about the legal and ethical implications of mass surveillance, as well as the competency of those who conduct it.The post discusses various privacy-focused tools and alternatives to popular platforms, such as Gmail and Dropbox. It includes recommendations for 2FA apps and encourages the use of open-source options like Aegis, rather than closed-source options like Authy. The post also touches on the limitations of current technology and the need for simpler and more transparent devices and software. However, some commenters on the post express skepticism about the efficacy of privacy tools and the accuracy of certain claims. There are links to other lists of alternative tools, and readers can do further research to evaluate the effectiveness of the tools suggested. Overall, the post highlights growing concern about privacy in the tech industry and emphasizes the importance of taking steps to protect personal information.- Tucker Carlson's name was unmasked in NSA intercepts during his attempts to set up an interview with Putin, prompting an investigation into improper surveillance.\n- Community members struggle in adopting non-proprietary and privacy-focused solutions.\n- Replacing centralized tools with privacy-focused ones could limit mass surveillance, but making this shift universal may prove difficult.\n- Pen-and-paper one-time pads can provide almost perfect privacy for communications.\n- While providing recommendations for privacy-focused alternatives, the PrismBreak list lacks clear reasoning for some suggestions.\n- Adopting ethical licenses could prevent software from being used for unethical purposes.People are discussing the role of mass surveillance in society. Some argue that it can help identify criminals or spies, while others argue that it poses a threat to individual privacy and civil liberties. There are concerns about the possibility of abuses of power or the misuse of surveillance technology. Some propose using tactics such as providing false data or using encrypted chats to circumvent surveillance. However, it is also acknowledged that news organizations and journalists are failing to hold those in power accountable, making it difficult to know how those in power will behave if they have to pay a persistent, meaningful cost for surveilling citizens. One article recommends using a Google-free Android phone to prevent surveillance but others argue that this may not be sufficient.",

Krita is available for purchase in various stores, including Microsoft Store, Steam, and Epic, which has helped the project raise funds and attract users who may not otherwise donate. However, Krita's income sources have been disappointing compared to purchases made on stores. A breakdown of funding sources from Krita in 2016 revealed that Steam purchases have made significantly more than donations. The all-caps emphasis on \"FREE\" in marketing Krita may undermine the software's functionality and capabilities. While it is important to consider that Krita's main advantage is its openness and its capability to run on low-performance machines, people should recognize first and foremost its world-class usability.A thread on Hacker News discusses users' experiences with Krita, an open-source digital painting software.

    "hn_content": "JPMorgan Chase Bank has assumed all deposits of First Republic Bank, following its recent failure. The collapse of this bank has raised questions about the stability of the banking industry since the Global Financial Crisis, though some experts suggest that the collapse has so far been relatively orderly. This commentary sparked a debate on Hacker News regarding the value of disorder and whether losses should be absorbed by the general public when banks fail. There were also discussions about inter-generational wealth disparities and ageism. Lastly, there were points made about the reasons for recent inflation spikes and how corporate concentration affects prices and the regulatory landscape surrounding businesses.Inflation is being driven by corporate concentration and failed tax policy, while wage growth is driven by a labor shortage due to the pandemic. Raising interest rates doesn't cause inflation, but it also doesn't fix it when caused by corporate concentration and cartel-like behavior. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and First Republic Bank (FRC) were due to unique circumstances; however, we have set a precedent for future banking crises by bailing out the banks. FDIC will levy a special assessment on member banks to cover the estimated $13 billion cost of SVB's bank failure. The collapse of FRC does not affect the monetary supply; it is determined by bank loans and the Fed buying or selling. There are proposed solutions to keep this type of crisis from happening again, such as banks choosing between illiquid and marked-to-market securities.Multiple smaller banks have failed in recent weeks due to rising interest rates. The situation is reportedly concerning for basic risk management practices within the banking sector. The FDIC has been stepping in to handle the failures, with JPMorgan Chase taking over deposits from one bank. Critics argue that consolidating banks only increases risks while creating opaque behemoths. The duration of bonds in crisis has caused concerns about long-term inflation or future banking system explosions. Regulations may be insufficient to account for unprecedented stimulus and rapid changes in interest rates. Despite multiple bank failures, there is no evidence of contagion spreading to larger banks, but this could be worrisome if trust in regional banks deteriorates.The article discusses the systemic issues with private-public dependency in the banking industry and its impact on shareholder incentives. The banking industry has become heavily subsidized by the government, leading to repeated debasement and access to Fed lending/liquidity tools unavailable to the public. The current trend indicates that in the future, there will only be a few \"too-big-to-fail\" banks left. One possible solution is for the government or Fed to provide a core banking functionality for free, and banks compete based on value-added services. However, this approach raises concerns related to privacy, and government control of personal bank accounts. Additionally, the article touches on the healthcare industry's failures and the need to accept that the capitalist market has failed in this area.Experts discuss the benefits and drawbacks of ensuring everyone has a checking and savings account via a federal or state-owned bank, with some preferring the regulation of private banks to serve unbanked customers. Some commenters express concerns about government access to bank accounts while others highlight the potential societal benefits of universal banking. The discussion also delves into the topic of public healthcare, with some arguing that Americans are unwilling to grapple with the complexities of government-run programs and others pointing to other countries successful implementation of universal healthcare with lower costs. Finally, some propose solutions such as reviving postal banking or increasing interstate competition on services to cut out rent seekers.The conversation discusses the potential for the government or Fed to provide core banking functionality and for traditional banks to compete based on value added. Some alternative options like Chinese state-owned banks and German Bundesbank are also discussed in this context. Narrow banking is suggested as a solution to protect depositors from systemic risks, but the systemic effects need to be considered and thought through in advance. Banks and government are argued to have neglected depositors by offering poor interest rates and exposing them to more risk than necessary. The advent of online banking and digital payments has created value, making it hard for most people to be unbanked or underbanked. The Fed is expected to support such services with FedNow. While the survival of traditional retail banking is deemed important, any profit-driven option will be motivated by increased profit.A discussion on the benefits of using profits to expand a company's balance sheet for greater financial preparedness and stock appeal. BitCoin, and other cryptocurrencies, were created to remove corruption in the finance industry, but critics point out that they have not solved corruption or unfair advantages in the industry. BitCoin's high volatility and lack of stability as a currency make it unsuitable for personal savings accounts or as a checking account substitute. A potential solution may be to create a digital currency stack in layers. Any coin with a fixed supply will be deflationary, making lending difficult. Financial regulation has been increasing over the past 100 years, but some disagree with the implementation of certain regulations.- The complexity of financial regulations makes it difficult to measure their effectiveness.\n- Regulations can create a false sense of security and lead to riskier behavior in highly regulated industries.\n- Recent legislation has exempted certain banks from regulations, potentially contributing to recent bank failures.\n- Narrow banking, where banks only store deposits and do not engage in lending, is currently not allowed in the US due to government and Federal Reserve policies.\n- The Federal Reserve's actions to fix failed banks through indirect money printing could lead to inflation and uncontrollable rates.The article features comments from readers discussing the risks of large corporations and banks, government regulations, lobbying, and bailouts. There are debates on the role of the government in regulating large corporations, the effects of centralization on government interventions and bailouts, and the dangers of aggregating risks in big banks. The article raises concerns about the lack of accountability and transparency in the banking sector. The comments suggest that the government needs to be more cautious and regulators should require banks to be more responsible. The readers discuss how this issue is relevant to the tech industry and the dangers of pooling risks in large companies.The article discusses the risks and downsides of a concentrated banking system, highlighting the potential for lower probabilities of high-impact events, which can lead to mis-pricing of risks and a higher chance of non-earned profits through rent extraction channels. Large banks create de-facto regulatory capture, potentially giving them leverage over rule-makers. There may be subtle benefits, such as excess compensation to retain key talented individuals, but ultimately this pattern doesn't offer benefits beyond the few insiders at the top. The article also discusses the failure of smaller banks and the potential systemic impact on the economy. The solution may not be to create larger banks, but rather to enforce stricter regulatory regimes and diversification requirements.Small banks are more susceptible to government influence compared to larger banks due to limited financial resources. Large banks use their significant legal muscle to fight back against government pressure whereas smaller companies find it simpler to give up. IRS and SEC enforcement actions are harsher on small actors because they tend to break the law in more obvious and stupid ways. Big banks can handle gray areas and not worry about giving in to government pressure due to their legal power. It's essential to regulate banks and limit how they can invest their funds to avoid depreciation of assets and possible failures. Shorting banking stocks of overvalued companies isn't questionably ethical if their analysis shows they're overvalued.",

Others defend the government's interventions, claiming that they prevent mass loss of jobs and assets. \nThe controversy surrounding banks and their role in the economy is highlighted again, with some commenters calling for the abolition of banks and Wall Street.A discussion thread on Hacker News debates the impact of inflation, wage growth, and interest rates on the economy. The concept of neo-Fisherism, which suggests that raising interest rates can cause inflation, is brought up and compared to how it is being implemented in Turkey. The failure of banks like SVB and FRC due to corporate concentration and failed tax policies is also discussed. There is debate over whether raising interest rates can actually fix the problem of inflation, and some argue that the low interest rate period should have been used to build inflation-fighting housing and transit instead. The proposal to allow banks to choose between HTM securities being illiquid and at face value or fluctuating in value is introduced. The collapse of FRC is also discussed and how it differs from the 2008 financial crisis.Several smaller banks are failing due to the rise in interest rates, which highlights a concerning lapse in bank risk management.\n\nThe solution of creating even larger banking behemoths may not be effective, as it commingles all sorts of risks in an opaque system.\n\nThe FDIC is providing JPMorgan with a significant term loan, taking risk and assuming damage in the case of failure.\n\nThe frequency of bank failures is potentially more concerning than their sizes, which often come in waves.\n\nBank executives may lose everything when a bank is shut down by the FDIC, but depositors have not been wiped out due to new rules being created on-the-fly.\n\nThere is a risk of entrenched inflation for a decade or more, which could lead to an explosion of the banking system or both.A discussion on the flaws of the private-public dependency of the banking system and how it incentivizes short-termism. The banking industry has created perverse incentives, with banks directing profits towards their own bonuses rather than expandingbalance sheets or returning those profits to shareholders. The trend indicates that there will be a handful of TBTF banks, and so should there be a system where governments or the Fed provide the core functionality of central banking, and let banks compete based on value-added, with the least-worst outcome. Although the idea of governments controlling our bank accounts raises privacy concerns, The US government already regularly collects information on its citizens. Americans seem willing to pay more to their private businesses instead of a government, even regarding excessive fees for healthcare. However, they might consider their options for disintermediation.Experts discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of establishing a Bank of the United States to solve the \"unbanked crisis\" in the US. Some argue that there is a societal benefit to ensuring everyone has a checking and savings account, while others suggest that a simple regulation requiring private banks to service these customers could suffice. There are concerns about the government having direct access to and control over citizens' bank accounts, as well as the need to rework the financial system from the ground up to switch from fractional reserve to narrow banking or public accounts at the Fed. Narrow banking may also mean the end of commercial checking and require finding non-bank providers of all the asset-side services that banks currently provide. In addition, there is skepticism around the public's willingness to accept government-run healthcare and banking services due to propaganda and a narrow view of the world.The article is a discussion thread on Hacker News about a potential shift from fractional reserve banking to narrow banking. Narrow banking is a system where accounts hold money at the Federal Reserve, which would reduce risk but limit deposits and loans. Some commenters see benefits to this approach, while others urge caution and point out potential complications. Recent banking failures, the success of cryptocurrency, and the possibility of a digital euro have also entered the conversation.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were created to remove corruption and unfair advantages from the finance industry. However, critics argue that crypto is a mess of scammers and criminals and is not a viable replacement for traditional banking. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may serve as a long-term store of value, its volatile price and problematic storage methods make it unsuitable for laypeople's savings accounts. Moreover, any adoption of cryptocurrencies in banking must address the issues of fraud and collapses that wildcat banks experienced. While regulation in the finance industry has trended higher over the past century, it may not be enough to prevent banks from destroying themselves, as recent history has shown. Ultimately, rather than looking to cryptocurrencies, there is a need to level the playing field in the finance industry and have better implementation of banking regulations.- Regulations in the financial industry can lead to a false sense of security, with investors assuming any failures will be bailed out.\n- The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act exempted smaller banks from most of the Dodd-Frank regulations, which may have contributed to recent bank failures.\n- Narrow banking, where deposits are not lent out, is not allowed in the US due to government regulations.\n- The Fed's actions in trying to fix failed banks through indirect money printing may lead to inflation and loss of control over interest rates.\n- Custodia Bank in Wyoming is attempting to offer a narrow banking option, but the Fed is trying to stop them.Commenters discuss the dangers of big banks and the need for diversification. They argue that the concentration of power and risk in a few giant banks is a terrible idea for stability and competition. Some suggest that banks should be more cautious, while others call for fewer government interventions and more accountability. There is also debate regarding the moral appeal of letting banks fail versus bailing them out. The issue of too-big-to-fail banks remains a contentious topic in the industry, with some suggesting that systemic risk creates conditions for a catastrophic failure.The concentration of power within the financial sector is leading to \"non-earned profit\" and excess compensation. Gigantic firms can offer higher caps to talented persons, which suppresses other actors. Such concentration is harmful since Gigantism creates de-facto regulatory capture, leading to a further risk-less profit. Though smaller banks support risk management, they are subject to a far lighter regulatory regime. Low-probability-high-impact events that are mispriced can turn out to be a \"rent extraction channel,\" and non-earned profit would become another source of distortion in the market. Society's ignorance is why concentration is occurring in the first place. Smaller banks are not riskier by nature, and they passed a law that allowed them to get riskier. Consequently, they got a reputation for riskiness, making them riskier. The FDIC and Fed encourage inadequate investment of money by banks. The consolidation of the industry into a few megabanks with the \"systemically important\" designation makes small banks dangerous, creating a public-private partnership with effective censorship of government-disapproved entities by severing them from the banking system.Smaller banks are more susceptible to government influence as they can't afford to fight back with expensive lawyers.\nMoney is an excellent proxy for legal muscle in enforcing rights in court.\nLarge companies exploit loopholes and gray areas in the law instead of breaking the law in obvious ways.\nBig banks can effectively fight back against government pressure on gray areas, unlike smaller companies.\nRegulation and stringent reporting can fix the ongoing smaller bank failures caused by the rise in interest rates.\nShorting overvalued bank stocks is ethical if analyzed correctly.",

This book back-references its appendix with grey underlines thus signaling that something has a technical definition and is jargon.For instance, \"loss\" is really common English. In ML it's a loss function. You can clearly see it's a special word in this world in the text. Other examples include weights, capacity and channel.I don't have to sit there confused trying to guess which English words are being used in special ways.This discipline is fantastic. In some texts, such terms might be italicized but that behavior has seem to fallen out of practice.As someone who isn't a professional mathematician, hints like these help greatly.replyrwoerz 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]I fully agree with your general critique. It is a common bad habit in science to use common words with an uncommon meaning without any explanation. I remember me sitting in a lecture about cryptology and wondering how that \"I can prove to know a SECRET without revealing it\" is supposed to work. I just did not realize that SECRET just meant \"random-looking string\" instead of something like \"I know where the money is hidden\".replychaxor 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]If it's a map to the hidden treasure (as in the exact bits of the image of the map) then it's kind of the same thing right?

It does not surprise me to see that his books are of very high quality !The course was focusing on all of the mathematical aspects of Deep Learning, starting from the simple understanding of the gradient descent algorithm to (trying to) understand how transformers work. There was also quite a lot of computer science involved and lots of practical assignments. One of the 2 projects of this course was to design from scratch in Python or C++ a DNN framework (roughly an API like pytorch or tensorflow) which required to really think properly about which architecture to use for your code. The minimum requirements only asked to implements a few activation, normal layers and convolutional layers but you go beyond that and implements all kind of layers. Lots of fun.

Fox \u201cdeeply moved by breakthrough,\u201d \u201cmaking a cure for Parkinson\u2019s inevitable\u201dNEW YORK (April 12, 2023) \u2014 A landmark paper published today in The Lancet Neurology journal by leaders of the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), the gold-standard Parkinson\u2019s biomarker study sponsored by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF), confirms the most significant breakthrough yet in the search for a Parkinson\u2019s biomarker: a biological test for Parkinson\u2019s disease that demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy, differentiates molecular subtypes and detects disease in individuals before cardinal movement symptoms arise.The new test, known as the alpha-synuclein seed amplification assay (\u03b1Syn-SAA), heralds the revolutionary ability for research to define Parkinson\u2019s disease biologically, offering a critical tool for clinical trial design and assessment of treatment effects, and for early detection of disease pathology.As authors from PPMI detail in The Lancet Neurology, the test detects synuclein pathology, one of the two biological hallmarks of Parkinson\u2019s disease (alongside dopaminergic transport dysfunction, which can be visualized using DaTScan). As a result, for the first time since James Parkinson first characterized the disorder in 1817, researchers and clinicians can use biology (vs. clinical assessments and patient-reported outcomes) to identify, define and monitor Parkinson\u2019s objectively, based on cellular pathology in the living body.\u201cValidation of this biomarker launches a new, biological era in Parkinson\u2019s research,\u201d said Kenneth Marek, MD, PPMI Principal Investigator and president and senior scientist at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders. \u201cUsing \u03b1Syn-SAA, we are already unlocking new understanding of Parkinson\u2019s, which will transform every aspect of drug development and ultimately clinical care. We will rapidly be in a position to test new therapies in the right populations, target the right therapy to the right patient at the right time, and launch studies of agents with potential to prevent Parkinson\u2019s disease altogether. This is what PPMI was built to do, and we are especially grateful to the thousands of study participants whose contributions have enabled this watershed moment.\u201d The paper, co-led by Andrew Siderowf, MD, PPMI Investigator and Director, Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Center at the University of Pennsylvania and Luis Concha, PhD, Director, Research and Development at Amprion, outlines \u03b1Syn-SAA results from more than 1,100 PPMI participants including individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease, those with genetic and/or clinical risk factors but not diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, and control volunteers. The large-scale analysis in PPMI confirms previous reports \u2014 including from MJFF-funded work \u2014 that \u03b1Syn-SAA can distinguish Parkinson\u2019s from control volunteers with a stunningly robust sensitivity of 88 percent and specificity of 96 percent.As an objective and reliable biomarker of Parkinson\u2019s biology, \u03b1Syn-SAA will significantly decrease the risk for industry to invest in the development of potential blockbuster therapies, including preventive agents, and increase the speed and efficiency with which these therapies can be developed, tested and brought to market. With \u03b1Syn-SAA in hand, it will be possible to establish objective endpoints for clinical trials of Parkinson\u2019s treatments, ensure study participants exhibit appropriate pathology, and detect therapy-induced changes in their status. This already is reworking the design of clinical trials and can induce greater pharma and biotech investment in the space \u2014 creating more \u201cshots on goal\u201d to benefit people at every stage of disease.Subtypes of Parkinson\u2019s Biology Linked to Genetic and Clinical FactorsThe authors reported findings related to olfactory deficit, or smell loss (enduring and significant smell loss is a common symptom of Parkinson\u2019s often seen years before a diagnosis) and to carrying a mutation in the Parkinson\u2019s-associated LRRK2 gene:The assay accurately diagnosed disease in 99 percent (274 of 278) of people with smell loss and sporadic Parkinson\u2019s (without a known causal genetic mutation).The proportion of positive results was lower in people with Parkinson\u2019s and a LRRK2 mutation [68 percent (83 of 123)].Positive results also were lower in people with sporadic Parkinson\u2019s without olfactory deficit (78 percent).People with Parkinson\u2019s, a LRRK2 mutation and normal smell ability were even less likely to show positive assay results. This was particularly true among females; only 12.5 percent of females in this population (three of 24) showed synuclein pathology on the test.In people with Parkinson\u2019s enrolled in PPMI who consented to post-mortem examination and who have passed since joining the study, all those with positive assay results (14) showed typical alpha-synuclein aggregation pathology in brain cells; the single such PD participant who did not show positive assay results was a LRRK2 mutation carrier with preserved olfaction.These results suggest that not all cases of clinical Parkinson\u2019s symptoms are associated with the accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates as detected by this assay, and that LRRK2 variant carriers, in particular, may not show this pathology. This insight opens new avenues of investigation toward treatments to benefit more people with PD. It also will enable deeper studies of the cellular pathways and cascades occurring in LRRK2-associated Parkinson\u2019s, some of which may be protective against synuclein dysfunction and Parkinson\u2019s toxicity. This could lead to breakthroughs to benefit everyone with Parkinson\u2019s, not just those who carry a genetic mutation. (Three therapies targeting dysfunction in the LRRK2 pathway are currently in clinical trials.) New Evidence that Biological Changes in Synuclein Predate Both Symptoms and Dopamine Dysfunction, Setting Stage for First Prevention TrialsThe \u03b1Syn-SAA also has been validated in individuals enrolled in PPMI who have not been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s, but are age 60 or older and living with increased relative risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s due to genetic mutations, smell loss, or diagnosed REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). (RBD is a sleep disorder of acting out dreams by hitting, punching or kicking, and is tied to significant risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s or a similar neurodegenerative disease.) PPMI reopened enrollment in 2020 and is building a longitudinal cohort of 2000 such at-risk individuals.Most people with olfactory deficit [88 percent (16 of 18)] or RBD [84 percent (28 of 33)] showed positive assay results.The authors also compared results to dopamine transporter (DAT) brain imaging scans, a tool for assessing dopamine transporter system dysfunction and thereby Parkinson\u2019s pathology, including in at-risk individuals. Only about 30 percent of at-risk individuals with a positive seed amplification assay result also had significant dopamine loss.This finding suggests that synuclein pathology could be detectable by this assay earlier than dopamine dysfunction is seen with DAT imaging, extending the window in which it may be possible to intervene with preventive therapies.On the other hand, undiagnosed but at-risk carriers of a LRRK2 or GBA mutation (the most common known genetic link to Parkinson\u2019s disease) were less likely to show positive assay results: 8.8 percent (14 of 159) and 7.3 percent (11 of 151) respectively.This finding suggests that RBD and olfactory deficit arise closer to onset of Parkinson\u2019s movement symptoms.It also suggests that alpha-synuclein aggregation in spinal fluid is not a life-long trait but rather acquired as part of a disease biology process that ultimately gives rise to symptoms. By exploiting this understanding to intervene in this process, drugmakers hope to make Parkinson\u2019s a preventable condition.Biomarker Test Available for Diagnostic AssessmentThe \u03b1Syn-SAA was developed when MJFF on-staff neuroscience PhDs approached researchers at University of Texas working on seed amplification assays in Alzheimer\u2019s. The Foundation offered funding to experiment with developing an alpha-synuclein assay using PPMI cerebrospinal fluid samples.The University of Texas team that developed the assay has since launched biotech Amprion, which partnered with PPMI on its analysis of \u03b1Syn-SAA. The company has commercialized the assay as the SYNTap\u00ae test, which is available for order by physicians for people exhibiting symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s or related disorders. When the test is positive, a person likely has Parkinson\u2019s or a related disorder of alpha-synuclein, such as Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). The test, on its own, cannot differentiate between these diseases. It also may not be covered by insurance. But, in conjunction with a doctor\u2019s examination, the test might help support a specific diagnosis.\u201cThe Michael J. Fox Foundation has always recognized the indisputable need for biomarkers of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and has relentlessly pursued them as a mission-critical goal,\u201d said Deborah W. Brooks, MJFF\u2019s chief executive officer (and a PPMI control volunteer at the University of Pennsylvania since 2010). \u201cIt would be difficult to overstate the implications of this discovery. With development and scaling, \u03b1Syn-SAA can usher in the era of objectively and biologically defining Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2014 revolutionizing every aspect of research and care.\u201d  Michael J. Fox said: \u201cThere are many ways I am involved with the work of the Foundation, but I come to this result first and foremost as a Parkinson\u2019s patient. I am deeply moved by this breakthrough and endlessly grateful to the researchers, study participants and funders who have endeavored to bring us this far. When we started PPMI, we weren\u2019t casting about for fish \u2014 we were going after a whale. Now, here we are. Together we are making a cure for Parkinson\u2019s inevitable.\u201dPPMI: The Study that\u2019s Changing EverythingMJFF launched the Parkinson\u2019s Progression Markers Initiative (www.ppmi-info.org, michaeljfox.org/ppmi) in 2010 at 18 clinical sites in the United States and Europe with a lead gift from the late Mrs. Lily Safra, a visionary friend, partner, and board member of MJFF. A longitudinal observational study, PPMI has built the most robust dataset and biosample library ever assembled in Parkinson\u2019s research, which is shared with the broader research community in real time for ongoing discovery and validation studies. Today the study has enrolled nearly 2000 participants and is actively enrolling Parkinson\u2019s patients, at-risk individuals and control volunteers at 51 clinical sites around the globe. Study data are downloaded by researchers worldwide for independent studies on average 2200 times a day.With the publication of \u03b1Syn-SAA, The Michael J. Fox Foundation announced that the tagline of the PPMI study will change from \u201cThe Study that Could Change Everything\u201d about how Parkinson\u2019s disease is diagnosed, managed and treated to \u201cThe Study that\u2019s Changing Everything.\u201dMajor funding for PPMI comes from Aligning Science Across Parkinson\u2019s (ASAP) (www.parkinsonsroadmap.org), a coordinated research initiative focused on accelerating the pace of discovery and informing the path to a cure for Parkinson\u2019s disease. ASAP support is enabling the seismic expansion of PPMI to increase recruitment efforts and remote testing for those at-risk for PD as well as expanding assay development efforts to enable breakthroughs such as \u03b1Syn-SAA. This infrastructure provides a ready platform for future discoveries.In addition to Aligning Science across Parkinson\u2019s, PPMI is supported by the Edmond J. Safra Foundation, the Farmer Family Foundation, Connie and Steven Ballmer, and Susan and Riley Bechtel. The study is additionally funded by a consortium of more than 40 biotech and pharmaceutical firms providing financial and in-kind support, and by tens of thousands of individual donors to The Michael J. Fox Foundation.### About The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research (MJFF) As the world's largest nonprofit funder of Parkinson's research, The Michael J.

Fox Foundation is underway to help find early biomarkers.Readers discuss various topics related to Parkinson's disease in this forum, including the difficulty of detecting and curing it, symptoms, potential environmental and genetic causes, and lifestyle factors that may reduce the severity of the disease. Some contributors recommend resources for researching Parkinson's using databases like OMIM and Substack journalism. A few participants raise the idea of genetic testing and/or changing one's lifestyle habits to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's. Finally, a recent study finds that Parkinson's shares biomarkers with long COVID and other neurological diseases, and oxidative stress linked to nutrient deficiency and zinc may contribute to its development.",

    "content": "ABOVE:\u00a9 ISTOCK.COM, SEFA OZELRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune condition that affects millions of people across the globe (1). The ultimate cause of RA is largely mysterious. While researchers have long suspected that the microbiome influenced development of the disease, the specific microbe (or microbes) has eluded identification.Now, in a recent Science Translational Medicine paper, researchers reported a strain of Subdoligranulum bacteria that may drive RA development (2). Some people at risk for the disease have antibodies against this bacteria, and Subdoligranulum activation of T cells was more prevalent in people with RA than in healthy controls. Perhaps even more intriguingly, mice given this bacterium developed a condition similar to human RA.Identifying this bacterium was no simple task. First, the research team, a collaboration between scientists at the University of Colorado, Stanford University, and the Benaroya Research Institute, screened blood donated by people at risk for RA or with early-stage RA for RA-related autoantibodies.Then researchers tested whether any of these autoantibodies also targeted human intestinal bacteria. They mixed the antibodies with bacteria from stool samples donated by healthy people and people with RA. They then sequenced the bacterial species to which the autoantibodies attached. These RA antibodies cross-reacted with many species of bacteria, largely from Lachnospiraceae or Ruminococcaceae, two closely related families.To study these species in more detail, researchers cultured bacteria from the stool of an individual who had high levels of these two bacterial families present. Two types of Subdoligranulum bacteria, which they called isolates 1 and 7, emerged as potential candidates for driving RA development. Compared to isolate 1, isolate 7 was a more potent activator of T cells in blood from RA patients.The reason I think this line of research is particularly exciting is that it could very well get at an actual beginning of the disease. - Rabi Upadhyay, NYU Grossman School of MedicineTo find out if isolate 7 bacteria actually caused disease, scientists fed the bacteria to mice. Kristine Kuhn, a study coauthor and rheumatologist at the University of Colorado, said that she didn\u2019t expect anything to happen when the team gave the mice the bacteria without another agent to disturb the immune system.\u201cWe thought we were going to have to rev their immune systems up with an adjuvant or something,\u201d said Kuhn. \u201cMeagan [Chriswell, another author] was monitoring the mice, making sure that they had stable colonization. After a couple of weeks \u2014 I happened to be out of town \u2014 she called me up and she said, \u2018Kristine, you'll never believe this, but the mice are getting swollen paws.\u201d This is similar to the swollen hand and finger joints experienced by people with RA.While other bacteria have previously been associated with human RA, Subdoligranulum is so far unique in its ability to cause RA-like symptoms in mice without the addition of another immune insult (3).The similarities between the mice and human RA patients extended beyond what could be seen with the naked eye. \u201cThere were antibodies getting into the joints, much like we see in rheumatoid arthritis,\u201d said Kuhn. \u201cSo, we started to profile the antibodies that were in the serum of the mice and we found that a lot of those antibodies targeted the same proteins that are targeted in rheumatoid arthritis.\u201dRabi Upadhyay, a medical oncologist who studies the microbiome, immunity, and cancer at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and was not involved in this work, said that while this study convincingly demonstrated that this species could produce an RA-like condition in mice, it may be too soon to pin all the blame on Subdoligranulum alone, since the study didn\u2019t necessarily rule out other species.\u201cIt's hard to know how big of a player this specific isolate is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be the dominant player, and that's why they came across it first. But it could be that if they went back and did larger screens, that they would come up with more \u2014 that [Subdoligranulum] would be just one of many.\u201dIn keeping with this, the researchers only found this Subdoligranulum strain in 16.7 percent of people at risk or with early-stage RA, indicating that this strain is likely not the sole driver of disease.Nevertheless, Upadhyay said that it\u2019s still an exciting study. Currently, there are no therapies that can prevent or cure the disease, and the immunosuppressant treatments that alleviate symptoms can have dangerous side effects.\u201cThe reason I think this line of research is particularly exciting is that it could very well get at an actual beginning of the disease, so that we could design therapeutics to perturb the colonization of bacteria\u2026 to see whether you can prevent a percentage of disease prevalence by getting rid of colonization. And that would totally change the types of therapies that a rheumatologist could use.\u201dReferencesCross, M. et al.

The bacterium belongs to the family Veillonellaceae. The team found signs of specific T-cell activation in secondary lymphoid organs in mice exposed to subdoligranulum, indicating RA could be a bacterial disease. Antibiotics have been shown to alleviate symptoms, but further research is needed to determine if a causal link exists between subdoligranulum and RA. The study has also reignited the possibility of there being a microbe-like cause for various chronic diseases. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can mirror RA, and existing research presents contradictory findings on the association between ankylosing spondylitis and klebsiella pneumoniae.The article discusses the idea that Streptococcus bacteria can trigger autoimmune diseases like rheumatic fever. While there is no test for this, there is a subclinical infection, and research suggests that bacterial infections can trigger autoimmunity and can hide in biofilms. There is no specific treatment, but probiotics, vitamin D supplementation, and lifestyle changes like diet and exercise can improve symptoms. There is also discussion about the link between gut bacteria and various autoimmune diseases, including Crohn's disease and uveitis. Finally, there is hope that phage therapy can be developed for these conditions.A discussion on the effectiveness of various treatments for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) revealed anecdotal evidence of improvement through diet changes, antibiotics, and probiotics. Some users have experienced improvement in joint pain or mood after taking antibiotics, while others have found relief through collagen peptides, a low inflammation diet, or cannabis use. The discussion also highlighted controversial treatments like prescribing antibiotics based on detected bacteria, and the high cost of medication like Humira for RA. The exchange underscores the importance of the gut biome and its potential impact on overall health. However, more research is needed to verify these anecdotal experiences and turn them into medically approved treatments.A study found a possible link between a bacterium called Subdoligranulum and early-stage rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Participants with early-stage RA had a higher abundance of the bacterium. However, researchers did not find the bacterium in all participants with early RA, suggesting it may not be the sole driver of the disease. People with autoimmune diseases like RA reported feeling better when they had the flu, indicating the possibility of viral triggers. Synthetic Biologics is in Phase 2b with a medication that looks promising as a cleaner alternative to JAK inhibitors without a need for injections. Ra and autoimmune diseases often improve when treated with antibiotics. However, this is still controversial and needs more research. Electrical current or strong fields exposure might trigger inflammation.",

Image: GettyGeoffrey Hinton, who alongside two other so-called \u201cGodfathers of AI\u201d won the 2018 Turing Award for their foundational work that led to the current boom in artificial intelligence, now says a part of him regrets his life\u2019s work. Hinton recently quit his job at Google in order to speak freely about the risks of AI, according to an interview with the 75-year-old in The New York Times.\u201cI console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn\u2019t done it, somebody else would have,\u201d said Hinton, who had been employed by Google for more than a decade. \u201cIt is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.\u201dHinton notified Google of his resignation last month, and on Thursday talked to CEO Sundar Pichai directly, according to the NYT. Details of that discussion were not disclosed.It\u2019s this work that ultimately led to the creation of ChatGPT and Google Bard.The life-long academic joined Google after it acquired a company started by Hinton and two of his students, one of whom went on to become chief scientist at OpenAI. Hinton and his students had developed a neural network that taught itself to identify common objects like dogs, cats, and flowers after analyzing thousands of photos.

From what I saw, it's just reporting on the NYT report.replyetiam 11 hours ago | root | parent [\u2013]Metz / NYT: In 2012, Dr. Hinton and two of his graduate students at the University of Toronto created technology that became the intellectual foundation for the A.I. systems that the tech industry\u2019s biggest companies believe is a key to their future.It's questionable to place that whole development in 2012, as much as the combination of accumulated learnings and introduction of Dropout regularization pushed benchmarks and grabbed attention and economical investment. Omitted from Ricker / the Verge, which instead discusses the foundational work without a specific timepoint and includes also at least the work by the other two Turing prize winners.Dr. Hinton said he has quit his job at Google, where he has worked for more than a decade and became one of the most respected voices in the field, so he can freely speak out about the risks of A.I.Hinton was 'one of the most respected voices in the field' for decades before taking employment at Google. This excerpt also contains the first of several insinuations that would seem be the reason for Hinton's rebuttal which has been pointed out at https://twitter.com/geoffreyhinton/status/165299357072121037... Note in particular:Until last year, he said, Google acted as a \u201cproper steward\u201d for the technology, careful not to release something that might cause harm. But now that Microsoft has augmented its Bing search engine with a chatbot \u2014 challenging Google\u2019s core business \u2014 Google is racing to deploy the same kind of technology. The tech giants are locked in a competition that might be impossible to stop, Dr. Hinton said.But I must admit, in a rereading with some emphasis on analysis, I actually see far fewer strictly, explicitly wrong statements than I had impression of at first. I still feel it misuses loaded language and arrangement to paint a picture of accusations and degrees of angst and doom which I have bit of a hard time believing. So maybe my preference for Ricker's version is mainly due to that style difference. It does make one of the overinterpretations I'd argue Metz invites, inAccording to the NYT interview, Hinton was happy with Google\u2019s stewardship of the technology until Microsoft launched the new OpenAI-infused Bing, challenging Google\u2019s core business and sparking a \u201ccode red\u201d response inside the search giant. Such fierce competition might be impossible to stop, Hinton says, resulting in a world with so much fake imagery and text that nobody will be able to tell \u201cwhat is true anymore.\u201dBut on the other hand it has been amended to include Hinton's clarifying statement right after that, which is more than could be said for the NYT piece.replydang 11 hours ago | root | parent [\u2013]The discussion of the NYT piece includes Hinton's twitter comments.I think that's a good way to do it: post the original article, then include additional relevant information in the thread. This is better than rewarding articles that are mostly copying someone else's work.replyetiam 10 hours ago | root | parent [\u2013]Everything else equal, I agree. In this case I think that also ends up rewarding manufacture of drama and controversy though, and punishing a more truthful and neutral reporting of the same event through the merging and removing of the secondary source.I'm not going to try to convince you to revert it, but I note that the discussion under the NYT post contains a fair bit of vitriolic and confused commentary, which is less surprising when the target post itself works to conjure up e.g. emotionally charged parallels to the Manhattan project.You'll be a better judge than I whether this thread would have devolved in a similar way, but personally I feel that the original article in this case also has significant poor qualities to be the chosen reporting on the event.replyApplications are open for YC Summer 2023Guidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | ContactSearch:",

    "hn_content": "The German government has introduced a new public transit ticketing system, replacing the fragmented previous system, where each region had its own ticketing system. The new system allows riders to buy one monthly ticket and ride on local transit anywhere in Germany, without worrying about different ticketing systems and complicated rules. The new monthly ticket costs half the price of the typical monthly transit ticket. However, the on-time performance of transit in the country is still problematic after years of neglected maintenance. The discussion also touches upon the electronic ticket systems used in other parts of the world, such as the SF Bay Area's Clipper card and London's Oyster-derived system.The article contains a discussion among commenters about public transportation payment methods and their ease of use for tourists. The commenters mention various systems and challenges, such as the inconvenience of paper tickets, difficulty or confusion in accessing payment options, and the need to do research in advance. Some regions have implemented contactless payment options and universal compatibility, but many places still rely on traditional payment methods. There is a suggestion for a \"tourist day pass,\" allowing unlimited travel for a set period, and some debate about the value of such a pass versus paying per use. Some commenters also touch on related issues such as concealed carry reciprocity between states.German cities have complicated and expensive transit systems, leading to confusion for both locals and tourists. Berlin's transit system requires different tickets for different zones but is still comparatively simple and cheap. Some visitors have fallen for tourist scams in London where day passes only last for 24 hours from the time of purchase. German transit companies offer numerous regional ticketing systems that can complicate travel for commuters. A new national monthly ticket for local transit in Germany simplifies ticketing systems for those who regularly use public transit and saves money for many. RFID passes in Taiwan allow for easy entry and exit, with riders only paying for the exact distance that they travel. Some people are critical of the lack of a unified transit app in Germany, as installing a new app for every city can be a hassle for travelers.Discussions about the quality and pricing of public transportation in Germany appear in the comments section. Some commenters argue that public transit should be publicly owned and a true public good accessible to everyone. Others point out the challenges of providing service in rural areas and emphasize the importance of investing in infrastructure and avoiding overburdening taxpayers. Some mention their positive experiences with public transport in Germany and compare it to other countries. Commendations are made about recent initiatives aimed at making public transit more affordable such as subsidized tickets and monthly passes. Overall, the comments reveal varying perspectives on public transit in Germany and highlight the need for sustained investment to address issues such as quality, affordability, and access.The topic of discussion is teenagers being required to work mandatory unpaid jobs for the government in healthcare or social services for 9 months per year in Austria. One commentator questions the necessity of this, and another argues that it is a false dichotomy and that the government could instead hire more professional workers with revenue from increased societal productivity. The original commentator defends the system, citing government figures and claims that suggest the healthcare and social service systems in Austria would not be able to function without the work of teenagers. The legal and ethical implications of mandating young people to work jobs not of their own choosing and competency are also mentioned in the thread, as well as comparisons to other countries that have mandatory military conscription.The post discusses the compulsory \"civil service\" system in Austria and Germany, where 17-19-year-olds are required to do 9 months of unpaid work in the healthcare and social service sectors instead of military conscription. The system is considered successful and provides practical life skills and personal benefits to the volunteers. However, some question the delay it causes for young adults to enter the job market, as they start university a year later. The public transport system in Germany is also criticized for its complexity and underfunding. The discussion includes personal experiences and opinions on the matter.The post is a discussion about public transportation, its funding, and its classification as a public good. Opinions differ on the best way to fund and provide public transportation, with some arguing for more government subsidies and others for private ownership. There is also discussion of the effectiveness of public transportation in different countries and regions. Some argue that public transportation is a public good due to its benefits for businesses and the reduction of externalities, while others disagree and see it as only benefiting individual travelers. The conversation also touches on the environmental impact of transportation and the need for sustainable options. Overall, the post provides insight into the diverse perspectives on public transportation and its role in modern society.The rise in railway traffic in the UK is a general proxy for economic health, and it has been in decline since the end of World War II, despite brief rebounds. The decline began around WWI, which marked the beginning of the decline of the British Empire. Rail traffic began to rise in the mid-90s following privatization, despite high prices, low satisfaction, and poor reliability. Network Rail manages the infrastructure, while the trains themselves are privately owned. Public transport systems may be owned by local, regional, and national bodies. Public ownership and good organization can be two very different things, as seen in some European countries. People who can't afford tickets may receive special prices such as in some German towns where kids from low-income families travel free. \u00a0The article discusses the inefficiencies of systems for fare collection and enforcement in public transit systems, and suggests that the costs of these systems could be eliminated and replaced with taxes to improve the transit experience. Commenters discuss different models for fare collection in their own countries, including systems without barriers or proof-of-payment requirements. Some express skepticism about the feasibility of such systems in larger cities, while others suggest that inspectors could be replaced with automated algorithms or other methods of monitoring compliance. Overall, the article highlights the potential for innovative solutions to improve public transit access and affordability.",
