This is the story of how we discovered that the answer could be your root password!IntroductionAll x86-64 CPUs have a set of 128-bit vector registers called the XMM registers. You can never have enough bits, so recent CPUs have extended the width of those registers up to 256-bit and even 512-bits.The 256-bit extended registers are called YMM, and the 512-bit registers are ZMM.These big registers are useful in lots of situations, not just number crunching! They\u2019re even used by standard C library functions, like strcmp, memcpy, strlen and so on.Let\u2019s take a look at an example. Here are the first few instructions of glibc\u2019s AVX2 optimized strlen:(gdb) x/20i __strlen_avx2...  <__strlen_avx2+9>:  vpxor xmm0,xmm0,xmm0...  <__strlen_avx2+29>: vpcmpeqb ymm1,ymm0,YMMWORD PTR [rdi]  <__strlen_avx2+33>: vpmovmskb eax,ymm1...  <__strlen_avx2+41>: tzcnt eax,eax  <__strlen_avx2+45>: vzeroupper  <__strlen_avx2+48>: retThe full routine is complicated and handles lots of cases, but let\u2019s step through this simple case. Bear with me, I promise there\u2019s a point!The first step is to initialize ymm0 to zero, which is done by just xoring xmm0 with itself1.  > vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0   vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]   vpmovmskb eax, ymm1   tzcnt eax, eax   vzeroupperHere rdi contains a pointer to our string, so vpcmpeqb will check which bytes in ymm0 match our string, and stores the result in ymm1.As we\u2019ve already set ymm0 to all zero bytes, only nul bytes will match.   vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0  > vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]   vpmovmskb eax, ymm1   tzcnt eax, eax   vzeroupperNow we can extract the result into a general purpose register like eax with vpmovmskb.Any nul byte will create a 1 bit, and any other value will create a 0 bit.   vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0   vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]  > vpmovmskb eax, ymm1   tzcnt eax, eax   vzeroupperFinding the first zero byte is now just a case of counting the number of trailing zero bits.That\u2019s a common enough operation that there\u2019s an instruction for it - tzcnt (Trailing Zero Count).   vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0   vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]   vpmovmskb eax, ymm1  > tzcnt eax, eax   vzeroupperNow we have the position of the first nul byte, in just four machine instructions!You can probably imagine just how often strlen is running on your system right now, but suffice to say, bits and bytes are flowing into these vector registers from all over your system constantly.Zeroing RegistersYou might have noticed that I missed one instruction, and that\u2019s vzeroupper.   vpxor xmm0, xmm0, xmm0   vpcmpeqb ymm1, ymm0, [rdi]   vpmovmskb eax, ymm1   tzcnt eax, eax  > vzeroupperYou guessed it, vzeroupper will zero the upper bits of the vector registers.The reason we do this is because if you mix XMM and YMM registers, the XMM registers automatically get promoted to full width. It\u2019s a bit like integer promotion in C.This works fine, but superscalar processors need to track dependencies so that they know which operations can be parallelized. This promotion adds a dependency on those upper bits, and that causes unnecessary stalls while the processor waits for results it didn\u2019t really need.These stalls are what glibc is trying to avoid with vzeroupper. Now any future results won\u2019t depend on what those bits are, so we safely avoid that bottleneck!The Vector Register FileNow that we know what vzeroupper does, how does it do it?Your processor doesn\u2019t have a single physical location where each register lives, it has what\u2019s called a Register File and a Register Allocation Table. This is a bit like managing the heap with malloc and free, if you think of each register as a pointer. The RAT keeps track of what space in the register file is assigned to which register.In fact, when you zero an XMM register, the processor doesn\u2019t store those bits anywhere at all - it just sets a flag called the z-bit in the RAT. This flag can be applied to the upper and lower parts of YMM registers independently, so vzeroupper can simply set the z-bit and then release any resources assigned to it in the register file.A register allocation table (left) and a physical register file (right).SpeculationHold on, there\u2019s another complication! Modern processors use speculative execution, so sometimes operations have to be rolled back.What should happen if the processor speculatively executed a vzeroupper, but then discovers that there was a branch misprediction? Well, we will have to revert that operation and put things back the way they were\u2026 maybe we can just unset that z-bit?If we return to the analogy of malloc and free, you can see that it can\u2019t be that simple - that would be like calling free() on a pointer, and then changing your mind!That would be a use-after-free vulnerability, but there is no such thing as a use-after-free in a CPU\u2026 or is there?Spoiler: yes there is \ud83d\ude42This animation shows why resetting the z-bit is not sufficient.VulnerabilityIt turns out that with precise scheduling, you can cause some processors to recover from a mispredicted vzeroupper incorrectly!This technique is CVE-2023-20593 and it works on all Zen 2 class processors, which includes at least the following products:AMD Ryzen 3000 Series ProcessorsAMD Ryzen PRO 3000 Series ProcessorsAMD Ryzen Threadripper 3000 Series ProcessorsAMD Ryzen 4000 Series Processors with Radeon GraphicsAMD Ryzen PRO 4000 Series ProcessorsAMD Ryzen 5000 Series Processors with Radeon GraphicsAMD Ryzen 7020 Series Processors with Radeon GraphicsAMD EPYC \u201cRome\u201d ProcessorsThe bug works like this, first of all you need to trigger something called the XMM Register Merge Optimization2, followed by a register rename and a mispredicted vzeroupper. This all has to happen within a precise window to work.We now know that basic operations like strlen, memcpy and strcmp will use the vector registers - so we can effectively spy on those operations happening anywhere on the system! It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re happening in other virtual machines, sandboxes, containers, processes, whatever!This works because the register file is shared by everything on the same physical core. In fact, two hyperthreads even share the same physical register file.Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s write an exploit \ud83d\ude42ExploitationThere are quite a few ways to trigger this, but let\u2019s examine a very simple example.  vcvtsi2s{s,d}  xmm, xmm, r64  vmovdqa     ymm, ymm  jcc       overzero  vzeroupperoverzero:  nopHere cvtsi2sd is used to trigger the merge optimization. It\u2019s not important what cvtsi2sd is supposed to do, I\u2019m just using it because it\u2019s one of the instructions the manual says use that optimization3.Then we need to trigger a register rename, vmovdqa will work. If the conditional branch4 is taken but the CPU predicts the not-taken path, the vzeroupper will be mispredicted and the bug occurs!OptimizationIt turns out that mispredicting on purpose is difficult to optimize! It took a bit of work, but I found a variant that can leak about 30 kb per core, per second.This is fast enough to monitor encryption keys and passwords as users login!We\u2019re releasing our full technical advisory, along with all the associated code today. Full details will be available in our security research repository.If you want to test the exploit, the code is available here.Note that the code is for Linux, but the bug is not dependent on any particular operating system - all operating systems are affected!DiscoveryI found this bug by fuzzing, big surprise \ud83d\ude42 I\u2019m not the first person to apply fuzzing techniques to finding hardware flaws. In fact, vendors fuzz their own products extensively - the industry term for it is Post-Silicon Validation.So how come this bug wasn\u2019t found earlier? I think I did a couple of things differently, perhaps with a new perspective as I don\u2019t have an EE background!FeedbackThe best performing fuzzers are guided by coverage feedback. The problem is that there is nothing really analogous to code coverage in CPUs\u2026 However, we do have performance counters!These will let us know when all kinds of interesting architectural events happen.Feeding this data to the fuzzer lets us gently guide it towards exploring interesting features that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to find by chance alone!It was challenging to get the details right, but I used this to teach my fuzzer to find interesting instruction sequences. This allowed me to discover features like merge optimization automatically, without any input from me!OracleWhen we fuzz software, we\u2019re usually looking for crashes. Software isn\u2019t supposed to crash, so we know something must have gone wrong if it does.How can we know if a a CPU is executing a randomly generated program correctly? It might be completely correct for it to crash!Well, a few solutions have been proposed to this problem. One approach is called reversi. The general idea is that for every random instruction you generate, you also generate the inverse (e.g. ADD r1, r2 \u2192 SUB r1, r2). Any deviation from the initial state at the end of execution must have been an error, neat!The reversi approach is clever, but it makes generating testcases very complicated for a CISC architecture like x86.A simpler solution is to use an oracle. An oracle is just another CPU or a simulator that we can use to check the result. If we compare the results from our test CPU to our oracle CPU, any mismatch would suggest that something went wrong.I developed a new approach with a combination of these two ideas, I call it Oracle Serialization.Oracle SerializationAs developers we monitor the macro-architectural state, that\u2019s just things like register values. There is also the micro-architectural state which is mostly invisible to us, like the branch predictor, out-of-order execution state and the instruction pipeline.Serialization lets us have some control over that, by instructing the CPU to reset instruction-level parallelism. This includes things like store/load barriers, speculation fences, cache line flushes, and so on.The idea of a Serialized Oracle is to generate a random program, then automatically transform it into a serialized form.A randomly generated sequence of instructions, and the same sequence but with randomized alignment, serialization and speculation fences added.movnti [rbp+0x0],ebx movnti [rbp+0x0],ebxsfencercr dh,1 rcr dh,1lfencesub r10, rax sub r10, raxmfencerol rbx, cl rol rbx, clnopxor edi,[rbp-0x57] xor edi,[rbp-0x57]These two program might have very different performance characteristics, but they should produce identical output. The serialized form can now be my oracle!If the final states don\u2019t match, then there must have been some error in how they were executed micro-architecturally - that could indicate a bug.This is exactly how we first discovered this vulnerability, the output of the serialized oracle didn\u2019t match!SolutionWe reported this vulnerability to AMD on the 15th May 2023.AMD have released an microcode update for affected processors. Your BIOS or Operating System vendor may already have an update available that includes it.WorkaroundIt is highly recommended to use the microcode update.If you can\u2019t apply the update for some reason, there is a software workaround: you can set the chicken bit DE_CFG[9].This may have some performance cost.LinuxYou can use msr-tools to set the chicken bit on all cores, like this:# wrmsr -a 0xc0011029 $(($(rdmsr -c 0xc0011029) | (1<<9)))FreeBSDOn FreeBSD you would use cpucontrol(8).OthersIf you\u2019re using some other operating system and don\u2019t know how to set MSRs, ask your vendor for assistance.Note that it is not sufficient to disable SMT.DetectionI am not aware of any reliable techniques to detect exploitation. This is because no special system calls or privileges are required.It is definitely not possible to detect improper usage of vzeroupper statically, please don\u2019t try!ConclusionIt turns out that memory management is hard, even in silicon \ud83d\ude42AcknowledgementsThis bug was discovered by me, Tavis Ormandy from Google Information Security!I couldn\u2019t have found it without help from my colleagues, in particular Eduardo Vela Nava and Alexandra Sandulescu. I also had help analyzing the bug from Josh Eads.You don\u2019t need to set ymm0 explicitly, all VEX encoded instructions that write to xmm automatically zero the upper part.\u21a9See Software Optimization Guide for AMD EPYC\u2122 7003 Processors, section 2.11.5.\u21a9See Software Optimization Guide for AMD EPYC\u2122 7003 Processors, section 2.11.5.\u21a9In fact, conditional branches are not necessary at all because of SLS.\u21a9HOME \u2022 ABOUT \u2022 CONTACT",

I tried writing a serious-looking research paper about the bug and my proposed fix, but I lost a series of pitched battles against Pytorch and biblatex, so I figured I\u2019d just write a blog post instead. (History is written by the winners; blogs are written by\u2026)In this post I\u2019ll explain how (IMHO) the current generation of AI models have an off-by-one error in a crucial place, and it\u2019s making everyone\u2019s Transformer models needlessly difficult to compress and deploy. Consider this an opinion piece, but if anyone out there on the Internet wants to run some experiments and prove me right, we can collaborate and call ourselves scientists.It\u2019s All About OutliersFirst let\u2019s talk about why this off-by-one error matters. ChatGPT works great, what\u2019s your problem bro? I first caught the scent of something amiss whilst minding my business and perusing research papers on quantization, the technique by which LLM Edgers cram big models onto Mac Minis and Rasberry Pis and jailbroken home thermostats. Everybody in AI is limited by RAM, so the less RAM you use the more cool stuff you can do, both Up There In The Cloud and down here on the edge. LLMs have billions of weights, and if we can make these weights tighten their haunches and suck in their paunches, we can compose better sonnets or plagiarize superior essays or accelerate the end of days, whatever your personal motivation for using language may be.RAM stores information. This sounds like a tautology, but hang with me. Information is negative log-probability, and is how many bits we need to store things. If a stream of numbers is highly predictable, for example is always contained in a limited range, we need fewer bits to store them. If a stream of numbers is not predictable, like once in a blue moon a mega-number shows up, we need more binary digits to encode the Colossus.This is what\u2019s been happening in LLMs \u2013 for reasons that are only partially understood, Transformer models contain these outlier weights and are emitting Black Swan mega-activations that are much, much, much larger, like orders of magnitude larger, than their peers. But no one can get rid of them; the megalodons seem to be critical to the operation of these models, and their existence is contrary to everything we thought we knew about neural networks prior to building ones that worked so well. Many papers have been written about these outlier values, and people have been cooking up all kinds of bit-burning schemes to encode them with fewer ones and zeroes, because right now we get pretty gnarly performance degradation with vanilla scale-and-bias integer quantization. Georgi can tell you more; I\u2019m getting ahead of myself.The best analysis of all of this comes from a team at Qualcomm AI Research in this paper: Quantizable Transformers: Removing Outliers by Helping Attention Heads Do Nothing. The authors traced the existence of these outlier values to the attention mechanism\u2019s softmax function, the seemingly innocent exponentiator that no one thought capable of such kurtotic barbarities. The researchers came this close to finding the off-by-one error, like killer-in-the-closet close, but they must all be on summer vacation in Italy as none of them are responding to my email overtures, and so I must appeal to the international community of scholars the old-fashioned way.If you read the linked paper, just ignore their proposals. Sounds harsh, but hear me out. The clipped softmax comes with a wheel-spinning zero gradient, and their gated attention proposal, while workable, introduces millions of new parameters to solve what is really just a failure to increment. There\u2019s a simple and hindsight-obvious solution here that, from all of my reading, no one has thought to try.All right, I\u2019ve talked up this silly error enough. I\u2019ve alluded to its location. Let\u2019s talk about the softmax function and why it\u2019s not-quite-the-right tool for the job when it comes to attention.The Trouble With SoftmaxNow to explain the bug you really have to understand what the attention mechanism is trying to do. Most numerical bugs are programmers implementing equations incorrectly. However, when you\u2019re dealing not with bad code, but with bad math, you need to understand where that equation comes from and what it\u2019s supposed to be doing before you have any hope of fixing it.I had to read like 50 arXiV papers to understand all this, and probably I should have taken a Udemy course or binge-watched Andrej Karpathy\u2019s YouTube channel instead, but let\u2019s start with what is called the input embedding, which is a floating-point vector that represents a word in the input string.This vector seems to get taller every model year, for example the recent LLaMA 2 model from Meta uses an embedding vector of length 3,204, which works out to 6KB+ in half-precision floating-point, just to represent one word in the vocabulary, which typically contains 30,000 - 50,000 entries.Now if you\u2019re a memory-miserly C programmer like me, you might wonder, why in the world are these AI goobers using 6KB to represent something that ought to take, like 2 bytes tops? If their vocabulary is less than 216=65,384, we only need 16 bits to represent an entry, yeah?Well, here is what the Transformer is actually doing: it transforms (eh?) that input vector to an output vector of the same size, and that final 6KB output vector needs to encode absolutely everything needed to predict the token after the current one. The job of each layer of the Transformer is quite literally adding information to the original, single-word vector. This is where the residual (n\u00e9e skip) connections come in: all of the attention machinery is just adding supplementary material to that original two bytes\u2019 worth of information, analyzing the larger context to indicate, for instance, that the word pupil is referring to a student, and not to the hole in your eye. Repeat the attention mechanism a few dozen times and you\u2019ve mastered the English language and all its vasty contents.Now the final step of Transformer is to multiply this output vector by a rectangular matrix, and cram the resulting vocabulary-length vector into a softmax, treating those exponentiated outputs as next-token probabilities. This is reasonable, but everyone knows it\u2019s not quite right, as no sane and respected model out there regards those output probabilities as correct, but instead every implementation and its sister uses a sampling mechanism to hide the fact that softmax is over-representing low probabilities.That\u2019s all fine and workable; softmax in the output step gives us a gradient for every word in the vocabulary, and it\u2019s a reasonable choice until something better comes along.But what I want to argue is that sauce for the goose shouldn\u2019t be slathered on the gander; the Transformer\u2019s output softmax serves a very different purpose from the attention mechanism\u2019s internal softmax, and we\u2019d all do well to get rid of the latter, or at least prop up its denominator with something handy \u26f1\ufe0f.An exponential peg\u2026So what is softmax? It started out in statistical mechanics as a way to predict the distribution of states based on their energy levels:pi\u221dexp(\u2212\u03b5ikT)Then the economists got a hold of it and realized that if the noise term in people\u2019s otherwise linear utility functions happened to follow a Gumbel distribution (doesn\u2019t yours?), then the probability someone will choose an item will be proportional to the exponent of the utility inputs:Pr(Yi=k)=exp(Xi\u03b2k)\u2211jexp(Xi\u03b2j)This gave softmax a life in multinomial logistic functions; this is where I got to know the old chap, as in I hand-derived the Hessian of this sucker in grad school and coded it up to run on GPUs using linear fixed effects, which to my knowledge no one else has been foolish enough to attempt before or since. I just mention this because I know the softmax function better than I know many of my humanoid friends, and I can recognize when it\u2019s being used for things it oughtn\u2019t.Softmax is a kind of cheat code to map real-valued numbers to probabilities that sum to one. In physics, it works quite well; in economics, it\u2019s a little bit of a lie, but by the time it got to machine learning, it just became a thing that seemed to work whenever a discrete choice was involved. Softmax the vector and pick something, all right?(softmax(x))i=exp(xi)\u2211jexp(xj)Here\u2019s the core mechanic of softmax: it forces a choice among competing alternatives, whether it\u2019s particles picking an energy state or consumers choosing a car. That is, if a softmax mechanism doesn\u2019t want to choose anything at all, softmax will require modification, or else we would expect the softmax to produce distortions once it encounters actual data.In the context of LLMs, one of those distortions is to heavily weight non-semantic tokens (commas and such), and those beefy weights become those difficult-to-compress outlier values that make Life on the Edge harder than it should be. The Qualcomm AI researchers found that 97%+ of outlier activations in LLMs occur in whitespace and punctuation positions. Something\u2019s fishy around here\u2026 and I thought I ordered the chicken.\u2026in a linear holeLet\u2019s dive in to how softmax is used inside of attention and see exactly where it goes wrong. Here\u2019s the equation again:Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(QKT\u221ad)VBreaking it down: in decoder-only models (i.e., everything since ChatGPT), Q, K, and V all originate from the same input sequence. They\u2019re not identical, as they\u2019ve been projected in different ways along the way, but in each layer they all start with the same annotated (added-to) embedding vector.Now: QKT is looking for correlations between token (embedding) vectors in different positions, essentially building up a square matrix of correlation (dot-product scaled by 1/\u221ad) values, where each column and row corresponds to a token position. Then each row of this square matrix is softmaxed, with the resulting probabilities used as a mixing function for the value vectors in the V matrix. The probability-mixed V gets added to the input vector, with the sum passed on down the neural network for further processing.Multi-head attention goes through this process several times, in parallel, per layer. Essentially it divides up the embedding vector, and each head uses information in the entire vector to annotate one (non-overlapping) segment of the output vector. If you were confused by the Concatenation operation in the original Transformer paper, that\u2019s all that\u2019s happening: Head 1 adds information to Segment 1, Head 2 adds information to Segment 2, and so on.The problem with using softmax is that it forces each attention head to make an annotation, even if it has no information to add to the output vector. Using softmax to choose among discrete alternatives is great; using it for optional annotation (i.e. as input into addition) is, like, not cool, man. The problem here is exacerbated with multi-head attention, as a specialized head is more likely to want to \u201cpass\u201d than a general-purpose one. These attention heads are needlessly noisy, a deafening democracy where abstention is disallowed.Now it\u2019s possible that softmax should be replaced wholesale, but it\u2019s worked pretty well for the most part, except for this one wee little bug that prevents attention heads from saying nothing. So I propose a very small tweak on which I am willing to stake all future Internet claims to being correct. The tweak is so small, yet so obvious, and it\u2019s been sitting here under everyone\u2019s noses ever since attention was invented (2014).Are you ready?Are you ready-ready?I can\u2019t hear you.Softmax One and Quiet AttentionAll right, here it is and you are welcome, the long-awaited Softmax Super-Mod that is soon to set the LLM hacker channels aflame:(softmax1(x))i=exp(xi)1+\u2211jexp(xj)Bit of a let-down, eh? All I did was added one to the denominator. This lets the vector as a whole tend to zero if it wants, but otherwise just shrinks the values by a small amount, a shrinkage which will be made up for during normalization, which happens right after attention.The key difference is in the negative limit, when entries in x are significantly less than zero and the model is trying to avoid an annotation altogether. Compare the limiting behavior of the original softmaxlimx1\u2192\u2212\u221e\u2026limxk\u2192\u2212\u221e(softmax(x))i=1k>0to that of the new and improved softmax1:limx1\u2192\u2212\u221e\u2026limxk\u2192\u2212\u221e(softmax1(x))i=0Vanilla softmax will always emit the same total weight; softmax1 mostly looks the same, but comes with an escape hatch in the negative orthant. To be clear: the core issue here is mathematical and not numerical in nature. Extra precision won\u2019t save the softmax; all Transformers are affected.You\u2019ll notice a couple of other things about softmax1. The derivative is positive, so we always have a non-zero gradient, and its sum is between zero and one, so the output isn\u2019t out of control. The function maintains the property(softmax1(x))i(softmax1(x))j=(softmax(x))i(softmax(x))j=exp(xi)exp(xj)\u2200 i,ji.e. relative values in the output vector are unchanged.Originally I wanted to call this function ghostmax, as you can think of there being an extra zero-valued entry in x (as exp(0)=1), as well as a zero vector in the V matrix that attenuates the result. But I didn\u2019t want to scare anyone.Even though softmax1 is facially quite boring, I\u2019m 99.44% sure that it will resolve the outlier feedback loop that\u2019s making quantization the subject of cascades of research. If you want to run some experiments and prove me right, DM me on Twitter and we\u2019ll get a paper going.We can call the improved mechanism QuietAttention, as it allows attention heads to keep their yaps shut. So may I propose to a receptive publicQuietAttention(Q,K,V):=softmax1(QKT\u221ad)VI think a test could be hacked together fairly quickly: if you prefix every input context with a zero vector, and ensure that your neural network of choice doesn\u2019t add any bias (including with the positional encoding), then the zero should pass through unaltered and will have the effect of adding unity to every subsequent softmax denominator; that way you won\u2019t lose your mind mucking with gradient code. I think this could be done with a LLaMA model that uses fixed embeddings and a special prefix token, but I\u2019d very much like to get back to my non-existent hobbies, and I\u2019ve already spent more time on this problem than my therapist needs to know about.You\u2019d still have to re-train the model, so don\u2019t try this on an RPi just yet. But do let me know how those weight kurtoses and activation infinity norms are looking after a few runs. I\u2019m thinking those numbers will make for a handsome table in a soon-to-be influential arXiV paper, either when those Qualcomm AI researchers step off the plane from Italy, or someone in an LLM hacker channel figures out biblatex, whichever happens first.You\u2019re reading evanmiller.org, a random collection of math, tech, and musings.

    "summary": "- The attention formula, a crucial equation in modern AI, contains an off-by-one error that is affecting the compressibility and deployability of Transformer models.\n- The off-by-one error is caused by the softmax function in the attention mechanism, which is assigning disproportionately high weights to non-semantic tokens, making compression difficult.\n- The proposed solution to this error is a simple tweak to the softmax function, called softmax1, which adds one to the denominator and allows attention heads to \"keep their yaps shut.\" This tweak is expected to resolve the outlier feedback loop and improve model quantization.",

    "content": "WHO ASKED FOR THIS \u2014Google\u2019s nightmare \u201cWeb Integrity API\u201d wants a DRM gatekeeper for the webIt's just a \"proposal,\" but it's also being prototyped inside Chrome right now.RON AMADEO - 7/24/2023, 7:55 PMEnlarge / The little Android robot is watching everything you do.Aurich Lawson / Getty Images131WITHGoogle's newest proposed web standard is... DRM? Over the weekend the Internet got wind of this proposal for a \"Web Environment Integrity API. \" The explainer is authored by four Googlers, including at least one person on Chrome's \"Privacy Sandbox\" team, which is responding to the death of tracking cookies by building a user-tracking ad platform right into the browser.The intro to the Web Integrity API starts out: \"Users often depend on websites trusting the client environment they run in. This trust may assume that the client environment is honest about certain aspects of itself, keeps user data and intellectual property secure, and is transparent about whether or not a human is using it.\"ADVERTISINGThe goal of the project is to learn more about the person on the other side of the web browser, ensuring they aren't a robot and that the browser hasn't been modified or tampered with in any unapproved ways. The intro says this data would be useful to advertisers to better count ad impressions, stop social network bots, enforce intellectual property rights, stop cheating in web games, and help financial transactions be more secure.AdvertisementPerhaps the most telling line of the explainer is that it \"takes inspiration from existing native attestation signals such as [Apple's] App Attest and the [Android] Play Integrity API.\" Play Integrity (formerly called \"SafetyNet\") is an Android API that lets apps find out if your device has been rooted. Root access allows you full control over the device that you purchased, and a lot of app developers don't like that. So if you root an Android phone and get flagged by the Android Integrity API, several types of apps will just refuse to run. You'll generally be locked out of banking apps, Google Wallet, online games, Snapchat, and some media apps like Netflix. You could be using root access to cheat at games or phish banking data, but you could also just want root to customize your device, remove crapware, or have a viable backup system. Play Integrity doesn't care and will lock you out of those apps either way. Google wants the same thing for the web.Google's plan is that, during a webpage transaction, the web server could require you to pass an \"environment attestation\" test before you get any data. At this point your browser would contact a \"third-party\" attestation server, and you would need to pass some kind of test. If you passed, you would get a signed \"IntegrityToken\" that verifies your environment is unmodified and points to the content you wanted unlocked. You bring this back to the web server, and if the server trusts the attestation company, you get the content unlocked and finally get a response with the data you wanted.Page: 1 2 Next \u2192ARS VIDEOHow The Callisto Protocol's Team Designed Its Terrifying, Immersive AudioREADER COMMENTS131WITHRON AMADEORon is the Reviews Editor at Ars Technica, where he specializes in Android OS and Google products.

    "content": "\u201cHoly shit.\u201dInside the cockpit of the cruising airliner, Captain Bob Pearson was understandably alarmed at the out-of-the-ordinary beeps that were chiming from his flight computer. On the control panel, an amber low fuel pressure warning lamp lit up to punctuate the audio alarm.First Officer Maurice Quintal, copilot of Air Canada Flight 143, checked the indicator light to determine the cause of the computer\u2019s complaints. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with the fuel pump,\u201d he reported.The mustachioed Captain Pearson pulled out the trusty Boeing handbook, his fingers dashing through the pages to find the specifics of the warning. To his relief, the troubleshooting chart indicated that the situation was not as perilous as it might seem: the fuel pump in the left wing tank was signaling a problem, a minor issue considering that gravity would continue to feed the engines even if the pump failed.\u201cYou know,\u201d he commented to Copilot Quintal, \u201cI would not take this air\u2026\u201d He trailed off as the computer blurted out another four beeps, and the indicator panel lit up like a Christmas tree decorated with bad news. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d Pearson lamented, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to go to Winnipeg.\u201dThe date was 23 July 1983, and although the fuel pressure warnings were not the flight\u2019s first mechanical frustrations, they were certainly the most distressing so far. When pilots Pearson and Quintal had arrived for their shift earlier that day, they had been notified that the plane\u2019s fuel gauges were non-functional due to a fault in the Fuel Quantity Indicator System (FQIS). Even worse, the component required to repair it could not be delivered until later that evening.Rather than canceling the flight, Captain Pearson instructed the engineers to check the fuel level manually. The four-month-old 767 was a state-of-the-art machine with state-of-the-art glitches, and FQIS issues were becoming a common complaint. Several independent dripstick checks later, the fuel hosers were satisfied that sufficient fuel was loaded, and they advised Air Canada Flight 143 to take off. The airliner departed from Montreal at 5:48pm eastern time with their sixty-one passengers. At 6:58pm they made a brief scheduled stopover in Ottawa, where engineers once again checked the fuel dripsticks\u2060\u2014 just to be safe.It was just after 8:00pm central time that the cockpit computer began its string of inexplicable beeps and warning lights. As the jumbo jet crossed the Canadian countryside at 41,000 feet, Copilot Quintal thumbed through the 767 handbook to ascertain the nature of the airplane\u2019s problem. \u201cThey don\u2019t say anything if you\u2019ve got more than one though, main tank, eh?\u201d he said to Captain Pearson, as well as the flight engineer who had joined them. \u201cLike there\u2019s two pumps, they don\u2019t say anything about only one, eh?\u201d According to the computer\u2019s calculations there should have been plenty of fuel remaining, but multiple fuel pumps were indicating pressure problems. The flummoxed flight crew decided to divert to the nearby Winnipeg airport as a precaution, and alerted Air Traffic Control (ATC) of their intent.The cockpit of a typical Boeing 767\u201cAir Canada 143 cleared present position direct Winnipeg,\u201d the tower responded. \u201cWe\u2019re landing runway 31. You\u2019re cleared to maintain six thousand descent your discretion.\u201d Pearson and Quintal updated their flight computer with the new heading and destination. \u201cAir Canada 143 did you want any assistance?\u201d the traffic controller inquired, where \u201cassistance\u201d is an aeronautic euphemism for a reception from the fire brigade.\u201cFor the moment we won\u2019t require any assistance,\u201d Pearson responded.The flight engineer struggled to assess the situation. \u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing in the center tanks, eh?\u201d he inquired of the captain.\u201cNo, we ran the pumps,\u201d the captain replied, referring to an earlier attempt to transfer fuel from another tank. \u201cUh, let\u2019s put them back on again.\u201d Within moments, several more warning lights snapped on in quick succession. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d\u201cGod damn,\u201d Quintal remarked, \u201cthey\u2019re all going out, eh? How about uh\u2026\u201d\u201cAll the lights are on,\u201d Pearson observed soberly, as the array of low fuel pressure indicators glowed with incandescent urgency. The captain summoned the in-charge flight attendant to the cockpit and apprised him of the situation, but his summary was outdated mere moments later. The flight computer bellowed out a flamboyant BONG! which none of the men present could recall having heard before.\u201cOkay,\u201d the captain observed upon examining the instruments, \u201cWe\u2019ve lost the left engine.\u201d\u201cOkay, what\u2026will we do?\u201d Quintal replied. \u201cWant the checklist now?\u201d\u201cChecklist, yeah.\u201dThe pilots began preparations for a delicate-but-very-doable single-engine landing, and Copilot Quintal contacted Winnipeg tower to request the previously offered \u201cassistance\u201d. It was becoming increasingly clear that the plane\u2019s problems lay not in its machinery, but in its fuel. The men, however, were unsure of exactly what was amiss.Following two minutes of uneventful descent, the ever-present vibrations in the deck were disrupted by an almost imperceptible shudder, and the white-noise hum of the remaining jet engine faded away with a long and melancholy mechanical sigh. The gauges and monitors of the control panel\u2060\u2014 which had been so animated with anxiety mere moments before\u2060\u2014 fell dark. Absent the usual murmur of the twin turbofans, an unsettling silence hung heavy in the air.\u201cHow come I have no instruments?\u201d Captain Pearson wondered aloud, though the answer lingered mockingly in the cockpit\u2019s uncharacteristic quiet. The airliner\u2019s generators and hydraulic systems required at least a single functioning engine in order to operate, without which there was no electricity for the computer, and no power to manipulate the ailerons, rudder, and elevator. In effect, the highly advanced flying machine had roughly the maneuverability of a flying brick, with barely enough instrumentation to monitor its slow dive towards the Earth. After a few ponderous moments, however, the automatic emergency systems twitched into action. Onboard batteries revived a few of the most critical instruments, and a door popped open on the plane\u2019s underbelly to expose a ram-air turbine (RAT) designed to provide limited emergency hydraulic support.\u201c143,\u201d the radio crackled, \u201cWe have lost your transponder return right now.\u201dCaptain Bob PearsonCaptain Pearson was beginning to grasp the true gravity of the situation. \u201cCenter, one-four-three, this is a mayday and we require a vector onto the closest available runway. We are out of 22,000 feet on\u2026 both engines have failed due to looks like fuel starvation and we are on emergency instruments and can only give you limited headings. Information\u2060\u2014 we are heading two five zero now, please give us a vector to the nearest runway.\u201d\u201c143 we copy all that okay. We have lost your transponder return and attempting to pick up your target now\u2026 we have it now, just stand by on the two fifty heading.\u201d\u201cAh, roger.\u201dAfter repeated unsuccessful attempts to restart the stalled engines, Pearson and Quintal once again consulted the 767 emergency manual, this time for advice on an unpowered landing. Much to their dismay, no such section existed, presumably because a simultaneous engine failure had been too ridiculous for Boeing engineers to contemplate. The pilots sat anxiously in their darkened cockpit and monitored the plane\u2019s slow and silent descent using a handful of analog instruments based on pre-WW2 technology: a magnetic compass, an artificial horizon, an airspeed indicator, and an altimeter.The traffic controller in the tower at Winnipeg advised the flight officers of their options. \u201c143 we show you at sixty-five miles from Winnipeg and approximately forty-five miles from Gimli.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Pearson responded, \u201cis there emergency equipment at Gimli?\u201cNegative emergency equipment at all. Just one runway available I believe and no control and no information on it.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d prefer Winnipeg then.\u201dIn a stroke of profound luck, Captain Pearson was an accomplished glider pilot, a skill which afforded him with some sense of the vehicle\u2019s glide capabilities. He applied his expertise to estimate the plane\u2019s best glide ratio speed, but having neither a vertical speed indicator nor a view of the landscape through the clouds, he was unaware that Winnipeg was well beyond the reach of their gravity-gripped flight equipment.Back in the passenger compartment, the in-charge flight attendant radiated counterfeit calm as he informed the plane\u2019s sixty-one passengers of the situation, and instructed them in the subtle art of not freaking out during an in-flight emergency. In the meantime, crew members directed able-bodied men to move into the rows alongside the exit doors, then solemnly buckled into their own seats. Many of the crew members were keenly aware that jumbo jets such as theirs were not designed for dead-stick flight\u2060\u2014 let alone dead-stick landings. In all probability, their inevitable confrontation with the Earth would not be an improvement on their current situation.As the impromptu glider emerged from the ceiling of clouds and obtained a view of the landscape, the pilots quickly realized that the plane was shedding altitude far too quickly to have any chance of reaching Winnipeg. Copilot Quintal confirmed this conclusion using radar data from Air Traffic Control.\u201cHow far are we from Gimli?\u201d Pearson inquired of the Winnipeg tower.\u201cYou are approximately twelve miles from Gimli right now.\u201dAir Traffic Control had no specific data on the remote airstrip, but in another stroke of luck, First Officer Quintal had been stationed there during his time in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Lacking any feasible alternative, the copilot recommended they drop in on his old friends from the service. He was not aware, however, that the facility had since been converted into a public airport; nor did any of the men know that one of its two runways had been decommissioned and carved up for use as a racetrack.As Flight 143 fell below the Air Traffic Control radar range, the tower grimly requested a count of the souls on board. As Pearson began his long final approach, he scraped up a bit of optimism as he updated Winnipeg tower on their status. \u201cWe have the field in sight,\u201d he reported, \u201cand we feel we\u2019re in good shape.\u201dOn the ground at Gimli, it was Family Day at the local racetrack. Sports Racers buzzed along the decommissioned runway as spectators cheered from the sidelines. A collection of campers at the end of the airstrip soaked up the summer Saturday evening as their dinners sizzled on assorted barbecues. Without the jet engines to announce the airliner\u2019s approach, the people were oblivious of the 132-ton Boeing behemoth which was bearing down on them.In the cockpit, Copilot Quintal activated the manual landing gear controls, and the two main gears lowered and locked. The nose gear, however, dangled limply from its housing. For Captain Pearson, the flight controls were becoming increasingly difficult to operate. The effectiveness of the emergency RAT was governed by the speed of the wind slipping around the fuselage, so as the plane gradually slowed, the hydraulic assistance was diminishing. Nevertheless, Pearson needed to sharply reduce the speed and altitude of his approach, otherwise the 767 would overshoot the tarmac; and without engines there would be no opportunity for a second try. Ordinarily an airline pilot would apply some combination of flaps and aerobrakes, but none of these systems were functioning on Pearson\u2019s crippled craft.Lacking a more orthodox option, Captain Pearson cranked the control wheel to the right and gave the left rudder pedal a firm stomp. The criss-crossed controls tilted the deck to the right as one wing dipped toward the ground, providing the passengers with a lovely view of the golf course on one side, and nothing but blue sky on the other. The fuselage also rotated its heading to the left, becoming diagonal relative to its direction of travel. Such forward-slip maneuvers were sometimes used on small planes and gliders, but the curve-ballish air acrobatics were unheard of with a jumbo jet. The airplane indeed decelerated, but the reduced airspeed robbed the controls of even more precious hydraulic pressure, requiring Pearson to apply monumental force to try to straighten the slip.Orientation of the aircraft during forward slip maneuverAt the opposite end of the runway, the Family Day campers and spectators had finally spotted the silent and oddly-angled incoming aircraft, and they were scrambling from its path with appropriate levels of panic. First Officer Quintal caught sight of the fleeing families, but it was far too late to revise their landing plans, so he opted not to distract the captain with the unsettling discovery.Forty feet above the ground\u2060\u2014 mere seconds before contact\u2060\u2014 Captain Pearson managed to wrestle Flight 143 back to a straight and level approach. At 8:38pm central time, the rear landing gears grabbed the tarmac at Gimli airport, and Bob Pearson stood on the brake pedals as the airplane skidded towards the scattering bystanders. A few of the loudly protesting tires finally succumbed to the abuse and blew out with adequate force to shimmy the fuselage. As some of the weight shifted forward, the unsecured front landing gear buckled, dumping the nose section onto the pavement and spraying a three-hundred foot shower of sparks.After sledding across the asphalt for 2,900 feet, Air Canada Flight 143 ground to a halt just a few hundred yards from the shocked onlookers. There was a moment of stupefied contemplation within the passenger cabin, followed by an eruption of cheering and applause. Meanwhile several astute racetrack workers dashed to the nose of Flight 143 and doused a small friction-induced fire using hand-held extinguishers. Within a few minutes the inflatable rubber escape chutes plopped from the sides of the plane, and the sixty-nine frazzled occupants disembarked.A crew of engineers from Winnipeg airport clambered into a van and headed for Gimli to assess the damage. During transit, however, their vehicle unexpectedly ran out of fuel, nearly ripping a hole in the delicate space-irony continuum. When airline mechanics finally arrived at the landing site, they found all three of the 767\u2019s fuel tanks completely dry, with no evidence of a fuel leak. A review of the day\u2019s events traced the problem back to the manual dripstick checks in Montreal and Ottawa. In order to maintain awareness of the overall weight of the aircraft, flight crews kept track of fuel quantity based on kilograms rather than the fuel company\u2019s liter-based measurements. Pearson and Quintal had determined the fuel weight by multiplying the the number of dripsticked liters by 1.77, as indicated by the documentation. However, unbeknownst to the pilots and the fuel crew, this multiplier provided the weight in imperial pounds; the new, all-metric 767 was based on kilograms, and required a multiplier of 0.8. As a consequence of this documentation disconnect, Flight 143 had left Montreal with roughly half the necessary fuel.Because the rear escape slides were excessively steep due to the buckled front gear, a few bumps and bruises were sustained on egress; but no one was seriously injured in the Gimli incident. Had it not been for Pearson\u2019s capable captaining and glider experience, as well as Quintal\u2019s cucumber-cool support, the outcome of the metric mixup might have been considerably less pleasant. In addition, had it not been for the drag created by the collapsed front gear, the powerless plane would have plunged into the crowd of spectators, sowing destruction and death in its wake. All told, the soon-to-be-dubbed \u201cGimli Glider\u201d was a nearly perfect demonstration of dead-stick flying, accompanied by an extra-large portion of good fortune.The Gimli after landing (photo by Wayne Glowacki, Winnipeg Free Press)With just two days of mechanical jiggering, Captain Pearson\u2019s wounded 767 was patched up sufficiently to fly it out for repairs elsewhere. The Gimli Glider officially rejoined the Air Canada fleet after a bit of body work, a new front gear, a new wiring harness, a repaired Fuel Quantity Indicator System, and a full load of jet fuel. The internal investigation into the incident laid the blame partially upon Captain Bob Pearson and First Officer Maurice Quintal, who should have observed the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) and grounded the aircraft since it lacked functioning fuel gauges. Some of the responsibility was also assigned to the maintenance workers, and to \u201ccorporate deficiencies.\u201d As a consequence Pearson was briefly demoted, and Quintal was suspended for two weeks. Nonetheless both pilots continued to work for Air Canada, and in 1985 they received the well-deserved F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale Diploma for Outstanding Airmanship for their handling of the unusual landing.As for the Gimli Glider herself, the twenty-four year old 767 remains an active part of the Air Canada fleet to this very day. Some grizzled old pilots swear that sometimes, when the wind is just right on a quiet night, you can just about make out the double-engine-failure BONG! as the old girl is flying by; and if you\u2019re very lucky, you might catch the faint odor of damp pilots in the air.Update: The Gimli Glider\u2013Air Canada Flight 143\u2013was retired from service on 24 January 2008 in a ceremony involving Captain Robert Pearson, First Officer Maurice Quintal, and three of the six flight attendants who had been aboard Flight 143 during its unscheduled glide and rough landing.",

    "content": "Your Mystery: Have Attention Spans Been Declining?july 24, 2023 slimemoldtimemoldcontest, internet science, mad science, mysteries, science[This is one of the finalists in the SMTM Mysteries Contest, by a reader writing under the pseudonym Cennfaeladh. We\u2019ll be posting about one of these a week until we have gotten through all the finalists. At the end, we\u2019ll ask you to vote for a favorite, so remember which ones you liked.]I investigate whether the attention span of individual humans has been falling over the last two decades (prompted by curiosity about whether the introduction of the internet may be harmful to cognitive performance). I find little direct work on the topic, despite its wide appeal. Reviewing related research indicates that individual attention spans might indeed have been declining65%.In what might be just the age-old regular ephebiphobia, claims have been raised that individual attention spans have been declining\u2014not just among adolescents, but among the general population. If so, this would be quite worrying: Much of the economy in industrialized societies is comprised of knowledge work, and knowledge work depends on attention to the task at hand: switching between tasks too often might prevent progress on complicated and difficult problems.I became interested in the topic after seeing several claims that e.g. Generation Z allegedly has lower attention spans, observing myself and how I struggled to get any work done when connected to the internet, and hearing reports from others online and in person having the same problem.The exact question being asked is:\u201cHave the attention spans of individuals on neutral tasks (that is, tasks that are not specifically intended to be stimulating) declined from 2000 to the present?\u201d(One might also formulate it as \u201cIs there an equivalent of the \u201cReversed Flynn Effect\u201d for attention span?\u201d) I am not particularly wedded to the specific timeframe, though the worries mentioned above assert that this has become most stark during the last decade or so, attributing the change to widespread social media/smartphone/internet usage. Data from before 2000 or just the aughts would be less interesting. The near-global COVID-19 lockdows could provide an especially enlightening natural experiment: Did social media usage increase (my guess: yes90%), and if so, did attention spans decrease at the same time (or with a lag) (my guess: also yes75%), but I don\u2019t think anyone has the data on that and wants to share it.Ideally want to have experiments from ~2000 up to 2019: close enough to the present to see whether there is a downward trend (a bit more than a decade after the introduction of the iPhone in 2007), but before the COVID-19 pandemic which might be a huge confounder, or just have accelerated existing trends (which we can probably check in another 2 years).I am mostly interested in the attention span of individual humans and not groups: Lorenz-Spreen et al. 2019 investigate the development of a construct they call \u201ccollective attention\u201d (and indeed find a decline), but that seems less economically relevant than individual attention span. I am also far less interested in self-perception of attention span, give me data from a proper power- or speed-test, cowards!So the question I am asking is not any of the following:\u201cDoes more social media/internet usage cause decreased attention spans?\u201d\u201cDoes more social media/internet usage correlate with decreased attention spans?\u201d\u201cDoes more social media/internet usage correlate with people reporting having shorter attention spans?\u201d\u201cDid collective attention spans decrease?\u201d\u201cAre people on average spending less time on webpages than they used to?\u201dHow Is Attention Span Defined?Attention is generally divided into three distinct categories: sustained attention, which is the consistent focus on a specific task or piece of information over time (Wikipedia states that the span for sustained attention has a leprechaun figure of 10 minutes floating around, elaborated on in Wilson & Korn 2007); selective attention, which is the ability to resist distractions while focusing on important information while performing on a task (the thing trained during mindfulness meditation); and alternating or divided attention, also known as the ability to multitask.When asking the question \u201chave attention spans been declining\u201d, we\u2019d ideally want the same test measuring all those three aspects of attention (and not just asking people about their perception via surveys), performed annually on large random samples of humans over decades, ideally with additional information such as age, sex, intelligence (or alternatively educational attainment), occupation etc. I\u2019m personally most interested in the development of sustained attention, and less so in the development of selective attention. But I have not been able to find such research, and in fact there is apparently no agreed upon test for measuring attention span in the first place:She studies attention in drivers and witnesses to crime and says the idea of an \u201caverage attention span\u201d is pretty meaningless. \u201cIt\u2019s very much task-dependent. How much attention we apply to a task will vary depending on what the task demand is.\u201d\u2014 Simon Maybin quoting Dr. Gemma Briggs, \u201cBusting the attention span myth\u201d, 2017So, similar to comas, attention span doesn\u2019t exist\u2026sure, super-proton things come in varieties, but which varieties?? And how??? Goddamn, psychologists, do your job and don\u2019t just worship complexity.Perhaps I should soften my tone, as this perspective appears elsewhere:[\u2026] Gould suggests the metaphor of a dense bush whose branches are periodically pruned by nature. This allows for parallel evolutionary sequences, some of which are adaptive and others not \u2014 at any moment in time only the tips of aseledaptive branches are in evidence, the pruned ones cannot be seen. Thus rather than being direct descendants of primitive hominids, for example, huankind would have evolved along a separate but parallel line from other primates.Might the ontogeny of selective attention recapitulate this theme? That is, rather than selective attention comprising a single construct with a fixed ontogenic plan, might it be better conceptualized as a multidimensional construct with separat, parallel developmental trajectories for different components. To carry the analogy still further, might the specific developmental progression for a particular component of selective attention be determined by the adaptive fit of that component with the individual\u2019s \u2018environmental press\u2019? Although such a conjecture rekindles the tened of ontogeny recapitulates phylogney long since abandoned in physiological development (e.g., Dixon and Lerner, 1985), we suggest that it may nonetheless provide an overarching framework within which to cast life-span research and theory on the development of selective attention.\u2014 Plude et al., \u201cThe development of selective attention: A life-span overview\u201d p. 31, 1994How Do We Measure Attention Span?One of my hopes was that there is a canonical and well-established (and therefore, ah, tested) test for attention span (or just attention) \u00e0 la the IQ test for g: If so, I would be able to laboriously go through the literature on attention, extract the individual measurements (and maybe even acquire some datasets) and perform a meta-analysis.Continuous Performance TestsFor measuring sustained and selective attention, I found the family of continuous performance tests, including the Visual and Auditory CPT (IVA-2), the Test of Variables of Attention (T.O.V.A.), Conners\u2019 CPT-III, the gradCPT and the QbTest, some of which are described here. These tests usually contain two parts: a part with low stimulation and rare changes of stimuli, which tests for lack of attention, and a part with high stimulation and numerous changes of stimuli, which tests for impulsivity/self control.Those tests usually report four different scores:Correct detection: This indicates the number of times the client responded to the target stimulus. Higher rates of correct detections indicate better attentional capacity.Reaction times: This measures the amount of time between the presentation of the stimulus and the client\u2019s response.Omission errors: This indicates the number of times the target was presented, but the client did not respond/click the mouse. High omission rates indicate that the subject is either not paying attention (distractibility) to stimuli or has a sluggish response.Commission errors: This score indicates the number of times the client responded but no target was presented. A fast reaction time and high commission error rate points to difficulties with impulsivity. A slow reaction time with high commission and omission errors, indicates inattention in general.I\u2019m currently unsure about two crucial points:How much does any CPT measure the concept we naively call attention span? The papers I\u2019ve read don\u2019t refer to attention span per se, but a general capability of sustained and selective attention.Are there any time-series analyses or longitudinal studies using a CPT, or alternatively meta-analyses using data collected from existing studies? I have not been able to find any.Other Heterogenous MetricsI also attempted to find a survey or review paper on attention span, but was unsuccessful in my quest, so I fell back to collecting metrics for attention span from different papers:Gausby 2015Three online tests (probably devised by the authors (?), since no source is given) (n\u22482000 Canadians). Very little information about the exact nature of the tests.Sustained attention span: \u201cCounting the number of times responds correctly identified an X occurring after an A.\u201dSelective attention span: \u201cCounting the number of times respondents correctly identified a change in the orientation of the rectangles\u201dAlternating attention span: \u201cCalculating the difference in the time lapsed to perform a series of consecutive number or letter classification, compared to a mixture of number and letter classifications.\u201dNeurological research: The same games/tests as above with the participants being measured with an EEG (\u201cResults were reported as ACE (Attention, Connectivity, Encoding) scores, as well as the number of attention bursts\u201d) (n=112 Canadians)Carstens et al. 2018 (n=209 American respondents to a survey)Questionnaire developed by the authors based on Conners 2004 (reliability: \u03b1=0.786)Wilson & Korn 2007 report several different measures of attention span during lectures: the amount of notes taken over time, observation of the students by an author of one study or two independent observers in another study, retention of material after the lecture, self-report in 5-minute intervals during the lecture, and heart rate. They also note that \u201cResearchers use behaviors such as fidgeting, doodling, yawning, and looking around as indicators of inattentiveness (e.g., Frost, 1965; Johnstone & Percival, 1976).\u201dPlude et al. 1994 review how selective attention develops during a human life. For measuring attention, they mainly focus on studies using reaction time as a metric\u2014the speed at which an action occurs as a result of a changing stimulus: eye movement patterns of infants, simple tests such as pressing a button on a changing (often visual) stimulus, the influence of irrelevant visual stimuli at the periphery on a task performed at the centre of the visual field, judging similarity of stimuli at various distances in the visual field, responding to a target stimulus surrounded by interfering distractor stimuli, and determining whether a visual target item is present or absent. They also mention skin conductance (measuring arousal).They also mention studies investigating the time required for attentional switching in acoustic contexts: \u201cPearson and Lane (1991a) studied the time course of the attention-shifting process between lists and also found large age-related improvements between 8 and 11 years. Whereas 8-year-olds required more than 3.5 s to completely switch from monitoring one list to another, 11-year-olds and adults appeared to complete the switch in less than 2.5 seconds.\u201dMuhammad 2020Time spent on websites on average.This is not an adequate metric, I believe: It would also decline if people would become better at prioritising on which websites are more worthy of their attention.Lorenz-Spreen et al. 2019Time that specific pieces of information (hashtags/n-grams/Reddit submissions &c) were popularAs it stands, I think there\u2019s a decent chance60% that one or several tests from the CPT family can be used as tests for attention span without much of a problem.I don\u2019t think a separate dedicated test for attention span exists45%: The set of listed measures I found (apart from the CPT) appears to be too heterogenous, idiosyncratic, mostly not quantitative enough and measuring slightly different things to be robustly useful for a meta-analysis.What Are the Existing Investigations?A lack of long-term studies means we can\u2019t tell whether attention spans have actually declined.\u2014Bobby Duffy & Marion Thain, \u201cDo we have your attention\u201d p. 5, 2022Gausby 2015Questions answered:Sustained attention:Do younger people perform worse on the sustained attention span test?, Yes (31% high sustained attention for group aged 18-34, 34% for group aged 35-54, and 35% group aged 55+) (the methodology is wholly unclear here, though: how do we determine the group that has \u201chigh sustained attention span\u201d? Did they perform any statisitical tests? If yes, which?).Do people who report more technology usage (web browsing/multi-screen usage while online/social media usage/tech adoption) perform worse on the sustained attention span test?, Yes. Light:medium:heavy usage for web browsing has 39%:33%:27% users with high sustained attention span, 36%:33%:27% for light:medium:heavy multi-screen usage, 36%:29%:23% for light:medium:heavy social media usage and 35%:31%:25% for light:medium:heavy tech adoption (though these numbers are basically not elaborated on).Selective attention:Do younger people perform worse on the selective attention span test? No (34% high selective attention for group aged 18-34, 30% for group aged 35-54, and 35% group aged 55+).Do people with high selective attention use fewer devices at the same time? Yes (details p. 31).Alternating attention:Do younger people perform worse on the alternating attention span test? No (36% high selective attention for group aged 18-34, 28% for group aged 35-54, and 36% group aged 55+).Do people who report more technology usage (tech adoption/web browsing/multi-screen usage while online) perform worse on the alternating attention span test? No, they seem to perform better: Light:medium:heavy tech adoption corresponds to 31%:39%:40% having high alternating attention spans, light:medium:heavy web browsing to 29%:34%:37% and multi-screening while online to 27%:32%:37%.Do people who use social media more have higher Attention/Connection/Encoding scores on EEG measurements?, Not quite: \u201cModerate users of social media are better at multi-tasking than lower users. But, when crossing into the top quartile of social media usage, scores plummet.\u201dThis is a marketing statement wearing the skinsuit of a previously great paper, it would be awesome if they released their exact methodology (tests performed, data collected, exact calculations & code written). I can smell that they actually put effort into the research: Creating an actual test instead of just asking respondents about their attention spans, doing EEG measurements of over 100 people, for 3 different types of attention\u2026come on! Just put out there what you did!Carstens et al. 2018 (n=209 American respondents to a survey)Questions answered:Is self-reported attention span related to the number of social media accounts?, No, not statistically significant (F(2, 206)=0.1223, p>0.05) (via a one-way ANOVA)Is self-reported attention span related to whether a respondent mainly uses a mobile phone or a computer?, No, not statistically significant (P(2,713)=0.923, p>0.05) (via a one-way ANOVA)I do not trust this paper: Calling (what I think is) Generation Z \u201cGeneration D\u201d (without source for the term), being clearly written in Word, and confusing grammar (I think the authors are all Americans, so no excuse here):Users that are older such as late adolescents and emerging adults average approximately 30-minutes daily for just Facebook that does not calculate the time spent on all social media networks\u2014Carstens et al., \u201cSocial Media Impact on Attention Span\u201d p. 2, 2018Bakardjieva and Gaden (2012) examined the field of social interaction in general to the everyday chatter of unstructured and spontaneous interactions among individuals to highly structured and regulated interaction consisting of the military or the stock exchange.\u2014Carstens et al., \u201cSocial Media Impact on Attention Span\u201d p. 3, 2018Muhammad 2020Question answered: How much time do people spend on a website, on average?, \u201cif you look at the trend for mobile browsing between the years 2017 and 2019 you would see that there is a drop of about 11 seconds in the average time spent on a website.\u201d and \u201cThe data suggests that the average amount of time spent on websites before navigating away for all devices has gone down by 49 seconds which is a pretty huge reduction all things considered.\u201dThe data is from the right timeframe (up to but not including 2020), but the linked SimilarWeb report is behind a paywall, so I can\u2019t confirm the numbers. Furthermore, the time spent on websites is a weak proxy: Perhaps people simply have become better at prioritising information sources.Lorenz-Spreen et al. 2019Questions answered:How long does any particular hashtag stay in the group of the top 50 most used hashtags? Specifically, how has that number developed from 2013 to 2016?, \u201cin 2013 a hashtag stayed within the top 50 for 17.5 hours on average, a number which gradually decreases to 11.9 hours in 2016\u201d, and \u201cThe average maximum popularity \u27e8L(tpeak)\u27e9on one day tpeak stays relatively constant, while the average gradients \u27e8\u0394L\u27e9in positive and negative direction become steeper over the years.\u201dDo things become more popular faster over time? That is, when e.g. a movie is gaining popularity, did it take longer to become popular in 1985 than it did in 2018?, Broadly yes (the trends holds for popularity of hashtags in tweets (2013-2016)/n-grams in books (1900-2004)/number of theaters that movies were screened in (1985-2018)/topics for search queries on Google (2010-2017)/Reddit comments on posts (2010-2015)/citations of publications (1990-2015)/daily traffic for Wikipedia articles (2012-2017)). Again the length of the time at the peak mostly didn\u2019t change (except in the case of Wikipedia articles, where the time at the peak shrunk)While it investigates a question different from the one I have, this paper seems good and trustworthy to me, while supporting a suspicion I\u2019ve had (observing that the lifecycle of e.g. memes has apparently sped up significantly). I\u2019d be interested in seeing whether the same process holds for internet communities I\u2019m part of (for example on votes LessWrong and the EA Forum or forecasts on Metaculus).Mark 2023 is a recent book about attention spans, which I was excited to read and find the important studies I\u2019d missed. Unfortunately, it is quite thin on talking about the development of attention span over time. It states thatMy own research, as well as those of others, has shown that over the last fifteen years, our attention spans have declined in duration when we use our devices. Our attention spans while on our computers and smartphones have become short\u2014crazily short\u2014as we now spend about forty-seven seconds on any screen on average.\u2014Gloria Mark, \u201cAttention Span\u201d p. 13/14, 2023which is not quite strong enough a measurement for me.In 2004, in our earliest study, we found that people averaged about one hundred fifty seconds (two and a half minutes) on a computer screen before switching their attention to another screen; in 2012, the average went down to seventy-five seconds before switching. In later years, from 2016 to 2021, the average amount of time on any screen before switching was found to be relatively consistent between forty-four and fifty seconds. Others replicated our results, also with computer logging. seconds. Others replicated our results, also with computer logging. Andr\u00e9 Meyer and colleagues at Microsoft Research found the average attention span of twenty software developers over eleven workdays to be fifty seconds.\u2079 For her dissertation, my student Fatema Akbar found the average attention span of fifty office workers in various jobs over a period of three to four weeks to be a mere forty-four seconds.\u00b9\u2070 In other words, in the last several years, every day and all day in the workplace, people switch their attention on computer screens about every forty-seven seconds on average. In fact, in 2016 we found the median (i.e., midpoint) for length of attention duration to be forty seconds.\u00b9\u00b9 This means that half the observations of attention length on any screen were shorter than forty seconds.\u2014Gloria Mark, \u201cAttention Span\u201d p. 74/75, 2023She doesn\u2019t mention the hypothesis that this could be the symptom of a higher ability to prioritize tasks, although she is adamant that multi-tasking is bad.Furthermore, this behavior displays only a decrease in the propensity of attention, but not necessarily one of capacity: Perhaps people could concentrate more, if they wanted to/were incentivized to, but they don\u2019t, because there is no strong intent to or reward for doing so. Admittedly, this is less of an argument in the workplace where these studies were conducted, but perhaps people just care not as much about their jobs (or so I\u2019ve heard).when email was cut off, people\u2019s attention spans were significantly longer while working on their computers\u2014in other words, they switched their attention less frequently.\u2014Gloria Mark, \u201cAttention Span\u201d p. 97, 2023She gives some useful statistics about time spent on screens:Nielsen reports that Americans spend on average five hours and thirty minutes daily of screen time on their computers, tablets and phones8. [\u2026] But what is really astonishing is that when we add in the time watching other media like TV and films to this, then we see that our attention is fixated on some form of screen, in some type of mediated environment, nearly ten hours a day8.\u2014Gloria Mark, \u201cAttention Span\u201d p. 180, 2023She connects attention span to shot-length in movies:The type of motion within shots has been changing. According to film scholar James Cutting and his colleagues at Cornell, shots containing the onset of motion (like a standing person who then runs) have increased because filmmakers believe that it will better attract viewers\u2019 attention. [\u2026] The average film shot length in 1930 was twelve seconds, but then began to shorten, reaching an average of less than four seconds after the year 2010, as measured by James Cutting and colleagues.12 Interestingly, the shot length for film sequels also decreased. For example, the shot length of the first Iron Man film averaged about 3.7 seconds; for Iron Man 2, 3.0 seconds; and for Iron Man 3, about 2.4 seconds.13\u2014Gloria Mark, \u201cAttention Span\u201d p. 180/181, 2023Like in TV and film, shot lengths in television commercials also shortened over time. The average shot length of commercials in 1978 was 3.8 seconds, dropping down to an average of 2.3 seconds in 1991. [\u2026] It\u2019s not just the shot lengths, though, that are short\u2014the overall length of advertisements on TV has also decreased. The majority of ads started out as sixty seconds in length in the 1950s,26 but that length comprised only 5 percent of ads shown in 2017. In the 1980s, advertisers started experimenting with showing fifteen-second ads instead of thirty-second ads. They discovered that fifteen seconds was even more persuasive than thirty seconds, especially when the ads used elements expressing cuteness and humor.27 In 2014, 61 percent of ads were thirty seconds in length, but three years later, that percentage decreased to 49 percent.28\u2014Gloria Mark, \u201cAttention Span\u201d p. 189, 2023Do People Believe Attention Spans Have Declined?Half of the public feel their attention span is shorter than it used to be, compared with around a quarter (23%) who believe they are just attentive [sic] as they\u2019ve always been.Again, the feeling of is not just reported by the young \u2014 it\u2019s also the dominant feeling among the middle aged too, with 56% of 35- to 54-year-olds thinking their attention spans have worsened.\u2014Bobby Duffy & Marion Thain, \u201cDo we have your attention\u201d p. 6, 2022Even more widespread is the belief that young people\u2019s attention spans in particular are worse than they were in the past\u2014two-thirds of people think this is the case (66%).Perhaps unsurprisingly, this belief is most common among the oldest age group surveyed, of those aged 55 or over \u2014 however, young people themselves also feel this way, with a majority of 18- 34-year-olds holding this view.\u2014Bobby Duffy & Marion Thain, \u201cDo we have your attention\u201d p. 7, 2022Note that selective attention mostly improves with age, so the older age-groups might be comparing themselves now to the younger age groups now (as opposed to remembering back at their own attention spans).The absence of long-term research means it remains unknown whether technology has caused a deterioration in the country\u2019s ability to concentrate \u2014 but comparisons with survey data from previous decades indicate that, on some measures the public feel more pressured than they did in the past.\u2014Bobby Duffy & Marion Thain, \u201cDo we have your attention\u201d p. 18, 2022In response to the questions (n=2093 UK adults aged 18+ in 2021):\u201cTo what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The pace of life is too much for me these days\u201d (1983: 30% agree, 2021: 41% agree)\u201cTo what extent do you agree or disagree with the following statement? I wish I could slow down the pace of my life\u201d (1997: 47% agree, 1999: 51% agree, 2008: 45% agree, 2021: 54% agree)What About Rates of ADHD?Data from the CDC shows a clear increase in the percentage of children with a parent-reported ADHD diagnosis:There has been a similar increase in the diagnosis of ADHD among adults, \u201cfrom 0.43 to 0.96 percent\u201d between 2007 and 2016.However, this does not necessarily mean that the rate of ADHD has increased, if e.g. awareness of ADHD has increased and therefore leads to more diagnoses.What Could A Study Look Like?Compared to other feats that psychology is accomplishing, finding out whether individual attention spans are declining appears to be of medium difficulty, so I\u2019ll try to outline how this could be accomplished in three different ways:Develop a good instrument for measuring attention span (optionally just use a continuous performance test). Once one has a suitable instrument for measuring attention span, one can every year (or every second year) for a couple of years pick a random sample from the population (not of the same set of people, though, since attention span increases with age), e.g. via the internet if the test can be done online. One could then apply a linear trend estimation or a fancier statistical technique I don\u2019t know to find out whether attention spans have declined between the measurements.This could be done relatively cheaply: Let\u2019s say we collect 50 datapoints a year, from Mechanical Turk workers at $10/hr. A conservative estimate is that the test takes ~30 minutes to complete, so for three years the cost of the data would be 50\u22c53\u22c510$/h\u22c50.5h=$750. It looks like there are open-source implementations of the test available (Conners\u2019 CPT 3 costs $1.5k), so the additional cost is for the researcher setting up the test and recruiting the participants, which could take ~30 hours, and another ~30 hours for analysing the data. So the total cost of the experiment would be, at an hourly wage of $15 for the researcher (come on, we can let a grad student do it), $750+60h\u22c515$/h=$1650. Fudging upwards by taking the planning fallacy into account gives $2k for the experiment.Find someone who has been collecting data on attention span, ask them for it nicely, and analyse that data.Use the control groups from studies testing the effect of interventions on attention as data and then perform a meta-analysis. A lot of studies use some variant of the CPT, I started collecting such studies in Appendix B.ConclusionGiven the amount of interest the question about shrinking attention spans has received, I was surprised to not find a knockdown study of the type I was looking for, and instead many different investigations that were either not quite answering the question I was asking or too shoddy (or murky) to be trusted. It seems likely to me that individual attention spans have declined (I\u2019d give it ~70%), but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the decline was relatively small, noisy & dependent on specific tests.So\u2014why hasn\u2019t anyone investigated this question to satisfaction yet? After all, it doesn\u2019t seem to me to be extremely difficult to do (compared to other things science has accomplished), there is pretty clearly a lot of media attention on the question (so much so that a likely incorrect number proliferates far & wide), it appears economically and strategically relevant to me (especially sustained attention is probably an important factor in knowledge work, I\u2019d guess?) and it slots more or less into cognitive psychology.I\u2019m not sure why this hasn\u2019t happened yet (and consider this text evidence for a partial violation of Cowen\u2019s 2nd law\u2014although, to be fair, the law doesn\u2019t specify there needs to be a good literature on everything\u2026). The reasons I can think of is that one would need to first develop a good test for determining attention span, which is some work in itself (or use the CPT); be relatively patient (since the test would need to be re-run at least twice with a >1 year pause, for which the best grant structure might not exist); there are many partial investigations into the topic, making it appear like it\u2019s solved; and perhaps there just aren\u2019t enough cognitive psychologists around to investigate all the interesting questions that come up.So I want to end with a call to action: If you have the capacity to study this problem, there is room for improvement in the existing literature! Attention spans could be important, it\u2019s probably not hard to measure them, and many people claim that they\u2019re declining, but are way too confident about it given the state of the evidence. False numbers are widely circulated, meaning that correct numbers might be cited even more widely. And it\u2019s probably not even (that) hard!Consider your incentives :-).Appendix A: Claims That Attention Spans Have Been DecliningMost of these are either unsourced or cite Gausby 2015 fallaciously (which Bradbury 2016 conjectures to be the number of seconds spent on websites on average).Today, individuals are constantly on an information overload from both the quantity of information available and the speed of which information gets into the hands of individuals through advertising and multimedia. Attention deficits tend to be increasing as it is challenging to attract individuals and hold their attention long enough for people to read or watch messages such as work memos, advertisements, etc.\u2014Carstens et al., \u201cSocial Media Impact on Attention Span\u201d p. 2, 2018Big data plays an important role in the development of microlearning. In the age of big data, human\u2019s attention span is decreasing. As per Hebert (1971), \u201cwhat information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it\u201d (p. 41). An example of short attention span in the age of big data can be found in the music industry, as per (Gauvin, 2017), the average time that passed before the audience would hear the vocals on any radio song was 23 s, today the average intro is just 5 s long. Wertz (2017) also suggested that 40% of users are likely to abandon a website if it does not load within three seconds or less. Furthermore, a survey (Gausby, 2015) conducted by Microsoft indicated that the average attention span of a human dropped from 12 to eight seconds, which means shorter than a goldfish. Given the average human attention span is decreasing, microlearning becomes more and more important because it emphasises short learning duration.\u2014Leong et al., \u201cA review of the trend of microlearning\u201d p. 2, 2020Unfortunately, all too many of us are having \u201csquirrel\u201d days, according to Dr. Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who studies how digital media impacts our lives. In her new book, \u201cAttention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness and Productivity,\u201d Mark explained how decades of research has tracked the decline of the ability to focus.\u201cIn 2004, we measured the average attention on a screen to be 2\u00bd minutes,\u201d Mark said. \u201cSome years later, we found attention spans to be about 75 seconds. Now we find people can only pay attention to one screen for an average of 47 seconds.\u201dNot only do people concentrate for less than a minute on any one screen, Mark said, but when attention is diverted from an active work project, it also takes about 25 minutes to refocus on that task.\u2014Sandee LaMotte, \u201cYour attention span is shrinking, studies say. Here\u2019s how to stay focused\u201d, 2023Tech-savvy users often say that the way the modern internet works has made it so that people\u2019s attention spans are getting shorter every single day but the truth behind this story is rather tough to ascertain. However, recent data from SimilarWeb indicates that people definitely are suffering from shorter attention spans, and what\u2019s more is that these attention spans are shortening at a pretty rapid pace when you take into account the numerous factors that are coming into play, all of which serve some kind of purpose in this trend.If you look at the data for how long users spend on websites before navigating away, for the most part the trend has been that these times are remaining more or less stable on web based browsing, but if you look at the trend for mobile browsing between the years 2017 and 2019 you would see that there is a drop of about 11 seconds in the average time spent on a website. When you take into account the fact that mobile browsing is starting to become a lot more popular and in many ways has become the preferred form of browsing for people on the internet, the change is a lot more drastic.\u2014Zia Muhammad, \u201cResearch Indicates That Attention Spans Are Shortening\u201d, 2020However, as much as technology can be used as an effective learning tool inside and outside the classroom, there\u2019s no denying that one of the biggest challenges faced by educators today is the distraction posed by social media. Students are distracted by their phones during class, and even without that distraction, the time they spend on social media outside the classroom has an impact on their attention spans.\u2014EU Business School, \u201cThe Truth about Decreasing Attention Spans in University Students\u201d, 2022(No link given.)In 2015, a study commissioned by Microsoft and discussed in Time magazine found that the average attention span was in fact only 8 s. If indeed this is the case, then even participating in a 15-min lecture would be positively heroic. To place this in perspective, it was reported in the same Time article, that goldfish, of the piscine rather than snack variety, have an attention span of 9 s, one whole second greater than humans! It is perhaps rather premature to opt for an 8-s lecture format, as there are many caveats to the Time article, not the least of which is that no one knows how to actually measure a goldfish\u2019s attention span. What has been measured is goldfish memory, which, according to researchers in the School of Psychology at the University of Plymouth, is actually quite good (7). Similarly the 8-s attention span for humans actually reflects the average time a person will spend on a web page before looking somewhere else.\u2014Neil A. Bradbury, \u201cAttention span during lectures: 8 seconds, 10 minutes, or more?\u201d, 2016Appendix B: Studies for a Meta-AnalysisI\u2019ll list the closest thing those studies have to a control group, list sorted by year.Studies Using the CPTWhat Determines Continuous Performance Task Performance?

Siegel/Penny V. Corkum, 1993) p. 8-9 contains references to several studies from before 1993 using the CPT on children with ADHD.Appendix C: How I Believed One Might Measure Attention Span Before I Found Out About The CPTBefore I found out about the Continuous Performance Test, I speculated about how to measure attention span:(Note that I\u2019m not a psychometrician, but I like speculating about things, so the ideas below might contain subtle and glaring mistakes. Noting them down here anyway because I might want to implement them at some point.)It seems relatively easy to measure attention span with a power- or speed-test, via one of three methods:Present a stimulus, change the stimulus and let the test subject report the change in stimulus; this results in two numbers: the time between the stimulus being initially being presented and the time it was changed (let\u2019s call this value t_change), and the time between the change of the stimulus and the reporting of the change (calling this value t_report). Performing this test with different value of t_change should result in different values of t_report. There is a t_change for which t_report falls over a threshold value, that t_change can be called the attention span.This method has some disadvantages:It needs a change in stimulus that requires selective attention to notice, but changing e.g. visual stimuli involves motion, which direct attention. (Idea: have a colored stimulus continuously changing color, and a reference color, once the stimulus has the reference color, the subject is supposed to report; avoiding sudden changes in visual stimuli.)The method would require many samples to find the t_change for which t_report falls over the threshold value.Performing the test multiple times in a row might induce mental fatigue, decreasing attention spanLet the test subject engage in a mentally draining exercise like the Stroop test with some performance measure. I would the performance to decline over time, and one could define a threshold value at which the subject \u201cis no longer paying attention\u201d.Let the subject observe a neutral stimulus while measuring some indicator of attention (such as arousal via skin conductivity or the default mode network being inactive), when the measured value falls under/over a threshold the subject has \u201clost attention\u201d.This method has the major disadvantage that it requires special equipment to perform.Such an instrument would of course need to have different forms of reliability and validity, and I think it would probably work best as a power test or a speed test.I\u2019m not sure how such a test would relate to standard IQ tests: would it simply measure a subpart of g, completely independent or just partially related to it?Share this:TwitterFacebookLoading...RelatedMYSTERIOUS MYSTERIES OF UNSOLVED MYSTERY: Call for EntriesJanuary 1, 2023In \"contest\"Your Mystery: Why is autism rare among the Amish?

Not tracking all residents with location? Using E2E? All willful blindness by this logic.\u201dThe effort to eliminate privacy in the name of 'safety' continues. Anything \u2264 total surveillance of everyone = 'willful blindness.'Failing to put cameras in everyone's bedrooms? Not tracking all residents with location? Using E2E? All willful blindness by this logic. https://t.co/GJeedPUbiW\u2014 Meredith Whittaker (@mer__edith) July 14, 2023A threat to E2E encryptionLaw enforcement has long complained about how end-to-end encryption creates what the Department of Justice has called a \u201clawless space that criminals, terrorists, and other bad actors can exploit for their nefarious ends.\u201dTwo Mexican drug cartels trafficking most fentanyl and methamphetamine into America use social media applications to \u201ccoordinate logistics and reach out to victims,\u201d the DEA said in a May press release. The agency named Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat along with encrypted platforms WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, Wire, and Wickr as examples.More than 1,100 cases in a recent DEA operation targeting Mexican drug cartels involved social media applications and encrypted communications platforms through which fentanyl and meth were trafficked, the agency said.\u201cThese social media platforms understand there is no legal application for the sale of many of these substances and yet they continue with impunity,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-IL) said at a Thursday Senate markup hearing for the bill, noting a similar reporting mechanism already in place which requires the companies to report child sexual abuse material.Privacy advocates counter that determining what constitutes child sexual abuse imagery on platforms is much easier than patrolling speech, particularly in various languages and with street slang, to sniff out drug sales.Senator Alex Padilla (D-CA) told the Judiciary Committee that, unlike online sexual imagery of children, language is harder to police on a mass scale since \u201ccontext is pretty important.\u201d\u201cDo we really want to effectively deputize untrained tech companies led by people like Elon Musk to serve as law enforcement?\u201d Padilla said. \u201cThis bill will empower them to disclose people's private data to federal law enforcement without a warrant or oversight based only, on quote, a reasonable belief that someone is committing an offense.\u201dPadilla also criticized the bill for potentially \u201ccriminalizing companies that offer encrypted services,\u201d citing how beneficial encryption has been for people in marginalized communities and women seeking reproductive care in the post Dobbs world.A Thursday press release from sponsor Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) highlighted statistics from the DEA supporting the need for the legislation.Within a five-month period, Shaheen said, DEA investigated 390 drug-poisoning investigations and found that 129 had direct ties to social media.\u201cUnfortunately, federal agencies have not had access to the necessary data to intervene, which has allowed the crisis to worsen,\u201d the press release said.It added that the law will establish a \u201ccomprehensive and standardized reporting regime that would enable the DEA to better identify and dismantle international criminal networks and save American lives.\u201dBut Nojeim said there is a bigger question in play and it is one that society must confront sooner rather than later as all manner of social interactions, and problems, play out online.\u201cWe live our lives online nowadays,\u201d he said. \u201cOne question that we have to answer as a society is whether we want these communication service providers, with whom we can't communicate without, to be close to agents of the government.\u201dThey already are, according to Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of the web communications provider membership association NetChoice. Szabo said social media sites voluntarily work with law enforcement to stop the trafficking of drugs on their sites.He said that if the bill is enacted all reporting by social media sites \u201cwould be subjected to Fourth Amendment processes, and it will actually become harder for law enforcement to identify these threats.\"Tagssocial mediaSenatebilldrugsPrivacy LawPrivacySUZANNE SMALLEYSuzanne Smalley is a reporter covering privacy, disinformation and cybersecurity policy for The Record.

Some of the heavy rendering tasks have been separated internally, to help with performance when zooming, panning and transforming objects. By default, Inkscape will now leverage the power of all your computer's cores when it renders objects, but you can also choose to limit its powers in the preferences.As always, there are a few new features in this release, which have been tested by users during the beta release.Many thanks to everyone who lent a hand with this important step in the process!Among our favorites are several that focus on helping you get things organized and work more efficiently when using Inkscape.Shape Builder toolCombining paths by clicking and dragging to create new paths with the Shape Builder toolInkscape\u2019s new Shape Builder tool helps get the job done quickly and efficiently. You\u2019ll enjoy the overview of all shapes and the ability to select multiple overlapping shapes \u2013 click, or click and drag them. Your objects will retain their original color, too. Shortcuts for this tool include Shift for quickly switching between adding and subtracting parts. There is one caveat for the tool at this time, as it is still pretty new. When you use it with curved shapes, you can end up with paths with a large number of nodes. If you don't need to be really precise, use Ctrl+L or the 'Simplify' LPE to simplify the result. This is on the list to be addressed in a future version of Inkscape.Document Resources DialogThe Document Resources dialog shows statistics about your documentIf you like to efficiently organize your Inkscape documents, this is the tool for you. There are times when being able to quickly see an overview of elements is key \u2013 when sharing a file for commercial printing, for instance. It\u2019s a checklist of resources contained in your document, including patterns, filters, colors, fonts, symbols, markers, and much more.Font collectionsCreating a font collection and filtering by collectionStill on an organizing path, this new button helps those who wrestle with many fonts to categorize them by collections \u2013 and easily and quickly identify which font(s) to grab for which contract or client or custom project. Or you can organize them by style \u2013 cursive, funny, serif, sans-serif... There\u2019s a new icon to help you find those collections.PatternsAdjusting pattern parameters in the Pattern EditorNot only do you have access to a funky and practical library of patterns within Inkscape, there\u2019s a new pattern editor that enables you to adjust a pattern. In addition to being very useful, it\u2019s also fun to explore... have fun playing with shape, size, and rotation with these repeats. Change colors for your version of a pattern and adapt the offset, too.For your inner organizer, the patterns are now categorized into collections here, so they\u2019re easier to find a second time.Inkscape 1.3 has plenty to offer in terms of improvements to the features you know and love already. We\u2019ve put together a short list of ones to check out first:Layers and Objects dialogSetting opacity and blend mode in the Layers and Objects dialogThe search box is back! Create and filter by name. The improved Objects dialog allows you to once more use the slider to adjust the opacity or blending mode of a layer, and drag multiple objects to hide or lock them in a single swipe; done. You\u2019ll also enjoy the shortcuts for navigating and tweaking \u2013 the arrow keys, space bar and shift key all have roles.Persistent snap barFor those of you who use snapping, you\u2019ll be able to once again quickly adjust the snap settings. For those of you who haven\u2019t played with this feature, now\u2019s the time to test it out.Page margins and bleedSetting page marginsWhen you\u2019re prepping your document for print (in RGB, of course), you now have more control over margins and bleed. You\u2019ll spot the new round handles in the middle of the page borders. Simply click and drag them to set your margins. When it comes to the red boundary for the bleed margin, you can edit it from the tool controls bar, in a fly-out menu that allows you to customize your document.Lasso selection for nodesBeing a node ranger just got easier! You\u2019ll appreciate being able to hold the Alt key and draw to select nodes that are hard to select with rectangle selection.Selecting nodes by drawing around themLive Path Effects (LPE) dialog redesignRedesigned LPE dialog for quick and easy accessIf you ever wanted to get a better handle on your LPE situation, this revamped dialog delivers just that. See an overview of your stack unfolded and enjoy a quicker way to add a new LPE to your work all while making it easier to see which one you\u2019ve got selected.PDF import rewrittenInformative and feature-rich PDF import dialogInkscape\u2019s PDF importer has undergone an overhaul. You\u2019ll find a new dialog with an overview of what Inkscape will do with each font it finds in your PDF, and more.  Node deletion logic changedInkscape guessing the desired result when deleting nodes (mostly smooth results)Deleting nodes now doesn\u2019t always behave the same, as Inkscape tries to detect whether you want the result to be a straight line connecting the nodes, or whether you want the result to be a round and smooth curve.Pinned colors in paletteWe\u2019re working hard to help you find the colors you need to succeed. Choose and pin the most important colors from a palette and keep them at your fingertips. Then unpin the ones you don\u2019t need. Customize the size of the color swatches, too. This is practical when you\u2019ve got a project with a specific color palette to respect.

The UI is the exact opposite of how I expect things to work.It's improving at breakneck speed though. 1.2 already solved some of my frustrations (the new interface for linecaps & line dots, amazing!)Almost all the features in this release seem to solve a major frustration I had with Inkscape.* The node deletion behavior, it was so annoying, how you delete a node on a straight line and suddenly you get some soup.* The awful color palette. You had to manually edit text files to get your own palettes, couldn't edit them in Inkscape. I, in fact, never managed to create a custom palette. Pinned colors seem to solve this.* Lasso selection. It was soo fiddly to select a group of nodes. One missclick and you had to start from scratch, clicking on the tinny controls.* Multithreaded rendering. The single-threaded software renderer is a misery for complex projects, or just zooming in. Now Inkscape is going to be 12 times faster on my machine* Font selection was utter garbage, the new UI seems promising* Patterns was also a constant source of frustration, looks like this release improves it.This is exciting. I'm looking forward to use this new release.Now please give me a dialog for key rebinding, similar to Krita. And better key binding discoverability.replyAdamBelis 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]you still cannot create color pallets easily/user-friendly , we did not implemented this yet.you can expect some performance gains but not really 12x it does not scale lineri .you can edit SOME keyboard shortcuts in preference - Interface -keyboard .Some (a lot) of actions are still not migrated to actions so you cannot change shortcuts easily. But this is ongoing process.replyauveair 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I love Inkscape so much, thank you and all of the team for this release :)replyrice7th 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Inkscape also has an experimental OpenGL backend that seems fairly stable. When I tested it, it seemed pretty stable and glitchless. I hope it will replace the Cairo backend soon, since OpenGL will give Inkscape even MORE performance!replyandrea76 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> Now please give me a dialog for key rebinding, similar to Krita. And better key binding discoverability.Krita is using the default KDE key binding dialog box. I don't know is there something similiar in GTK.replymyfonj 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As for discoverability (of keyboard shortcuts as well as commands), few versions back Inkscape introduced `View > Command Palette`, by default bound to \"`?`\" key:https://inkscape.org/doc/keys-1.3.x.html#idm734It allows you to search for command by name and \"tooltip description\" and displays their assigned shortcuts. This is IMO the one of the few recent features that should be implemented in all applications. In Inkscape it is not as smooth as in IDEs, has somewhat slow first run, but I'm super glad it is even there.replysprucevoid 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The command palette in the Windows version of Inkscape is inexplicably slow very often, not only on first run. 5 seconds to open slow. Is it spending time making fancy command predictions? Does it request and rebuild a list of existing commands each time? It is also missing some commands, like the Shape Builder tool. I'd rather have a stupid static list of all possible commands that opens instantly and filters super quickly as you type.replymyfonj 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, there is a huge space for improvements there, besides sup-par speed, strange filtering and ordering, unintuitive focus management \u2026 but at least it is there and has chance to evolve. I'm quite convinced, that even five seconds delay of (each) command palette invocation is most of the times better than mindlessly sifting through menus and keyboard settings. And as always, the \"happy path\" is to to use it just once and memorise the direct shortcut of desired command, so next time there will be not use for the palette.reply_s_a_m_ 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The UI is garbage. It's like GIMP. I'm more than happy to pay for software especially when it has a well designed (user first) UI. It is not only the UI, it is the UX generally.

The benefit is that loadtime is much faster when only select fonts from a much larger collection have been installed into the system.I tried the font browser dialogue in inkscape and it was not on par with what I'm already doing. I also tried FontBase but was just not thrilled with the some features being paywalled behind a FontBase Awesome Subscription model. While nexusfont has less polish, it also has less B.S..replyHamcha 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]As an Affinity Designer user, it's insane too see how close we went from only Illustrator having Shape Builder to both Designer and Inkscape releasing it so close together. It's super handy and happy to see it as an option everywhere now.Honestly if they focused on cleaning up the UI I could see myself trying out Inkscape more seriously!replyAdamBelis 1 day ago | parent | next [\u2013]We are slowly working also on thatreplyjosiahpeters 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]How does on get involved to help with the UI challenges/improvements?replyRicoElectrico 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I bought Designer and Photo just a few months before 2.0 came out, and just before the window for free upgrade for existing customers begun.I have to say it's more performant than Inkscape, clearly geared towards artists, but there are still stuff that are more easily done in Inkscape. These mostly relate to automation. To add insult to the injury there is NO plugin system for Designer. I think this is a huge oversight on Serif's part, people would be so happy to fill the gaps.replyHamcha 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Indeed, another annoyance I have with Designer is how not purely vector it is. I mean it's great and makes it a breeze to make documents but it really sucks for making web-targeted SVGs. Both Inkscape and Illustrator support using SVG as the project file and I never have to guess if the feature I'm using is going to actually export as vector or just rasterized and embedded as a base64 PNG (which is true for fancy gradients and some of the more advanced masking, not even just the raster persona stuff).replyfinchisko 22 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]which version of designer have it? i didn\u2019t upgrade to latest yet.replyHamcha 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]2.0 and up.Honestly you better save your money if you can live without it. I've been using 1.x for years and they never asked for more money so I upgraded to show my support but I don't really think it's worth forking that much amount of money yet if you're happy with 1.xreplyjillesvangurp 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Looks like usability on mac improved massively between version 1 and this version. Version 1.0 was barely usable on a mac. I just tried version 1.3 out for a few minutes. The UI looks very slick and responsive compared to what I last saw. I'm not a designer but this looks like I could use it and would probably experience a bit of a learning curve. It's a bit intimidating with all the buttons on all sides of the window.replyafandian 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]I love Inkscape but for as long as I can remember it's always been laggy on a Mac. IIRC at one point there was a disclaimer on the website that the Mac version wasn't well maintained.I'm running Inkscape 1.1 on an M1 Pro. I just measured time between clicking a plain rectangle and it being selected. It takes about 460 ms.New 1.3 version takes 216 ms, about twice the speed.

I especially like how one can align all the things rather easily and exactly, without having to trust ones mouse pointer movement skills and helper lines. Of course SVG is also about exactness, so a tool working with SVGs should also allow you to do things exactly.replyfareesh 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]Since Figma has gotten better and better, I have significantly reduced my usage of Inkscape, however, when dealing with SVGs I find that Inkscape is really good for solving bugs with the SVG exports from Figma.This seems to be my only use-case currently. It also has several very useful features like crop-to-content for SVG.replynforgerit 21 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I vividly remember \"designing\" (with my light skills) a T-Shirt using Inkscape for a sports team back at university in ~2008. It was organized as a competition with the winner getting a free shirt.IIRC it took me about 6h, the Inkscape UI was frustrating at first but eventually I got better at it and won the contest. Such a fun seeing other people running around the city of Karlsruhe (Germany) wearing my shirt.Thank you Inkscape team! I'm seeing as much potential as with Blender in kicking some commercial vendor's butts!replyFreak_NL 1 day ago | prev | next [\u2013]There is a lot in this release that I'll readily use. Pinned colours and font collections in particular seem useful, but I'm looking forward to seeing how the improved node deletion logic works too. Deleting nodes used to have unintuitive effects on the path; not in terms of its shape, but in the distribution of the nodes on the section where you deleted one.replylol768 22 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]Does the PDF import work for anyone?

For me the best experience used to be with 0.92 and since then it has significantly degraded, with counter-intuitive things happening all the time in the UI. One of the operations I find the most complicated is to place circles at specific positions. I only know how to adjust their size and left position but as I'm using inkscape to design drill positions, it's a real pain for me to have to mentally subtract the radius and the line width. And in general, I find everything related to movements, alignments and such particularly difficult, to the point that generally you have to find a video showing a trick to proceed efficiently.replyplanede 21 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]You can adjust the radius of a circle when the circle tool is selected.

Overall I am quite happy with the features, the UI and the UX.My main pain point is drawing vector curves. I cannot seem to get the intuition on how to rapidly draw curves, and it seems I need to switch tools to remove anchors and modify curvature. In Illustrator I used one tool and a few keyboard shortcuts and could trace fast.Maybe it's just that I never fully learned the Inkscape way.

Usually fairly detailed, but mostly useful to get a sense of proportion and to design the basic layout of things like built-in closets.Inkscape's snapping, aligning, and layering features make it a good tool for this as long as you need nothing more than 2D views.I also use Inkscape to prepare the (plywood, MDF) sheet sawing instructions for the lumber yard. They love it when customers present them with a clear overview for the cuts (and I love it when wood I order is cut correctly). For me it's useful to use a single sheet as economically as possible.replyduckmysick 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's awesome, thank you.

While the lowercase \ud835\udd69 (subject role) is more common, uppercase makes it a function and is useful in functional programming. More visibility for the character is helpful if it means wider font support, although the real sticking point has been lousy UTF-16 handling on Windows.

In LaTeX you can have actual boldface letters, so you should write a boldface letter R to represent the real numbers and so on. Using \"blackboard bold\" in print looks terribly off to some (many?) people.replySkeime 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I strongly disagree that the bold symbols are better, even though they\u2019re what blackboard bold was originally conceived to approximate. The reason: Bold font draws attention (ask a typographer about type color), but usually, the bolder symbols are not the ones requiring that attention. (If I read a text about real analysis, I know that the domains and codomains will be the real numbers, for example.) The blackboard bold versions stick out much less when looking at the greater composition of the page.replyenriquto 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I respect your opinion, and agree that with some particularly \"thin\" fonts (most notably, Computer Modern and its variants), the associated bold symbols are too exaggerated and produce and ugly effect.But there is certainly some dependency on the font. For example, the Baskerville used by the Publications de l'IH\u00c9S is a much thicker font, and the bold letters flow very naturally. Look for example herehttp://www.numdam.org/item/PMIHES/The publications in the sixties and seventies, which are scanned, are very beautiful and the bold letters mix smoothly in the text. You cannot see them \"from far away\" as happens with Computer Modern.Curiously, the modern pdfs look slightly different, with apparently thinner fonts. This may be an effect of printing, that smears the ink a bit and produces slightly thicker type?replymarcelluspye 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I hated when textbooks/papers did this. Half the time you can't tell if they meant to use the bold letter or if the printer was just being generous on that character. Made legibility quite a bit more difficult.

Coming from a non-math background, having only one symbol to deal with feels less confusing than switching around symbols based on the medium it happens to be written on. Did one of the symbols come \"first\"?replyenriquto 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Here you have the whole history:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_boldSummary: boldface came first, in print, and was widely used. Much later, some mathematicians started to write blackboard bold on blackboards (because actual bold would be very untoward to write on a blackboard). Then, the usage was backported to print.I find it ugly, a sort of breaking \"suspension of disbelief\", I don't know how to explain why. Some sort of \"anachronistic\" feeling, like watching a movie about the roman empire and some soldiers wear watches.EDIT: as for having \"different symbols\", this is not the case. They are exactly the same symbol, with different faces. Like when you write the letters \"a\" or \"g\" very different on a blackboard as they appear on print.replyskoob 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's pretty typical for how typography develops. Majuscule and miniscule letters were just two different styles of writing the same letter. But eventually, people started using majuscule (i.e uppercase) letters to give emphasis to the beginning of sentences or certain words, like names.Italic typefaces were created by Italian type designers to mimic the cursive handwriting of the time. They weren't meant to be mixed with roman style typefaces. However, typesetters who had access to both roman and italic fonts started to use italic for emphasis when typesetting texts in roman type.And of course blackletter is also just a style that originally tried to mimic earlier handwriting.replydietrichepp 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It sounds similar to the division between \u201cmath\u201d and \u201cmaths\u201d.

Boldface is obviously common in places where BB is unavailable, more restrictive, more difficult. Web publishing is a great example.BB is common, in my experience, in hand-written text where bold isn't really an option. It is, to my tradition, the most common and recognizable way to indicate the most common field sets and also generally is a good stand-in for any \"large category\" of interest.Bold is used intermittently in my experience, probably due to its inability to be hand-written. To me, it tends to mean \"vector\" or \"matrix\" much more than set. In hand-written forms, I sometimes see \"arrow hats\" instead, especially for vectors.replyBlackFingolfin 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> \"Publications Math\u00e9matiques de l'IH\u00c9S\" which is the undisputed gold standard in mathematical typography.It is? Do you have any supporting evidence for this claim?I just had a look at a bunch of recent articles, and I would very much dispute it. I saw nothing extraordinary, and found the fonts they used rather ugly (though of course that is highly subjective). The use of bold face to highlight theorem/definition/etc. numbers is IMHO very questionable. The boldface letters you praise stick out like a sore thumb, feeling as if they were being emphasized and highlighted when they clearly are not meant to be.replyenriquto 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It is? Do you have any supporting evidence for this claim?I don't have any evidence to support this claim. I always thought about it as self-evident, because it was in that journal that Grothendieck published his work, and the same style is used in by the legendary Hermann editor from Paris and by Bourbaki. But I cannot find any non-partisan source of my claim. As for non-neutral sources, you have for example the congratulations on the typesetting by Dieudonn\u00e9e [0] (who was a member of the IHES), or a more recent article by Haralambous about the Baskerville variant used by the institute [1].

Note: not the folklore of math! The folklore of mathematical typesetting, which is a tiny community.You can find many old and new math texts using either convention. Most often readers won't even notice. There are authors who are adamant against blackboard bold, most famously Donald Knuth and Jean-Pierre Serre. Others simply use regular boldface because of tradition, or because it's the default style of the journal. Most people don't care too much. But I have also heard people expressing strong opinions on each side, that's why I made the analogy with tabs-vs-spaces. Nothing too serious.Elegance is entirely subjective. I have the opposite opinion: if we can do real boldface in print, which is the original usage, what's the point of using a black-board version? We have the real thing! But I also understand the opposite opinion, voiced elsewhere in this thread, that open bold lettering is a new case, like italics or fraktur, and we can use it freely in print.replyjdrek1 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> In LaTeX you can have actual boldface letters, so you should write a boldface letter R to represent the real numbers and so on.Almost [1] every single student absolutely hates that notation in scripts.

I don't know a single person who thinks this is a good idea, even the professors writing their scripts like that think it's stupid and are only doing it due to some nonsense fear of it otherwise not printing correctly due to one single bad experience with a shitty printer in 1950.

If this is TLDR, the key feature relating to the topic at hand is the point about handling mathematical symbols, so skip everything except that one.* Pre-parse the entire page and count the number of characters that would be read using a multi-word description. While doing this, create sub-counts of characters that fall into each Unicode script (Latin, Cyrillic, mathematical notation, etc.).* If the number of characters that would be read using a multi-word description exceeds a user-specified threshold, prompt the user for how to proceed.* First, tell the user how many different Unicode scripts (and blocks if necessary[2]) are contained on the page. For each set, prompt using the following logic if the user hasn't already set a default:** If a script/block/whatever consists of abstract symbols, like the mathematical set, offer to read it using the closest approximation in the character set it's derived from. e.g. for \ud835\udd4f, read it as \"X\" instead of \"mathematical double-struck capital X\".

I can't think of anything else that would make sense.Throwing 44 billion dollars on a company and then gutting it for everything that was valuable including a unique brand that had even its own verb?But the sad reality is probably that a 12 years old narcissist edgelord in the body of a billionaire wanted a vanity plate.replybamfly 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The initially-too-high offer plus downturn in his stock value right after, meant a deal structure that damn-near doomed the company anyway (tons of debt).Best-case (for him), Twitter as we knew it dies and he manages to turn the burnt-down ashes into something profitable enough to overcome that hurdle. Twitter per se cannot reasonably get out of the hole he's dug for it.Though, arguably, the brand itself was a huge part of the value, and he just threw that in the trash.You know a guy's going down a weird path when all defenses of his behavior amount to \"I know the last twenty things he's done have looked insane and none of it's made any money, but he's got a secret genius plan, I swear! 5D chess!\"replyuptown 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Seems like a reasonable theory if it's the price to be paid by those in power to avoid future revolutions.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Revolutionreplysamr71 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Or to foment one of his own ;)replytoast0 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]This would explain things, if there was a credible suggestion for who's pulling the strings.The theory of Elop destroying Nokia (consumer) makes sense, because he was at Microsoft, went to Nokia sold it to Microsoft at diminished value and stayed there for a good amount of time. But who would pay Musk for this? And how will he be compensated? Afaik, he's lighting a bunch of his own money on fire. Although, there has been a lot less news from him on Tesla and SpaceX, so maybe it was all a plan to keep him out of those spaces.replypferde 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I've seen theories about Saudis paying for this in order to prevent the next Arab Spring, in which Twitter played a key role for the protesters to organize themselves.
