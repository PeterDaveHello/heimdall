Some of the worst provisions had been thankfully watered down, but the basic strategy of trying to delay the teaching of subjects like algebra remained. It\u2019s a sign that the so-called \u201cprogressive\u201d approach to math education championed by people like Stanford\u2019s Jo Boaler has not yet engendered a critical mass of pushback.And meanwhile, the idea that teaching kids less math will create \u201cequity\u201d has spread far beyond the Golden State. The city of Cambridge, Massachusetts recently removed algebra and all advanced math from its junior high schools, on similar \u201cequity\u201d grounds.It is difficult to find words to describe how bad this idea is without descending into abject rudeness. The idea that offering children fewer educational resources through the public school system will help the poor kids catch up with rich ones, or help the Black kids catch up with the White and Asian ones, is unsupported by any available evidence of which I am aware. More fundamentally, though, it runs counter to the whole reason that public schools exist in the first place.The idea behind universal public education is that all children \u2014 or almost all, making allowance for those with severe learning disabilities \u2014 are fundamentally educable. It is the idea that there is some set of subjects \u2014 reading, writing, basic mathematics, etc. \u2014 that essentially all children can learn, if sufficient resources are invested in teaching them.Before public education \u2014 one of the key crusades of the original Progressive movement \u2014 only private actors invested resources in educating children. Families taught their kids skills, rich families hired tutors, companies trained their workers, churches provided some classes, etc. But it was a threadbare, uneven patchwork. Worse, it was highly unequal \u2014 if you weren\u2019t born to a family with lots of time and/or money to spare, you didn\u2019t get nearly as much education. This led to inequality throughout society, as well as the preservation of intergenerational wealth. Furthermore, it wasted much of society\u2019s productive potential, because the unlucky kids weren\u2019t learning as many useful skills as they could have been.Universal public education was a way to attack all of these problems at once. By investing state resources in childhood education, it not only boosted human capital and economic growth, it eroded inequality of birth and circumstance. Teachers, hired by the state, provided some of what poor kids\u2019 families couldn\u2019t provide. Everyone except for a very few fringe ideologues now agrees that this model was a success; public education is pretty much universally believed to be a key input into economic development, and plenty of research supports that notion that it fosters intergenerational mobility as well. It is not a perfect equalizer and never will be, but it is one of the more important equalizers that exist in our society.When you ban or discourage the teaching of a subject like algebra in junior high schools, what you are doing is withdrawing state resources from public education. There is a thing you could be teaching kids how to do, but instead you are refusing to teach it. In what way is refusing to use state resources to teach children an important skill \u201cprogressive\u201d? How would this further the goal of equity?I can easily see one (very twisted) perspective that might lead someone to think it would do so. If you take a strongly \u201chereditarian\u201d view toward education, then you believe that inborn mental ability \u2014 what we typically call \u201cIQ\u201d \u2014 determines most of what people can and can\u2019t learn. If you are a strong hereditarian, then perhaps you believe that students who don\u2019t learn algebra well are simply born without the cognitive ability to learn it.And if you believe that, then you might conclude that the only way to create equity in society would be to handicap the kids who were born with the ability to learn algebra. Like the Handicapper General in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s satirical sci-fi short story \u201cHarrison Bergeron\u201d, you might try to kneecap the opportunities of the kids you believed to be the genetic elite. In doing so, you would then become a living, breathing embodiment of this meme that opponents of equity created in order to ridicule the whole idea:Now, if you went up and asked \u201cprogressive\u201d educators like Jo Boaler if they believed in a version of hereditarianism so strong as to make Charles Murray himself blush, they would undoubtedly deny that they do. And I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t consciously think that math ability is all in the genes. But when you think about the idea of creating equity by restricting access to advanced math classes, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to avoid the conclusion that the idea is to make all kids equal by making them equally unable to learn.But whatever you think about the morality of this idea, it simply will not work. The reason is that the strong hereditarian hypothesis is wrong; practically all kids are educable, with the proper investment of resources.I know this from personal experience. I was a math tutor for many years, in high school and college, and part of that was volunteer work tutoring poor Black and Hispanic kids. Guess what? They learned a lot of math! But this isn\u2019t just my own anecdote; evidence consistently shows that tutoring is highly effective. Nickow, Oreopoulos, and Quan (2020) surveyed 96 studies using a variety of different tutoring approaches in a variety of different contexts. Here\u2019s a summary of what they found:We found that tutoring is remarkably effective at helping students learn, with over 80% of the 96 included studies reporting statistically significant effects. Averaging results across the studies included in this analysis, we found a pooled effect size of 0.37 standard deviations. In other words, with the help of tutoring, a student at the 50th percentile would improve to the 66th percentile. In the field of K-12 education research where there is little agreement on what works, these findings are remarkable not only for their magnitude but also for their consistency. The evidence is clear that tutoring can reliably help students catch up.The effectiveness of tutoring can help us understand achievement gaps in math classes. Some students do well because of greater preparation \u2014 they show up already knowing much of the material, or having the general concepts in place to pick it up quickly. This is because they had a tutor at home growing up: their parents, who had the leisure time and educational background required to teach their kids some math. A few rich parents also hire private tutors, but the main tutors are almost always Mom and Dad.Now imagine what will happen if we ban kids from learning algebra in public junior high schools. The kids who have the most family resources \u2014 the rich kids, the kids with educated parents, etc. \u2014 will be able to use those resources to compensate for the retreat of the state. Either their parents will teach them algebra at home, or hire tutors, or even withdraw them to private schools. Meanwhile, the kids without family resources will be out of luck; since the state was the only actor who could have taught them algebra in junior high, there\u2019s now simply no one to teach them. The rich kids will learn algebra and the poor kids will not.That will not be an equitable outcome.Taken to its logical extreme, the idea of restricting what can be taught in public schools \u2014 for whatever reason \u2014 leads us back to the pre-public-school era. It leads us to a world of private schools and home schooling. That\u2019s not an era we should seek to return to. Nor am I being hyperbolic; Cambridge\u2019s restriction of junior high algebra is effectively a small step toward that bygone era, since kids with resources will just learn algebra from their parents or be pulled out into private schools.So what should we do instead? Dallas came up with an answer: Teach kids more math instead of teaching them less. In 2019, Dallas Independent School District implemented a new equity policy that encouraged many more people to take honors math classes:Many capable Hispanic, Black and English learner students did not elect to join these classes on their own or were passed over by their instructors. And their parents were often unaware they could make the request. Dallas ISD, which serves some 142,000 children, took note of the disparity and in 2017 formed a racial equity advisory council \u2014 some of whose members had children in the district \u2014 with the goal of improving opportunity for all\u2026It decided to move from an opt-in model to an opt-out policy in the 2019-20 school year. Since then\u2026students cannot opt out [of advances classes] without written parent permission. The move has dramatically increased participation among traditionally marginalized children.The results were pretty incredible. First of all, many more students enrolled in honors math:Source: Dallas Independent School District via The74Before the change, three times as many White students as Black students enrolled in honors math; after the change, it was less than twice as many. Not perfect equity, but progress in that direction.But did all these new students actually learn the honors math? Yes, indeed they did:And the policy has not led to a decrease in student scores as some speculated: Last year\u2019s 8th-grade Algebra I students had similar pass rates as those in years prior, the district said, with 95% of Hispanic students passing the test and 76% meeting grade-level proficiency; 91% of Black students passing and 65% meeting grade level and 95% of English learner students passing the state exam and 74% meeting grade level. Guess what? Children are educable. If you invest the resources of the state in poor kids and underrepresented minorities, they will learn. The true path toward equity is to have the state teach more, not less. Instead of trying to prevent the well-prepared kids from learning algebra, invest more in teaching algebra to the disadvantaged kids!How did we end up in a world where \u201cprogressive\u201d places like California and Cambridge, Massachusetts believe in teaching children less math via the public school system, while a city in Texas believes in and invests in its disadvantaged kids? What combination of performativity, laziness, and tacit disbelief in human potential made the degradation of public education a \u201cprogressive\u201d cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre? I cannot answer this question; all I know is that the \u201cteach less math\u201d approach will work against the cause of equity, while also weakening the human capital of the American workforce in the process.We created public schools for a reason, and that reason still makes sense. Teach the kids math. They can learn.SubscribeShare380 Likes\u00b727 Restacks380113SharePreviousNext",

However, 3 would be fine for demo purposes.Model files will be cached and you won't need to download them each time.LOAD MODELRUNReadyFollow me on GitHubFAQQ: What if I get protobuf parsing failed error?A: Open DevTools, go to Application -> Storage and press \"Clear site data\".Q: What if I get sbox_fatal_memory_exceeded?A: You don't have enough RAM to run SD. You can try reloading the tab or browser.Q: How did you make it possible?A: In order to run it, I had to port StableDiffusionPipeline from python to JS. Then patch onnxruntime and emscripten+binaryen (WebAssembly compiler toolchain) to support allocating and using >4GB memory. Once my pull requests get to release, anyone would be able to compile and run code that uses >4GB in the browser.Q: Why is it so slow?A: It does not support multi-threading yet, so is using just one CPU core. There is no way to create 64 bit memory with SharedArrayBuffer through WebAssembly.Memory constructor. I\u2019ve proposed a spec change to have \u201cmemory64\u201d flag and after it\u2019s accepted, i will patch V8 engine to support it.Q: But it\u2019s running on a GPU, right?A: Yes, but webgpu is onnxruntime is in early stage, so a lot of operations are not yet implemented. And data is constantly transferred from and to CPU through JS. Once the majority of operations will have their JS kernels, it will be way faster.Q: Can I run it locally?A: Yes, this page\u2019s code is available here: https://github.com/dakenf/stable-diffusion-webgpu-minimalQ: Can I use your patched onnxruntime to run big LLMs with transformers.js?A: Yes, you can use this package but i don\u2019t guarantee it will be working in all cases. This build is limited to 8GB of memory, so you can load up to ~4GB weights. Just use https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aislamov/onnxruntime-web64Q: Are you going to make a pull request in onnxruntime repo?A: Yes. It will be my second one, i\u2019ve added GPU acceleration to node.js binding earlier.",

I'm just pointing it out. For good or bad, it is what it is. There are two sides to it. For anyone familiar with system theory, this was the inevitable end game of the web.However, the web also has a terrible bloat/legacy issue it refuses to deal with. So sooner or later, a new minimal platform will grow from within it, the way the web started in the 90s as the then humble browser. And the web will be replaced.replyanon35 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think we've already seen the first shoots from that nascent new system: https://webassembly.org/. And this hilarious talk will continued to be viewed by future generations for marking the 2013 inflection point: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death...reply3cats-in-a-coat 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I had great expectations of WASM, and maybe it can evolve into what we're discussing. But as it is, this system is too limited in two crucial ways.First, it's explicitly designed to be easy to port existing software to. Like C libraries, say. Sounds good right? Well, it's not designed as a platform that arose from the needs of the users, like the web did. But the need of developers porting software, who previously compiled C libraries to JS gibberish and had to deal with garbage collection bottlenecks etc. This seems fairly narrow. WASM has almost no contact surface with the rest of the browser, aside from raw compute. It can't access DOM, or GPU or anything (last I checked).Second, for reasons of safety, they eliminated jumps from the code. Instead it's structured, like a high-level language. It has an explicit call stack and everything. Which is great, except this is a complete mismatch for all new generation languages like Go, Rust etc. which focus heavily on concurrency, coroutines, generators, async functions etc. Translating code like that to WASM requires workarounds with significant performance penalty.replynaillo 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]WASM can access the GPU via middle layers like SDL. I.e. you can write a C program that uses opengl and compile it and as long as you include the right flags etc into `emcc` you will barely need to touch or glue it together on the JS side at all.reply3cats-in-a-coat 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]All those go through JS as far as I'm aware. Emscripten bridges everything for you, but technically it goes through JS so SDL's calls also go through JS.replynaillo 40 minutes ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You're correct but I don't see why that matters. From your perspective as a C coder you get webgl access without having to write JS, that's what's important. Everything is \"mixed together\" into asm in the end anyway whether it's glue code in JS or browser side glue code.replybawolff 1 day ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Its not a criticism that this is neccesary, its a criticism that it is possible to even do this in a browser.replyesperent 1 day ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]But why is that a criticism? I tried running SD on my computer a few months ago. I spent several hours trying to install the dependencies and eventually gave up. I'm sure it wouldn't have been a big deal for someone familiar with python but for me it was a massive hassle and I eventually failed to make it run at all.For this one, as long as my browser supports WebGPU (which will be widely supported soon) and I have the system resources, it will run. Barely any technical knowledge needed, doesn't matter what OS or brand of GPU I have. Isn't that really cool? It reduces both technical and knowledge based barriers to entry. Why do people criticize this so strongly?replyfiloleg 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]After seeing the sort of argument you are replying to countless times on HN, I came to a simple conclusion. Some people, esp on HN, just have disdain for anyone who might not be willing to deal with the hubris of running a piece of software, because it invites \"lower common denominator\", and they don't want to \"taint\" their hobby by the presence of \"normies\" in what used to be their exclusive domain.In a similar vein, you can find plenty of comments on HN faulting the massive proliferation of smartphones among the general population throughout 2010s for \"ruining\" web, software ecosystems, application paradigms, etc. There are plenty of things one could potentially criticize smartphones for, and some of that criticism indeed has merit. But this specific point about \"ruining\" things feels almost like a different version of the same argument above - niche things becoming widely adopted by the masses and \"ruining\" their \"cool kids club.\"Another similar example from an entirely unrelated domain - comic books and their explosion in popularity after Marvel movies repeatedly killing it in the box office. I don't even like Marvel movies, barely watched any of them, but the elitism around hating things becoming more popular is just silly.replybawolff 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's a pretty weird conclusion to draw.The objection (more surprise than objection) is that web browsers are supposed to be sandboxed environments. They are not supposed to be able to do things that negatively impact system performance. It is surprising you can do things involving multi-gb of ram in a web browser. It has nothing to do with what you are using that ram for or if its cool or not.I dont think anybody has an objection to making it easier to run stable diffusion and i think the only way you could come to that conclusion is intentionally misunterpreting people's comments.replyquickthrower2 1 day ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The web ate Java's original premise.replyDrScientist 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes on the client, no on the server.Java's real success was ( and still is ) on the server - powering a whole generation of internet applications, and creating a cross vendor ecosystem that stopped MS leveraging it's client dominance to take over the server space as well.I don't believe Unix/Linux would have survived the Windows server onslaught without Java on the backend and the web on the front.replyjholman 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]It's true that the server is where Java has been most successful, by a large margin.But it was never Java's \"original premise\", which is what the comment you are replying to was about. According to their (very heavy-handed) marketing at the time, Java was supposed to be for native desktop applications and for \"applets\". But yeah, in the many years it took for those promises to truly become hollow, Java carved out a surprisingly robust niche for itself on the enterprise server.Also, I am skeptical of this last sentence of yours. The thing that resisted the Windows server onslaught, broadly, was the wide range of free-as-in-speech-and-as-in-beer backend technologies, like Perl, PHP, Python, Postgres, and some other things that start with \"P\", as well as, yeah, Java. Java played a role, but it was just one of many.replynunobrito 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Java was created from the beginning for embedded devices. Most people don't realize that is has been there since the beginning on each Nokia 3310 device all the way up to most Android apps on the newest smartphones.On the desktop we had Swing which was OKish to build GUI apps (albeit still underneath Borland) and then totally lost sight of desktop with JavaFX that was created without hearing the community and then abandoned, also refusing to improve Swing. Quite a pity.replyquickthrower2 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Definitely agree. Java massively succeeded on the server.

Of course there are still things you'd have to monitor (e.g. network requests) to fully trust any web app. A good solution could be something like OpenBSD's pledge, to allow me to prove to the user nothing malicious is possible (e.g. by disabling fetch and any new requests, even from src attributes, altogether).replyWaterluvian 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]As a sandbox, I especially like that there's a dropdown with a huge list of things a website/app can do.

That's valuable but the flaws of previous systems wasn't that the programs in those systems were exploitable but that the virtual machines were. Some of this was due to the fact that the underlying virtual machines, like the JVM, were de-facto unconstrained and the web use case attempted to add constraitns on after the fact; obviously webassembly has been designed differently.I hope wasm sees more mitigations, but I also expect that wasm is going to be a target primarily for memory safe languages where these problems are already significantly less significant.

Websites could deliver prompts only, perhaps rendering different images for different users.That's a fascinating possibility, but we're very far from that world right now: elsewhere in the thread it's mentioned that this actively uses 8 GB of RAM. And I doubt many web designers would accept the risk that a model misinterprets a prompt, produces distorted output (like the wrong number of fingers on someone's hands), or accidentally produces sexual or violent content in a context where it's not intended.For many generative image models today, people often pick the best of a dozen or more images, and the others that they throw away may actually be quite bad.The quality and predictability of the models would need to be significantly higher than it is now in order to routinely dynamically illustrate web sites.But I don't want to say that we'll never get there.

It's available in four weights \u2013 Book, Regular, Semibold and Bold.In cases where Sweden Sans can\u2019t be used, Noto Sans acts as replacement and/or supporting typface.Sweden Sans is the key element in the Sweden Brand Identity. It works to maintain consistency, create clarity, and handle the Sweden brand legacy. Sweden Sans is always used when it\u00b4s important to fully own the brand expression.Noto Sans is the alternative (secondary) and supporting typeface to Sweden Sans, and replacement typeface for non-roman languages/special characters, as well as fallback for special weights (i.e. italics).

Following a structured rhythm, this hierarchy allows for a general baseline of 6px steps. This gives us a balanced correlation when moving between different sizes and typographic combinations, without losing the overall expression.Labels are used sparingly together with headlines that are linked to a specific offering or category. It helps the user quickly sort information and link it directly to a category or offer. They are primarily used on the cards in our hero space, describing selected projects, core values or other important editorial content.Note: All styles may be used in white against dark backgrounds with the exception of links.SpacingTo ensure rational and continuous typographical flow throughout the platform, all line heights are defined through our baseline grid (one line every 6px). All spacing is optically set according to this baseline in perfect balance with the different line heights. The general rule is this: Bigger headline equals bigger spacing between headline and paragraph.WritingUse sentence case or lowercase as much as possible in all context. Our brand should speak to our audiences, not shout at them.Uppercase should only be used if needed, and with a maximum of 1 to 3 characters, e.g., category label in a website.Right to left hand readingWhen sub-logos and content are based on Arabic text, please follow this example.AlignmentText should always be left aligned.Sender system should always be left aligned.Logos within sender system should be centered.ApplicationsHere you'll find a selection of typography applications.Takeaway: usage of the Sweden Sans familySemibold in logotype,Sweden Sans Bold in headline,Sweden Sans Book in textPreviousAccessibilityNextGrid\u00a9 Sweden | Powered by deBroomeWe use cookies to give you the best user experience.

Designers should make consistent designs. By doing this Developers can create functional designs systems that have sane default behaviors. Once you can get to that point, the system serves to reduce the load from the dev, not increase.I have created a tailwind-based design system interpretation like this in the education space at a rather large scale. Our designs and our tailwind-config comes from the same spec.Doing this removes the engineer from thought by reducing options and possibilities. It also serves as check and balance. Paddings, font-weights, all of it are consistent. Designs that deviate from line-height, padding, weights, colors, etc are incorrect mocks and our configured values will make it obvious to the dev. Code that deviates from the spec is incorrect. This requires a good communication flow between Eng and UX but actually works in practice.In a functioning system, it is a weight off your shoulders as you end up knowing the defaults just by looking at something.Might I also remind you, the point of the entire backend of an app is to serve the front end. An app with amazing backend practices but fails at matching designs or specs is just a failure and is noticeable by customers.replyKon5ole 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Good points which I generally agree with, but I still think it's common to see a remarkable level of time and effort spent on typography compared to even other parts of the frontend. Not always, but surprisingly often.Many companies have these style guides around typography. Beautiful, thoughtful, very well made things for sure, yet when some backend dev makes a typo so the custom font drops to arial or whatever, it can be days before someone notices and the ones who notice are the font nerds from marketing. Nobody else seems to mind much.Compare that with what happens if someone misunderstands the 20 year old SQL schema and writes the wrong magic string to a table. Instant crash, everybody notices immediately. Yet database schemas for internal applications tend not to be documented in Porsche-brochure-like sites like this Sweden Sans is.How did the typography guys get a voice so strong? Note that I don't mind it, I like to see well made things in general, but it's puzzling. It's like there is a secret society of typography nerds that have spread to all major organisations.>Might I also remind you, the point of the entire backend of an app is to serve the front end.

They just do a job once, get paid some (relatively small) amount for it, and then move on to the next project. At the biggest these projects involve a few people working for a year or two. Their entire job is about communication, sales, and sweating small design details, so it's no wonder they do a relatively good job at those.The amount of work those \"20 year old SQL schemas\" take, once you include every bit of other comparable detail across a whole organization, is (at least) thousands of times bigger and more complicated. Overall the \"code guys\" have much more resources spent, spend a lot more time, and everyone ultimately cares a lot more about their output. They are large teams of either long-term employees or long-term contractors, whose work never really ends.In short: Code is a sprawling mess rather than a cutely packaged self-contained thing. Unsurprisingly it's harder to make sense of at a glance.replychefandy 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]News flash: technical worker thinks more resources should be diverted from non-technical matters to technical matters. Film at 11. ;-)The people who design interfaces and the people who do branding and identity work are rarely the same people. I've done both (and was developer all over the stack for a decade,) but never at the same time. Branding and identity work is usually done by specialized agencies, and they're usually the ones who make decisions about the type stack.What you and most other developers don't realize is that these things do actually matter\u2014 just not in ways that non-designers consciously pick up on. When looking at an individual website, most folks might not see much difference between a poorly kerned system font and a really expensive 'pro' font painstakingly hand kerned over months or years. However, when people are encountering a brand on a whole, having a uniform, polished look across media dramatically affects how it comes across, and that is hugely consequential. Think about how differently car dealership websites land than car manufacturer websites? And they're selling literally the same fucking product! A knowledgeable designer could write an essay on the difference in the two designs while a layperson would likely shrug and say \"it looks... smoother I guess?\"It's really no different than performance for developers. Most people don't consciously notice the difference between a website that's really really streamlined and optimized and one that's just kind of okay... But the meh site will not inspire positive feelings about the experience. If your competitors do better, you likely won't be the one getting their business even if the customer didn't consciously reject your business because of it.replyjbc1 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]So I could be wrong about their point because they used SQL schema as their comparison but the commenter does question typography specifically so I think this is more \"why is topography so focused on?\" not \"why is design so focused on?\". At least that's the more interesting question to me.For example this page. First thing you see is a hero image showing their font in use. It's a pretty important element that takes up the whole screen. It's blurry and pixelated. Not the worst I've seen but definitely gives me more car dealership not car manufacturer vibes. It's a 1.3MB png that looks just as good converted to an 80KB jpeg and imo even better as a 20KB avif. If it was instead a 1.3MB jpeg or avif starting from a high quality source that thing would look crisp and super car manufacturery.There is also a section in the page where the text goes blurry because they've included a table as an image. Or I should rather say it's both blurry and an image because they could have just included a higher res image of the table. They have plenty of other images where it looks fine. Again something that gives me car dealership vibes. Actually I would say blurry text image table is specifically a dodgy second hand car dealership level of vibe.Now you could say that the typography page isn't user or customer facing so its not that important but I see plenty of shitty blurry images on otherwise polished looking pages all over the internet, and also if they covered images in their design system like they do typography then it wouldn't matter. They'd just be in the habit of only using high quality images and have some process in place to deliver them in appropriate formats.So while backend vs frontend or functionality vs polish are imo boring and played out webdev topics, I am super curious as to why they care enough about inspiring positive feelings through web design to make an entire custom font, have a page of guidelines on how to use said font, but dont have the same level of care for images. And why I see this contrast enough to consider it reasonably common in the industry.replygyulai 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]> What you and most other developers don't realize is that[...]Generalizations like this are just so bad.

It's not necessarily a zero sum effort (and probably often is entirely not) to produce design guides and work on other technical requirements at the same time.Also, design, including and sometimes especially typography, is accessibility and is often worth that sort of attention to detail for exactly that reason, keeping designs accessible to all users. Defining contrasts and visual hierarchy hugely influences how accessible something using a design might be.One specific example I see is the callout in this particular example for using much less UPPERCASE text moving forward from whatever their previous design language was. This is something I know that I've fought designers I've worked with over as an accessibility problem they've missed. (It's also something that Microsoft went through a huge accidental blow up in very public with early \"Metro\" designs that they had to apologize for and then walk back in consequent \"Fluent\" designs.) In general people read word shapes more than individual letters, uppercase forms a lot of very similar looking \"rectangles\" and even for readers with no other obvious dyslexia uppercase words are the visual equivalent of \"speed bumps\" in a roadway. They slow reading, sometimes to a crawl, and generally just get in the way, for all readers. (For dyslexic readers I've known they sometimes are even more \"walls\" than simply \"speed bumps\" and text entirely in uppercase will completely upset them, if not make the content 100% inaccessible to them and they will nope out entirely.)That's an important thing about typography that is easy to miss. I've seen so many designs use all uppercase text in places simply because it \"looks nice\" (those \"all words create about the same sort of rectangular shape\" that makes a dyslexic viewpoint absolutely hate seeing all uppercase text add a regularity and \"cleanliness\" to design shapes that some designers find they love; one person's massive accessibility bug is another's aesthetic feature).replymlsu 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It is actually amazing how much effort is seemingly expended on things like this.I think it's pretty simple:- there are a lot of people out there who love obsessing over typography- they want to obsess over typography- so they invent a purpose for obsessing over typographyI love it, I'm here for it, and I think we should give people money for obsessing over typography.replyimiric 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think that's an overly cynical take for the work type designers do.Design in general is highly detail oriented. In interior design, there are philosophies about the proper arrangement of furniture (feng shui). In visual design the balance of colors is crucial, and there are complex theories about the best ways to match and offset colors. This is highly technical work that might seem overly pedantic to outsiders, but really has an established theory about how it impacts the viewer.So is the case with type design. There are infinite combinations of shapes and sizes of symbols, and an entire science behind how humans interpret characters to form words and communicate ideas. Think about how much design went into just this paragraph you're reading. A bad type can be tiring to read, while a good one can make the words flow off the page/screen. As readers, we take this for granted, but a type designer needs to take all this into consideration.Consider the work it takes to design a logotype, and how it sometime seems deceptively simple, when in reality it takes a keen eye to design a brand logo. Now extrapolate that to all letters of all alphabets that a modern type should support, and it's no wonder that great type designers deserve all the praise and recognition.So, yes, all these documents are necessary, and explain the intent of the designer, or how the user feels the type helps with transmitting their message.replyMAGZine 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It is actually amazing how much effort is seemingly expended on things like this.I think it's pretty simple:- there are a lot of people out there who love obsessing over software- they want to obsess over software- so they invent a purpose for obsessing over softwareI love it, I'm here for it, and I think we should give people money for obsessing over software.Just because it's simple on the surface does not mean that there's a lot that goes into it, or that the details don't matter. I feel like what you've written is a little reductionist to the hard work people put into designing frameworks for communications like this, and how much it can help to give voice and unify messaging in intra- and inter-institution communication.

Technical access is generally much more limited for such people than is access to de facto brand representation through graphical presentation.If it's a differential comparison vs. tech then that differential should be treated as its own issue, not an issue of design guidelines deserving a label like pedantry just because something else isn't as well-planned or documented.replymediascreen 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Well, this is is not guidelines for an app or a website.

Am I misunderstanding what a serif is? Or am I understanding what sans means in this context?replythemodelplumber 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]There's a lot of wiggle room. Sometimes a font designer will even throw in a single serif because hey--this is also an emotive art. Or maybe for a specific reason due to the project spec.When I used to teach typography in the 2000s, sometimes students would point this out. Or as an example of a beginner's lesson, they'd use a font without really examining it, and some detail about the font would catch them out later.It's weird but most people pick fonts without really thinking about the font itself, or even reading its name, let alone examining it. They are thinking about their design, their thoughts & feelings, their message, their amazing design opportunity, or whatever.Skilled designers need to be trained to think about whether they're basically hallucinating the purpose of the font, as a few seconds of inspection will often make the original purpose really obvious. To people who learn how this works, it becomes just that obvious why those slab serifs might be in there.replybobbylarrybobby 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The regular and bold versions probably qualify as slab serifs, but the \u201cbook\u201d weight is a true sans.

I guess you could generously say that serif and sans-serif are handles on either end of what is really a spectrum.

It is more like an indicator of the general font lineage the designer considers it to be in.But plenty of sans fonts have a handful of serifs, particularly on the mistakable chars like l.

Most entries only required 4-5 lines of config and there was no ugly shell syntax, a million options, conditionals etc.Probably just because I grew up with it, but MBR and disk/boot management on Linux was so much simpler back then.512 bytes of partition table + bootloader(well, the bootstrapping part anyway). Partitions had one simple, 3 character name in /dev. No weird FAT32 partitions full of mysterious files, UEFI stuffed full of unnecessary features, but you can be damn sure a desktop or laptop board is gonna provide all the ones that make your life harder, and none of the actually useful ones.I'm sure there are lots of good technical reasons why everything needs a UUID now, and so on and so forth, but none of all this complexity solved any problem I actually had in the before times. It just added the problem of now having to read a buttload of documentation every time I even think about touching this stuff.At some point a few years back, I wanted to switch DNS servers on my laptop running some ubuntu derivative at the time. resolv.conf was still there, so I edited it. Nothing happened. Eventually I ended up finding like 4 different files in various places specifying DNS. And only one was the right one to change. Others might do nothing or actually break DNS.One of these days I'll probably throw up my hands, put my mobo in legacy mode, and install some bare bones, Systemd free distro. Maybe Crux Linux or Slackware if those even exist still.replyversteegen 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm using Slackware-current with manually maintained [edit: actually, I wrote a python script to generate it, see other comment] grub.cfg (grub 2.06) on a MBR system, and happy I don't have GPT. Recently I tried to convert a Windows installation from MBR to GPT. What a disaster, never doing that again (but if you do need to, use gdisk [1]. It's great, I had unrelated issues). I suppose I'll eventually have to convert my Linux PC to GPT when replacing the motherboard. I haven't ever reinstalled Slackware (I just upgrade), since switching to it in 2007. Honestly there are issues with that.Slackware just celebrated its 30 year anniversary two days ago [2] and still going strong without systemd ;) Well actually it now has eudev, which is the small unintrusive part of systemd which a lot of software these days has as a dependency.

At least it's clearly inspectable and I can make customisations that won't be erased by regeneration. For example my root partition is a btrfs subvolume, but how does grub know which subvolume I want mounted as the root?

    "content": "AdviceA few things to know before stealing my 914Norman Garrett31 March 2022ShareNorman GarrettDear Thief,Welcome to my Porsche 914. I imagine that at this point (having found the door unlocked) your intention is to steal my car. Don\u2019t be encouraged by this; the tumblers sheared off in 1978. I would have locked it up if I could, so don\u2019t think you\u2019re too clever or that I\u2019m too lazy. However, now that you\u2019re in the car, there are a few things you\u2019re going to need to know. First, the battery is disconnected, so slide-hammering my ignition switch is not your first step. I leave the battery disconnected, not to foil hoodlums such as yourself, but because there is a mysterious current drain from the 40-year-old German wiring harness that I can\u2019t locate and/or fix. So, connect the battery first. Good luck finding the engine cover release. Or the engine, for that matter.Now, you can skip your slide hammer. The ignition switch\u2019s tumblers are so worn that any flat-bladed screwdriver or pair of scissors will do. Don\u2019t tell anyone.Once you\u2019ve figured that out and try to start the car, you\u2019ll run into some trouble. The car is most likely in reverse gear, given that the parking brake cable froze up sometime during the Carter administration. Since there is not a clutch safety switch on the starting circuit, make sure to press the clutch down before you try to crank the engine. (I don\u2019t want you running into my other car in the driveway.) This is doubly necessary because my starter is too weak to crank the clutch-transmission input shaft assembly with any success.With the clutch pedal depressed, the engine should turn over fast enough to get things going. But first, you\u2019ll need to press the gas pedal to the floor exactly four times. Not three. Not five. Four. The dual Webers don\u2019t have chokes and you\u2019ll be squirting fuel down the barrels with the accelerator pumps for the necessary priming regime. If you don\u2019t do it right, the car won\u2019t start before the battery gives up the ghost. Consider yourself forewarned.MarketplaceBuy and sell classics with confidenceBrowse MarketplaceNorman GarrettIf you\u2019ve followed along so far, the engine should fire right up. Don\u2019t be fooled\u2014it will die in eight seconds when the priming fuel runs out. Repeat the gas pedal priming procedure, but only pump two times. Deviate from this routine at your own peril.Now you have the engine running. Make sure the green oil light in the dash goes out. If it does not, you only have about 100 yards to drive before the engine locks up, so be attentive. If all goes well with the oil pressure, you may now attend to the gear shift lever. Some explanation follows.This is a Porsche 914. It has a mid-engine layout. The transmission is in the far back of the car, and the shift linkage\u2019s main component is a football-field-long steel rod formed loosely in the shape of your lower intestine. Manipulating the gear shift lever will deliver vague suggestions to this rod, which, in turn, will tickle small parts deep within the dark bowels of the transaxle case. It is akin to hitting a bag of gears with a stick, hopefully finding one that works.I\u2019ll make sure the drivetrain is in the car, by the way. Norman GarrettIf you are successful in finding first gear (there is a shift pattern printed on the knob; they say German engineers don\u2019t have a sense of humor), congratulations. You may launch the vehicle into motion.Do not become emboldened by your progress, as you will quickly need to shift to another gear. Ouija boards are more communicative than the shift knob you will be trusting to aid your efforts. Depress the clutch as you would in any car, and pull the knob from its secure location out of first gear. Now you will become adrift in the zone known to early Porsche owners as \u201cNeverland\u201d and your quest will be to find second gear. Prepare yourself for a ten-second-or-so adventure. Do not go straight forward with the shift knob, as you will only find Reverse waiting there to mock you with a shriek of high-speed gear teeth machining themselves into round cylinders. Should you hear this noise, retreat immediately to the only easy spot to find in this transmission: neutral. This is a safe place, no real damage can occur here, but alas, no forward motion will happen either. From this harbor of peace, you can re-attempt to find second, but you may just want to go for any \u201cport in a storm\u201d, given that the traffic behind you is now cheering you on in your quest with vigorous horn-honks of support and encouragement. Most 914 owners at this point pull over to the side of the road and feign answering a cell phone call to a) avoid further humiliation; b) allow traffic to pass; and c) gather the courage for another first gear start. You may choose to do likewise.Norman GarrettIf you press onward without taking a break, you may re-enter first. This is how the car mocks you for your lack of skill, but sometimes it is the only path forward. Once you are ready to again try for second, I can offer some advice. One trick that works is to declutch the transmission, pull the lever from the first-gear position, enter into the aforementioned neutral zone, and then rapidly wig-wag the shift knob side-to-side along a lateral axis. If you move the knob quickly enough, the transmission will be out-smarted and cannot anticipate your next move. It is at this time that you should re-attempt to enter second, and most likely you will do so. Surprise is your best weapon against this transmission.The move to third should be straightforward, as it\u2019s the only easily-accessible gear in the set. You should now be out of my neighborhood and on the main four-lane road. Third gear will be good for 45 mph, so I would advise you just staying there. Trying to get to fourth gear will only frustrate you and your nearby drivers (see: first-to-second shift).You don\u2019t need to check for gasoline in the car. It will be full, even though the fuel gauge reads zero. The odometer reads \u201c0\u201d, not because it was reset when I filled the tank, but because it is just broken. Ignore it. If it is night, and it most likely will be, you will need to turn on the lights. I\u2019ll leave it to you to find the switch since I\u2019ve helped a lot so far. Suffice to say that once you get them active, you will find that the seven inch sealed beams from 1971 will only illuminate sufficient roadway for travel below 45 mph. Since you are still in third , this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Oh, and the lights only work on high beam, so ignore the flashing lights and vulgar gestures from opposing traffic.Norman GarrettBy now you\u2019ve certainly noticed the smell. That is the aroma of Mobil 1 oil being boiled off of long sections of horizontal exhaust pipes, which were cleverly encased by the factory with a second shroud of oil-holding chambers. They filled with oil during my last drive and you are now operating a small thermal refinery that is making light short-chained vaporous hydrocarbons from what was once $8-a-quart oil. They are being conveniently routed to the cabin through carefully formed channels in the heating system, plus the rust holes in the floor provided by Mother Nature herself over the past few decades.You\u2019ll feel less dizzy if you open a window. But mind that driver\u2019s window does not work, so you\u2019ll have to lean over and roll down the passenger window half-way. I say half-way in a manner that will become apparent once you try to get the window to go all the way down, which it will refuse to do. Instead, simply open the driver\u2019s door slightly and drive along, as I do. Once the oil vapors are exhumed from the cabin, you should start to feel a little better. There is a rag behind the driver\u2019s seat that you can use to wipe the oil film off of the inside of the windshield.Knowing which road you\u2019re probably on by now, you will be hitting stop lights. Try as hard as you can to not bring the 914 to a stop. The brake system is ideal for this situation, being known more as \u201cscrubbers\u201d than \u201cbrakes\u201d. Since you can\u2019t effectively stop the car, use this to your advantage and don\u2019t try. Remember: You certainly don\u2019t want to have to go back into first.If you have made it within sight of to the highway entrance, don\u2019t get any ideas. The front right wheel is severely bent and the vibration at velocities above 50 mph will crack the windshield and cause the doors to open by themselves. So stay on the surface streets, stoplights notwithstanding.It may be at this point that you consider abandoning the car to avoid further calamity. There is an Exxon station right before the freeway entrance. The last guy who stole my 914 used this very spot and it was rather convenient for all concerned parties.

    "content": "ValThe Val Programming LanguageLanguage tourRoadmapCommunity discussionVal is a programming language that leverages mutable value semantics and generic programming for high-level systems programming.Val aims to be:Fast by definition: Val is compiled ahead-of-time to machine code and relies on its type system to support in-place mutation and avoid unnecessary memory allocations. Val avoids hidden costs such as implicit copies and therefore avoids heavy dependence on an optimizer for basic performance.Safe by default: Val\u2019s foundation of mutable value semantics ensures that ordinary code is memory safe, typesafe, and data-race-free. By explicit, auditable opt-in, programmers can use unsafe constructs for performance where necessary, and can build safe constructs using unsafe ones.Simple: Val borrows heavily from Swift which has demonstrated a user-friendly approach to generic programming and deep support for value semantics. Val\u2019s programming model strengthens and extends this support, while de-emphasizing reference semantics and avoiding the complexities that result from trying to make it statically safe (e.g., memory regions, lifetime annotations, etc.).The language tour gives an overview of Val\u2019s features. The language specification and IR specification (work in progress) provides detailed information about Val\u2019s syntax and semantics.Val is under active development and is not ready to be used yet. The code of the compiler is open source and hosted on GitHub. The current status of the project is described on our roadmap page.We opened a forum to host community discussions. Please ask questions and/or tell us what you think about the Val project!Sounds great, but why another language?Our goals overlap substantially with that of Rust and other commendable efforts, such as Zig or Vale. Besides, other programming languages have value semantics (e.g., R or Whiley) and/or provide excellent support for generic programming (e.g., Swift or Haskell). So why another one?What sets Val apart in the current landscape is its focus on mutable value semantics for the purpose of writing efficient, generic code. Val is a zero-cost abstraction language that fully acknowledges the physical constraints of computer architecture. Yet, it presents a user model that marries these constraints with the benefits of value-oriented programming.Enough, show me some code!Okay, okay. Here\u2019s a simple program:subscript longer_of(_ a: inout String, _ b: inout String): String { if b.count() > a.count() { yield &b } else { yield &a }}fun emphasize(_ z: inout String, strength: Int = 1) { z.append(repeat_element(\"!\", count: strength)))}public fun main() { var (x, y) = (\"Hi\", \"World\") emphasize(&longer_of[&x, &y]) print(\"${x} ${y}\") // \"Hi World!\"}This program declares two character strings, appends an exclamation mark to the longest, and prints them both after the mutation. No pointers or references are used (& in Val does not mean \u201caddress of\u201d\u2014it simply marks a mutation), and no unnecessary allocation occurs. The result of longer_of is a projection of the longer argument, so the mutation of z by emphasize occurs directly on the value of y. The value is neither copied, nor moved, and yet it is not being passed by reference to emphasize. The body of emphasize owns z in exactly the same way as it owns strength, which is passed by value: z is an independent value that can only be touched by emphasize.To better understand, notice that longer_of is not a function; it\u2019s a subscript. A subscript does not return a value, it projects one, granting the caller temporary read and/or write access to it.A Python programmer may think that String has reference semantics and that longer_of is simply returning a reference to y. A C/C++ programmer may think of longer_of as a function that takes and returns pointers or mutable references to values. Neither of these views are quite right. All types in Val are value types and their instances behave like ints. As a result, the possible accesses to a function parameter are always visible in the body of that function, and can\u2019t be hidden behind some stored reference.The language guarantees to emphasize that the value of z will not be accessed via x or y (or any other means) until that function returns.A Rust programmer may think of longer_of as a function that borrows its arguments mutably and returns a mutable reference bound by the lifetime of those arguments. What happens is semantically identical, but notice that in Val, longer_of has no lifetime annotations. Lifetime annotations were not elided, they simply do not exist in Val because it uses a simpler model, devoid of references.Have a look at the section on subscripts in the language tour to get more information.Hosted on GitHub Pages \u2014 Theme by orderedlist",

If you'd like to sponsor this project and have your avatar or company logo appear below click here.Elevator PitchMinor rant incoming: Something's not working? Maybe a service is down. docker-compose ps. Yep, it's that microservice that's still buggy. No issue, I'll just restart it: docker-compose restart. Okay now let's try again. Oh wait the issue is still there. Hmm. docker-compose ps. Right so the service must have just stopped immediately after starting. I probably would have known that if I was reading the log stream, but there is a lot of clutter in there from other services. I could get the logs for just that one service with docker compose logs --follow myservice but that dies everytime the service dies so I'd need to run that command every time I restart the service. I could alternatively run docker-compose up myservice and in that terminal window if the service is down I could just up it again, but now I've got one service hogging a terminal window even after I no longer care about its logs. I guess when I want to reclaim the terminal realestate I can do ctrl+P,Q, but... wait, that's not working for some reason. Should I use ctrl+C instead? I can't remember if that closes the foreground process or kills the actual service.What a headache!Memorising docker commands is hard. Memorising aliases is slightly less hard. Keeping track of your containers across multiple terminal windows is near impossible.

See Config DocsHow do I get text to wrap in my main panel?In the future I want to make this the default, but for now there are some CPU issues that arise with wrapping. If you want to enable wrapping, use gui.wrapMainPanel: trueHow do you select text?Because we support mouse events, you will need to hold option while dragging the mouse to indicate you're trying to select text rather than click on something. Alternatively you can disable mouse events via the gui.ignoreMouseEvents config value.Mac Users: See Issue #190 for other options.Why can't I see my container's logs?By default we only show logs from the last hour, so that we're not putting too much strain on the machine. This may be why you can't see logs when you first start lazydocker. This can be overwritten in the config's commandTemplatesIf you are running lazydocker in Docker container, it is a know bug, that you can't see logs or CPU usage.Why isn't my docker-compose environment being used?By default Compose V1 (docker-compose with the hyphen) is used as the docker-compose command. You will need to make sure you have the docker-compose command available for lazydocker to be able to use.If you use Compose V2 (docker compose without the hyphen), alternatively, you can change the docker-compose command used via the commandTemplates.dockerCompose config value.Alternativesdocui - Skanehira beat me to the punch on making a docker terminal UI, so definitely check out that repo as well! I think the two repos can live in harmony though: lazydocker is more about managing existing containers/services, and docui is more about creating and configuring them.Portainer - Portainer tries to solve the same problem but it's accessed via your browser rather than your terminal. It also supports docker swarm.See Awesome Docker list for similar tools to work with Docker.",

(It will still be slow, even if you're using tab-completion or fzf or copy-pasting).Keyboard-driven interfaces like lazydocker or lazygit avoid those disadvantages.replylgas 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]The replies to ziftface also apply here.

How many studies are faked or flawed?Investigations suggest that, in some fields, at least one-quarter of clinical trials might be problematic or even entirely made up, warn some researchers. They urge stronger scrutiny.Richard Van NoordenTwitterFacebookEmailIllustration by Piotr KowalczykHow many clinical-trial studies in medical journals are fake or fatally flawed? In October 2020, John Carlisle reported a startling estimate1.Carlisle, an anaesthetist who works for England\u2019s National Health Service, is renowned for his ability to spot dodgy data in medical trials. He is also an editor at the journal Anaesthesia, and in 2017, he decided to scour all the manuscripts he handled that reported a randomized controlled trial (RCT) \u2014 the gold standard of medical research. Over three years, he scrutinized more than 500 studies1.For more than 150 trials, Carlisle got access to anonymized individual participant data (IPD). By studying the IPD spreadsheets, he judged that 44% of these trials contained at least some flawed data: impossible statistics, incorrect calculations or duplicated numbers or figures, for instance. And 26% of the papers had problems that were so widespread that the trial was impossible to trust, he judged \u2014 either because the authors were incompetent, or because they had faked the data.Carlisle called these \u2018zombie\u2019 trials because they had the semblance of real research, but closer scrutiny showed they were actually hollow shells, masquerading as reliable information. Even he was surprised by their prevalence. \u201cI anticipated maybe one in ten,\u201d he says.When Carlisle couldn\u2019t access a trial\u2019s raw data, however, he could study only the aggregated information in the summary tables. Just 1% of these cases were zombies, and 2% had flawed data, he judged (see \u2018The prevalence of \u2018zombie\u2019 trials\u2019). This finding alarmed him, too: it suggested that, without access to the IPD \u2014 which journal editors usually don\u2019t request and reviewers don\u2019t see \u2014 even an experienced sleuth cannot spot hidden flaws.Source: Ref. 1\u201cI think journals should assume that all submitted papers are potentially flawed and editors should review individual patient data before publishing randomised controlled trials,\u201d Carlisle wrote in his report.Carlisle rejected every zombie trial, but by now, almost three years later, most have been published in other journals \u2014 sometimes with different data to those submitted with the manuscript he had seen. He is writing to journal editors to alert them, but expects that little will be done.Do Carlisle\u2019s findings in anaesthesiology extend to other fields? For years, a number of scientists, physicians and data sleuths have argued that fake or unreliable trials are frighteningly widespread. They\u2019ve scoured RCTs in various medical fields, such as women\u2019s health, pain research, anaesthesiology, bone health and COVID-19, and have found dozens or hundreds of trials with seemingly statistically impossible data. Some, on the basis of their personal experiences, say that one-quarter of trials being untrustworthy might be an underestimate. \u201cIf you search for all randomized trials on a topic, about a third of the trials will be fabricated,\u201d asserts Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.The issue is, in part, a subset of the notorious paper-mill problem: over the past decade, journals in many fields have published tens of thousands of suspected fake papers, some of which are thought to have been produced by third-party firms, termed paper mills.But faked or unreliable RCTs are a particularly dangerous threat. They not only are about medical interventions, but also can be laundered into respectability by being included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which thoroughly comb the literature to assess evidence for clinical treatments. Medical guidelines often cite such assessments, and physicians look to them when deciding how to treat patients.Ben Mol, who specializes in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, argues that as many as 20\u201330% of the RCTs included in systematic reviews in women\u2019s health are suspect.Many research-integrity specialists say that the problem exists, but its extent and impact are unclear. Some doubt whether the issue is as bad as the most alarming examples suggest. \u201cWe have to recognize that, in the field of high-quality evidence, we increasingly have a lot of noise. There are some good people championing that and producing really scary statistics. But there are also a lot in the academic community who think this is scaremongering,\u201d says \u017darko Alfirevi\u0107, a specialist in fetal and maternal medicine at the University of Liverpool, UK.This year, he and others are conducting more studies to assess how bad the problem is. Initial results from a study led by Alfirevi\u0107 are not encouraging.Laundering fake trialsMedical research has always had fraudsters. Roberts, for instance, first came across the issue when he co-authored a 2005 systematic review for the Cochrane Collaboration, a prestigious group whose reviews of medical research evidence are often used to shape clinical practice. The review suggested that high doses of a sugary solution could reduce death after head injury. But Roberts retracted it2 after doubts arose about three of the key trials cited in the paper, all authored by the same Brazilian neurosurgeon, Julio Cruz. (Roberts never discovered whether the trials were fake, because Cruz died by suicide before investigations began. Cruz\u2019s articles have not been retracted.)A more recent example is that of Yoshihiro Sato, a Japanese bone-health researcher. Sato, who died in 2016, fabricated data in dozens of trials of drugs or supplements that might prevent bone fracture. He has 113 retracted papers, according to a list compiled by the website Retraction Watch. His work has had a wide impact: researchers found that 27 of Sato\u2019s retracted RCTs had been cited by 88 systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, some of which had informed Japan\u2019s recommended treatments for osteoporosis3.Some of the findings in about half of these reviews would have changed had Sato\u2019s trials been excluded, says Alison Avenell, a medical researcher at the University of Aberdeen, UK. She, along with medical researchers Andrew Grey, Mark Bolland and Greg Gamble, all at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, have pushed universities to investigate Sato\u2019s work and monitored its influence. \u201cIt probably diverted people from being given more effective treatment for fracture prevention,\u201d Avenell says.Anaesthetist John Carlisle at work.Credit: Emli BendixenThe concerns over zombie trials, however, are beyond individual fakers flying under the radar. In some fields, swathes of RCTs from different research groups might be unreliable, researchers worry.During the pandemic, for instance, a flurry of RCTs was conducted into whether ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug, could treat COVID-19. But researchers who were not involved have since pointed out data flaws in many of the studies, some of which have been retracted. A 2022 update of a Cochrane review argued that more than 40% of these RCTs were untrustworthy4.\u201cUntrustworthy work must be removed from systematic reviews,\u201d says Stephanie Weibel, a biologist at the University of Wuerzberg in Germany, who co-authored the review.In maternal health \u2014 another field seemingly rife with problems \u2014 Roberts and Mol have flagged studies into whether a drug called tranexamic acid can stem dangerously heavy bleeding after childbirth. Every year, around 14 million people experience this condition, and some 70,000 die: it is the world\u2019s leading cause of maternal death.In 2016, Roberts reviewed evidence for using tranexamic acid to treat serious blood loss after childbirth. He reported that many of the 26 RCTs investigating the drug had serious flaws. Some had identical text, others had data inconsistencies or no records of ethical approval. Some seemed not to have adequately randomized the assignment of their participants to control and treatment groups5.When he followed up with individual authors to ask for more details and raw data, he generally got no response or was told that records were missing or had been lost because of computer theft. Fortunately, in 2017, a large, high-quality multi-centre trial, which Roberts helped to run, established that the drug was effective6. It\u2019s likely, says Roberts, that in these and other such cases, some of the dubious trials were copycat fraud \u2014 researchers saw that a large trial was going on and produced small, substandard copies that no one would question. This kind of fraud isn\u2019t a victimless crime, however. \u201cIt results in narrowed confidence intervals such that the results look much more certain than they are. It also has the potential to amplify a wrong result, suggesting that treatments work when they don\u2019t,\u201d he says.Stamp out fake clinical data by working togetherThat might have happened for another question: what if doctors were to inject the drug into everyone undergoing a caesarean, just after they give birth, as a preventative measure? A 2021 review7 of 36 RCTs investigating this idea, involving a total of more than 10,000 participants, concluded that this would reduce the risk of heavy blood loss by 60%.Yet this April, an enormous US-led RCT with 11,000 people reported only a slight and not statistically significant benefit8.Mol thinks problems with some of the 36 previous RCTs explains the discrepancy. The 2021 meta-analysis had included one multi-centre study in France of more than 4,000 participants, which found a modest 16% reduction in severe blood loss, and another 35 smaller, single-centre studies, mostly conducted in India, Iran, Egypt and China, which collectively estimated a 93% drop. Many of the smaller RCTs were untrustworthy, says Mol, who has dug into some of them in detail.It\u2019s unclear whether the untrustworthy studies affected clinical practice. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using tranexamic acid to treat blood loss after childbirth, but it doesn\u2019t have a guideline on preventive administration.From four trials to oneMol points to a different example in which untrustworthy trials might have influenced clinical practice. In 2018, researchers published a Cochrane review9 on whether giving steroids to people due to undergo caesarean-section births helped to reduce breathing problems in their babies. Steroids are good for a baby\u2019s lungs but can harm the developing brain, says Mol; benefits generally outweigh harms when babies are born prematurely, but the balance is less clear when steroids are used later in pregnancy.The authors of the 2018 review, led by Alexandros Sotiriadis, a specialist in maternal\u2013fetal medicine at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, analysed the evidence for administering steroids to people delivering by caesarean later in pregnancy. They ended up with four RCTs: a British study from 2005 with more than 940 participants, and three Egyptian trials conducted between 2015 and 2018 that added another 3,000 people into the evidence base. The review concluded that the steroids \u201cmay\u201d reduce rates of breathing problems; it was cited in more than 200 documents and some clinical guidelines.In January 2021, however, Mol and others, who had looked in more depth into the papers, raised concerns about the Egyptian trials. The largest study, with nearly 1,300 participants, was based on the second author\u2019s thesis, he noted \u2014 but the trial end dates in the thesis differed from the paper. And the reported ratio of male to female babies was an impossible 40% to 60%. Mol queried the other papers, too, and wrote to the authors, but says he did not get satisfactory replies. (One author told him he\u2019d lost the data when moving house.) Mol\u2019s team also reported statistical issues with some other works by the same authors.How a data detective exposed suspicious medical trialsIn December 2021, Sotiriadis\u2019s team updated its review10. But this time, it adopted a new screening protocol. Until that year, Cochrane reviews had aimed to include all relevant RCTs; if researchers spotted potential issues with a trial, using a \u2018risk of bias\u2019 checklist, they would downgrade their confidence in its findings, but not remove it from their analysis. But in 2021, Cochrane\u2019s research-integrity team introduced new guidance: authors should try to identify \u2018problematic\u2019 or \u2018untrustworthy\u2019 trials and exclude them from reviews. Sotiriadis\u2019s group now excluded all but the British research. With only one trial left, there was \u201cinsufficient data\u201d to draw firm conclusions about the steroids, the researchers said.By last May, as Retraction Watch reported, the large Egyptian trial was retracted (to the disagreement of its authors). The journal\u2019s editors wrote in the retraction notice that they had not received its data or a satisfactory response from the authors, adding that \u201cif the data is unreliable, women and babies are being harmed\u201d. The other two trials are still under investigation by publisher Taylor & Francis as part of a larger case of papers, says Sabina Alam, director of publishing ethics at the firm. Before the 2018 review, some clinical guidelines had suggested that administering steroids later in pregnancy could be beneficial, and the practice had been growing in some countries, such as Australia, Mol has reported. The latest updated WHO and regional guidelines, however, recommend against this practice.Overall, Mol and his colleagues have alleged problems in more than 800 published medical research papers, at least 500 of which are on RCTs. So far, the work has led to more than 80 retractions and 50 expressions of concern. Mol has focused much of his work on papers from countries in the Middle East, and particularly in Egypt. One researcher responded to some of his e-mails by accusing him of racism. Mol, however, says that it\u2019s simply a fact that he has encountered many suspect statistics and refusals to share data from RCT authors in countries such as Iran, Egypt, Turkey and China \u2014 and that he should be able to point that out.Screening for trustworthiness\u201cBen Mol has undoubtedly been a pioneer in the field of detecting and fighting data falsification,\u201d says Sotiriadis \u2014 but he adds that it is difficult to prove that a paper is falsified. Sotiriadis says he didn\u2019t depend on Mol\u2019s work when his team excluded those trials in its update, and he can\u2019t say whether the trials were corrupt.Instead, his group followed a screening protocol designed to check for \u2018trustworthiness\u2019. It had been developed by one of Cochrane\u2019s independent specialist groups, the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth (CPC) group, coordinated by Alfirevi\u0107. (This April, Cochrane formally dissolved this group and some others, as part of a reorganization strategy.) It provides a detailed list of criteria that authors should follow to check the trustworthiness of an RCT \u2014 such as whether a trial is prospectively registered and whether the study is free of unusual statistics, such as implausibly narrow or wide distributions of mean values in participant height, weight or other characteristics, and other red flags. If RCTs fail the checks, then reviewers are instructed to contact the original study authors \u2014 and, if the replies are not adequate, to exclude the study.\u201cWe\u2019re championing the idea that, if a study doesn\u2019t pass these bars, then no hard feelings, but we don\u2019t call it trustworthy enough,\u201d Alfirevi\u0107 explains.For Sotiriadis, the merit of this protocol was that it avoided his having to declare the trials faulty or fraudulent; they had merely failed a test of trustworthiness. His team ultimately reported that it excluded the Egyptian trials because they hadn\u2019t been prospectively registered and the authors didn\u2019t explain why.Other Cochrane authors are starting to adopt the same protocol. For instance, a review11 of drugs aiming to prevent pre-term labour, published last August, used it to exclude 44 studies \u2014 one-quarter of the 122 trials in the literature.What counts as trustworthy?Whether trustworthiness checks are sometimes unfair to the authors of RCTs, and exactly what should be checked to classify untrustworthy research, is still up for debate. In a 2021 editorial12 introducing the idea of trustworthiness screening, Lisa Bero, a senior research integrity editor at Cochrane, and a bioethicist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, pointed out that there was no validated, universally agreed method.\u201cMisclassification of a genuine study as problematic could result in erroneous review conclusions. Misclassification could also lead to reputational damage to authors, legal consequences, and ethical issues associated with participants having taken part in research, only for it to be discounted,\u201d she and two other researchers wrote.For now, there are multiple trustworthiness protocols in play. In 2020, for instance, Avenell and others published REAPPRAISED, a checklist aimed more at journal editors. And when Weibel and others reviewed trials investigating ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment last year, they created their own checklist, which they call a \u2018research integrity assessment\u2019.Bero says some of these checks are more labour-intensive than editors and systematic reviewers are generally accustomed to. \u201cWe need to convince systematic reviewers that this is worth their time,\u201d she says. She and others have consulted biomedical researchers, publishers and research-integrity experts to come up with a set of red flags that might serve as the basis for creating a widely agreed method of assessment.Despite the concerns of researchers such as Mol, many scientists remain unsure how many reviews have been compromised by unreliable RCTs. This year, a team led by Jack Wilkinson, a health researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, is using the results of Bero\u2019s consultation to apply a list of 76 trustworthiness checks to all trials cited in 50 published Cochrane reviews. (The 76 items include detailed examination of the data and statistics in trials, as well as inspecting details on funding, grants, trial registration, the plausibility of study methods and authors\u2019 publication records \u2014 but, in this exercise, data from individual participants are not being requested.)Check for publication integrity before misconductThe aim is to see how many RCTs fail the checks, and what impact removing those trials would have on the reviews\u2019 conclusions. Wilkinson says a team of 50 is working on the project. He aims to produce a general trustworthiness-screening tool, as well as a separate tool to aid in inspecting participant data, if authors provide them. He will discuss the work in September at Cochrane\u2019s annual colloquium.Alfirevi\u0107\u2019s team, meanwhile, has found in a study yet to be published that 25% of around 350 RCTs in 18 Cochrane reviews on nutrition and pregnancy would have failed trustworthiness checks, using the CPC\u2019s method. With these RCTs excluded, the team found that one-third of the reviews would require updating because their findings would have changed. The researchers will report more details in September.In Alfirevi\u0107\u2019s view, it doesn\u2019t particularly matter which trustworthiness checks reviewers use, as long as they do something to scrutinize RCTs more closely. He warns that the numbers of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that journals publish have themselves been soaring in the past decade \u2014 and many of these reviews can\u2019t be trusted because of shoddy screening methods. \u201cAn untrustworthy systematic review is far more dangerous than an untrustworthy primary study,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is an industry that is completely out of hand, with little quality assurance.\u201dRoberts, who first published in 2015 his concerns over problematic medical research in systematic reviews13, says that the Cochrane organization took six years to respond and still isn\u2019t taking the issue seriously enough. \u201cIf up to 25% of trials included in systematic reviews are fraudulent, then the whole Cochrane endeavour is suspect. Much of what we think we know based on systematic reviews is wrong,\u201d he says.Bero says that Cochrane consulted widely to develop its 2021 guide on addressing problematic trials, including incorporating suggestions from Roberts, other Cochrane reviewers and research-integrity experts.Asking for dataMany researchers worried by medical fakery agree with Carlisle that it would help if journals routinely asked authors to share their IPD. \u201cAsking for raw data would be a good policy. The default position has just been to trust the study, but we\u2019ve been operating from quite a naive position,\u201d says Wilkinson. That advice, however, runs counter to current practice at most medical journals.In 2016, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), an influential body that sets policy for many major medical titles, had proposed requiring mandatory data-sharing from RCTs. But it got pushback \u2014 including over perceived risks to the privacy of trial participants who might not have consented to their data being shared, and the availability of resources for archiving the data. As a result, in the latest update to its guidance, in 2017, it settled for merely encouraging data sharing and requiring statements about whether and where data would be shared.The fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham scienceThe ICMJE secretary, Christina Wee, says that \u201cthere are major feasibility challenges\u201d to be resolved to mandate IPD sharing, although the committee might revisit its practices in future. Many publishers of medical journals told Nature\u2019s news team that, following ICMJE advice, they didn\u2019t require IPD from authors of trials. (These publishers included Springer Nature; Nature\u2019s news team is editorially independent.)Some journals, however \u2014 including Carlisle\u2019s Anaesthesia \u2014 have gone further and do already require IPD. \u201cMost authors provide the data when told it is a requirement,\u201d Carlisle says.Even when IPD are shared, says Wilkinson, scouring it in the way that Carlisle does is a time-consuming exercise \u2014 creating a further burden for reviewers \u2014 although computational checks of statistics might help.Besides asking for data, journal editors could also speed up their decision-making, research-integrity specialists say. When sleuths raise concerns, editors should be prepared to put expressions of concern on medical studies more quickly if they don\u2019t hear back from authors, Avenell says. This April, a UK parliamentary report into reproducibility and research integrity said that it should not take longer than two months for publishers to publish corrections or retractions of research when academics raise issues.And if journals do retract studies, authors of systematic reviews should be required to correct their work, Avenell and others say. This rarely happens. Last year, for instance, Avenell\u2019s team reported that it had carefully and repeatedly e-mailed authors and journal editors of the 88 reviews that cited Sato\u2019s retracted trials to inform them that their reviews included retracted work. They got few responses \u2014 only 11 of the 88 reviews have been updated so far \u2014 suggesting that authors and editors didn\u2019t generally care about correcting the reviews3.That was dispiriting but not surprising to the team, which has previously recounted how institutional investigations into Sato\u2019s work were opaque and inadequate. The Cochrane collaboration, for its part, stated in updated guidance in 2021 that systematic reviews must be updated when retractions occur.Ultimately, a lingering question is \u2014 as with paper mills \u2014 why so many suspect RCTs are being produced in the first place. Mol, from his experiences investigating the Egyptian studies, blames lack of oversight and superficial assessments that promote academics on the basis of their number of publications, as well as the lack of stringent checks from institutions and journals on bad practices. Egyptian authorities have taken some steps to improve governance of trials, however; Egypt\u2019s parliament, for instance, published its first clinical research law in December 2020.\u201cThe solution\u2019s got to be fixes at the source,\u201d says Carlisle. \u201cWhen this stuff is churned out, it\u2019s like fighting a wildfire and failing.\u201dNature 619, 454-458 (2023)doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02299-wReferencesCarlisle, J.

    "summary": "- A significant number of clinical trials in the field of medicine may be faked or flawed, according to investigations.\n- These \"zombie\" trials, which are studies that appear to be legitimate but contain flawed or fabricated data, can have serious consequences as they can be included in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, which influence medical guidelines and treatment decisions.\n- Efforts are being made to address this issue, including implementing trustworthiness checks for trials and advocating for journals to require the sharing of raw data from authors. However, more work is needed to ensure the integrity of clinical trials and improve the quality of medical research.",

    "hn_content": "- Medicine is facing a significant problem with untrustworthy clinical trials, with around a quarter of trials being flawed or potentially fake.\n- The issue stems from lack of oversight, superficial assessments, and a publish-or-perish culture that prioritizes quantity over quality.\n- Dubious trials can have major implications for medical decision-making and patient care, as they may lead to ineffective or even harmful treatments.\n- Measures need to be implemented to improve the transparency, integrity, and reproducibility of clinical trials.\n- One possible solution is to establish an independent advisory organization that can provide guidance on trial design and methodology.\n- The dissemination of clear, accessible information is essential for self-regulating the scientific community and improving trust in the field of medicine.- A significant number of research studies and clinical trials are potentially flawed or fraudulent, leading to unreliable results.\n- The current system of publishing scientific research does not always require the release of raw data, which makes it difficult to verify the findings.\n- There are concerns about the lack of transparency and reproducibility in the scientific community.\n- Some researchers and institutions have called for stricter standards and greater scrutiny of research studies and clinical trials.\n- The issue of flawed or fraudulent data has implications for the trustworthiness and reliability of scientific research.\n- The trustworthiness of clinical trials is particularly important, as they are used to determine the safety and efficacy of medical treatments.\n- There is a need for open science practices, including the release of raw data, to ensure transparency and accountability in scientific research.",
