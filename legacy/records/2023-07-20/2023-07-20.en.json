Words cannot express the sorrow and emptiness I feel upon hearing this heartbreaking news. Kevin was not just a good friend; he was an extraordinary person whose presence in our lives enriched us in so many ways.Kevin had a unique ability to light up any room he entered with his infectious smile and warm personality. He had an incredible knack for making people feel welcomed, accepted, and valued. His genuine kindness and compassion knew no bounds, and he was always there to lend a helping hand or offer a listening ear to anyone in need.As a friend, Kevin was unwavering in his loyalty and support. He was the type of person who would drop everything to be there for you, no matter the time or distance. He made every moment spent together unforgettable, whether it was sharing laughs, exploring new places, or just enjoying each other's company.Beyond his infectious spirit, Kevin was a source of wisdom and guidance. He had a profound ability to see the best in others and encouraged us to be the best versions of ourselves. His unwavering belief in our potential was both motivating and inspiring.The memories we created with Kevin will forever hold a special place in our hearts. His passing leaves an immense void in our lives, but we find solace in knowing that we were fortunate to have had such an exceptional friend in our lives, even if it was for too short a time.During this difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with you and all those who were touched by Kevin's presence.

(Photo: NIKOLAS LIEPINS/The Stanford Daily)By Theo BakerJuly 19, 2023, 10:06 a.m.Stanford President Marc Tessier-Lavigne will resign effective Aug. 31, according to communications released by the University Wednesday morning. He will also retract or issue lengthy corrections to five widely cited papers for which he was principal author after a Stanford-sponsored investigation found \u201cmanipulation of research data.\u201dAccording to Jerry Yang, chair of the Stanford Board of Trustees, Tessier-Lavigne will step down \u201cin light of the report and its impact on his ability to lead Stanford.\u201d Former Dean of Humanities Richard Saller will serve as interim president. In a separate statement, Tessier-Lavigne defended his reputation but acknowledged that issues with his research, first raised in a Daily investigation last autumn, meant that Stanford requires a president \u201cwhose leadership is not hampered by such discussions.\u201d\u201cAt various times when concerns with Dr. Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s papers emerged\u2014in 2001, the early 2010s, 2015-2016, and March 2021\u2014Dr. Tessier-Lavigne failed to decisively and forthrightly correct mistakes in the scientific record,\u201d Stanford\u2019s report said, identifying a number of apparent manipulations in Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s neuroscientific research.The report concluded that the fudging of results under Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s purview \u201cspanned labs at three separate institutions.\u201d It identified a culture where Tessier-Lavigne \u201ctended to reward the \u2018winners\u2019 (that is, postdocs who could generate favorable results) and marginalize or diminish the \u2018losers\u2019 (that is, postdocs who were unable or struggled to generate such data).\u201dThe report concluded there was no evidence that Tessier-Lavigne himself manipulated data in the papers reviewed, nor that he knew about manipulation at the time. But the report noted Tessier-Lavigne \u201chas not been able to provide an adequate explanation\u201d for why he did not correct the scientific record when presented the opportunity on multiple occasions. \u201cI am gratified that the Panel concluded I did not engage in any fraud or falsification of scientific data,\u201d Tessier-Lavigne said in a written statement. He acknowledged that \u201cthe report identified some areas where I should have done better, and I accept the report\u2019s conclusions.\u201d The report identified \u201crepeated instances of manipulation of research data and/or subpar scientific practices from different people and in labs run by Dr. Tessier-Lavigne at different institutions.\u201dRetracting a paper is a rare act, especially for a scientist of Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s stature. A database of retractions shows that only four in every 10,000 papers are retracted. The move is saved for when there is \u201cclear evidence that the findings are unreliable,\u201d according to guidelines from the nonprofit Committee on Publication Ethics. Tessier-Lavigne had claimed repeatedly last autumn that the issues in his studies \u201cdo not affect the data, results or interpretation of the papers.\u201dFor several papers worthy of retraction to have been principally authored by the same scientist represents \u201cunusual frequency of manipulation of research data and/or substandard scientific practices,\u201d the investigation concluded. Tessier-Lavigne is expected to retract or issue robust corrections to at least five papers in response to concerns he had not addressed for years, including a widely publicized study that he once claimed \u201cturn[s] our current understanding of Alzheimer\u2019s on its head.\u201dStanford\u2019s report, released in a 95-page document Wednesday morning, is the work of Mark Filip, a former deputy attorney general contracted by a special committee of the Stanford Board of Trustees to review allegations first identified in Daily reporting last November. Filip drafted several high-profile scientists, including Nobel laureate Randy Schekman, former Princeton president Shirley Tilghman, former Harvard provost Steve Hyman and two other members of the National Academies.The investigation took eight months, with one member stepping off after The Daily revealed that he maintained an $18 million investment in a biotech company Tessier-Lavigne cofounded. Reporting by The Daily this week shows that some witnesses to an alleged incident of fraud during Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s time at the biotechnology company Genentech refused to cooperate because investigators would not guarantee them anonymity, even though they were bound by nondisclosure agreements.Not guaranteeing anonymity in an investigation of this importance is an \u201cextremely unusual move\u201d that could hamper access to key witnesses, said Jeffrey Flier, who ran a number of research misconduct inquiries in his time as Dean of Harvard Medical School. In the report, the scientific panel raised questions about allegations of fraud in a major 2009 Alzheimer\u2019s study that claimed to have found the cause of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer\u2019s patients and was publicly called \u201cthe most important discovery in Alzheimer\u2019s in the last 20 years, maybe ever\u201d by former Genentech executive Richard Scheller. While the report found the central conclusions of the paper to be incorrect and said the quality of the research in Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s lab \u201cfell below accepted scientific practices,\u201d the panel also said it \u201cbelieves that the mistaken narrative of fraud in certain reporting may stem from a conflation of various events.\u201d The report raised the possibility that allegations were confused with a separate 2010 incident of fraud in Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s lab.The 2010 incident involved a group of lab members reporting their suspicions about a coworker in Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s lab, leading to the termination of a postdoc and the withdrawal of an already-submitted manuscript with Tessier-Lavigne listed as principal author, according to the report.However, potential witnesses \u2014 who include five high-level executives and scientists at Genentech \u2014 have alleged in previous reporting by The Daily that there was indeed fraud in the 2009 paper and that Tessier-Lavigne was made aware in 2011 that scientists within Genentech had attempted to reproduce the findings and concluded its findings to be invalid. Tessier-Lavigne has denied this characterization and Genentech has contested the executives\u2019 and scientists\u2019 version of events. Each executive and scientist had spoken with The Daily about two separate instances in Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s lab \u2014 the two the report suggested had been confused. Four of those people also spoke about a third instance of alleged fraud that they said resulted in another scientist under Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s lab leaving the company.The Stanford investigators were informed of this third alleged incident in a February email obtained by The Daily. The third allegation does not appear in the report, and witnesses with relevant knowledge about what happened say they were not asked about it during interviews.Instead, the investigation concluded that the allegations of fabrication of data in the 2009 paper \u201care not accurate.\u201d Tessier-Lavigne said \u201cthe report clearly refutes the allegations of fraud and misconduct that were made against me.\u201dOne person with direct knowledge of the incidents at Genentech told The Daily Wednesday, \u201cI did not confuse these two incidents.\u201d The person said they told the Stanford committee about both. They told The Daily they were glad more details about Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s lab continued to emerge.None of the high-profile scientists on the committee would answer questions about their work or the decision not to guarantee anonymity. Filip and Aidan Ryan, an Edelman senior vice president for crisis communications serving as the spokesperson for the investigation, answered questions on background.While the report said it had not found evidence of fraud in the 2009 paper, the panel concluded that the research that went into it \u201cfell below accepted scientific practices, let alone Dr. Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s self-described standard of scientific excellence\u201d and that the paper ought to be retracted or face \u201ca comprehensive and robust set of corrections.\u201dThe report\u2019s finding was a rebuke of Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s public defense. His lawyer Stephen Neal, chair emeritus of Cooley, had written on Tessier-Lavigne\u2019s behalf in a letter to The Daily last February that \u201ca correction or retraction of those findings would have been unwarranted and inappropriate.\u201dThe report confirmed many details previously reported by The Daily and broke new ground in other areas.\u201cWithin weeks after the publication of\u201d a 2001 article in the journal Science now thought to contain doctored imagery, the report said, a colleague in the field identified an error. \u201cDr. Tessier-Lavigne stated to the colleague in writing that he would take corrective action, including both contacting the journal and attempting to issue a correction\u2026. He did not contact the journal and he did not attempt to issue an erratum, which is inadequate.\u201dThe report noted that Tessier-Lavigne had not followed up for seven years on unpublished corrections to two of his papers in Science, concluding that \u201cDr. Tessier-Lavigne did not have an explanation for deciding to not follow up on the corrections beyond that he has a practice of drafting many emails to see how they read but only sends a portion of them and that he concluded the communication was unnecessary,\u201d the report said. \u201cTo date, the scientific record remains uncorrected.\u201dThe report noted that explanations made by Tessier-Lavigne in correspondence with editors at the journal Nature over manipulated research data in a 2004 paper were \u201cnot fully responsive to the range of publicly expressed concerns given the available forensic evidence.\u201d Since then, Tessier-Lavigne \u201chas acknowledged the presence of manipulation of research data,\u201d and assented to a correction after the panel concluded it was \u201crequired and appropriate for the paper.\u201dFilip, who led the review, said in an interview that more investigations could come out of the board\u2019s report.

    "content": "Advanced Python MasteryA course by David Beazley (https://www.dabeaz.com)Copyright (C) 2007-2023SynopsisAn exercise-driven course on Advanced Python Programming that was battle-tested several hundred times on the corporate-training circuit for more than a decade. Written by David Beazley, author of the Python Cookbook, 3rd Edition (O'Reilly) and Python Distilled (Addison-Wesley). Released under a Creative Commons license. Free of ads, tracking, pop-ups, newsletters, and AI.Target AudienceThis course is for Python programmers who want to move beyond short scripts to writing more sophisticated programs. Topics focus on programming techniques that get used in popular libraries and frameworks. The primary goal is to better understand the Python language itself so that you can understand other people's code and so that you can apply your newfound knowledge to your own projects.PrerequisitesYou already know some Python. This is not a course for beginners. For more introductory material, you might consider the Practical Python Programming course.How to Take the CourseTo take the course, you should first fork/clone the GitHub repo to your own machine.It is assumed that you are working locally in a proper Python development environment. That means a proper installation of Python, an editor/IDE, and whatever other tools that you would normally install to work on Python. Due to the use of multiple files and module imports, the use of Notebooks is not recommended.The PythonMastery.pdf file contains detailed presentation slides. Course exercises and suggested timings are clearly indicated. You'll want to keep this by your side (I recommend downloading and viewing it with a local PDF viewer). Start here!The Exercises/ directory has all of the course exercises.The Solutions/ directory has fully worked out solution code.The Data/ directory has some datafiles used during the course.The course was originally taught over 4-5 days in an in-person classroom setting with a mix of lecture and hands-on exercises. Successful completion of the course will likely require 30-50 hours of work. Exercises tend to build upon each other. Solutions are always provided in case you get stuck.Supplemental MaterialThe Advanced Python Mastery course often suggested more in-depth tutorials on selected topics. These were presented at the PyCon conference and might be of interest:Generator Tricks for Systems ProgrammersA Curious Course on Coroutines and ConcurrencyPython3 MetaprogrammingGenerators: The Final FrontierModules and Packages: Live and Let DieQuestions and AnswersQ: Are any videos available?A: No. You will be able to more quickly read the presentation slides which contain technical information. However, the Python Programming Language: LiveLessons video available on O'Reilly's Safari site is closely related to the material in this course.Q: Can I use these materials in my own course?A: Yes. I just kindly ask that you give proper attribution.Q: Do you accept bug reports or pull requests?A: If you've found a bug, please report it! However, I'm not looking to expand or reorganize the course content with new topics or exercises.Q: Are the presentation slides available in any format other than PDF?A: No.Q: Is there any forum/chat where the course can be discussed?A: You can use GitHub discussions to discuss the course.Q: What wasn't topic/tool/library X covered?A: The course was designed to be completed in an intense 4-day in-person format. It simply isn't possible to cover absolutely everything. As such, the course is focused primarily on the core Python language, not third party libraries or tooling.Q: Why aren't features like typing, async, or pattern matching covered?A: Mainly, it's an issue of calendar timing and scope. Course material was primarily developed pre-pandemic and represents Python as it was at that time. Some topics (e.g., typing or async) are sufficiently complex that they would be bettered covered on their own in a separate course.Q: How can I help?A: If you like the course, the best way to support it is to tell other people about it.>>> Advanced Python Mastery...

Adding this to the listreplyjamesdutc 19 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]I taught this course to corporate clients for three or four years before developing my own materials.The course materials for this course and the introductory course (\u201cPractical Python\u201d[1]) are quite thorough, but I've always found the portfolio analysis example very hokey.There's enormous, accessible depth to these kinds of P&L reporting examples, but the course evolves this example in a much less interesting direction. Additionally, while the conceptual and theoretical materials is solid, the analytical and technical approach that the portfolio example takes quickly diverges from how we would actually solve a problem like this. (These days, attendees are very likely to have already been exposed to tools like pandas!) This requires additional instructor guidance to bridge the gap, to reconcile the pure Python and \u201cPyData\u201d approaches. (Of course, no other Python materials or Python instruction properly address and reconcile these two universes, and most Python materials that cover the \u201cPyData\u201d universe\u2014especially those about pandas\u2014are rife with foundational conceptual errors.)Overall, David is an exceptional instructor, and his explanations and his written materials are top notch. He is one of the most thoughtful, most intelligent, and most engaging instructors I have ever worked with.I understand from David that he rarely teaches this course or Practical Python to corporate audience, instead preferring to teach courses direct to the public. (In fact, I took over a few of his active corporate clients when he transitioned away from this work, which is what led me to drafting my own curricula.) I'm not sure if he still teaches this course at all anymore.However, I would strongly encourage folks to look into his new courses, which cover a much broader set of topics (and are not Python-specific)!

(I don't know but my naive attempts and quick SO search were unfruitful.) Also, you're potentially giving up benefits of the CSV reader. Plus, as others have clarified, brevity does not equal readability or relative lack of bugs:In the course example, it's reasonably easy to add some try blocks/error handling/default values while assigning records, giving you the chance to salvage valid rows without affecting speed or readability. In fact, error handling would be a necessity if that CSV file is externally accessible. Contrast that with my two lines, where there's not an elegant way to handle a bad row or escaped comma or missing file or virtually any other surprise.Anything else I can think of off-hand (defaultdict, UserList, \"if not portfolio:\") has the same initialization step, endures some performance degradation, is more fragile, and/or is needlessly unreadable, like this lump of coal:  portfolio = [record] if 'portfolio' not in globals() else portfolio + [record]So... your technique and generators. Those are safe-ish, readable, relatively concise, etc.replyCogitoCogito 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> It's not better than a generator, but I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the very terse and still mostly readable> header, *records = [row.strip().split(',') for row in open(filename).readlines()]Better would be:  header, *records = [row.strip().split(',') for row in open(filename)]No need to read the lines all into memory first.Edit: Also if you want to be explicit with the file closing, you could do something like:  with open(filename) as infile:    header, *records = [row.strip().split(',') for row in infile]That is if we wanted to protect against future changes to semantics for garbage collection/reference counting.

It can be a nice option if most of the parts in the generator can be broken out into functions with their own name, though.You could turn it into a generator, which can cause some fun bugs (e.g. everything works fine when you first iterate over it, but not afterwards), so IMO that's best used when it needs to be a generator, for semantics or performance.You could turn it into a generator, then add a wrapper that turns it into a list (keeping the inner function private), or use a decorator that does the same, but it's less clear than this pattern.So, i'd just learn to live with it.replyCogitoCogito 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yeah I think using a list comprehension is overkill. The main reason I like list comprehensions is because I don't introduce variables (even temporarily) that I don't really need. I think that clarifies the code. But putting the code in a separate function also avoids introducing those variables to the current scope only at a cost of putting the code somewhere else (which I personally think has a cost). In this case I would just use a function or (probably) just inline it as you don't like.replytomn 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> which I personally think has a costYeah, so many people don't get this, but too many small functions can be hard to understand -- that's why I qualified that option.In this case i agree that inlining it is fine, i was talking about the general pattern.replythrdbndndn 19 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]There is always list comprehension.So `portfolio = [{'name': row[0], 'shares': int(row[1]), 'price': float(row[2]) for row in rows]`But if it's more complicated than this (like if there is conditional(s) inside the loop), I'd recommend just stick with the current approach. It's possible to have even multiple conditionals in list comprehension, but it's not really very readable. If you do want to, walrus operator can make things better(something like `numbers = [m[1] for s in array if (m := re.search(r'^.*(\\d+).*$', s))]`)replynurbl 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They can be more readable than that at least, e.g.:  keys = \"name\", \"shares\", \"price\"  portfolio = [    dict(zip(keys, row))    for row in rows  ]If I had to do more complex stuff than building a dict like this I'd move it into a function. That tends to make the purpose more clear anyway.That said, it's fine to append to a list too, I just prefer comprehensions when they fit the job. In particular, if you're just going to iterate once over this list anyway, you can turn it into a iterator comprehension by replacing [] by () and save some memory.replyroywiggins 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You can alternately stick the logic into a function, which maintains the readability.  def get_record(row):    return {        'name': row[0],        'shares': int(row[1]),        'price': float(row[2])    }  return [ get_record(r) for r in rows ]or  return list(map(get_record, rows))replythrdbndndn 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I do like to use ad hoc functions to make things cleaner (mainly for the handy \"early\" return behavior), but in this case I don't find it's much better than \"just create an empty list first and do a for loop\".replygen220 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Personally, I enjoy the pattern of making the return type a dataclass and make this function a static method on the dataclass, something like `def from_data(self, data: Dict) -> PortfolioRow`.In 2023, it's rude to return dictionaries. :)replyproamdev123 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> In 2023, it's rude to return dictionaries. :)Why do you say that?I think you were partially kidding, but also half serious.

Relatedly, they enable meaningful type hints: def some_method(input: Dict[str, int]):  ...You can just as easily call `some_method({\"foo\": 1})` as `some_method({\"bar\": 2})`.vs. def some_method(input: MyDataClassWithFoo):  ...Now you can't pass a dict where the key is \"bar\" and presumably get a KeyError when it tries to look up a \"foo\" key, you can only pass a MyDataClassWithFoo.replygen220 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Regarding the 2023 part, it's because dataclasses in Python are pretty fully-featured and part of the stdlib, so building rich data structures is quick, ergonomic, and helps remove/centralize boilerplate and parsing (aka validating, see https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-va...).Regarding rude, yea it was a bit tongue-in-cheek (I would never hold a grudge against somebody for returning a dict).You should generally define an interface for your function that's as precise as its logic allows for. `Dict` is as good as `Any`: it doesn't tell you very much about what the function internally expects.

I'll say the ideal solution would be \"postfix streaming methods\" like `.filter` and `.map`. Unfortunately, Python doesn't have those (prefix `filter`s and `map`s are not even close), and you have comprehension expressions at best. To make things worse, complex comprehensions can also create confusion, so for your particular example I'll probably say it's acceptable.

No. Quite the contrary: less-experienced people may still read, learn from and improve themselves by the advanced/beyond-their-level code they encounter.

If you can't read code, you're that denominator, and that's on you.I find your statement terribly odd too. A true Python master tends to write highly readable code; idiomatic and Pythonic code tends to be readable, unlike in other languages.

    "content": "Children, relatives of alumni no longer have admissions edge at Carnegie Mellon, PittBILL SCHACKNER| Sunday, July 16, 2023 12:01 a.m.SHANE DUNLAP | TRIBUNE-REVIEWCarnegie Mellon University campus seen Friday, July 14, 2023 in Oakland. EMAIL NEWSLETTERSTribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.For decades, Carnegie Mellon University viewed whether a student applicant was related to alumni as an \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cconsidered\u201d factor in admissions decisions.But it appears that legacies, as children or relatives of alumni are called, no longer have an edge in admissions decisions at the highly selective university.In Carnegie Mellon\u2019s latest Common Data Set, a collection of campus information that universities produce annually, the school checked \u201cnot considered.\u201dIn its latest Common Data Set, for 2022-23, the school marked \u201cnot considered\u201d in a section detailing how important alumni relations were in admissions decisions. That had not been the case since at least 1999-2000. Earlier Common Data Set reports are not available on the university\u2019s website.The University of Pittsburgh also has ended its consideration of legacy status.Asked about the wording change from \u201cconsidered\u201d to \u201cnot considered\u201d that first appeared this year, Pitt spokesman Jared Stonesifer said Thursday that admissions staff actually had stopped considering legacy status in 2020 \u2014 even though Pitt\u2019s Common Data Set said otherwise for several years.Giving preference to children of alumni is a practice stretching back generations at elite universities across the country. Some critics say it unfairly advantages wealthy applicants, while U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., recently likened it to affirmative action for white people.Debate over its fairness has intensified since the Supreme Court ruled last month that colleges can no longer consider a student applicant\u2019s race.Officials at Carnegie Mellon declined to directly address questions about why, and over what time period, the school\u2019s stance on legacies changed.\u201cEach applicant is evaluated by the same criteria irrespective of legacy status. CMU does this to ensure equity throughout the admission process for all students,\u201d the university said in a statement provided by spokesman Peter Kerwin.The university declined further comment.An administrator who headed admissions at Carnegie Mellon for nearly 40 years before retiring June 30 recalls how over time, as the number and quality of applicants rose, the university found less need to give legacies a boost.\u201cIt was more of an evolution than, \u2018One day we did it, the next day we didn\u2019t,\u2019 \u201d Dean Emeritus of Admission Mike Steidel told the Tribune-Review.\u201cI do think there was a time when perhaps legacies needed a boost,\u201d he said. \u201cOver time, the quality of the applicant pool increased to the point where we really didn\u2019t have to do it.\u201dSteidel said the tipping point came perhaps three or four years ago as standardized testing became optional at many institutions, including Carnegie Mellon.Steidel said he could not speak for Carnegie Mellon\u2019s current position, but noted that during his tenure legacies typically made up less than 10% of incoming classes.Viewed from an equity and diversity perspective, he said, legacy programs are a harder sell with the public for reasons including the Supreme Court\u2019s ban on using affirmative action in admissions decisions.\u201cIt\u2019s harder and harder to make the case that legacies even deserve a bump in the admission process. By and large, historically, legacies have been predominantly white,\u201d Steidel said. \u201cThey are not underrepresented in the applicant pool at all.\u201dLast month\u2019s affirmative action ruling sent colleges scrambling to find alternative ways to ensure Blacks and other underrepresented minorities are equitably represented on campuses.The ruling was followed within days by a civil rights complaint over use of legacy preferences.Lawyers for Civil Rights, a Boston-based nonprofit, lodged the complaint with the U.S. Department of Education on behalf of Black and Latino community groups in New England. The group contends that Harvard University\u2019s legacy preferences violate the Civil Rights Act.Harvard was one of two schools, along with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose affirmative action programs were ruled unconstitutional on June 29 by the Supreme Court.A National Association for College Admission Counseling report in 2019 suggested that legacy status was a factor in admissions decisions at about half of the nation\u2019s colleges and universities.Education Reform Now, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank opposed to the practice, said in an issue brief that about 100 colleges and universities had ended legacy preferences since 2015, but nearly 800 still consider legacy status.The issue brief by senior policy analyst James Murphy called the practice \u201ca textbook example of systemic racism, since most beneficiaries of legacy preferences are white, while students of color and students from low- and middle-income households are much more likely to be the first in their families to go to college.\u201dThe programs are common at institutions admitting fewer than 25% of applicants, Murphy\u2019s issue brief stated. \u201cMany highly ranked universities and colleges enroll more legacies than Black students.\u201dDefenders of legacy preferences say they can encourage alumni loyalty and donor gifts that strengthen an institution.Shamus Khan, a professor of sociology and American studies at Princeton University, offered another defense of such policies.In a guest essay for the New York Times, he wrote that students admitted as legacies to leading colleges already were headed for economic success, as they were born into privilege.\u201cOne group, however, got a big economic boost from going to elite schools: poor students, students of color and students whose parents didn\u2019t have a college degree,\u201d Khan wrote. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because elite colleges connected them to students born into privilege \u2014 the very kind of student that legacy preferences admit in such large numbers.\u201dCarnegie Mellon\u2019s revised stance on legacies distinguishes it from most, but not all, of the 13 institutions it considers peer institutions.California Institute of Technology, Georgia Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology do not consider legacy status, while it is considered at Cornell University, Duke University, Emory University, Northwestern University, Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rice University, Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania and Washington University in St. Louis.Penn State University\u2019s Common Data Set reports in each of the past several years indicates that the main campus considers alumni relationships in admissions decisions. The reports say the same for its branch campuses, including Penn State New Kensington in Upper Burrell, Penn State Beaver, Penn State Greater Allegheny on the border of McKeesport and White Oak and Penn State Fayette, The Eberly Campus.However, spokesman Wyatt Dubois painted a different picture Friday in a written statement that did not mention those Common Data Set reports, which are posted to the university\u2019s website.Dubois said when undergraduates apply, \u201cevaluation for admission to the university does not include race, ethnicity or legacy status as a factor.\u201d\u201cOnce admitted to the university, students are placed at a particular campus. Criteria used in determining campus placement include residency, legacy status, being from an underserved community, race and ethnicity, veteran status, being an adult learner, geographic diversity and special talent.\u201dIn light of the Supreme Court decision on the use of race in admissions, Penn State is reviewing its admissions and campus placement procedures, Dubois said.At Pitt, Stonesifer said the change involving legacy status followed a review of admissions practices following the Varsity Blues scandal that erupted nationally in 2019 over bribery, standardized test cheating and misrepresenting student-athletes to influence admissions decisions at several leading universities.Pitt wanted to safeguard against such influence, he said. It did not formally announce the change in practice.\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the consideration of (alumni relations) as checked on previous Common Data Set data was not listed as \u2018important\u2019 or \u2018very important,\u2019\u201d Stonesifer said. \u201cIt has never been a primary or \u2018plus\u2019 factor in Pitt admissions of undergraduates.\u201dPitt declined to say how many legacies are part of its entering classes.At Carnegie Mellon, the alumni association defines legacies as \u201cstudents with family members who graduated from CMU, among them parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles and other more distant relatives,\u201d according to the school\u2019s website.\u201cLove of CMU is genetic. Our community boasts nearly 4,000 legacies among the current students and alumni, including five families who have five generations of CMU graduates,\u201d the website said.Bruce Edelston, a 1976 graduate and association board member, said he does not have strong feelings either way and sees both sides of the argument over legacy preferences.\u201cThe pros are certainly fundraising development. I think people like to think that if they give a lot of money to a university, their children will get special preference,\u201d he said. \u201cI can sort of understand the other side saying it\u2019s unfair to other applicants.\u201dHe said he prefers merit over affirmative action but does not see legacy programs as specifically a race issue.Steidel is also a Carnegie Mellon alumnus, graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry and administration and management science in 1978.The university is bigger, more competitive and more international in reach than it was when Steidel was a student.He said he believes that parents of legacies understand what a challenging place Carnegie Mellon has become today for an applicant.\u201cI couldn\u2019t get in today, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he quipped. \u201cThe world has changed.\u201dBill Schackner is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

    "hn_content": "- Carnegie Mellon and Pitt have announced that the children of alumni will no longer receive preferential treatment in admissions.\n- This decision is seen as a step towards eliminating non-meritocratic practices in college admissions.\n- The number of students admitted to elite universities through non-meritocratic means is significant, with more than 43% of white applicants admitted to Harvard falling into one or more of these categories.\n- Legacy admissions have been justified with the argument that they promote social networking and provide opportunities to interact with influential individuals.\n- Critics argue that legacy admissions contradict the idea of equality of opportunity and undermine the meritocratic principles of university admissions.\n- The debate surrounding legacy admissions often intersects with the broader discussion on affirmative action and its impact on university admissions.\n- The argument arises about whether racial preferences justify legacy admissions or vice versa.\n- Some argue that the focus should be on addressing the larger structural issues to ensure equal access to quality education and opportunities.\n- Affirmative action is seen as a more comprehensive approach to promoting equality of opportunity, including providing quality schooling, healthcare, reducing tuition fees, and considering poverty as a criterion rather than race.\n- The discussion around legacy admissions and affirmative action highlights questions around equality of opportunity and the idea of meritocracy in university admissions.\n- Legacy admissions have been a contentious issue for years, and the decision by Carnegie Mellon and Pitt to eliminate this practice is seen as an important development in promoting meritocracy in admissions.- Legacy admissions at prestigious universities, such as Harvard, have long been a controversial practice.\n- Legacy admissions give preference to the children of alumni, often leading to a disproportionate number of wealthy and influential students being admitted.\n- The argument in defense of legacy admissions is that they bring together the children of the rich and powerful with academically talented students from middle-class backgrounds, creating a valuable network.\n- Some argue that legacy admissions benefit both the legacy students and the non-legacy students by providing opportunities for networking and learning from each other.\n- Critics argue that legacy admissions perpetuate privilege and prevent equal opportunities for all students.\n- The recent discussion on legacy admissions is part of a broader conversation on diversity and fairness in college admissions.\n- It is important to consider the goals of universities and what they prioritize in the admissions process, such as academic success, career success, donations, and cultural cachet.\n- The future of legacy admissions is uncertain, but there may be a shift towards greater meritocracy and diversity in admissions practices.\n- The decision to end affirmative action in college admissions has also prompted discussions about the fairness of other admissions practices, including legacy admissions.\n- Ultimately, the debate around legacy admissions raises questions about the purpose of higher education and what should be prioritized in the admissions process.- The discussion revolves around the worth and value of attending prestigious universities like MIT and Harvard for career growth and success.\n- Legacy admissions, which give preference to children of alumni, are seen as creating advantages and connections for future generations.\n- The promise of MIT is ruthless academic excellence, while Harvard and Yale promise induction into the American ruling class.\n- The debate raises questions about the importance of intelligence versus other factors like attitude, personality, and connections.\n- \"Ruling-class\" credentials and connections can be highly valuable in lucrative sales, investing, law, lobbying, non-profit positions, and corporate leadership.\n- The lack of MIT alumni in the Supreme Court is contrasted with the dominance of Harvard alumni, suggesting a correlation between prestige and career success.\n- Legacy admissions are criticized as perpetuating advantages for the wealthy and hindering meritocracy.\n- The education quality and administration of Harvard are questioned, suggesting it may not be worth the price of admission.\n\nThis discussion provides insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of attending elite universities and the role of legacy admissions in creating advantages for privileged individuals. It also raises questions about the relationship between intelligence, connections, and career success.",

    "content": "NETSCAPE AND SUN ANNOUNCE JAVASCRIPT, THE OPEN, CROSS-PLATFORM OBJECT SCRIPTING LANGUAGE FOR ENTERPRISE NETWORKS AND THE INTERNET28 INDUSTRY-LEADING COMPANIES TO ENDORSE JAVASCRIPT AS A COMPLEMENT TO JAVA FOR EASY ONLINE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENTMOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (December 4, 1995) -- Netscape Communications Corporation (NASDAQ: NSCP) and Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ:SUNW), today announced JavaScript, an open, cross-platform object scripting language for the creation and customization of applications on enterprise networks and the Internet. The JavaScript language complements Java, Sun's industry-leading object-oriented, cross-platform programming language. The initial version of JavaScript is available now as part of the beta version of Netscape Navigator 2.0, which is currently available for downloading from Netscape's web site.In addition, 28 industry-leading companies, including America Online, Inc., Apple Computer, Inc., Architext Software, Attachmate Corporation, AT&T;, Borland International, Brio Technology, Inc., Computer Associates, Inc., Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, Iconovex Corporation, Illustra Information Technologies, Inc., Informix Software, Inc., Intuit, Inc., Macromedia, Metrowerks, Inc., Novell, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Paper Software, Inc., Precept Software, Inc., RAD Technologies, Inc., The Santa Cruz Operation, Inc., Silicon Graphics, Inc., Spider Technologies, Sybase, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Verity, Inc., and Vermeer Technologies, Inc., have endorsed JavaScript as an open standard object scripting language and intend to provide it in future products. The draft specification of JavaScript, as well as the final draft specification of Java, is planned for publishing and submission to appropriate standards bodies for industry review and comment this month.JavaScript is an easy-to-use object scripting language designed for creating live online applications that link together objects and resources on both clients and servers. While Java is used by programmers to create new objects and applets, JavaScript is designed for use by HTML page authors and enterprise application developers to dynamically script the behavior of objects running on either the client or the server. JavaScript is analogous to Visual Basic in that it can be used by people with little or no programming experience to quickly construct complex applications. JavaScript's design represents the next generation of software designed specifically for the Internet and is:designed for creating network-centric applicationscomplementary to and integrated with Javacomplementary to and integrated with HTMLopen and cross-platform.Java, developed by Sun, is an object-oriented programming language that operates independent of any operating system or microprocessor. Java programs called applets can be transmitted over a network and run on any client, providing the multimedia richness of a CD-ROM over corporate networks and the Internet. Java has been widely hailed by programmers because it eliminates the need to port applications, and by managers of information systems for its potential to lower the costs of distributing and maintaining applications across the network.With JavaScript, an HTML page might contain an intelligent form that performs loan payment or currency exchange calculations right on the client in response to user input. A multimedia weather forecast applet written in Java can be scripted by JavaScript to display appropriate images and sounds based on the current weather readings in a region. A server-side JavaScript script might pull data out of a relational database and format it in HTML on the fly. A page might contain JavaScript scripts that run on both the client and the server. On the server, the scripts might dynamically compose and format HTML content based on user preferences stored in a relational database, and on the client, the scripts would glue together an assortment of Java applets and HTML form elements into a live interactive user interface for specifying a net-wide search for information.Java programs and JavaScript scripts are designed to run on both clients and servers, with JavaScript scripts used to modify the properties and behavior of Java objects, so the range of live online applications that dynamically present information to and interact with users over enterprise networks or the Internet is virtually unlimited. Netscape will support Java and JavaScript in client and server products as well as programming tools and applications to make this vision a reality.\"Programmers have been overwhelmingly enthusiastic about Java because it was designed from the ground up for the Internet. JavaScript is a natural fit, since it's also designed for the Internet and Unicode-based worldwide use,\" said Bill Joy, co-founder and vice president of research at Sun. \"JavaScript will be the most effective method to connect HTML-based content to Java applets.\"Netscape's authoring and application development tools -- Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0, Netscape LiveWire and Netscape LiveWire Pro -- are designed for rapid development and deployment of JavaScript applications. Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 enables developers to create and edit JavaScript scripts, while Netscape LiveWire enables JavaScript programs to be installed, run and managed on Netscape servers, both within the enterprise and across the Internet. Netscape LiveWire Pro adds support for JavaScript connectivity to high-performance relational databases from Illustra, Informix, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase. Java and JavaScript support are being built into all Netscape products to provide a unified, front-to-back, client/server/tool environment for building and deploying live online applications.Java is available to developers free of charge. The Java Compiler and Java Developer's Kit as well as the HotJava browser and related documentation are available from Sun's web site at http://java.sun.com. In addition, the Java source code can be licensed for a fee. Details on licensing are also available via the java.sun.com web page. To date, Sun has licensed Java to a number of leading technology companies, including Borland, Macromedia, Mitsubishi, Netscape, Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Spyglass, and Toshiba. Sun's Workshop for Java toolkit is scheduled for release in Spring 1996. Sun's NEO product family, the first complete development, operating and management environment for object-oriented networked applications, will also use Java-enabled browsers as front-ends to the NEO environment.Netscape and Sun plan to propose JavaScript to the W3 Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an open Internet scripting language standard. JavaScript will be an open, freely licensed proposed standard available to the entire Internet community. Existing Sun Java licensees will receive a license to JavaScript. In addition, Sun and Netscape intend to make a source code reference implementation of JavaScript available for royalty-free licensing, further encouraging its adoption as a standard in a wide variety of products.Netscape Communications Corporation is a premier provider of open software for linking people and information over enterprise networks and the Internet. The company offers a full line of Netscape Navigator clients, Netscape servers, development tools and Netscape Internet Applications to create a complete platform for next-generation, live online applications. Traded on Nasdaq under the symbol \"NSCP\", Netscape Communications Corporation is based in Mountain View, California.With annual revenues of $6 billion, Sun Microsystems, Inc. provides solutions that enable customers to build and maintain open network computing environments.

    "content": "A glitch in the SEO matrix(or: A comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data management)07-14-23Izzy Miller<- blogLast week, I found a glitch in the matrix of SEO. For some reason, every month 2,400 people search for the exact string \u201ca comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data management\u201d.Data from SEMRushAnd weirdly, there are ~1,000 results for the exact query \u201cA comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data management\u201d. This is at once a weirdly small and weirdly large number\u2014 small because most Google searches have tens of millions of results, but large because most Google searches for exact string matches of that length actually turn up few, or no results. So there's something to this phrase.Looking at the results, it's immediately obvious that most of these are very thin AI generated blogs just published in the last couple of months.Sell gold near me!Wtf? Of course, I stopped doing my SEO research (b o r i n g) and started trying to figure out how to rank for this keyword why the heck people were dogpiling into this weird query.A strange game...And I figured it out! But to fully understand this phenomenon, we need a bit of background on SEO.SEO is a strange game. Here's how it goes:You run a business, and your business has a website.You want people to find your website when they search things on Google, so they buy your stuff.There's an almost infinite number of keywords people are searching\u2026But only some of those keywords are reasonable in topic for your business.And for those valuable keywords, there's only a couple places worth anything in the SERP (Search Engine Results Page). Even if your site is result #12 out of \u201cAbout 82,800,000 results\u201d for a hot keyword, you probably get nothing for your effort.So you keep trying new content until you get something in the top few spots.SEO is also a zero-sum game. The only way to get into those coveted top spots is to unseat an existing entry\u2014 someone just like you, with a business just like yours, who set off on the same mission as you, but simply didn't do a good enough job to keep your new incredible content from bumping them off. Their loss, your gain.But there is one way to outplay this competition a little bit: find a new keyword that nobody else is ranking for, but that people are searching for. Of course, you have to strike fast, and after a bit of time this will also turn into the zero-sum leapfrogging of any popular keyword. But you have a tiny bit of green field.A comprehensive ecosystem of open-source software for big data managementThat's exactly what's happening here! There is a Cisco Introduction to IoT course that must have gotten pretty popular recently. One of the potential questions on a sample final exam is about Hadoop, which, as we all know, is a comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data management !This means that thousands of students started searching for \u201ca comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data management\u201d every month as they studied for their final IoT exam. And the SEO analytics dashboards noticed.The really interesting thing about this case though, is that the original source content driving this search interest is not publicly available or indexed. This query is copied and pasted verbatim from an exam, which are famously not something you want to be found on Google.Most of the time when something new emerges that's worth searching for, there's some party that's already front-run the SEO game. New Apple Vision Pro? Been talked about for months, plus Apple's got a page for it. OpenAI Code Interpreter? There's already 8 million results.But here, there was a rare SEO vacuum: a very specific high volume query, with almost zero content to match. The SEO dashboard tools see that, think \"JACKPOT!\", and that's why we have a thousand low-quality posts desperately trying to rank for this strange and confusingly specific keyword. Mystery solved.The problem with SEOBut there's a problem here that exposes the strange, mindless behavior of finding a keyword in an SEO dashboard and pouncing on it without thinking twice.That 2 second Quizlet GIF above actually contains 100% of the information the user searching needs. They just want to know the answer to their Jeopardy-style question, and nothing more. One word, \u201cHadoop\u201d, does the trick.Google knows this, so it adds a \u201cQuestion and Answers\u201d block before the first SERP result, probably diverting a tremendous amount of traffic away from that page. Honors for that top page go to Ben Farrell at Data Driven Daily\u2014 Ben if you're reading I'd love to know the backstory of how you discovered this keyword and how much traffic it actually drives!But since that article was written purely to dominate the SEO rankings and please The Algorithm, it's metastasized from the one-word answer \u201cHadoop\u201d into 1,066 words of jargon. The sentence about Hadoop doesn't even appear until word 491, almost halfway through the article. It wasn't written to answer someone's question or satisfy their search intent. It was just written to rank.And this is BY FAR the best article in the entire SERP about the subject. All the rest appear to be either copy/pastes of Ben's article, AI generated garbage, or just outright scam links. Of the three results below, the top one is a site dedicated to copying & pasting answers to Computer Based Tests (CBTs) in a freeform stream-of-consciousness blog that covers test subjects from apartheid history to printer network management. The other two escape me.My favorite result is from \u201cHighAdviser.com\u201d, which has one of the most powerful homepages I have ever seen. My favorite little detail here is that the date is actually wrong, somehow? It's July 14th as I write this, not 10th.Also, I mean, \"Innovation Management Generate Fresh Ideas\"? \u201cBoys And A Dog Homemaking Homeschool Tips\u2014 For Busy Folks? No notes. I desperately want to quit my job and write for High Adviser full time. I think I could really uplevel their innovation management, and generate fresh ideas\u2014 for Busy Folks!There's even a 4chan /b/ post in the SERP, obviously with an NSFW image attached to it. The irony is that this is genuinely the most helpful item on the entire search page. This should be the #1 result!So what?I sort of doubt that this is driving meaningful traffic to these sites, but it's fascinating to me to watch an SEO Meme like this develop, and see how fast the programmatic SEO hounds hurl themselves at a fresh target.This is only going to get weirder with LLMs, at least in the interim before everyone stops using Google. There's now a ton of tools that automatically find low competition keywords and generate hundreds of AI blog posts for you in just a few minutes. Here's a guy claiming to be generating 150,000 AI SEO blogs:how to make a 500 blog post niche site about \"best running shoes for xyz\" in 10 minsfind low kd keywords in the nichewrite 500 articles with drafthorsepublish to Wordpressthis one of the 300 niche sites im building pic.twitter.com/0sqC6r7OAH\u2014 Cody Schneider (@codyschneiderxx) July 13, 2023Some of these might be helpful! But lots of them wont, and there'll be thousands of \"glitch\" keywords just like this one that get caught in a circular AI arms race of unhelpful SEO content. The real problem is just the lack of alignment these articles have with search intent\u2014 if you want people to land on your site and remember you favorably, you should just answer their question. Everything else is extraneous. I don't have high hopes for AI accurately determining the intent of all the strange keyword combinations out there, and so I expect we'll see more and more of these glitches.Perhaps, only 4chan can save us with their reputation for kindness and straight to the point questions and answers...PS: secretly, I hope that this post starts ranking for \u201ca comprehensive ecosystem of open source software for big data management\u201d, which is why I have said it verbatim so many times. To be honest, I'd settle for the 19th spot: just above highadviser.com.Liked this post? Follow me on Twitter @isidoremiller.",
