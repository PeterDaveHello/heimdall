### [Sao Paulo: A city with no outdoor advertisements (2013)](https://www.amusingplanet.com/2013/07/sao-paulo-city-with-no-outdoor.html)

- In 2006, the mayor of S達o Paulo passed a law that banned all outdoor advertisements in the city, including billboards, transit ads, and store signs. This resulted in the removal of 15,000 billboards and the shrinking of store signs to comply with the new law.

The removal of advertisements also revealed previously overlooked architectural beauty in the city.
- S達o Paulo is not the only city to ban outdoor advertisements, as other places in the US and Europe have imposed similar restrictions. This move sparked interest because it challenged the traditional presence of advertisements in urban environments and highlighted the potential benefits of a more visually clean cityscape.
