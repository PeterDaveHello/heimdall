### [Mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets](https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20230714121907)

- OpenBSD has implemented mandatory enforcement of indirect branch targets on the AMD64 (Intel) and ARM64 platforms.
- The approach taken by OpenBSD is different from Linux, as on OpenBSD, the enforcement is on by default, unless a binary requests opt-out, while on Linux, executables without enforcement can still exist and work unsafely.
- This enforcement provides increased protection against certain security vulnerabilities and ensures that applications are more secure on OpenBSD.
