### [Don't Take VC Funding â€“ It Will Destroy Your Company](https://www.eidel.io/2023/07/09/vc-funding/)

- VC funding is not a guarantee of success and may actually indicate a company's inability to be profitable on its own.
- Taking VC funding means selling a part of your company and changing the objective from building a company you like to building a company that can be sold for a higher price in the future.
- VC funding can lead to second-order effects such as hiring more employees than desired, spending time looking for new investors instead of building the company, and prioritizing growth over profitability.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36654960)

- The author argues that raising money from venture capitalists (VCs) puts startups on a defined path with limited outcomes: failure, acquisition, or going public.
- The most important thing is to consider one's goals and the specific circumstances of the company when deciding whether or not to take VC funding.
- VC funding can distort incentives and hinder a company's vision by prioritizing growth and profit over other goals.

### [How small is the smallest .NET Hello World binary?](https://blog.washi.dev/posts/tinysharp/)

### [InfluxDB Cloud shuts down in Belgium; some weren't notified before data deletion](https://community.influxdata.com/t/getting-weird-results-from-gcp-europe-west1/30615)

- Users of InfluxDB Cloud in Belgium experienced issues with missing or incomplete data on their dashboards.
- It was discovered that there was a discontinuation of AWS ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) and GCP europe-west1 (Belgium) regions, which may have caused the data problems.
- Some users did not receive emails from InfluxDB notifying them of this change.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36657829)

- InfluxDB Cloud shut down in Belgium without proper notification, causing data loss for some users.

### [Using Lidar to map tree shadows](https://tedpiotrowski.svbtle.com/using-lidar-for-tree-shadows-in-shademap)

- The author has developed a website called ShadeMap that simulates tree shadows using LiDAR data.
- Radar, which is commonly used for shadow simulation, misses 90% of the shadows cast by trees because it only reflects off the ground.
- LiDAR, on the other hand, reflects off all objects and provides a much richer model of the earth's surface, making it more accurate for shadow simulation. However, collecting LiDAR data is time-consuming and expensive.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36658001)

- Radar does not include vegetation in its mapping because it reflects off the ground, making objects like trees and buildings invisible.
- The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) uses radar that does penetrate into some canopies, but it didn't capture foliage or building shadows in its data.
- Lidar can be used to map tree shadows with granular detail and has various potential applications such as solar panel placement, photography, car parking, and more.

### [Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788741/sarah-silverman-openai-meta-chatgpt-llama-copyright-infringement-chatbots-artificial-intelligence-ai)

- Comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey are suing OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement, alleging that the companies trained their AI models on illegally-acquired datasets containing their works without their consent.
- The lawsuits claim that OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's LLaMA summarized the books of the plaintiffs when prompted, infringing on their copyrights.
- The authors are seeking statutory damages, restitution of profits, and more, and the lawsuits challenge the limits of copyright in the AI industry.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36657540)

- Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement, claiming that they have used copyrighted works without permission in their AI training datasets.
- This lawsuit brings attention to the debate surrounding copyright and fair use in the AI community.
- The case questions the accuracy of OpenAI's ChatGPT's summaries, raises concerns about the legality of using copyrighted material in training AI models, and may have implications for the use of copyrighted content in AI training datasets.

### [California needs real math education, not gimmicks](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/california-needs-real-math-education)
