### [When an app asks for permissions, it should have a "feed fake data" option](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Nifflas/110668040598715116)

- When an app asks for permissions, users should have the option to provide fake data instead of granting full access.
- This approach would allow users to protect their personal information while still being able to use the app.
- Actively punishing services by feeding them fake data can be more effective than boycotting them.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36644895)

- Ongoing debate about users' control over their data, the impact of app permissions, and the need for transparency and accountability from app developers and device manufacturers.
- Concerns about privacy and user autonomy, and the potential for new developments in the future.
- Discussions on the implementation of region localization on the App Store, dissatisfaction with the current system, and suggestions for alternative solutions.

### [If PEP 703 is accepted, Meta can commit three engineer-years to no-GIL CPython](https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/99)

- The statement "pmf = sum(counters) # does this work? can't remember" will work if an initial empty Counter is provided.
- Without an initial empty Counter, the statement will start with 0 and raise an error.
- This information is relevant for understanding how to use the statement correctly in programming.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36643670)

- PEP 703, if accepted, could lead to the removal of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, offering improved parallelism and performance.
- The transition to a GIL-less Python would require rebuilding and updating C-API extensions, which could be a major undertaking for codebases heavily relying on them.
- Facebook (Meta) has committed to investing engineer years in improving the Python interpreter and making it possible to disable the GIL.

### [Software engineers hate code](https://www.dancowell.com/software-engineers-hate-code/)
