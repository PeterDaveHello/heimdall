### Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm Now Open-Sourced

- [Twitter's Recommendation Algorithm (Discussion Service)](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35391433), [Article]({self.url})

Twitter's algorithm has faced scrutiny for potentially favoring right-wing American political content but Twitter denies nefarious intent. Documents revealed Twitter employees with a leftist ideological bias spending time blacklisting right-wing politicians. Twitter CEO requested transparency but only a fraction of the documents have been released. Elon Musk requested Twitter to remove a feature that tracked engagement metrics for important accounts, but its existence and potential reasons for creation is debated. Twitter released its natural language processing algorithm, but there is limited transparency, making it difficult to evaluate. Twitter open-sourced its recommendation algorithm, "Home Mixer," consisting of three-stage pipelines to increase user engagement. Twitter's "For You" timeline uses in-network and out-of-network sources, a neural network, and heuristics to provide a diverse and balanced feed to users.

Italian privacy regulator bans OpenAI's ChatGPT over alleged privacy violations, particularly for exposing minors to unsuitable content without verifying age. Critics argue that the ban is unnecessary and could limit innovation. The status of privacy regulations in different countries, like GDPR, is questioned. The comments section features debates on finding a balance between innovation and regulation and the need for technology ministers to have technical expertise. The ban highlights the challenge of enforcing GDPR's extraterritorial jurisdiction worldwide. The Tech Times covers news and analysis on various policy areas but is not the correct platform for this content.

### NYPD non-compliance with surveillance laws raises concerns in tech community

- [NYPD is refusing to comply with NYC's new surveillance tech laws (Discussion Service)](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35387000), [Article]({self.url})

The NYPD's non-compliance with surveillance technology laws in New York City is causing concern in the tech community. Users on Hacker News discuss the prevalence of surveillance, challenges of surveillance footage as evidence, and concerns about government surveillance leading to a surveillance state. There is debate over whether it is the responsibility of law enforcement to decide the constitutionality of laws. Police accountability and oversight are crucial, but there is minimal accountability when it comes to the NYPD. The NYPD is also accused of not disclosing information about its surveillance technologies. The lack of police accountability and transparency highlights the need for police reform.

### Feasibility & Future of Building Low-Cost Language Models for Web Browsers

- [Could you train a ChatGPT-beating model for $85k and run it in a browser? (Discussion Service)](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35391115), [Article]({self.url})

Building low-cost language models for web browsers is being explored by tech experts with a focus on using fine tuning techniques against the LLaMA model to emulate GPT-3. Train-on-idle-GPU frameworks are being proposed to reduce the cost of training models, but challenges in parallelizing the training process and inter-node latency remain. Some suggest that creating an open-source, non-profit AI clone of OpenAI could be a solution. Projects using lightweight models like Alpaca from Stanford are attracting attention for their accessibility and low hardware requirements. New models like LLaMA and Alpaca could face increasing competition from openly licensed models in the future. Advancements in WebAssembly and WebGPU are enabling the stable diffusion image model and the Hugging Face Transformer library of models to run entirely in the browser. Safe web browser capabilities are crucial, and the new H100 Tensor Core GPU from Nvidia provides 30x faster performance over their previous model.

### Facial recognition tech misuse raises concerns for civil liberties

- [Police relied on Clearview AI and put the wrong person in jail (Discussion Service)](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35389566), [Article]({self.url})

A wrongful arrest of an innocent man using facial recognition software highlights concerns about the technology's reliability and infringement on civil liberties. The case underscores the need for stricter regulations and responsible management of emerging technologies. E-warrants and automated matching also raise concerns about false positives and rubber-stamping by judges. The combination of AI technology with human social factors has resulted in complex damages. The lack of laws and regulations to control the use of such technologies is cause for caution. The misuse of technology should not go unchecked, and the importance of ethical and legal standards must be emphasized.

### Janet Language: A New Way to Create Redistributable CLI Apps

- [Janet for Mortals (Discussion Service)](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35386405), [Article]({self.url})

Janet Language, a LISP-inspired programming language, is being considered as an excellent option for creating redistributable CLI apps due to its ability to compile programs into statically-linked native binaries. It is easy to distribute even to non-technical users and has small binaries, making it convenient for making CLI or desktop apps, especially those targeting non-technical users. Janet's feature-rich ecosystem makes it a compelling choice, particularly for non-technical users. Its entire ecosystem is less than 1MB, and it boots up considerably faster than larger languages such as Python. Janet shares many similarities with Lua, making it an excellent choice for text-wrangling. A book on Janet, "Janet for Mortals" by Ian Henry, caters to those who already know how to program; the language is small, simple, usable on Windows, and has built-in concurrency, multithreading, and support for parsing expression grammars.

### CDC team falls ill investigating hazardous Ohio train derailment
