### [Rewriting the Ruby parser](https://railsatscale.com//2023-06-12-rewriting-the-ruby-parser/)

- Shopify has developed a new Ruby parser called YARP that can parse Ruby files in various codebases and gems.
- The motivation behind developing YARP is to address long-standing issues with the current CRuby parser, such as maintainability, error tolerance, portability, and performance.
- YARP aims to improve maintainability by providing better documentation, making it easier to read, understand, contribute to, change, and test the code.
- Error tolerance is important because it allows the parser to continue parsing a program even if it encounters syntax errors, providing more accurate metadata and improving developer productivity.
- The portability of YARP allows it to be used outside of the CRuby codebase and enables the development of standardized tooling that can be used across different Ruby implementations.
- Performance improvements are being worked on, and initial results show that YARP can parse a large number of Ruby files in a relatively short time with minimal memory usage.
- YARP will be integrated into various Ruby runtimes and tools, such as JRuby and TruffleRuby, and will be shipped as a library with Ruby 3.3.
- The development of YARP has already attracted contributions from many developers, leading to a stronger and more collaborative community.
- The future path for YARP includes further improving error tolerance, enhancing performance, expanding compatibility with existing tools, and merging it into the CRuby repository.
