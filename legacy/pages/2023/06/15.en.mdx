## June 15, 2023### [New York State Senate passes prohibitions on non-competes](https://ogletree.com/insights/new-york-state-senate-passes-prohibitions-on-non-competes/)- The New York State Senate has approved two bills that could ban or limit the use of non-compete agreements in the state.

- Bill No. S3100A would prohibit employers from entering into non-compete agreements with employees, independent contractors, or others who perform work for the employer. Violators could be subject to up to $10,000 in damages per violation.
- Bill No. S6748 aims to prevent the establishment of monopolies and restraints of trade. It would require employers to have a "good faith basis" to believe a non-compete agreement is enforceable and would also broaden the definition of non-compete agreements to include certain other types of agreements.
- Both bills still need to pass the New York State Assembly and be approved by Governor Kathy Hochul to become law.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36329483)- The New York State Senate has passed prohibitions on non-compete agreements, which is a significant development.

- This ban primarily affects the finance and technology sectors, particularly high-frequency trading (HFT) firms and proprietary trading shops employing software professionals.
- The new law invalidates contractual non-compete agreements but does not address non-association clauses, which restrict working with former colleagues.

- The loss of these subreddits means that users no longer have access to the valuable content, discussions, and answers found on Reddit.
- Reddit's blackout highlights the communal and informational nature of the platform, and the impact it has on the wider internet beyond just one website.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36327210)- The open internet is becoming centralized, with platforms like Reddit dominating the space.

- The lack of searchability in platforms like Discord hinders the preservation and discoverability of valuable information.
- The shift from blogs and forums to platforms like Reddit has limited the discoverability of specialized and niche content.

### [Native JSON Output from GPT-4](https://yonom.substack.com/p/native-json-output-from-gpt-4)- OpenAI has released a new feature called function calling for their GPT models, which allows them to call a function and return JSON data instead of just a string.

- This feature is currently available for the chat models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613.
- A demo app called Recipe Creator showcases how this new feature can be used to generate JSON responses for providing instructions on cooking dishes.
- By using a JSON schema, developers can define the structure of the JSON data they want to receive from the GPT model.
- This new feature reduces the need for prompt engineering and makes it easier to generate correct JSON output.
- It also allows for the possibility of using GPT models as intelligent backend APIs for applications and no-code prototyping tools.

### [Always the same warning signs](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/always-same-warning-signs)- Laronde, a biotech firm, has faced major problems reproducing data that helped raise them hundreds of millions of dollars last year.

- The company's circular-mRNA technology, known as "endless RNA," was expected to have better stability, distribution, and longer-lasting protein expression, but no one else could get it to work.
- Colleagues were denied access to raw data, while management blamed others for replication issues, similar to the Theranos scandal.
- Warning signs include only one person achieving successful results, stonewalling legitimate questions, and missing or hidden important data.
- These warning signs should not be ignored, as they indicate potential problems within a company or research project, which can lead to financial loss and damaged careers.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36325349)- Computer tech is often seen as a better fit for startup funding compared to biotech because it is easier to understand and evaluate.

### [Serotonin booster leads to increased functional brain connectivity](https://www.alphagalileo.org/en-gb/Item-Display/ItemId/234406?returnurl=https://www.alphagalileo.org/en-gb/Item-Display/ItemId/234406)- A new study published in Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging examines the effects of a serotonin booster called prucalopride on the brain.

- Serotonin receptors, particularly 5-HT4 receptors, are found in areas of the brain that regulate mood and cognitive function.
- The study found that participants who received prucalopride showed increased functional connectivity in the brain, specifically between cognitive networks and regions involved in attention and information processing.
- These findings suggest that prucalopride may have therapeutic potential for treating cognitive deficits in mood disorders and other psychiatric conditions.
- The study adds to the growing evidence that drugs targeting serotonin receptors could be a novel way to improve cognitive function in depression and other disorders.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36321843)- Intelligence in one area does not necessarily mean qualification in other fields.

- The study suggests that a serotonin booster leads to increased functional brain connectivity.
- It is important to approach the suggestions and conclusions made in the comments with caution and skepticism.
