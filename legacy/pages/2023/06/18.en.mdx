### [Bullshit Jobs (2018)](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-bullshit-jobs)

- The phenomenon of "bullshit jobs" refers to forms of employment that are considered pointless, unnecessary, or even pernicious by the person doing the job.- Bullshit jobs can be found in both the private and public sectors, ranging from office work to labor-intensive tasks.
- The subjective perspective of the employee is important in determining whether a job is considered bullshit.
- Bullshit jobs are distinct from "shit jobs," which are low-paid, physically demanding but still considered necessary.
- Market reforms can result in the creation of more bureaucracy, and the assumption that the private sector is more efficient is flawed.
- Many administrative jobs held by women are considered to be bullshit jobs, but assuming that mainly women are in these jobs is sexist and ignorant.
- The rise of bullshit jobs has negative implications for workers' creativity, imagination, and overall well-being.
- Despite the challenges, some workers are able to find purpose and meaning outside of their bullshit jobs through activism or creative pursuits.
- The rise of bullshit jobs is a real social problem that has received little public attention, and the reasons for their proliferation are complex and interconnected.
- The current system of valuing work is flawed, and there is a need to reassess what is considered valuable in society.
- The rise of bullshit jobs can be seen as a result of changing attitudes towards corporations' responsibility to workers and an increased focus on profit.
- Bullshit jobs can create feelings of frustration, depression, and self-doubt among workers.
- Bullshit jobs often lack clear scripts or cultural models, leading to anxiety and a sense of fraudulence.
- The rise of bullshit jobs is a social issue that goes against assumptions about how market economies should work.
- The financial sector is one industry where many employees consider their work to be pointless and lacking value.
- Government regulations can contribute to the creation of unnecessary bureaucratic jobs, but bullshit jobs are not confined to the public sector.
- The underlying reasons for the increase in bullshit jobs are complex and multifaceted, and further exploration is needed.
- The rise of bullshit jobs is a phenomenon observed in various industries, and the rise of the service economy does not fully explain this trend.
- The increase in productivity has not resulted in proportional increases in worker compensation, and many of the benefits go to those in unnecessary managerial positions.
- The rise of bullshit jobs is a result of managerialism in the corporate world, which shares similarities with feudalism.
- The concept of social value and compensation is often inverse, with high-paying professions having negative social value and low-paying professions having positive social value.
- The current system of valuing work is flawed, and there is a need for a reassessment of what is considered valuable in society.
- The rise of bullshit jobs has negative implications for individuals and society as a whole, but it has not received much public attention.
- The reasons for the proliferation of bullshit jobs are complex and interconnected, and further exploration is needed to fully understand this phenomenon.
- The rise of bullshit jobs highlights the need to reevaluate the purpose and value of work in people's lives.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36373190)

- The book "Bullshit Jobs" explores the concept of jobs that are seen as pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious by the employees themselves.- It challenges the notion that people are the best judge of whether their job is "bullshit" and argues that their perception may not align with the organization's perspective.
- The book highlights the need to consider the subjective experiences of workers in evaluating the meaningfulness of their jobs.

### [I don't need your query language](https://antonz.org/fancy-ql/)

- Every year, new general-purpose database engines are released with new query languages.- The author believes that having a separate query language is a weakness because learning a new language is burdensome.
- SQL is already a common ground language for general-purpose databases and is easier to use than learning a new language.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36369018)

- SQL has limitations when it comes to querying heterogeneous databases and dealing with multiplicity mismatch in JOINs.- JSON support in databases like SQLite allows for efficient aggregation of results and passing of JSON data.
- There are differing opinions on the advantages and limitations of SQL, and the need for a new query language is discussed.

### [The Secret Sauce behind 100K context window in LLMs: all tricks in one place](https://blog.gopenai.com/how-to-speed-up-llms-and-use-100k-context-window-all-tricks-in-one-place-ffd40577b4c)

- Large Language Models (LLMs) can now process an extremely large context window, up to 100K input tokens, during training and inference.- Increasing the context length allows LLMs to understand and process larger amounts of custom information, leading to higher accuracy and personalization.
- The original Transformer architecture has limitations when it comes to handling large context lengths, but researchers have developed several optimization techniques to overcome these challenges.
- These techniques include using alternative positional encodings, implementing sparse attention, efficient attention layer implementations, using multi-query attention, conditional computation, and utilizing GPUs with larger RAM capacity (such as 80GB A100 GPUs).
- These optimization techniques significantly speed up the training and inference of LLMs with large context lengths, making it feasible to train models with 100K context lengths.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36374936)

- The article discusses the techniques used to extend the context window in LLMs and make them work effectively.- One interesting observation is that placing instructions after the reference text in lengthy text bodies improves model performance.
- The RWKV-LM project on GitHub offers a potential solution for handling large context windows by using an RNN and caching the document, but it may have limitations for complex tasks.
- Some comments discuss the positioning of prompts and how it can affect model performance.
- Anthropics' Claude is highlighted as being underappreciated and potentially outperforming GPT4 in certain instances.
- The computational resources required for large context windows are discussed, with the suggestion that a retrieval method or heavy computations on important tokens could help reduce costs.
- The potential applications of LLMs with large context windows are mentioned, such as programming and bug finding.
- The difficulty of accessing and using LLMs at the same scale as large organizations is highlighted.
- The concept of lossy compression and efficiency in utilizing available parameters is discussed.
- The limitations and potential benefits of RNNs compared to transformers are mentioned.
- The need for benchmarks that specifically test large context sizes is mentioned.

### [Merging bcachefs](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/934692/5046d466490d9220/)

- The bcachefs filesystem was discussed at the 2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-Management and BPF Summit, and the process for merging it into the mainline kernel seems closer than ever.- The creator of bcachefs, Kent Overstreet, highlighted the progress and features of the filesystem, including scalability improvements and the implementation of snapshots and erasure coding.
- The bcachefs team is growing, and there is an automated testing infrastructure in place. Overstreet also emphasized his advocacy for writing code in Rust and his plan to gradually rewrite bcachefs in Rust.
- The process of upstreaming bcachefs involves reviewing and merging a large number of patches. The response and decision ultimately lie with Linus Torvalds, who is the maintainer responsible for merging new filesystems. Other concerns include bug report management and the number of filesystems in the kernel.
- Overall, bcachefs has the potential to be a high-performance and reliable filesystem with modern features, and its progress towards upstreaming is generating interest in the tech community.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36366002)

- Bcachefs is a file system that is in a good position to be merged into the Linux kernel.- There are concerns about the number of filesystems in the kernel and the impact of changes on all filesystems.
