### [I don't need your query language](https://antonz.org/fancy-ql/)

- The author expresses their frustration with the emergence of new query languages in the industry and argues that using SQL as a common ground language for general-purpose databases is more practical and efficient.
- The author compares a new query language called FancyQL with SQL, highlighting that SQL is not as complex as it is often portrayed and can effectively handle data-related tasks.
- The author emphasizes the advantages of SQL, such as its widespread usage, support from major database engines, and continuous improvement through a standards committee. They assert that there is no need for a fancy query language when SQL is already capable.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36369018)

- SQL queries can have drawbacks when it comes to querying databases with different types and multiplicity, leading to redundant output and lack of error handling.
- JSON support in databases allows for aggregating subselect results into a single column, providing more flexibility in querying.
- Alternative query languages like EdgeQL and PRQL aim to improve upon SQL's limitations, but SQL remains a valuable and widely used tool in the industry.

### [The Secret Sauce behind 100K context window in LLMs: all tricks in one place](https://blog.gopenai.com/how-to-speed-up-llms-and-use-100k-context-window-all-tricks-in-one-place-ffd40577b4c)

- The post discusses techniques to speed up training and inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) to use a context window of up to 100K input tokens, which is significantly larger than previous models.
- The limitations of the original Transformer architecture when working with large context lengths are explained, including the quadratic time and space complexity of the attention layer computations.
- Several optimization techniques are presented, including ALiBi positional embedding, Sparse Attention, FlashAttention, Multi-Query attention, Conditional computation, and the use of 80GB A100 GPUs, which help increase the context length and improve the efficiency of LLMs.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36374936)

- Anthropics' 100k model employs clever techniques to extend the context window, but it has some imperfections.
- Placing instructions after the reference text in the input can help the model pay more attention to them.
- The inability to cache transformers makes large context windows costly, but the RWKV-LM project on GitHub offers a potential solution.
- Anthropics' Claude outperforms GPT4 in some instances and ranks between GPT4 and Bard overall.
- The position of the prompt in the input can affect the model's "attention" and recency bias.
- Transformers were designed to avoid positional issues, but some cases show that recency bias can still be present.
- LLMs can struggle to allocate the same level of attention to all parts of the input across the entire context window.
- Anthropics' Claude is considered underappreciated, but access to it is currently difficult.
- The computational requirements for large context sizes can be significant but may be worth it for specific applications like programming.
- Training LLMs with large context windows is resource-intensive, but compressing and optimizing the models can improve efficiency.
- Large context sizes are necessary for tasks like recalling facts and understanding long stories.
- There is a need for benchmarks that focus on tasks requiring large context sizes.
- Lossy compression can result in better quality compared to lossless compression when it comes to LLMs.
- Positional encoding methods like sinusoidal embeddings may not be suitable for large context sizes.
- Knowledge of AI in general is essential, but reproducing or modifying LLMs independently requires significant resources.
- There is ongoing research to improve the scalability of LLMs in terms of compute and memory requirements.
- The use of learned positional encodings allows for fine-tuning on larger context sizes.
- The article lacks detailed explanations and makes vague statements about scaling context in LLMs.
- There is interest in exploring different paradigms and techniques to address the computational complexity of large context sizes.
- The blog GoPenAI, where the article is hosted, is not affiliated with OpenAI despite the similarity in the domain name.
