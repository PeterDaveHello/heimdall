### [Nanoplastic Ingestion Causes Neurological Deficits](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/nanoplastic-ingestion-causes-neurological-deficits-71152)

- Nanoplastic particles less than 500 nanometers in size may be more harmful than larger microplastics as they induce a greater immune response in the gut and negatively affect neurological function in mice.
- Researchers observed reduced cognitive function and short-term memory in mice exposed to nanoplastics for two months at human-consumption doses and found that this was correlated with elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and activated microglia and astrocytes.
- Blocking IL-1β using a monoclonal antibody or chemical inhibitor or cessation of nanoplastic exposure mitigated cognitive effects, indicating that the harm from nanoplastic ingestion can be reversible.
