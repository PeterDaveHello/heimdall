### [June 7, 2023 [Reddit's plan to kill third-party apps sparks widespread protests](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddits-plan-to-kill-third-party-apps-sparks-widespread-protests/)- Reddit's plan to impose API fees on third-party apps has sparked protests and backlash from users, with hundreds of subreddits planning to go dark for 48 hours on June 12.

- Third-party apps face high API pricing that many developers say is far above what other sites charge, potentially forcing them to shut down.
- Reddit's official app is generally considered inferior to third-party options, and the API terms also require blocking ads in third-party apps and exclude adult content, which are major draws for the site.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36210805)- Reddit is accused of artificially boosting engagement on localized versions of subreddits, which critics say aligns with its strategy to steer users towards the official app and pump perceived value ahead of going public.

- Users suggest implementing a funding model similar to Discord and Twitch, allowing users to pay for upgrades to subreddits and using a portion of the money to fund moderation.
- The post discusses Reddit's mobile app and website, with users expressing dissatisfaction with the lack of priority given to fixing issues and criticism of the company's priorities.

- Concerns have been raised about the open core business model and potential misalignment of interests between companies and the community.
- Willow and Home Assistant are alternatives to GGML for local command detection and speech recognition, and benchmarking is needed to compare different options.

### [US SEC sues Coinbase, one day after suing Binance](https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-sec-sues-coinbase-over-failure-register-2023-06-06/)- The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, accusing it of operating as a middleman on crypto transactions and evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.

- The lawsuit follows a similar one against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, accusing them and their CEO of operating a "web of deception."
- If the SEC prevails in either of the cases, it could assert its jurisdiction over the crypto industry, which has largely operated outside regulation and transform the market.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36212120)- The SEC has filed a lawsuit against Coinbase for trading unregistered securities and not meeting legal standards.

- The issue revolves around whether specific cryptocurrencies meet the definition of securities or financial instruments.
- The SEC provides no guidance on what is or isn't a security, leaving companies without a clear path to legal compliance.

### [Preparing for the Incoming Computer Shopper Tsunami](http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/5543)- Computer history expert Jason Scott has acquired nearly 200 issues of Computer Shopper, a popular magazine from the 1980s and 1990s that served as a 'bible' of hardware and software.

- Scott is scanning the issues, which will result in at least 100,000 pages being scanned, and sending them to Gaming Alexandria for post-processing to create more readable versions.
- Researchers aim to analyze computing history and find interesting information and trends from the preserved magazines, encouraging readers to help spread the word about donations of missing issues.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36206526)- The Internet Archive's Computer Shopper collection is praised for preserving the legacy of the popular technology magazine.

- Commenters reminisce about the old days of paging through the magazine to pick out computer parts and find local bulletin board systems.

### [OpenGL 3.1 on Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org/2023/06/opengl-3-1-on-asahi-linux/)- Asahi Linux has upgraded its graphics drivers from OpenGL 2.1 to OpenGL 3.1, and increased OpenGL ES 2.0 support to OpenGL ES 3.0. This means better quality rendering and more functioning applications.

- However, the drivers are experimental and not yet conformant to the OpenGL or OpenGL ES specifications, so users may encounter bugs.
- Highlights of the upgrades include multiple render targets, multisampling, transform feedback, and texture buffer objects. Specifically, multisampling is an efficient way to reduce aliasing caused by jagged diagonal edges due to rendering at insufficient resolution. It creates multiple samples for each pixel and averages them to create a regular image. However, Apple's AGX GPU requires a unique approach to sample shading, and blending can regress performance when blending and multisampling are enabled but sample shading is not.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36212674)- Asahi Linux has released an update with various features, including base support for M2 Pro/Max/Ultra SoCs and a new firmware-based battery charge control method.

- Users of Apple hardware are grateful for the freedom to run Linux on it, but some debate the sustainability of Asahi and whether it's worth buying a Mac just to run it.
- Asahi Linux has made significant progress, but there are still limitations and incompatibilities with GPU drivers that can impact performance.
