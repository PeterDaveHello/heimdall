### [Maps distort how we see the world](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/maps-distort-how-we-see-the-world)- Maps distort our perception of the world because they are 2D projections of a 3D sphere, causing distortion in size and shape.

- Africa is actually much bigger than it appears on maps, while countries near the equator appear smaller than they are.
- Different map projections and centers of reference can show different perspectives and reveal surprising relationships between regions.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36421315)- Different map projections distort the size and shape of countries in different ways, and the popular Mercator projection significantly distorts the sizes of landmasses.

- Other map projections, such as the Gall-Peters projection and the Robinson projection, offer more accurate representations of the sizes of different countries.
- The choice of map projection is based on the specific purpose of the map, and exploring different projections challenges our preconceived notions and encourages critical thinking.
