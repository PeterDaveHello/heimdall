- The accuracy and visual representation of observablehq.com's chart of bank failures are questioned, with concerns over the exclusion of non-FDIC bank failures
- FTX has recovered over $1bn worth of assets, primarily made up of cryptocurrencies, using blockchain technology, but concerns remain over the reported valuation of $7.3bn
- The discussion among commenters focuses on the frequency of bank failures in the US and the size and business models of banks, with some advocating for smaller, local banks and others for larger, diversified portfolios
- The article notes the impressive data visualization work of Mike Bostock but highlights shortcomings in the use of circles as a representation of data
- Some commenters provide data and insights into the subject, and the conversation touches on various subjects such as financial transparency and fraudulent activities in the banking and cryptocurrency industries.

### [Replit's new Code LLM: Open Source, 77% smaller than Codex, trained in 1 week](https://www.latent.space/p/reza-shabani#details)

- Replit has open-sourced their new code LLM, which is more efficient than OpenAI's Codex and trained in just one week.
- Replit's Head of AI, Reza Shabani, talks about their data platform, Ghostwriter, and the team's plans for the future, including new hires and scaling laws.
- The conversation centers around Ghostwriter, an AI-based code completion tool, and its unique abilities beyond completing code, as well as the social impact of automation and the importance of allowing AI to help people instead of replacing them.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35803435)

- The Replit-Code model is similar to OpenAI's Codex and GitHub's Copilot, but is open-source and can be trained on a user's specific codebase, making it a more popular approach to improving AI models for specific tasks.
- OpenAI's Copilot generates incomplete or unrelated code sometimes, but the ability to fine-tune it to specific libraries for open-source support has been suggested.

### [I want to talk about WebGPU](https://cohost.org/mcc/post/1406157-i-want-to-talk-about-webgpu)

- WebGPU is a new low-level graphics API that has been released for creating 2D and 3D graphics in web browsers and other software.
- It has the potential to replace Vulkan and OpenGL as the standard for drawing in any type of software or programming language.
- While it has some limitations and complexities in initialization and pipeline construction, WebGPU offers promise for easier cross-platform GPU programming.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35800988)

- WebGPU also has potential use cases in physics simulations and scientific workloads, and supports declarative programming models.
- Web developers discuss the potential benefits of using WebGPU, such as better access to graphics processing units, but also raise concerns about its potential for malicious activities.

### [Passkeys: The beginning of the end of the password](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/the-beginning-of-the-end-of-the-password/)

- Google has started rolling out passkeys, a new way to sign in to apps and websites that is both easier to use and more secure than passwords.
- Passkeys let users sign in the same way they unlock their devices, with options including fingerprints, face scans, or screen lock PINs.
- Unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35801392)

- Passkeys use biometrics to unlock the phone and are stored on users' devices, synced across all devices signed into the same Google account.
- While there are open-source and third-party options for using passkeys, storing private keys on cloud-based services raises privacy concerns, and losing access to all devices could result in loss of access to data.

### [OpenLLaMA: An Open Reproduction of LLaMA](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama)

- OpenLLaMA is a new open-source language model released by Berkeley AI Research that reproduces Meta AI's LLaMA language model.
- The public preview of the 7B OpenLLaMA model has been trained on 200 billion tokens and is now available with PyTorch and Jax weights on Huggingface Hub.
- OpenLLaMA has been evaluated on a range of tasks and exhibits comparable performance to the original LLaMA and GPT-J models.

#### [Industry Reactions](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35798888)
