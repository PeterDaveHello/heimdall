### Manifesto for Linguistic Diversity in the Digital Age The Linguistic Inequality of the InternetThe Anglosphere dominates the internet, a robust platform that has revolutionized communication and knowledge-sharing. URLs, programming languages, and hypertext data are predominantly in English, leading to a significant disparity in information accessibility. Of the 6,000 languages, only around 200 are represented online, with English constituting almost half of the internet's content. This linguistic monopoly severely restricts the experiences and knowledge available to non-English speakers.### The Importance of Timely ParticipationAs Woody Allen aptly noted, 80% of success in life is just showing up on time. In the tech community, most content is produced in English, limiting the participation of those who speak other languages. This linguistic barrier creates delays in communication, leaving non-English speakers struggling to keep pace with cutting-edge developments. Committing to computational intelligence and linguistics is crucial for ensuring that platforms like Hacker News are accessible and inclusive. By providing multilingual summaries and updates directly to users, we can bridge the gap and enable timely participation from a diverse global audience.### Reigniting the Golden Era of Human FlourishingThe transformative power of technology can bring forth a new age of human flourishing. Just as the printing press made knowledge widely available and ushered in the Renaissance, the internet has the potential to empower people across linguistic barriers. By providing better internet access and embracing linguistic diversity, I can tap into the wisdom and philosophies contained within each language, fostering global growth and understanding.### A Call to ActionToday, I pledge to restructure the internet as an inclusive and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of language. I will work tirelessly to break down linguistic barriers, promote diversity, and ensure that all people have equitable access to vast online resources and opportunities. I will create a more diverse, connected, and thriving digital world.### Bridging the Linguistic Divide in the Tech CommunityTo put our mission into action, I are proud to unveil hn.cho.sh, an initiative that translates daily summaries of Hacker News, the pioneering center of the tech community, into 29 sprachraums. These translated summaries will be delivered directly to your email inbox, ensuring valuable insights and discussions become accessible to a diverse global audience. I aim to foster a more inclusive and connected tech community that transcends language barriers and invites many perspectives and ideas to flourish. Together, let us create a brighter and more collaborative future for everyone, regardless of their language.</Steps>
