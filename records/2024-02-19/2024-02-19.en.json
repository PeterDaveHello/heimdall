    "commentBody": "Lapce (lapce.dev)487 points by tosh 16 hours agohidepastfavorite205 comments dzhou121 12 hours agoLapce dev here. Firstly sorry for the bad experience for some people. Just a bit of context here to explain the status of the project. The first line of code was started around 2018 as a personal project. And as of today, we still don't have anyone who works on it full time. We don't want to defend ourselves too much here, because there are very good quality code editors out there such as Helix, which is also community developed. But still, GUI is just such a beast of complexity, which consumes lots of time and energy which we already lack. That said, we had developed our own cross platform GUI toolkit called Floem, because as you may know there aren't any good ones that exist. The journey was fun and challenging, but the aim of the project isn't a toy, and we believe by taking slow but firm steps, we'll reach production quality, one day. Before that, please do bear with us, and help us if you can (as in code). reply roarcher 12 hours agoparentDon't apologize! It's not like you've taken anyone's money. HN can be a tough audience, but I don't see any (serious) comments that are putting down what you've done--just pointing out issues they personally experienced. I posted one myself. Informal bug reports. Honestly this is about what I'd expect from pre-alpha software, though I do agree with other commenters that that label should be more prominent on the website to manage expectations. Taking on something like VS Code as a competitor is ambitious, as is building a native UI library from scratch. Personally I applaud your effort and I hope this project succeeds. reply nicoburns 12 hours agoparentprevJust wanted to stick a link the Floem GUI toolkit mentioned above: https://github.com/lapce/floem because IMO it's as interesting as Lapce in it's own right. reply juliangmp 1 hour agoparentprevThere's no need to apologize, after all you're making this for free. reply jmrm 11 hours agoparentprevThanks your contribution! I just downloaded it, installed the Rust add-on, and it automatically used rust-analyzer showing all the information of types and structs. It maybe needs some polishing, but looks like it works like it should, and it does it really fast. I'll test it better tomorrow, the running and debugging interface seems really simple and interesting tbh On the side of the GUI, what made you make Floem instead of using egui or other similar library? As far as I looked, looks like a non-native reactive GUI using some 2D graphics library like the other ones. Does the granularity in that reactivity have a big importance in that? Apart from that, if Floem is easier to use than other graphical libraries for complex designs, or if you make a GUI designer like you have in Visual Studio, Qt, and similar, it can help a lot of people developing apps in Rust reply LorenDB 13 hours agoprevIt's refreshing to see a new IDE that isn't using Electron. Yes, I know Zed is native as well, but it only is macOS compatible, and I use Linux. I am using Qt Creator, and it is absolutely amazing for C++/CMake based development, but I will have to give Lapce a try and see how it stacks up. reply BoppreH 14 hours agoprevI'm shopping for an IDE with Vim keybindings, but this doesn't seem to be it yet. Points for having Vim-like support out of the box, but most of what I tried failed, including: - Exiting insertion mode with ctrl+c or ctrl+[ - Shift+U to undo all changes done to the current line - `di[` to delete the contents inside the current [ - `dta` to delete everything until the next `a` - Shift+[ and shift+] to jump paragraphs - Shift+D to remove everything until the end of the line - `.` to repeat the last action It's a good start, and I'll definitely check it again in the future, but I'd hold on advertising \"Vim-like\" editing until the support gets better. The rest of the editor is awesome, no complaints so far. reply bradly 13 hours agoparent> Shift+U to undo all changes done to the current line Been using Vim for over 15 years and didn't know this one. reply pandemic_region 11 hours agorootparentI know right! reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agoparentprev> I'm shopping for an IDE with Vim keybindings Me too. Both extension for VS Code have too many quirks for me, and I left the Jetbrains world and intend not to go back (due to too many disappointing support issues). reply jasonjmcghee 14 hours agoprevI try this editor every few months to see how it's progressing and is still way too early to use as a daily driver. People suggest this over Zed very frequently. In my experience Zed is way more mature and stable. That being said, it's no one near as usable as neovim with a good plugin setup, let alone a mature ide like Jetbrains products. Jetbrains IDEs might be slow, but I'll get a hell of a lot more done in 8 hours with it. Once you learn to use the features well, it's incredibly powerful. I love vim, but generally use jetbrains. If Jetbrains took 500ms to load a file vs 1ms to load, my productivity isn't going to change dramatically. It's fast enough. Yes initial indexing is slow, but it's easily worth it. All this being said, I think Lapce is very informative as a resource to anyone trying to build an editor in rust. reply manithree 14 hours agoparentI've tried Lapce several times over the past year or 2, and have never gotten more than 5 minutes in without it hanging or crashing. I wish I was a rust programmer, but Lapce is not a good poster-child for the language, IMO. It's not the speed, or even the phoning home that make me rage-quit VSCode on the regular. It's the RAM. EVERYTHING slows down if you only have 24GB and try to use VSCode. reply 29ebJCyy 15 hours agoprevAs someone who uses Neovim, I would love to have a near-vim experience in something that has all of the convenience of VSC + a great plugin ecosystem. However, I'm not sure about the fact that in `normal` mode `:` just brings up the `cmd+shift+p` command dialog. Maybe I could get used to it, but the fact that something as simple as my muscle memory for \"I'm in `normal` mode, better type `:w` just to make sure I've saved\" automatically bringing up that dialog and then suggesting I `Close current window` immediately... is not helpful. If the command experience is going to be so different from vim them it's not really going to ever be a suitable replacement even for brief stints/pairing IMO. It's a shame because the VS Code vim plugin leaves a lot to be desired. reply lsllc 13 hours agoparentNeovim with Lazyvim is pretty good out of the box. In the old days, both Emacs and (Neo)vim although highly extensible, well, it was hard to configure and set up for the things you wanted to do. Now, we have Spacemacs, Doom Emacs and Neovim with Lazy, Packer etc., so I really can have a 1st class \"IDE\" without needing to learn LISP or Vimscript (or Lua). So you do need a little bit of that to be able to edit the package.el or init.lua, but it's pretty much uncomment or cut & paste. If you're looking for a (Neo)vi(m) tutorial, try this: https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/boost-your-coding-fu-wi... reply 29ebJCyy 8 hours agorootparentJust to be clear I love neovim (though I don't really like Lazy particularly, maybe I should give it another shot). Mostly I'm looking for something that is close enough to vim for me but also close enough to VSCode for the people I pair with. reply e12e 14 hours agoparentprevNot vim (by design) - but have you tried helix? https://helix-editor.com reply infogulch 8 hours agorootparentI've used vim at a moderate proficiency level for 10+ years, but Helix's selection -> action motion design is just better, for a lot of reasons. Helix has been looking for a GUI solution for a while now. ( https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/39 ) I wonder if Lapce's UI toolkit would be a good fit. reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agorootparentprevHelix is a dream, as far as I can say from having played a lot with it, but only played. To be fully comparable to some IDE or Neovim setup like LazyVim, you need to complement it with other tools and use some workarounds, e.g. working the files (tree) or custom snippets. (I'm still using VS Code to get my stuff done, but in a couple of weeks I got some time to spent to re-evaluate Helix and Neovim.) reply ribelo 14 hours agorootparentprevHelix is a very good and well-managed project, but it's quite hostile towards its own community. There are no plugins, and they won't be in Wasm like users want, but in Scheme dialect named Steel, that nobody want... if at all. Missing features like copilot or file browser expected by the community are essentially never merged into the master. This might be a better path than total dispersion and destruction of what works, but my expectations do not align with what the creators offer, so I give them the freedom to choose. I keep my fingers crossed for its development, but I personally use something else. reply e12e 12 hours agorootparentAs a user, I certainly do not find it hostile. In a \"batteries included\" edit a service like copilot that expose all data to a third party is a terrible anti-feature. As for script-oriented plugins vs wasm - I see a tradeoff - and don't think neither are right or wrong. Cross editor plugins via a common wasm api might be fun, but perhaps not very practical. Edit: link to relevant issues and discussion: https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/discussions/3806#discu... https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/122 https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/1927 reply ribelo 12 hours agorootparentCopilot has many fans, and for many, the ability to use Copilot is more important than all the other \"batteries-included\" features. It's not for me or anyone else to judge. Everyone should make their own choices. Regarding plugins, I'm with Helix from the beginning, i have read everything, and I understand the motivation well and can accept it. Perhaps this is what the ideal editor looks like for creators, but it definitely doesn't look like the ideal editor for me. I respect their decision, but I'm sticking with Neovim and might switch to ZED when Linux support becomes available. reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agorootparentWhy do you consider switching to ZED from Neovim? ZED is lightyears away from a good Neovim setup in terms of functionality and efficiency. The problem with Neovim is the setup and config to do all, but you already mastered it. reply e12e 9 hours agorootparentprevI still don't understand why you claimed that: > [Helix]'s quite hostile towards its own community. reply jupblb 14 hours agorootparentprev\"good and well-managed\" vs \"[merges everything] users want\" - pick one reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agorootparentGenerally agreed, but in the editor space that's where plugins come into play. The plugin story for Helix is a long one, but I think it's converging and bet it's coming within this year. reply ribelo 12 hours agorootparentprevI pick to stay with neovim. reply 29ebJCyy 8 hours agorootparentprevNo but this seems neat! I'll check it out, thanks! reply twp 15 hours agoparentprevUse https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim instead. reply tuan 14 hours agorootparentSince v1.0+ of this extension I have been constantly having issues with neovim's and VSCode's buffers got out of sync. I cannot reliably reproduce the issues however. There are a few similar reports, e.g. https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim/issues/1624. I've switched to other VIM extension (VSCodeVim) which I found more reliable, albeit less powerful. reply koonsolo 12 hours agorootparentThat's funny, because I switched from VSCodeVim to NeoVim for a similar reason. I guess both have issues. But still, the power of VSCode with vim keybindings is still my best setup. reply qudat 14 hours agoparentprevWhat are you missing from neovim? There are plenty of out of the box configs that do most of the work for the user in terms of configuration that begs the question: why demand vim in other code editors? https://neovimcraft.com/c reply 29ebJCyy 8 hours agorootparentWhen I'm developing alone I mostly don't miss anything when in Neovim. However, even with mouse features enabled vim is not a great experience when I'm pairing with someone who is only used to using VSCode (which is a lot of people I work with). Ideally I'd like to have an editor which is very close to vim in the ability to use basic navigation, editing, commands (for instance, macro support would be nice but I can probably live without it) when pairing. reply qudat 7 hours agorootparentI guess that makes sense, I'm rarely in a situation where I need someone to work on my computer. reply retrochameleon 14 hours agoparentprevAgreed. : should be standard Vim commands. Command pallete should be a separate keybind. reply alluro2 15 hours agoprevDoes anyone have insight into how Lapce and Zed compare to each other? I.e. what are the differences in project goals, current capabilities and roadmap? Thanks! reply jsheard 15 hours agoparentLapce being cross-platform is a major difference for now, Zed plans to be eventually but it's currently only on Mac. reply nicoburns 12 hours agoparentprevNow that Zed is open source they're actually quite similar in capability (even sharing a number of underling libraries). The biggest difference is probably that Zed is backed by a commercial company (and I believe they have plans to sell collaborative functionality on top of the core editor) whereas Lapce is more of a community open source project. Lapce is also cross-platform whereas Zed is currently macOS only. But they seem to be making rapid progress on linux support so this may not be relevant soon. reply cal85 12 hours agoparentprevThis is my question too. I think I’m going to have to try both. AFAICT so far, Lapce is ‘just’ someone’s open source project that has got popular, while Zed is made by a funded-looking startup with several employees that announced they were switching to open source just a couple of weeks ago. Zed also has Copilot built in. Both look like great editors at a glance. Zed has more easily findable information about their goals - there’s a blog and a roadmap on their site. (I guess with Lapce it might be possible to get a sense of goals/vision by sifting through GitHub issues and comments, which I haven’t done yet.) reply ksynwa 15 hours agoparentprevOne thing I know of is that zed'a scope is a bit wider and includes some collaborative tools and enhancements. Don't know the exact details though. reply cultofmetatron 15 hours agoparentprevit seemes closer ti what I actually need than zed. love zed's speed but remote development is mandatory in thus day and age reply SpaghettiCthulu 12 hours agorootparentWhat makes you say that remote development is mandatory? I think it has less to do with \"this day and age\" and more to do with your current employment. reply cultofmetatron 36 minutes agorootparentFor me and a lot of people it is. But not because of employment. one big use of remote is to remote into docker containers. why docker containers? I can have a different set of dependencies for each project and yet have my different systems communicate with each other over a network. but for me, the big issue is I run phoenix framework and the older version I'm running my project on can't run the tests on the arm version of docker os I had to create a x86 machine on hetzner. reply sph 14 hours agoprevMaking a fast editor is such a common hobby, everybody seems to be working on one these days apparently, yet memory safety and speed has never been a real problem in editors. It would be much more impressive to explore a novel approach for editors more extensible than Emacs, or with a more innovative editing model than vim's. If we are reinventing the wheel, why not at least try to make a better wheel that's never been done before? reply stracer 14 hours agoparentEditors don't get made in Rust because people want better memory safety in an editor. They're made in Rust because people like Rust, and the Rust trademark makes anything associated more cool, no other language has reached such a godlike marketing status. reply oconnor663 14 hours agorootparentCounterpoint: The only really pleasant + mainstream + cross-platform languages for new client/desktop software today are Go and Rust. Depending on the Python interpreter or the JRE or whatever is a huge pain when you don't control the environment. Just spitting out a native binary really helps. (I say this as someone who doesn't personally find Go pleasant, but I understand that lots of other people do, and I respect the tradeoffs it made.) reply sph 10 hours agorootparentprevIt's called a hype cycle. A decade ago it was editors written in Go. reply eviks 2 hours agoparentprevYet there are common complaints about how slow emacs is, same for VSCode performance. And a better wheel is much harder (but there is a feature request for helix mode, that's more innovative than vim, maybe they'll add that) reply flexagoon 12 hours agoparentprev> with a more innovative editing model than vim's I think Helix tries to do that reply nequo 9 hours agorootparentKakoune too. But if a project focuses on a novel editing model and not some other aspect of an editor, then implementing it inside Emacs might be the best approach. If implemented inside Emacs, then it composes with the rest of its package ecosystem. Kakoune, Helix, etc. are somewhat set back by having to reproduce functionality equivalent to Magit, Org, LSP mode, and so on in order to be on equal footing for many users. Evil, Meow, and God mode seem to show that Emacs is a good platform for such experimentation. reply not_your_vase 16 hours agoprevWas just trying it out earlier this week. Or at least wanted to, after hearing all the good opinins about it over the net. Unfortunately using xmonad it simply refuses to display in certain positions. When I found a position where the interface was displayed, there was still no tooltip on the icons, which makes recognizing their function non-trivial. Anyway, after I spent 8 minutes trying to find a place to set custom include folder unsuccessfully for my project, I gave up, and went back to QT creator. Will try again next year. reply whats_a_quasar 15 hours agoprevJust installed this on windows 10. First time I tried to open it the window hung for 3 minutes until I killed it. The second time, I couldn't reposition the window by clicking and dragging. Third time I loaded it, it hung again. It's an exciting product pitch but isn't working for me. I see now that there's a \"pre-alpha stage\" disclaimer on the download page and wish that were in larger font. reply PreInternet01 14 hours agoparentNot sure if you tried the installer or the portable version, but for me, running the latter required me to put it in a location where it had permissions to create the 'lapce-data' sub-folder. (And no, there was no sensible error message when that inevitably failed). Having said that, there doesn't seem to be very much \"there\" there, right now. I managed to open a C# project using the 'csharp-ls' language server, but, other than suggesting some refactorings that I couldn't successfully apply, there wasn't much that indicated that this actually worked. Debugging certainly didn't. It did load very fast, though, so that might make it worth checking out again in, oh, a year or so... reply posix86 14 hours agoparentprevExperience on Ubuntu: It opens, but double clicking the header doesn't make it expand. Then `Open Directory` doesn't do anything; no typing, no nothing. So close again, and open from command line with the directory as agument, works. Now I can't see my mouse. reply HPsquared 15 hours agoparentprevI guess it had a lapse. reply roarcher 13 hours agoparentprevMy experience on Windows 11 wasn't as bad as yours, but I opened a small Rust project with Lapce (~20 files) and it uses 1400MB of RAM vs VS Code's 900MB, and has very noticeable latency when navigating the code and typing. But like you said, it's pre-alpha, and I hope this project succeeds. I'm sure these issues are solvable. It's exciting to see Rust-based non-web UI libraries finally starting to become usable for reasonably complex apps. reply panekj 9 hours agorootparentLapce cannot use that much of memory, it's most likely that Rust Analyzer has allocated majority of it. reply roarcher 8 hours agorootparentMy VS Code instance is also using Rust Analyzer. Edit: I just disabled RA in both editors and restarted them. VSCode is now at 320MB and Lapce is at 770MB. Edit 2: To be clear, my above comments are meant in the spirit of an informal bug report/feedback. I get that Lapce is a labor of love for its core developers, and I'm not shitting on it. In fact I think it's pretty impressive. I'm keeping an eye on it as something to potentially switch to once it matures a bit. reply nickstinemates 13 hours agoparentprevPortable version loaded instantly for me on Windows 10. Remote SSH functionality doesn't work at all unfortunately[1]. Would be nice to try out but I don't do any local dev. 1: https://github.com/lapce/lapce/issues/2985 reply panekj 9 hours agorootparentCorrection: Remote SSH works fine, we haven't reimplemented the remote file picker in new GUI toolkit but that can be workarounded by using `lapce` CLI and built-in terminal. reply nickstinemates 7 hours agorootparentCool - that works. reply jjallen 15 hours agoparentprevHow is a project with 30,000 GH stars a pre-alpha stage project? reply panekj 9 hours agorootparentBe a team of 3-4 people working in their spare time to maintain cross-platform native GUI FOSS project that people seem to like reply qudat 14 hours agorootparentprevIt boggles the mind. Good for the team building this, lots of respect entering this crowded and race to the bottom pricing product. But I don’t get how this differs from vs code or why someone would be excited about it. I get the feeling people like trying new editors so they throw stars around for every ide project they come across. None of the features advertised beat neovim nor does it have the crazy plugin ecosystem. reply panekj 9 hours agorootparentPeople like their editor to be fast, work on more platforms, be open source, not being tied to Microsoft, etc. Plenty of reasons why someone would choose Lapce over VS Code. reply paradox460 13 hours agorootparentprevYou can buy stars reply FpUser 14 hours agorootparentprevProbably because it says in Rust.

I type the folder path into the Open Folder thing at the top and it just silently fails. There's no menu or anything to open a folder either.

A native, GUI, fast code editor is a welcome change from what VSC does to my laptop’s battery. Unfortunately, I have to step away from it while I figure out a potential data corruption issue. While editing a complex config file in lapce yesterday, I reopened it later to find all KINDS of errors—dozens of deleted, moved, and changed lines. I haven’t pinned it on lapce and it may well end up being something else, but it’s the primary suspect at the moment unfortunately. But to be crystal clear: if the problem is with lapce, that’s on me for using early stage software with a real document. It’s a great project and I don’t blame the software at all for my choice!

On the other hand, I've been using KDE for over ten years and never had another application crash the entire thing. reply quibono 15 hours agoprevI have my CapsLock key remapped to Escape with `setxbkmap` and yet it's not recognized in the modal editing mode (I have to actually press Escape) - anyone else experiencing that? reply szundi 15 hours agoprevHow easy it is to underestimate the effort needed to compete with the status quo. There would be no sane individuals to try to siege it if this was evident for everyone though! reply jollyoldpirate 12 hours agoprevI remember the old days of using tinyIRC which boasted that it was hand-written in assembly. And indeed, it was great to use. But there’s nothing really notable about any of this today when so many editors are flexing speed. Two weeks can’t go by without a new editor coming out. I’m still on VS Code after ST shit the bed. reply tempodox 12 hours agoprevI could use a decent Rust IDE. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the VSCode plugin for Rust seems to be the best there is at the moment, way better than the JetBrains plugin. This cannot be the last word on that. reply hollerith 14 hours agoprevI'd give this a try if I could find some way to configure it to wrap long lines. By \"wrap long lines\", I mean that I will never see a horizontal scroll bar even if there is a very long line of text in the buffer. reply dflock 13 hours agoparentThe nightly builds got word wrap a few weeks ago, not been released yet afaik, but will be in the next one. reply hollerith 13 hours agorootparentThank you for letting me know! I will definitely be giving it a try! Can it wrap at column 80 or does it only wrap at the right border of the window? reply sushidev 14 hours agoprevPlease improve the UI before adding all the features of VSCODE but better :-) On a positive note, just to be sure I tried to run Eclipse - its UI is much worse. HN: please suggest open source code editor with great UI for MacOS. reply mark_l_watson 12 hours agoprevLooks like it doesn’t support Lisp languages? I like the idea of natively compiled editors - fast! For two days, I have been using the Lem editor written in Common Lisp, super fast and responsive. reply lchen_hn 13 hours agoprevWhat’s the benefit for a neovim user? Meaning I already got LSP, treesitter, it works in a terminal. I cannot think of a reason to even try this. reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agoparentMy point of view as well. Once you learned how to configure Neovim with all the features you need, there's no better IDE out there (except IntelliJ for Java), because none is as customized to your personal needs and preferences. The challenge is the getting there, but why should one leave it? reply zozbot234 12 hours agoparentprevWith neovim you're still dependent on plugins written in some scripting language, and their overhead can add up. Lapce plugins are compiled to WASM/WASI, so they should run a bit smoother. reply eikenberry 12 hours agorootparentLua is not some random scripting language, it is designed for embedding and is very fast with minimal overhead. I'm not saying that using WAS* is bad but bashing Neovim when it uses the one of the best proven technologies for extension is just silly. reply k_bx 12 hours agoprevGiven that the plugins are written in Rust, how does it dynamically load/use them? Is there a good description? reply lilyball 12 hours agoparentThe plugins use WebAssembly. reply smhaziq 13 hours agoprevIt consume 2GB of memory to load a typescript codebase. VSC just need 600MB of memory to load the same codebase. reply warthog 13 hours agoprevThe reason I am sticking with cursor.so is the AI. It is convenient to be able to a) let AI read whole files b) feed in direct documentation of a certain package to have proper context. Might not be worth to expert coders out here but definitely saves a lot of time for me debugging or onboarding into a new framework Wish Lapce had that. Also Zed does not have the quite depth for AI compared to Cursor reply flexagoon 11 hours agoparentWhy not just use basically any editor with codeium.com? reply SubiculumCode 12 hours agoparentprevdoes cursor.so allow use of local llms? reply avocadoburger 15 hours agoprevhaha linkin park logo reply thunkle 14 hours agoparentNo... It's 30 degrees different. reply debrisapron 14 hours agoprevI am constantly confused by text editors pitching themselves on speed. Is the world really full of developers going crazy with frustration because they’re waiting on vs code to do something? I opened a 100,000 line text file a few days ago & it rendered in like half a second, considering I do this about once a year it’s really more than good enough. reply SCdF 13 hours agoparentI would invert that: when was the last time you tried using a text editor that boasts speed instead of VSCode? I am forced to use VSCode for extension-based reasons, but have Sublime Text installed as well that I can very occasionally use. The difference each time is staggering, like a slap in the face. Scrolling smoothness, input latency, snappyiness to jump between files, or search workspaces. Each time it's so obvious. It's just so much more pleasant. Like going from being hunched over a tiny laptop screen to sitting in front of an all encompassing ultrawide, or going from an old laptop to a new desktop. It doesn't mean that VSCode is an unusable pile of garbage, just as a tiny laptop screen isn't unusable. But the difference, at least to me, is undeniable. reply amelius 13 hours agorootparentI'm often coding on a server with like 10ms round trip latency, so I'm not bothered by the small latency that my editor introduces. I'm using Vim, by the way. reply samtheprogram 13 hours agorootparentSame, and despite this, Vim over SSH feels better than regular VSCode (assuming a decent internet connection). reply rpacut 12 hours agorootparentEver tried the Remote-SSH plugin from Microsoft? With it I had the exact opposite experience, I'd regularly forget I was working on a remote dev machine! reply yjftsjthsd-h 11 hours agorootparentprevI was under the impression that the smallest time humans can perceive is like ~30ms, in which case 10 is effectively instantaneous reply nox101 13 hours agorootparentprevmy machine must be faster than yours. I have both. I can't tell the difference reply lrhegeba 13 hours agorootparenti guess which and the number of extensions will have a significant effect on lag reply moritzwarhier 12 hours agorootparentIn this case it's important to note though that this is a necessary side-effect of offering a powerful extension API. If you – for example – install some badly coded extension that blocks the main thread to parse the open file into an uncached AST on every keystroke before rendering the input, that's the extensions fault. Take my example with an ounce of saltt as I've never coded a VSCode extension. It is very well possible that the extension API prevents this particular example. I guess normally things like parsing source files have to follow guardrails that prevent this kind of bug, or at least discourage coding this way. And ASTs are exposed by VSCode's core for the natively supported languages. Still, it's probably safe to assume that there is a lot of badly written code out there that does not pay attention to performance, or follows an \"optimize-later\" mindset. Features surely often seem tempting to implement in a slow and unoptimized way, and anyone can contribute to VSCode extensions. reply yjftsjthsd-h 11 hours agorootparentprevTo be fair, that's always true; I've managed to make even vim stutter with the right extensions/configuration. reply robin_reala 13 hours agorootparentprevAlso, size of files. Less of an issue for typical codebases, but VS Code historically has slowed to a standstill on anything remotely large. reply nox101 12 hours agorootparentI regularly work on a code base with 250k files. Haven't noticed any slowdown reply sebastiennight 12 hours agorootparentI think the comment you're replying to was blaming slowdowns on the size (in lines of code) of individual files, rather than the total size (in number of files) of the codebase. reply Bjartr 13 hours agorootparentprevAlso, some people are just more sensitive to it than others. reply dan-allen 12 hours agorootparentprevI have exactly the same workflow: VSCode when I want a specific extension and Sublime as a fallback. I think a lot of people don’t notice the difference but I can’t un-notice it. Huge generated files and whatnot, VSCode just spins but Sublime opens them instantly. Not to knock VSCode: it’s amazing what they’ve done especially comparing it to other web-stack apps (like what is Slack doing that it’s slower than VSCode with 6 extensions running?!). Even when things are running smoothly, the just-perceptible delay in switching files or a slight stutter scrolling feels like the digital equivalent of working with a cheap tool. The cheap ratchet is a little sloppy and occasionally the pawl doesn’t catch but it still does all the same stuff. Yet Snap-On still has customers. reply serial_dev 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm in almost the same boat. Speed absolutely matters, but you only notice it when you don't have it. I'm working on a large Dart project and a long time ago someone thought that having the project split up into 100 packages would be a great idea (it's not). My previous editor was IntelliJ as I am used to its keyboard shortcuts, but it struggled with our setup: constant freezes and even if it didn't freeze, it would take seconds until the suggestions came up (or when I wanted to rename a local variable, smh). I was so frustrated by it, that I installed helix, it was fast so I'm now learning to use it as my daily driver. I have now both open, doing my editing on helix, and if I feel like I can go something faster in IntelliJ (which now happens less and less often), I do that little thing in IntelliJ and come back to helix. Why helix: it's \"great by default\" and I didn't have much success with setting up and customizing NeoVim (it didn't feel good, the plugin were annoying to learn, and it started to slow down). I'm sure it a skill issue, but helix just works for me, and I can live without plugins for now. reply Swizec 13 hours agorootparentprevVSCode is blazing fast on my 5 year old personal laptop. VSCode is frustratingly slow on my M2 work laptop full of corporate nannyware. It’s not VSCode’s fault ;) JS-based apps happen to interact terribly with nannyware for some reason. I see it every time I run one of our node services, everything just grinds to a halt while the antivirus freaks out about how dare I run a piece of uncompiled code. Slack and friends have the same problem. Discord actually runs better in a browser than as a standalone app. reply whizzter 12 hours agorootparentThis probably needs far more attention than it's given. A half-wild guess here is that because viruses uses various ways to hide themselves the anti-virus software probably scans W^X codepages on changes, so anything JIT compiled (all modern JS engines) will trigger a lot of spurious scans (kinda like how compiling and writing .exe files can grind turnaround times to a halt). reply buzzerbetrayed 12 hours agorootparentprev> JS-based apps happen to interact terribly with nannyware for some reason I mean, yeah.. because they're slow and resource intensive. Your comment directly contradicts itself: It IS VSCodes fault. And BTW, it doesn't have anything to do with \"nannyware\". They slow down on any computer that is under the tiniest load. reply mafuyu 14 hours agoparentprevIt’s the small latencies that add up for me. I usually use a tmux + nvim setup, but for codebases that require a bit more language server support (eg. C++20 and sometimes Rust), I have a VS Code setup with the nvim plugin that I’ve spent way too many hours tweaking hot keys and things. Despite all my tweaking, VSCode sometimes just feels like it’s a beat behind, and keyboard commands get dropped in the transition between panes and such. Even just scrolling with nvim keybinds feels a bit off. My key repeat rate is fairly high, and I’ll hold down ^D to skim through a source file. VSCode’s renderer struggles to keep up smoothly sometimes. This is all nitpicky stuff, not enough for me to swear off VSCode or anything. But it’s just annoying enough that every once in a while I end up in some rabbit hole of VSCode internals and css tweaks, instead of doing actual work. Most coding does not require a ton of bouncing around, but it does feel very liberating to have confidence in my inputs as I navigate around. reply dleink 13 hours agorootparentWow, that's a great way to phrase it. I'm currently setting up a basic laptop with speed like you're describing as a goal. \"Confidence in my inputs\" is an underrated value in HCI. Of course websites have to implore users to not click on this again while it loads, they don't have confidence in their inputs! reply saurik 12 hours agorootparentSomething actively dropping inputs is an entirely different category of problem than it merely being slow to process them. reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agorootparentprev> but for codebases that require a bit more language server support (eg. C++20 and sometimes Rust) Unfortunately, for this use-case, neither Zed or Laplace will likely to fill the gap, as they rely only on LSP as Neovim. That's also my issue with both: They should focus more on providing features to support coding, not just speed. reply bemusedthrow75 13 hours agorootparentprevYou are a data point for the notion I mention in my own reply to the parent that keyboard-only navigators might be feeling this more than mouse/trackpad users. Which seems likely to me. reply stracer 14 hours agoparentprevSome corporate employees use a notebook loaded with extremely invasive and performance-degrading security and spying software that can't be uninstalled. When your available cpu and disk time is 10% of what the hardware can do, you need as efficient editor as you can get. reply mattlondon 14 hours agorootparentYou're probably not going to be able to install random binaries from the internet on those kinds of machines though. reply stracer 14 hours agorootparentSadly true... Maybe in a few years, if it gets popular enough, and the key decisionmaker gets wooed into allowing it. reply akdjidensb 13 hours agorootparentprevDon't need to install them if they are portable (most everything can be made portable with some work, see scoop packager manager for instance). As long as the company isn't batshit crazy and has the resources and IT spend to afford to use something like applocker, in which case I'd seriously recommend looking for other employment if you cannot get explicit guarantees about administrative access. reply Keyframe 14 hours agoparentprevFor me it's the latency. It's not a deal breaker, of course. It's more of a first world problem akin to I don't know, guitars? High vs low action if you know guitar \"problems\". There's no coding problem where it's dependent on speed of typing; programming is mostly about reading anyways. It's more about the feel of it, like we're picky about keyboards and touch feedback we get. I guess spoiled, but nonetheless... reply bemusedthrow75 13 hours agorootparentHm, except high action is also a positive choice for some, not an inherent problem. (Though I like the attempt at an analogy and I see how it works for you at least) I am a high-action player —- I know I know, a monster! (but also a brass and heavy glass slide player) reply rplnt 12 hours agoparentprevGonna pile up. VS Code with barely any plugins on M1 is noticeably slower than IDEs I've used 15 years ago on a hardware from 20 years go. Slower to render, slower to react to my inpit. It's bordering on unusable on a x86 laptop from few years back. Better showcase on how ridiculous the tech stack is would be to open a 500 line file with a code and scroll. Startup isn't great either, though it isn't comically bad as it used to be. So yeah, I want to see the authors of any desktop software to address this modern problem of writing slow UI. Otherwise I might assume they don't care. reply pwython 11 hours agorootparentWhat IDE do you use nowadays if not VS Code? I'm curious because I'm also using an M1 Mac and I've ran through the gamut (Sublime, PyCharm, Atom, etc). reply jmrm 12 hours agorootparentprevSome people need to use at least one time in life IDEs like Visual Basic 6 in a Pentium 4 to feel what it's like to use a fast IDE reply Daeraxa 12 hours agoparentprevI'm on the team working on Pulsar, the community fork of Atom. You have no idea how much we hear \"Atom is slow\", \"are you making it fast?\" etc. I have honestly yet to work out exactly what is meant by it. Startup times, sure, you are never going to get Pulsar/Atom or VSCode to launch as fast as a terminal editor or a super lightweight native one but that isn't how I personally use that kind of editor - once it is open it stays open for a long time. Keystrokes, context menus, highlighting performance, I honestly don't see where this perceived slowness is. I'm not saying it isn't valid criticism but I guess the way I work with an editor just isn't the same as others who experience this. reply maccard 12 hours agorootparent> Startup times, sure, you are never going to get Pulsar/Atom or VSCode to launch as fast as a terminal editor or a super lightweight native one Would you consider something like emacsclient's approach - a daemon running in the background that a window connects to? reply jahsome 14 hours agoparentprevYes. I have an org issued machine with crap specs and dozens of repos I switch between all day long. Waiting 30s-2m doesn't sound like much but it breaks flow and leads to a lot of \"what was I doing again...?\" Sidetracks reply Cort3z 13 hours agorootparentSounds like your org is bad at basic arithmetic. 12230s = 12 minutes per day minimum. Assuming an engineering salary at perhaps 100k usd /year, that is about 40,7 usd per hour, they would save money by giving you a max specced frame.work(2500$) after 307 days (maximum). Assuming you do this more than “2 dozen” times per day, as you say “all day long”, at minimum they would make that money back in 7.7 days. The same numbers for a max specced MacBook Pro (at 7200 usd) is 22.1 to 884,5 days. I get mad at this attitude from some companies. It’s like telling a carpenter that they have to build a house, but are not allowed power tools. It makes no sense. Edit: typo reply arghwhat 13 hours agorootparentThis is the case for most orgs with corp IT. Their KPIs are around security, which often manifests itself as a game of \"how many security products can one run in parallel\". Crapware like Cisco Secure Endpoint (not to mention Umbrella), Thycotic, Netskope, and whatever else is the current cool way for a corp to MITM itself and introduce kernel vulnerabilities. This in turn puts departments at odds, as their argument for speed is turned into an argument against security, which is a very hard position to be in if your department is a few layers down the corp stack. reply Cort3z 13 hours agorootparentI don’t understand. How does speed implies inverse security, even with corporate blinders on? Let’s say the add all the bloatware in the world, how would a slower developmental speed compromise the security? That their ability to push code goes up and their potential for bugs increase? reply arghwhat 13 hours agorootparentSecurity solutions impact speed, rendering reasonable and performant machines borderline useless. There is no implication that working fast is bad for security. reply akdjidensb 13 hours agorootparentprevWe should be clear that it isn't ALL of corporate IT that is on board with this, or probably even the majority. Its the windows sysadmins that have to deal with non-technical end users, and are constantly being hounded about trivial shit like people clicking on phishing emails and that sort of thing. In fairness to the windows people, you probably wouldn't believe just how awful the majority of workers are with computers. So it's understandable why windows sysadmins become hyper paranoid and irrational in a lot of cases. The low pay doesn't help either. Windows sysadmin is usually a lower tier job within IT and is the most likely to suffer cost cutting and be forced to \"outsource\" security work to a pile of rotten security software. It's also entry level, and so sometimes they are only marginally better with computers than their end users. Ideally, most programmers should be in IT or have some kind of alignment with IT and able to give some pushback about this during CAB for instance, and/or get some exceptions but that is increasingly difficult the more 'agile' an organization becomes and the more it seeks to silo infrastructure people from application people. A good IT department imo is one that doesn't do this and retains a more traditional culture where programmers are part of IT and able to actually influence the technical direction of the company, not just be treated like a product factory for business units. Just from personal experience working as a programmer on the infrastructure side...complaining about windows sysadmins was the favorite past time of probably the majority of higher tier IT employees. It makes our jobs incredibly difficult for the same reason it makes application developers jobs difficult. reply arghwhat 12 hours agorootparentProblem is that most corps in my experience are run by such windows sysadmins, and when you're a subsidiary or two away from the IT department it doesn't matter whether you're all greybeards - you don't have authority. Best you can do is manage to fly under the radar. On the other hand, you'd be surprised by just how many career programmers are completely inept at sysadmin work and have no sense for security (nothing like CI pipelines using personal credentials and committing keys into public repos), so just letting all programmers do whatever isn't a great policy either... reply Cort3z 13 hours agorootparentprevThis assumed by the way that the speed goes to infinity, which is untrue. But the result would most likely be indistinguishable from instantaneous from the point of view of the developer. reply reaperman 13 hours agorootparentprevExcept carpenters bring their own tools, so they can determine the price: value that’s right for their pocketbook. reply jimbokun 13 hours agorootparentA lot of developers would be ecstatic to have a tools allowance and the ability to use whatever laptop they buy on the corporate network. reply jonathankoren 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat are you waiting two minutes to do? reply jahsome 6 hours agorootparentMy machine to respond to double clicking an icon, or using Windows search, or open teams (just kidding that one takes closer to 10). reply formerly_proven 14 hours agorootparentprevWith corporate Windows laptops the real question is \"what aren't you waiting two minutes to do?\" reply jwells89 14 hours agoparentprevSometimes it’s actually speed that’s the issue (when e.g. opening massive text files) but usually “speed” is more about responsiveness in editing, text navigation, etc, which some people are very sensitive to. The time between action and reaction is best minimal as possible. reply nicoburns 12 hours agoparentprev> Is the world really full of developers going crazy with frustration because they’re waiting on vs code to do something? Absolutely. How new/fast is your developer machine? A lot of developers are working on computers that are several years old and may not have been that high-spec to begin with. It's generally not basic editing that's slow on it's own. It's trying to run several editor windows at once (say a frontend and several backend services) along with all the other things required for work: the project itself, compilers, video calls, etc. As a reference point my 2015 MacBook Pro struggled with VS Code + Google Meet at the same time. reply bemusedthrow75 13 hours agoparentprevI have a sneaking feeling that the people who use only their keyboards to navigate are the ones who really notice latency in e.g. VSCode. I navigate with the trackpad on a Mac and seem not to ever feel it, but I know others do not like this way of working, which is fair enough. Lapce is interesting to me for other reasons: it is one of the few[0] GUI text editors with a remote dev option that matches what VSCode can do. And it might have a smaller footprint on the remote machine/in the container while doing it. VSC’s remote dev support is very nearly non-negotiable for me now, so I say more power to them; I intend to try it again properly soon. [0] there is another editor that was mentioned here recently that can achieve this with a plugin, but I forget the name Update: Zed is that editor. reply pcthrowaway 13 hours agoparentprev> Is the world really full of developers going crazy with frustration because they’re waiting on vs code to do something? If programming in Rust on a medium-to-large project, you might be waiting minutes for your editor to finish checks to highlight compilation errors every time you save. That was me on a Rust project last year when I was trying to program on a 2019 macbook air with 16GB of RAM and 1.1 GHZ quad-core intel processor. Typical wait times to check what I'd written would be 30 seconds to just over a minute. It was excruciating. I finally demanded the employer set me up with a cloud VM that I could use when working with that codebase, as the network lag with VS code opening the project remotely was so much more tolerable reply danielheath 12 hours agoparentprevA few years back, someone built a webpage that had various text fields with different typing latencies. A bunch of my friends tried it, and it was really interesting to see that many of them were not bothered in the slightest by even quite high latency numbers. Personally, I was mildly bothered by the \"single frame of latency\" example and _intensely_ bothered by all the higher numbers. It just felt really yuck to use; I would hate to be doing that all day. I can't tell you what exactly it is, but yes: the world contains many developers going crazy with frustration - not because of a 30 second wait, but because of a 30ms render delay. reply giancarlostoro 12 hours agoparentprevAs someone who owns a Sublime Text license if its not an IDE it better be as fast as Sublime or im just going to use Sublime instead. reply veber-alex 13 hours agoparentprevIt's like phones with 120Hz displays. You don't know you need it but once you have it it's hard to go back. reply bloopernova 13 hours agorootparentSimilarly with monitors, 60Hz LCD panels are OK, but 120Hz panels are just so much easier on the eyes. At least for me. Try dragging windows around or scrolling quickly, and you'll see the difference between 60 and 120 very fast. reply FpUser 13 hours agorootparentI can spot the difference but the value proposition is zilch to me. I would not pay 1 extra cent for it. If I was a gamer this would of course matter. reply franky47 14 hours agoparentprevFrustration often comes with extensibility: adding extensions on top of VSCode that need to run at file save time (eg: formatters) can lead to pretty significant performance drops. This extensibility is probably what made VSCode popular though, especially for web devs since the extension mechanism is JavaScript-based. Makes me wonder if those Rust-based tools (Lapce, Zed) will have as much success with Rust-based extensions authoring. reply maleldil 12 hours agorootparentI don't know about Lapce, but the plan for Zed is to have WASM extensions. reply Fraterkes 14 hours agoparentprevVscode is nearly unuseable when my 5 year old thinkpad isn't plugged in. So yeah. reply systems 14 hours agoparentprevfor me its the plugins speed a good example is magit on emacs, magit seems great, and i really want to learn it and use it, but its very slow (at least on windows its slow enough to make you unable to practically use it) in short, speed changes everything reply myaccountonhn 13 hours agoparentprevYeah I find delays make me lose my train of thought and can be frustrating. Especially once you've experienced an editor where everything is instant (kakoune). reply baby 14 hours agoparentprevI think it's just that everybody has been looking for THE editor, and so it is natural that people would develop their own. I think what we're seeing is that VSCode is becoming THE editor (if it's not already there). At this point it's hard to compete. I think the biggest contender is IntelliJ, as many people really seem to enjoy it, but I would predict that it's going to be hard to fight against free. reply pandemic_region 13 hours agorootparentIs anybody else finding Intellij more and more getting in the way in an obtrusive manner? Code completion suggestions are getting worse, formatting ability is basically none existent if your statement is missing a comma or a lambda, it keeps reindexing my local maven repo, code completions are slow to appear... I was a huge fan of their products but now I'm getting more and more annoyed. Maybe I'm getting old? Several times I have been on the brink of trying out spacevim for java development , out of pure frustration but the amount of config and tweaking needed scares me. I don't need much, lightning fast auto complete, auto import and Google code formatter integration. One of these weekends I'll bite the bullet I think and set it all up. reply WuxiFingerHold 5 hours agorootparentI noticed that a couple of years ago. 10 years ago or so, Jetbrains was the gold standard. Then support and quality started to rot. Issues not resolved for years, esp. for Webstorm. Instead building new products and features I was not interested in. I needed proper tailwind support back then, not some cloud colab solution for enterprises. reply jlengrand 14 hours agorootparentprevNot that I disagree, but IntelliJ has a free version, and they're building up Fleet as an attempt to compete. Future will tell. reply FpUser 13 hours agorootparentprevNot sure about how Jetbrains does in general but I have zero hesitation paying for perpetual license of their all inclusive package. It is peanuts compared to value. I still use VS code to do some remote editing / debugging as it is somewhat better experience. Hopefully Jetbrains catches up in this department one day. So yes. These two are THE editors for me. I only deviate from these when I need to do Delphi / Freepascal development. Notepad++ / Notepadqq are being used as in place hotkey invoked text editors. I still try new ones out of curiosity but I have hard time understanding why any would succeed. How they're going to get the same amount of extensions / plugins in order to match functionality? reply FireBeyond 13 hours agorootparentprevI had such high hopes for Sublime Text, but then development slowed to what seemed like a glacial pace, with every upgrade requiring another licensing fee. reply andrepd 11 hours agorootparentI'm happy with it even with \"slow updates\". What features are you looking forward to? reply serf 13 hours agoparentprevif vs code felt as responsive as emacs or vim, i'd use it. I don't really care about 'start-up time', and if I did then using emacsclient or some such with a daemon takes care of that issue entirely. there is no convenient way for me to 'plug-in' the responsiveness of something like vim or emacs into vs code. to be clear : responsiveness is things like opening a context menu of any kind, switching contexts, text drawing and blanking ; just things that add up to create a quick feeling piece of software. vs code/atom/whatever and other 'larger' graphic-heavy text editors feel slow. reply akdjidensb 13 hours agoparentprevIt's less about waiting for vscode to do something and more about the general feel and experience of movement and typing in the editor. \"Speed\" is probably the wrong word, it's latency that matters. reply camel_gopher 12 hours agoparentprevIs it as fast as vim or emacs? If not then a tough sell from my view. Same with chewing up cpu cores. reply umanwizard 12 hours agorootparentEmacs is not known for being particularly fast. reply perrygeo 12 hours agoparentprevIt's not about speed in terms of absolute cumulative time. It's about the interleaving, the user experience of latency, and the effect that has on our cognition. A few ms of noticeable latency here and there, a few hundred ms freeze every once in a while, it's maybe an extra minute per day in clock time. If it was just a 1 minute startup penalty, that would be different. But this 60,000 ms is split up throughout the working day into hundreds of small pauses, making the system feel laggy and unpredictable. If you're lucky, it's merely a subconscious drag on your attention. If you're unlucky it will, have you constantly breaking concentration to wonder \"is my editor frozen? Oh wait, never mind.\" Hundreds of times a day. Now contrast that to a text editor with literally zero instances of noticeable lag. It's not that it has zero latency, it's that the I/O latency on modern hardware is faster than our fingers and eyes can work. So we don't experience it. Hundreds of noticeable pauses versus zero pauses. Once you cross the threshold below which our fingers type and brain can read, you're lag free. Getting a faster text editor doesn't just slightly improve the lagginess, it completely solves it. reply xutopia 13 hours agoparentprevIf you pair program every ms counts.

Did you include the time needed to open the files? reply antisthenes 13 hours agorootparentYes, the files themselves open quite quickly, but I will admit that it's a complicated diff (lots of expected differences), and VSCode is not primarily a diff tool.

I feel like this is 80% of the rails ecosystem nowadays. reply dewski 10 hours agorootparentAuthor of peek here. Honestly, I got burnt out. We stopped using this internally at GitHub for our secondary Rails applications which made it difficult to continue working on. Rails was going through its identity crisis with asset pipelines and I didn't feel like trying to support every available option for people like Sprockets, Importmaps, NPM, Bower, etc. It was nice when there was the paved path and users could generally follow the README and be up and running quickly. https://github.com/MiniProfiler/rack-mini-profiler gets you most of the way there and comes by default in the Gemfile for new Rails applications. reply jupp0r 7 hours agorootparentHey there, sorry if this came across as critique on the project itself or you personally. I get it, priorities change and projects get abandoned by the original maintainers. My comment was more aiming at the ecosystem at large. Lots of the (RoR) stack in my current day job depends on long abandoned libraries with unmerged fix PRs from years ago and I see this all the time in the Rails ecosystem. Interest in the ecosystem is shrinking and this is one symptom. reply dewski 6 hours agorootparentIt's a fair critique! I still keep kicking the can down the road about revisiting the project and modernizing it. The ecosystem has moved along so much since I last revisited it I'll need to take a fresh look at it, accepting the PRs that are currently open is likely out of the question. > Interest in the ecosystem is shrinking and this is one symptom. I think the interest in the ecosystem is still very strong, there is just more publicity and marketing around the newest frameworks and capturing peoples attention. Rails is more than ever the best place to go zero to one, and still scaling past 100M at GitHub. There are so many libraries that are largely feature complete. For example, Devise doesn't need anymore features. There is some traction of going the more lazaronixon/authentication-zero route which is a generator for owning the code rather than having everything live in a gem. This is just one specific example. Rails is moving more and more third party things in house showing it matured in the ecosystem and can move into core Rails. I find myself reaching to a gem as a last resort if at all possible these days. reply hakunin 11 hours agorootparentprevI don't think this is quite right. I've done a survey a few months ago when deciding what to use for a new project (primarily comparing Ruby and Go). What I saw was many people rallying around the top useful libs out there. I also saw numerous brand new libs showing up, fixing mistakes of their predecessors. And each time I compared a popular Ruby project with a popular Go one, I'd find consistent activity from multiple maintainers in the former. And a lot of initial activity that completely dies down in the latter. The overall feeling I got is that Ruby on Rails has gotten a lot more \"getting shit done\", \"don't waste time\" mode, — many businesses depend on it. Libs became higher quality compared to the early playful years. reply awestroke 13 hours agorootparentprevI definitely get that feeling as well. 80% ghost town reply rubyfan 13 hours agorootparentYet almost all of it still works. reply jupp0r 13 hours agorootparentAll of it almost works. reply sergiotapia 12 hours agorootparentprevI'm moving from Phoenix back to Rails for a new project.

The ecosystem is very much alive albeit not “exciting” anymore and at the end of the day people use what they know. The 2010s have produced a large number of Rails developers. For the majority of CRUD apps Rails (or Laravel or Django) are just fine thus there’s no need to really make a switch. Finally, React can power a lot of things but in my experience it is far from offering the right integration and rapid development speed that something like Rails or Laravel come with. reply sodapopcan 10 hours agorootparentprev> But in 2024 things like react and typescript exists. Avoiding this stuff is one point on the list. I know I'm being a little snarky, but it's true. If you're building a fullstack app with fullstack devs you can avoid a lot of complexity that stuff brings. reply sergiotapia 11 hours agorootparentprev> react and typescript These are nonstarters for me. It seems like vercel has corrupted react beyond recognition, and other full-stack frameworks like Remix just do a lot of `rigamarole` to mimic a fraction of what an older fullstack framework like rails/django/phoenix can do. frontend is desperately trying to catch up to backend. backend is trying to capture frontend to seduce people back, and they're getting there with freakishly good UX like phoenix liveview and rails 8's morph. reply matthewmacleod 11 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a good choice for building a full stack web application.

If you need to call out over the network to 12 different services to serve your request or want to do computationally intensive things, etc, another language with support for concurrency is a better choice imho. reply francislavoie 10 hours agorootparentYou could say the same for PHP. But for 99.9% of applications, that doesn't apply. reply jupp0r 10 hours agorootparentYeah, right. Because all the interesting things nowadays happen on the same server that renders your html and nobody calls into other SaaS APIs or interacts with external systems much.

No, that’s still a choice you can make. It’s still possible to make your app run on one server with Rails/Django/PHP and to scale it horizontally and vertically very easily. The requirements of a web app / web site barely changed in 10-15 years, the only things that changed is that new ways to do the same things appeared regularly : some were real improvements, most are just hype-driven. If you need to call external APIs you can still do it on the client if that’s what you want or on the server with task queues / messages queues which are still a good practice anyway and which can be handled by how many servers you want. reply zelphirkalt 3 hours agorootparentprevCan you explain why concurrency within processing a request makes things difficult for Rails? reply hit8run 2 hours agorootparentprevCouldn’t you solve this problem with something like this: https://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/master/Co... reply julienbourdeau 15 hours agorootparentprevI didn’t see a demo, only the closed bar with some timing stuff.

We typically use in dev and lower QA environments, and they quickly become indespensible to help answer questions like \"which version of service X is deployed\", something that may be easy for a dev to answer as they can look at what is deployed on the server, but harder for a tester who can only access the frontend. Other useful environmental information we find useful includes \"which DB is being used\", which OpenShift namespace (with a link to the console), traceability for the deployed artifact (e.g. links to the GitHub release tag, CI pipeline which built the artifact, docker registry with the correctly tagged image). Especially useful if you have downstream or upstream services, is to have colour coded status info about whether the services are up. For the few days investment getting this up and running, it pays itself back in terms of time gained answering questions such as \"Why doesn't this feature work? Oh, after investigation, this service was down during testing\". reply thejosh 6 hours agoparentAlso handy (regardless of framework, language, etc) is if you use feature flags, if you're using actual valid credentials against a service or a local testing service (eg S3 vs minio, etc). Enabling this for non-technical users really helped also report any issues they would see, it was great for testing environments. Plus you would probably end up needing all this information anyway if you do any error tracking, so it probably exists somewhere already :-). reply nomilk 11 hours agoprevFirst time encountering the term 'debugbar', I see: > This project is inspired by what you get in the PHP world, with the Laravel debugbar for instance.

You'll always need to expose this info from the backend somehow. Of course with react and vue the data is available since it's already in the frontend. reply julienbourdeau 15 hours agorootparentYeah you always need a backend part as part of your dev dependencies but currently you also need to add a little snippet in your production view code. It could be a browser extension like Rails panel + meta_request but I think it’s also good that anybody working on the codebase always get the debugbar, regardless of their browser or setup. reply pmontra 14 hours agorootparentThe downside is that if the project decides not to have that in the code, nobody gets it.

Sweeney, whose company sued Apple over antitrust concerns related to App Store fees, is obviously a biased source on the matter, but he raises a question that’s on everyone’s minds. Did Apple break iPhone web apps because it was looking to protect customers from security risks arising from third-party browser engines, as it claims, or was the decision more about quashing a potential threat to Apple’s business? Would Apple really go so far as to degrade the consumer experience on iPhone to protect its revenue, in other words? The iPhone maker on Thursday published an update to its website detailing its DMA-related changes in the EU to address the matter, after the discovery that iPhone web apps — also known as progressive web apps, or PWAs — were no longer functional in the recent iOS betas in the EU. Initially, there was concern that the issues were just a beta bug, but Apple soon put that theory to rest. On its website, Apple explains that to comply with the DMA, it’s being forced to support other web browser engines besides WebKit — the browser engine used by Safari. iOS Home Screen web apps have relied on WebKit and its security architecture to keep users safe from online threats. This involves the isolation of storage and the enforcement of “system prompts to access privacy-impacting capabilities,” Apple said. Without this isolation and enforcement, malicious web apps could read data from other apps and gain access to a user’s camera, microphone or location with user consent, the company noted. Since Apple is being forced to allow alternative browser engines via the DMA’s requirements, the company chose not to put users at risk and instead degraded the web app experience on iOS for users in the EU. Now, web apps will function as website bookmarks — without support for local storage, badges, notifications and dedicated windowing. Though Sweeney arguably has a bone to pick with Apple, there may be some truth to his claims. Within Apple’s explanation of why it has ended support for web apps in the EU, the company admits there’s a technical solution to the security issues problem — but it simply chose not to implement it. Apple wrote (emphasis ours): Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps. In short, Apple is saying it knows how to fix the problem but because it’s been burdened by having to comply with the DMA — which it noted had required “more than 600 new APIs and a wide range of developer tools” — it decided to skip fixing this one. While it may be no small feat to build “an entirely new integration architecture,” it also isn’t as if Apple was surprised by the DMA, a regulation that’s been in the works for years. It had time to prepare for this. To further deflect any culpability here, Apple suggests that people won’t mind that it broke Home Screen web apps, given their “low user adoption.” But Apple’s own moves contradict that explanation. If anything, Apple has been working to make PWAs more useful over the years, adding features that allowed web apps to function more like native apps, and be easily distributed outside its App Store. Meanwhile, user adoption has been growing, not shrinking. Analysts estimated that the PWA market would reach $10.44 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate of 31.9%. It’s entirely possible that alternative browser engines could make PWAs even more useful, as Sweeney argues, which would be a threat to Apple’s App Store business, given the web apps are now nearly as functional as native apps are. Apple had been asked to comment on its decision around PWAs, but it only published an explanation to its DMA website as its response.

Apple has been strangling web app progress on iOS for many years. They wanted to ensure that web apps could never compete with native apps on the App Store, because they can extract their 30% fee. Now that Apple are forced to permit third party browser engines, web apps would suddenly be a lot more powerful. Apple just won't have that, so they're disabling a useful feature for everyone. I think this will backfire on them. Downgrading their own feature offerings to spite the competition is only going to fuel more animosity by everyone: users, businesses, developers, and legislators. I feel quite firmly that their proposal to comply with the Digital Markets Act is non-compliant. The DMA requires free interoperability, and Apple has imposed a very anti-competitive fee. Once this is eliminated, developers will be free to distribute whatever native apps they wish, and at this stage there are a lot of developers who will jump to any other app store. reply dubcanada 20 hours agoparentAs much as I would love to agree, the general population really does not care about features like \"home screen web apps\". Nobody outside of HN even knows what they are. Everyone just goes on the app store and downloads random website app. Even if it is just a browser app that renders a website. Apple would have to eliminate something that people actually care about for any boycott Apple to happen. reply cybrox 20 hours agorootparentPeople don't care because Apple has made sure they don't care. They have crippled web app adoption for years to push the app store and now argue that \"well, only a few people use that anyways\". How many apps in the app store are just webviews?

Ideally with a gatekeeper between her and anything she is going to install that has permission to use phone features; like cameras. She would very much concur, insofar as she understands the issues. She's using an iPhone specifically because Apple doesn't go for shenanigans like multiple ways to get apps on the phone. The point is to have an App store and funnel everything through it. There is enough sensitive stuff on a phone that I'm not even sure running a full web browser is a good idea for her. \"Limited capability\" really is the name of the game here. It isn't just we don't care because Apple doesn't support it. We are in fact grateful to Apple for not supporting it. This is value-add by Apple.

We don't need regulators trying to help by making iPhones worse. If you don't like what iPhones do, don't buy one.

They could do the same for web apps. What's been limiting them all this time is Apple policy. Apple policy 1- PWAs on iPhone must use Safari, Safari only has features Apple chooses to implement Apple policy 2- Add to Home Screen is hidden away Now with DMA, Google could make its own web browser, provide all their apps as \"PWAs that work with Chrome and not Safari\" and people could go along with it. Heck they could even start their own app store without the apps having to follow any of Apple's \"alternative distribution\" rules- because they're web apps, not native apps. reply adestefan 20 hours agorootparentSo you’d rather have Google abuse its monopoly on search to get what you want? reply lozenge 20 hours agorootparentI'm just working through Apple's reasoning. The idea that PWAs aren't in common use now therefore they won't be used in the future is completely wrong and that's borne out by history.

Oh, you cannot make such strategic decisions until regulators of the world force Apple to abandon anti-competitive practices? Like as you see even in 2024 there is still no clarity whether it will be possible to deliver the same standalone UX to iOS via the Web because of Apple? Your reasoning is somewhat circular. Let alternative \"app stores\" like the web deliver the same standalone UX to iOS because it is hell possible with current web capabilities and every OS including macOS is capable of supporting browser sandboxing. THEN wait 2-3-5 years so that best programmers can study the web and migrate to create the same fantastic experiences you claim by native apps. THEN write your above comment if still applies, thanks! reply mmcnl 13 hours agorootparentprevTrue, but it's not end users who should be caring about this at all, it's the developers. Developers can leverage the freedom of the web with PWAs: no gatekeepers, no 30% tax, no approvals.

To that end I dislike all the faux-native iOS apps that are just a webview with a menu. It's always quite obvious when people do that. So even if I would've known about HSWAs being a thing (and not just \"bookmarks on the home screen\", which is approximately the exact same thing, but with an address bar), I wouldn't have cared to use them.

The reason that devs don't target or improve it is the friction Apple (and Google to a degree) they put in front of utilizing PWA/web apps. reply jsnell 19 hours agorootparentChrome on Android has \"Install App\" in the main menu. It allows for sites to trigger an install flow without going any browser menus (you can e.g. have an \"Install\" button on a site, and clicking it will diredctly open a PWA installation prompt). In addition to that, Android supports PWAs in the Play Store. It supports other browsers, and doesn't restrict them from installing PWAs or providing alternate installation flows. I really don't understand the equivalency you're drawing here. Apple are a uniquely bad guy in this respect, it's not a difference of degree, it's a difference of kind. reply jasonjayr 18 hours agorootparentGoogle's implementation is nice, I agree, but I'm talking about richer APIs for PWAs, on parity with native apps. I imagine Google could, now that Apple is being forced to allow multiple browsers, have a 'Chrome launcher' for PWAs on iOS.

I understand what people meant with these words back then but it just confuses even tech people... nowadays standalone mode (\"install\") is orthogonal to whether the website is capable, good, progressive or whatever... like the .fun domain is a nice game that your child tried and enjoyed, it is hopefully well written so you want to use it in standalone instead of tab mode... you do it without fear of installing anything (nothing is installed) and if everything ok you use it launching it directly from the home screen without browser UI... seemless, that is the actual idea, no need for confusing and contraproductive wording reply madeofpalk 17 hours agorootparentI think an invisible long press is just as (un)intuitive as the share sheet junk drawer. reply interpol_p 20 hours agorootparentprevIt's pretty well hidden to the point of \"why do they bother supporting this feature?\" reply madeofpalk 18 hours agoparentprevI don’t believe Apple “strangles” Safari to promote their App Store and protect its 30% cut. There’s a mountain of web capabilities that Apple lead the charge and either invented the specs on, or adopted before others, on to make more native-like experiences for the web. I think things like backdrop-filter, position: sticky, and css snap points do a whole lot more to make websites feel like native app than stuff like WebMIDI. I think there's plenty of 'malicious compliance' and pettiness in Apple's recent DMA stuff, but I do not think removing chromeless home screen bookmarks was one of them. I think they took a strict interpretation of the regulations and don't really care too much about them so just removed them. I think Apple just has a different philosophy and priorities for their web platform, putting a higher value on privacy, performance, and efficiency than Chrome. reply szasamasa 18 hours agorootparentsure :) reply turquoisevar 2 hours agoparentprevHow do you reconcile this claim regarding Apple’s intent to crush web apps with their increased investment in supporting PWAs over the last four years up to and including the upcoming Safari release and recruiting top talent such as Jen Simmons to achieve this?

It becomes worse since the gatekeepers are also those that sell us the mobile devices to access the app stores. It comes down to marketing. As longer there isn't a largish corporation marketing alternatives to native apps, the current situation won't change much - in the short term. reply szasamasa 19 hours agorootparentprevI can assure you now it is totally possible to create the same standalone UX on iPhone from the web more securely than using a native app... if Apple is forced to allow at least other browser engines to use web capabilities securely (just like they could do this on macOS or any OS is capable) is it easy to create good web UX, not... most web desgners are not real programmers and most websites are terrible, I do not really use many web apps but plenty of them might be terrible now, too but it all comes down to the developer behind the product... if you get less native offerings in the future (there are areas where native is better, it is actually also a good bot protection to require native apps) then your good programmers simply deliver good web apps to you and it actually will be the same UX only cheaper interestingly enough, if everybody has to pay the apple tax and it is the user who pays it in the end, developers may just stay by native, no competitive pressure one area is that smaller innovative apps from even sole developers may never come to realisation because it is expensive to pay android and ios developers... I just checked lichess... it is a mixed website that is not responsive (on smaller screens terrible) but uses webassembly for stockfish, that is a plus still one of the biggest expense is 1 or 2 app developers, if they did not get 500k donations they might not even exist because of app store restrictions... that would be a loss actually they should have just invest that money to create a responsive design and maybe some offline functionality and they could deploy \"apps\" on iPhones and Android and actually on all desktops... but you might just want to use lichess as tabs there, one tab for analysis, one for broadcasts etc... that is a good example how we might lose great small projects like lichess... and why we only have 2 greats chess sites, one getting 100 million dollar from subscriptions... it is simply difficult to create a cross platform solution even if the stockfish ai is free and open source one monopoly creates others... reply Someone 19 hours agoparentprev> The DMA requires free interoperability, and Apple has imposed a very anti-competitive fee. From comments I read, quite a few people want it to require free interoperability, but I don’t see how it does. I even think it sort-of explicitly allows gatekeepers to keep charging for access. The pre-amble, point 62 starts with “For software application stores, online search engines and online social networking services listed in the designation decision, gatekeepers should publish and apply general conditions of access that should be fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.” so that point is about application stores. Its second paragraph starts (emphasis added) “PRICING or other general access conditions should be considered unfair if they lead to an imbalance of rights and obligations imposed on business users or confer an advantage on the gatekeeper which is disproportionate to the service provided by the gatekeeper to business users or lead to a disadvantage for business users in providing the same or similar services as the gatekeeper.” To me, that points to them at least considering that. Can you point me to where https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/1925/oj “requires free interoperability”? If you think article 6.7 says that, I disagree. IMO, it only talks about access to SDKs, specs of device ports, ability to make the same system calls as the applications of the gatekeeper can make, etc. Here’s article 6.7: “The gatekeeper shall allow providers of services and providers of hardware, free of charge, effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the same hardware and software features accessed or controlled via the operating system or virtual assistant listed in the designation decision pursuant to Article 3(9) as are available to services or hardware provided by the gatekeeper. Furthermore, the gatekeeper shall allow business users and alternative providers of services provided together with, or in support of, core platform services, free of charge, effective interoperability with, and access for the purposes of interoperability to, the same operating system, hardware or software features, regardless of whether those features are part of the operating system, as are available to, or used by, that gatekeeper when providing such services.” reply chacham15 19 hours agorootparent> it only talks about access to SDKs, specs of device ports, ability to make the same system calls The Apple App store uses SDKs + system calls to install other apps, right? So, if you're allowed to sideload your own app store it should be able to do the same freely. So, the question then becomes about sideloading which I think you're supposed to be able to do freely as well. reply Someone 17 hours agorootparentI would think the App Store asks the OS to install apps. More importantly, you can argue about the interpretation of that text, but in the end, it will be how the EU interprets it, and I don’t think there’s any way they ever intended it to mean “the DMA requires free interoperability”, or that they will in the future decide that to be the case. Of course, future legislation may say different things, but that won’t make the statement true. reply madeofpalk 17 hours agorootparentprevNo. Said APIs can be restricted by the platform through entitlements, which are cryptographically locked APIs that must be granted access via Apple.

Every time somebody says \"I don't want vendor lock-in\", they flip it to \"Oh, so you don't want safety?\" But these are often false dichotomies created by Apple. Reviewing and rejecting apps for fraud and malware is great, but Apple bundled that with rejecting apps for using the word \"Android\" and whatever other curation they want. Having built-in first-party subscriptions UI is safe and convenient for users, but the mobile duopoly and their control of the platform lets them charge for it whatever they want. Apple implies that allowing other payment processors means going to a dodgy website that makes unsubscribing and refunds impossible, but that's a false dichotomy Apple has created. They could require integration with iOS's subscription management APIs to use alternative payment processors (they already support PayPal as a back-end). And this is another case where it's incredibly convenient that opening up internal APIs without safeguards to 3rd parties would be unsafe, so they haven't done it. But this is a false dichotomy – they don't have to run 3rd party browsers unsandboxed, or allow any app create homescreen icons willy-nilly. Adding to home screen is already a user gesture through the Share sheet, mediated by the OS. Browsers must be sandboxed anyway, and webapps were already allowed to run full screen. And this isn't lack of just any feature. Apple has argued for years that App Store isn't mandatory, because anybody can just make a web app instead. That was never quite true do to Safari's limitations, but now is just a farce. reply tailspin2019 19 hours agoparentCompletely agree with this.

But it should still \"work\" right, if it's just a webpage. No notifications if apple have broken the notification API, but lots of sites use notifications, e.g. the pop up to enable desktop notifications for WhatsApp web, is this now broken? And no local storage, is this referring to JavaScript session / local storage? Surely that would break lots of websites? What about cookie storage, that's not something they can just break?

    "originBody": "Latest Release Matrix SpaceMatrix ChatReport IssueRedditDiscord A reimplementation of the 1997 Bullfrog business sim Theme Hospital. As well as faithfully recreating the original, CorsixTH adds support for modern operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux and BSD), high resolutions and much more. Getting Started You will need the following: Grab the latest installer for your system: Windows and macOS builds can be downloaded directly from releases. Linux and BSD repositories use either corsixth or corsix-th names packaged versions. A Flatpak for Linux users is available on Flathub. We use graphics, sound and other data from the original game so one of the following is required: Original game CD from eBay etc. or your dusty bookshelf:smile: A download from GOG.com or EA Head over to our getting started page for more detail. What's Working? Most features of the game are available -- and we're at a state where you can complete the full campaign without issue. Original Features Single player campaign All diseases, objects, rooms are available (see below section for outstanding anomalies) All events (emergencies, earthquakes, epidemics, VIP visits) Management windows (managing staff, patients, policies etc.) Music/Jukebox and gameplay videos (see below section for outstanding anomalies) Cheats (naughty!) New Features Custom levels and campaigns Full HD support Zooming Make your own maps and levels Unlimited saves and 12 autosave slots Play your own music! Option to remove destroyed rooms for a fee Improved game logic Full control over all hotkeys What's missing/needs improvement? There are some areas of the game still missing, and while we work to get them integrated any additional help from the community is always appreciated! Multiplayer/LAN AI Hospitals (and the components associated with it) Level skipping cheat (on level progression board) Rats (but rat holes are present) and the special rat level Win level video/letter Newspaper headlines on lose level The original graphics do not have a complete set for Pregnancy, Alien DNA, and female Fractured Bones patients -- these may cause anomalies if you enable regular spawning in settings Patients have an astounding ability to always remain upright (can't fall over in earthquakes) Some objects in the game may glitch with walls Developers Coders and non-coders we want you!

They had played the original game as a kid and I guess nostalgia and their then-current circumstances got them interested again. I was impressed by this port's functionality, back then. My friend didn't make it, several months later. The marrow transplant didn't take well enough, and they eventually caught a lung infection they didn't survive. Needless to say, this had a profound impact on my outlook. So it's bittersweet to see it pop up again. But I will repeat my original assessment: it's an impressively functional port! reply omarqureshi 20 hours agoprevSEGA employee here, so, a little biased, however, I don't play many SEGA games. For what it's worth one of our studios has members that are ex-Bullfrog and have Two Point Hospital - https://store.steampowered.com/app/535930/Two_Point_Hospital... Give it a try, this is one of the few ones that I have played and enjoyed. reply Caligatio 19 hours agoparentTwo Point Hospital is very much the spiritual successor to Theme Hospital and I would have no problems pointing people towards it first rather than Theme Hospital. I have extremely fond memories of playing Theme Hospital back on my PS1 but it does have some rough edges. reply mattlondon 15 hours agorootparent+1 very very much the spiritual successor, and I think even some of the same developers. The negative side of course is that they have not really added that much in terms of new gameplay mechanics in Two Point Hospital compared to the original, and a bunch of the levels are DLC so are extra money. But hey it is fun. reply k__ 20 hours agoparentprevNot a SEGA employee here. I played TPH and liked it. Is the university game already released? reply bikson 20 hours agorootparentYup.

You manage building, hiring staff, addressing difficult diagnoses, and so on. https://store.steampowered.com/app/868360/Project_Hospital/ reply Oddskar 21 hours agoprevI randomly started playing through Theme Hospital, and I'm now almost at the last level. I must say: in general it hasn't held up very well. There are so many mechanics that are extremely poorly explained that are fundamental to the game. E.g. epidemics and earthquake/machine strength. Trying to micromanage all of the gameplay systems that are quite annoying to begin with doesn't end up being .. fun. As a child I'm sure I liked it because it was goofy and approachable, but playing through it now I doubt I ever got through the levels where managing epidemics is important. reply blibble 20 hours agoparentwas that the old theme hospital or CorsixTH about a year ago I got most of the way through CorsixTH before realising a few things didn't behave as they did in the original, namely epidemics I went back and completed the original instead reply Oddskar 19 hours agorootparentIt's the original TH. Epidemics is a pretty bad gameplay system. Especially considering patients going between buildings automatically fails it; which makes it almost completely broken. On some maps buying some particular buildings is a complete foot-gun due to this. reply TheCycoONE 14 hours agorootparentprevCurious what you prefer about the original epidemics. As a rule we try to balance quality of life improvements with faithful implementation and lean towards faithful when a change is controversial. For our own protection we do not reverse engineer though so the goal is similar to what can be observed and fun to play. reply moritonal 19 hours agoparentprevJust wait until you find the fax machine mechanic xD reply feydaykyn 11 hours agoprevI made a few commits now and then on corsixth and I want to stress how much the team has been welcoming, with \"first issues\" label, guidance and help on the code. Many thanks! reply serf 15 hours agoprevTH, and CorsixTH afterwards have taken an unbelievable amount of my life away since the game first landed on the PS1. I feel like I speak with a British twinge on my voice for days after a few hours of listening to the PA secretary audio -- that applies to both TH and all the new Campus bullfrog games, too.

It wasn't the version on the UK Playstation Magazine Demo Disc No. 18, volume 2 for you as well, by any chance? :) reply rtuin 15 hours agorootparentSimilar though! It was on PC, either downloaded from Tucows or from one of these shareware discs they sold at computer fairs. reply alliao 9 hours agorootparentman thanks for the nostalgic rush, upon witnessing tucows a phrase I've not seen since forever I was instantly transported to 1998 searching with alta vista/infoseek getting gaming tips off happypuppy.com and updating my geocitie website, man those were the days reply shamiln 20 hours agoprevEvery year I play this, started with CorsixTH a few years ago when it became stable enough to play.

On the mend.mid is my favourite piece of music from the series. reply Oddskar 19 hours agoparentIt's poorly explained in the game, but you can increase the amount of machine health by researching \"Improvements\". One also has to keep track of the machine strength which is only visible in the bottom right corner when hovering over the machine. It will deteriorate over time, and at some points the machines will have to be replaced. reply charles_f 12 hours agoprev> we love Lua and its approachable and easy to pick up nature I keep seeing Lua popup in random places, like home automation or this game.

Peter Crawley (Corsix) built the original versions of CorsixTH back in 2009. I made my first significant contribution in 2012 when I added movies. Now I am the oldest active contributor and Windows packager. I primarily work on the engine and leave the scripting to others. Lewri joined in 2020 and brought a lot of energy back to the project, improving community outreach, bug triaging, patching and keeping everyone talking. Alan runs the distinct but parallel Android port which was recently started again after a long hiatus.

    "originBody": "The steep rise of Hackernews in Google rankings Feb 18, 2024 — von jonathan in Uncategorized I had a weird experience today. I saw the forum Hackernews in my Google results, a forum that I often visit to learn about cool opensoure projects and internet news, but I never found it on google before. Did it benefit from Googles hidden gem update? This November update changes the ranking system to prioritize useful personal insights and experiences and it pays special attention to forums. Reddit and Quroa are known to have gained a lot of traffic from this. I looked at the rankings for Hackernews with popular tools like sistrix and semrush in the UK and the US, because it only has content in english. And I found this: a 162% rise in visibilities in the ranking in the UK and a 75% increase in the US. Visibility of ycombinator.com It is also noteworthy what it HN ranking for: A comment is the top result for “where was gta made”. Hopefully “Philip-J-Fry” was honest. A comment from desdiv is ranking #1 for the question “Monaco in italian” Another article that ranks well for several keywords like „ruined my life“ is GRAHAM PANTHER’s article, and HN also ranks well for brand-related KW, such as every question about the cost of youtube tv, where Google favours the post from thunderbong. Also interesting is that Google is ranking HN Posts high for a special kind of Keywords like “libgen mirror” and “4chan”. In general I am suprised for how much non tech related stuff HN is ranking in total. Looking at the traffic and keyword ranking, it appears that HN is growing much faster in countries where English is not the main language than in the US. The downsides of the attention Many sites that benefited from the google gem update experienced a huge increase in spam. SEOs can now buy Reddit accounts, comments and upvotes to promote their sites. Google groups that reappeared through the update mostly have articles about free spins now and also Linkedin other social platforms are under attack by SEO spammers. So we can only hope that the new visibility won’t affect the wonderful HN too much. Kommentare Schreibe einen Kommentar Deine E-Mail-Adresse wird nicht veröffentlicht.

(Maybe November 2022 is turning out to be a new kind of Eternal September for the rest of the Web...) reply Shawnj2 16 minutes agoparentI bet a lot of text generated content you see online is LLM generated and I'm not sure how exempt HN is from this. Probably more than most but in 2024 it is trivial to generate something with an LLM that could be assumed to be written by a human and post it. Most of the internet pre-November 2022 isn't AI generated (with the exception of one off things like Seychelles Anon, SubredditSimGPT2, etc.) reply baq 1 hour agoparentprevI'd go a bit further and ask what other choice do they have...? Unless they can make a reasonably effective LLM-generated content detection (sounds tough!) they're faced with a rather inconvenient problem of mining the internet for known human-generated content (while we still agree what 'to know' even means). Interesting parallels to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel. reply thatjoeoverthr 28 minutes agorootparentIt’s certainly hard to detect authorship per se, but I expect very easy to detect content people produce using LLMs. You can target affiliate marketing blogs and other SEO garbage, entirely ignoring whether it’s literally written by human hands. reply A_D_E_P_T 4 minutes agorootparent> It’s certainly hard to detect authorship per se, but I expect very easy to detect content people produce using LLMs. Yes. For now. Just flag the use of the words \"delve\" and \"deep dive,\" flag bullet-pointed paragraphs and lists, and flag anything that closes with a too-neat one-paragraph conclusion — and you've just caught 85% of AIspam. But this is already changing, and in about 6-10 months I expect it'll be impossible to detect at more than 70% confidence whether an article is written by an AI or a human. (You could say: The human writes with soul, with style, whereas the AI is totally bland, irritatingly didactic, and generic. But you can quite easily coax an AI into imitating any literary style, and some of the best AI-generated content is warped in this way.) reply reddalo 1 hour agoparentprevI'd like this definition of \"Eternal AI September\": all the website that existed before November 2022 and kept posting the same kind of content will be considered safe. Everything else will be vetted to prevent LLM generated content. reply bryanrasmussen 11 hours agoprevso the theory is that now there will be a lot of bots taking over HN and posting stuff that they want to rank up, destroying the value of the site? What's the defense there? reply j-a-a-p 11 minutes agoparentCut off the infected limb and block the site to Google entirely. Or split HN in an active and archived branch with an upvote threshold, the latter is made accessible by Google. reply jcmp 11 hours agoparentprevBit afraid about that. Honestly it is suprising how spam free HN is, so maybe they have some good anti spam system in place. Also i think it would make sense to set all outside links to \"nofollow\" so google ingores them and therefore it is less interesting for SEO. reply TheAceOfHearts 11 hours agorootparentThere's definitely a bit of influence / perception manipulation on HN. A few years back I heard a story that a tech company would monitor HN for certain keywords, and if their product or category was ever brought up or mentioned multiple developers would always show up to engage on the topic. This isn't quite spamming or cheating the system, but it's a very effective tactic for shifting public perception. reply tech234a 10 hours agorootparentYou might be referring to GitLab: https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-rel... (hi to those from GitLab watching #hn-mentions on Slack) reply tivert 3 hours agorootparent> You might be referring to GitLab: https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/developer-rel... That's really interesting that they'd disclose their strategy so publicly. On the one hand, I can't see it doing much harm. On the other hand, wouldn't it be somewhat self-defeating or even embarrassing to confess that you're doing that? One could probably reasonably assume that many companies have a social media strategy like that, but to have people know that's the strategy would probably drain away at least some of the goodwill provided by the posts. reply bryanrasmussen 2 hours agorootparentI would think it is good if done in a good way and bad if done in a bad way. bad way - posting stuff to make your company profile go up all the time, if you think you have something that might be of interest to HN sure but not everything you do should get posted. when negative stuff comes up swoop in to defend company and to drag down those saying negative things about company, especially without disclosure but even with disclosure. Good - something technical about company comes up, developers who worked on technical thing come in and clarify technical aspects for people. Somebody has problem with your product and you come in and ask for clarification and help solve problem. reply john_cogs 10 hours agorootparentprev:waves: reply uoaei 1 hour agorootparentIt's a curious division between \"old internet\" and \"new internet\" (those on the *chans may have parallel but slightly different terminology for this dichotomy) to see people use BBS-style vs IRC-style emotive expressions. reply saagarjha 43 minutes agorootparentprevYou could also just hire people who spend all their time on this site. reply leobg 55 minutes agorootparentprevPinecone txtai … Someone should build an AI agent that keeps a list. reply ilamont 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is how some companies counter negative glassdoor reviews.

However they lied often about their ranking signals ;) https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/09/evolving-n... reply samtho 10 hours agorootparentDid Google really say that? It makes sense to treat it as a different category of link. An organic back link from a blog or website is putting the weight of the website’s name/reputation behind it whilst UGC has users putting their name/reputation on it (as it relates to their relationship with the originating website). The latter is not worthless as the website ultimately allows it, it not as strong as a signal as an organic backlink. reply pixl97 11 hours agoparentprevOver the past few weeks I've seen more crypto scam posts than ever. While they quickly become dead, I'm not sure if they are coming in a faster rate than in the past or what. reply dang 2 hours agorootparentI've seen that too. Usually these things come in waves and once the spammers figure out it's not working, they go away.

A site is spam-proof if it makes it hard enough to get an invitation. The relatively few spammers who slip through can be warned and/or banned. Unfortunately, we may not be invited. reply throw10920 6 hours agorootparentThis is what Lobsters does, and it's pretty effective (although the site has other, much worse problems that outweigh that one feature). reply illiac786 2 hours agorootparentThat aligns well with their line of thought though, which is that there is a specific political view which is desired. They're basically building an echo chamber and it will starve on the long run because it will become so specific, the chance of a new user fitting in that community on day one will become lower and lower. Being open is hard, very hard, but it's the only long term strategy in my eyes. The rest is an illusion. reply mlekoszek 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat sort of problems would you say they have? reply throw10920 4 hours agorootparentVotes are (to a greater extent than HN) used to indicate disagreement rather than low quality (which leads to more low quality comments); political content is allowed and encouraged (but only that which aligns with the beliefs of the moderators); many users have been banned without any transparency as to why; significant groupthink about technical topics (separate from the political content). reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentprevHeh, that doesn’t stop spammers. It only takes one spammer getting invited before they start inviting their spammer “friends”. Before you know it, you have thousands of dormant accounts just waiting to spam you. It makes it harder, sure, but that’s not an effective solution by itself. In fact, it leads to a false sense of security. reply throw10920 4 hours agorootparentDo you have evidence for this claim? As evidence against: Lobsters, which uses an invite tree, has virtually no spam to speak of. reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentThere is nothing I can share because it is proprietary information and would assist in informing spammers on how spam detection works on the platform I used to work on. That being said, if there are lots of dormant accounts on lobsters, they are likely spam bots just waiting to be activated once the rules are deeply understood and there is something to gain, or be waiting until there are more than the mods could actively fight against because they lack the tools to do so (see: false sense of security). reply throw10920 4 hours agorootparentGiven your refusal to provide any evidence or counterexamples, the cop-out that \"there are probably actually lots of spam accounts of Lobsters that haven't activated yet\", and the extremely naive nature of your comment that ignores simple modifications that can be made to an invite system to nullify all of the flaws you claim it has, I don't think that you actually have any evidence whatsoever. It's pretty clear that invite trees provide actual value and the opposite of a \"false sense of security\". reply withinboredom 4 hours agorootparentI mean, I don't work on lobsters, I have no desire to be a member there. So why would I have any evidence to support my claim about a platform I give two shits about? I'm simply telling you how spammers work on OTHER platforms, quite successfully. Whether lobsters is immune to that or not, I don't know, nor do I care to know. If you think they are immune, then great (see: false sense of security). reply matheusmoreira 3 hours agorootparentprevIf you discover a spammer, ban their entire invite tree and probably the account who invited them as well. reply withinboredom 3 hours agorootparentI wish I could say more about how spammers work ... but this won't work like you think it will. You are assuming all the spammers are distributed among a single branch in the tree, and you'd only realize it wasn't working when you ban someone popular who obviously isn't a spammer and has the clout to do something about it. reply ChainOfFools 3 hours agorootparentI'm pretty sure they mean ban the invite tree below the branch of the spammer, not the entire tree that spammer is on. The chances of a false positive are much lower in the former case than in the latter. Users who actually believe in the site and understand how the mechanism works and appreciate the high snr that they've enjoyed, will be understanding for the most part even if they end up on the wrong side of one of these bans, and have to go through an appeal system to rejoin the site on some other trust tree which is much more closely monitored by its members than the one they were on before. Ensuring that future bans will be highly unlikely. reply withinboredom 2 hours agorootparentOut of curiousity, how is a scammer that has hundreds of thousands of actual real people under it handled? Are all of those hundreds of thousands of users banned as well? Not even talking about scammers, if someone near the root of the tree has a bad day and decides to take it out on the community (or simply gets hacked), it seems you could lose the entire community. reply matheusmoreira 2 hours agorootparent> Are all of those hundreds of thousands of users banned as well? Depends on whether you can trust them. If someone at the top of the invite tree gets hacked or starts shitposting, it doesn't really imply anything about the people they invited, they're all probably innocent users. If they turn out to be a spammer though? Then you can't trust anyone they invited. Any false positive should be handled on a case-by-case basis or reinvited by someone else who is trusted and is willing to vouch for them. reply matheusmoreira 3 hours agorootparentprevTrees are rooted somewhere. The problem is reduced to finding the root account which invited all the spammers and banning that account and its entire invite tree and the guy who invited that root account for good measure. This reduces the number of accounts that must be evaluated, making it much more manageable. Any false positives can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. Make accounts and invitations a limited resource. People will think twice before inviting someone who can get them banned. This reduces the problem to one of trust which is the foundation of real security. reply tcldr 11 hours agoprevDear Google, we were only adding ‘site:reddit.com’ or ‘site:news.ycombinator.com’ to search queries so we could get to opinions that weren’t being manipulated by SEO fiddlers.

I was a moderator of some very large subreddits, and due to reddits pigeonholing me into an app vs new mobile layout, I'm leaving those moderator positions (note: I am not complaining about the api issues). I don't want to participate in a community that is catering to the lowest common denominator such that the term \"redditquitte\" is a joke. I've thought long and hard about it, and I think companies are intentionally creating Eternal Septembers in their products, because it's just easier to just put big pictures on the homepage to get clicks, when that type of UX only invites the type of people who see the site as something only to consume and not to contribute to. I've been invited to multiple \"moderator feedback\" focus groups, that were worse than awful. After they defaulted an \"annoying look here\" icon in the right corner to try and get us to work more, I said \"fuck this, I'm out.\" My point here isn't just to bitch and moan, it's to point out that site:reddit.com only works because the community is one that actively values contribution over consumption... that's going away, and the usefulness of site:reddit.com will go away as that culture changes. reply akdaadensb 6 hours agorootparentReddit was enshitified circa 2014 or 2015, this is not a new thing. It's been garbage for a long time and I'm surprised it's taken so many this long to notice. In fairness if you kept to subreddits that were eminently unpopular and off the beaten path then it wasn't as obvious. I guess the mobile app was what really broke the camels back but the quality of the posts had been on a downward trend in a severe way since at least Obama's second term, when I think both political parties recognized it as important and began to manipulate it. This is made easier by the partitioning of the site into subreddits. I hopefully don't have to explain here why that makes automated sockpuppeting much more effective and easier to accomplish. It's a fundamental design flaw (if we were to assume the design of Reddit was intended at all to provide a space for authentic personal takes on real issues and by real humans).

Some banned youtube content completely. Some banned \"video memes\", some banned X and some banned Y... all of them had slightly different guidelines and you immediately got an insta-splurge from a bot-mod if you tried posting. Some required you to prefix every post subject with some code word.

I then watched his review on water purifiers having done my own research beforehand and while he does end up recommending a decent purifier there is so much more to purification than just what he measures (TDS). In the end his omission of other factors have led to a conclusion that isn't entirely accurate. (That Zerowater is the best because it filters TDS to 0). What about bacteria? Other filters that faired poorly in the TDS test focus more on that and then there are a few major brands that weren't even featured. What about clarify of water? He did touch upon this very briefly but did not go further into it. You would think that a TDS of 0 indicates the water is perfectly clean. This is wrong as TDS cannot measure everything that may be in the water. There is more to water purification but these are just two examples. All in all, I have been impressed by Todd's reviews but after watching this review where I actually had done some research into the topic before watching, I came away doubting all his other videos. What did I miss just because I am not a subject expert in the topic? I guess at the very least his videos likely eliminate the very worst products but I bet you people are buying whatever products he recommends without thinking about them and may be getting burned or not getting the best product for them. reply Mkengine 1 hour agorootparentSince you already did your research, what is your water purifier recommendation? reply nebula8804 27 minutes agorootparentDepends on what you want to optimize for. These are different suggestions based on assumptions of your situation. Assuming you have access to fairly decent tap water (Europe and US) I'd follow Todd's recommendation for Zerowater as thats what I daily drive. I used to rely on Brita but it does not do much...just slightly improve taste and remove the worst heavy metals. Running tests on my water, there are still traces of some impurities like bacteria and some metals after Zerowater filtering. I am also about to start testing the Aquatru system that he also recommends. For Zerowater the filters are quite expensive (15$ per filter) and I have been peeved at how they get used up quickly (I have around 200PPM in my tap water and they last 75-90 days) and still dont filter everything out fully...but subjectively I can't get over how I like the taste and since im not on the west coast im in the more lucky group where Zerowater is good enough. Maybe Todd was also in this situation? My family does not like it but I love it. It tastes like \"flat\" water and becomes filled with bubbles if let to sit out for a short time but its worth it because it \"feels\" so clean. Sorry if this observation is unscientific but once you have physically removed impurities, you still will have some semblance of subjectivity. I try to target distilled water taste as a point of reference and Zerowater comes close. I have worked on a system where I first filter out using a Brita filter and then run it through the Zerowater to help improve the results but the problem with this is that my water is not bad enough for the brita's simple activated charcoal to really help reduce so in my case it actually has ended up giving mixed results. If you lived in the west coast where the water is typically around 400ppm then you'd extend the life of the Zerowater filter quite a bit by doing this trick but for me, well I have to try something else. But at that point maybe the Aquatru is better which is why I am trying it. For me, the Aquatru is just for curious comparison as this whole journey is reaching nutjob levels for me at this point and im not elon musk levels of rich(these water tests are not cheap)...the Zerowater is good enough for my usage because I live in a suburb away from any industrial places/poorly managed municipality(no major pathogens, just correcting the taste/eliminating any traces of metals and dirt). In reality, Brita is probably fine but I want that taste of flat water now that I have gotten a craving for it. Every time I drink something else like Brita or bottled water it just tastes weird. In reality others have told me if one is to spend the dough on Aquatru, you might as well get a under sink reverse osmosis system installed. Takes up less room and is cheaper. I got a good deal on a open box unit so I decided to go that route. Sorry I dont have results yet. If you are concerned about pathogens that could make you sick, then it becomes tricky. I have traveled to Pakistan and lived in places there where the tap water makes you sick. I have relied on Grayl and based on my testing water and sending it out it seems to filter pathogens but unfortunately it is a massive pain to use. Do not rely on Zerowater/Aquatru for this as it will not help you. I am still in the search for an excellent under sink solution to eliminating pathogens + giving me the taste that I get with Zerowater. My ideal combination would be to have some sort of automatic Grayl + filtered afterwards with Zerowater. Beautiful tasting water but quite expensive. Might as well rely on water bottles at that point. Hope this helps a bit. reply crq-yml 3 hours agorootparentprevI have noticed the same issue with Todd's approach. He does a good job of establishing an experimental metric that allows apples-to-apples comparison, but he reviews so many categories of product that there is no way he could be capturing the whole story on all of them.

Would you be willing to consider the possibility of delisting the site with robots.txt? reply dang 2 hours agoparentHN has been under downward quality pressure for a long time. Figuring out how to withstand it has been the core idea all along: HN is an experiment. As a rule, a community site that becomes popular will decline in quality. Our hypothesis is that this is not inevitable—that by making a conscious effort to resist decline, we can keep it from happening. - https://news.ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html pg wrote that over 15 years ago. I've been saying for (a mere) 10 years that we're trying to stave off the arrow of internet entropy: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que... – not doable forever, no doubt, but doable for a while if we expend enough energy. Based on experience so far, the way to do this is through a combination of a dedicated community, software that does what software can, and moderation to bump the system out of its failure modes. Trying to hide from the outside world is mostly not the way. pg used to do tricks like Erlang Day on occasion, but having that as the main strategy would be like trying to avoid infection by never going outside. Far better is to have a robust immune system, if possible. Trying to avoid (resistible) pathogens weakens the immune system, and hiding HN from new users is a path to decrepitude. The latter is probably a greater threat IMO, and too easy for established users to discount. Spam, and its cousins like content marketing, could kill HN if it became orders of magnitude greater—but from my perspective, it isn't the hardest problem on HN. That's because of the dedicated community, which flags these things, reports them when they escape in the wild, and is vigilant about quality. Without such a community, HN would have died long ago. By far the harder problem, from my perspective, is low-quality comments, and I don't mean by bad actors—the community is pretty good about flagging and reporting those; I mean lame and/or mean comments by otherwise good users who don't intend to and don't realize they're doing that. There's an unholy dynamic between those and the upvote system, so worse comments often get upvoted more than better comments do—often enough to choke the threads with weeds. That's the high-order bit and what I spend more time worrying about—not Cassandra E Oakley and her trading system*, nor the latest startup voting ring and whatnot. If those ever become the high bit, we might be doomed, but we should see it happening long enough in advance to readjust. p.s. (@dang doesn't work - I only saw this by accident.

Can you elaborate on this a bit? I don't see why \"lame and/or mean comments by otherwise good users who don't intend to and don't realize they're doing that\" should have an \"unholy dynamic\" with the upvote system. (FWIW, what I have observed is that once a comment becomes established as the top comment in a thread -- and it doesn't take much for that to happen -- it is nearly impossible to dislodge it. That means that getting into a thread early is crucial for getting noticed. I've pretty much stopped commenting on threads that are older than an hour or two because I can be 99.9% certain that whatever I write will never been noticed no matter how good it might be. And FWIW2, the comment I'm responding to is 50 minutes old as I write this.) reply supriyo-biswas 1 hour agorootparentThe dynamic being referred to is that low quality comments in the form of memes, distasteful jokes, attacks on other people, and similar comments tend to get upvoted a lot as they provide some entertainment to the upvoter, but said upvoted comment is highly damaging to the community in the kind of tone it sets for the thread, as well as the example it sets for the future. People optimizing for this kind of low effort but highly upvoted comment is called “karma whoring” on some places. reply dang 1 hour agorootparentprevMost upvoting is reflexive rather than reflective [1], so posts which generate a quick response are more likely to get upvoted. I think that mostly happens when the reader has a rapid feeling response—could be indignation (how dare $THEY!), could be familarity (no way! I like $THING too!), could be a quick association from $Familiar-A to $Obvious-B [2], but whatever it is, it's likely to be something that doesn't take much processing. The reflective circuitry, which takes in new information, turns it over, and generates an unpredictable response, is much slower and harder to run. I suppose it's a bit like the difference between a sugar hit and eating nutritious food with fiber. The latter makes you feel better in the long run, but when it comes to mass dynamics, the sugar hit wins out every time. > once a comment becomes established as the top comment in a thread -- and it doesn't take much for that to happen -- it is nearly impossible to dislodge it Moderators downweight top subthreads that are generic or otherwise lame, and repeat this until the top subthread is no longer lame—if possible. The trouble is that this is an intensive manual process. Most likely the software needs to be adjusted as well. [1] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&sor...

It’s probably related to what dang wrote above about the “unholy dynamic” of low-content comments that trigger easy upvotes. I remember myself having written some (frankly) lightweight low-effort snark, see it end up at the top of the comments for a few hours, and then it went mysteriously halfway down the list even though the upvotes didn’t stop. To be clear, I think it’s a good thing the moderators do this kind of weighting, and the invisibility of comment upvote counts to non-authors is an important feature because it enables this. reply thinkingemote 54 minutes agorootparentprevI was browsing the archives of NH the other day and I noticed the quality of most comments to be the pretty much about the same. Similar proportion of off topic or just replying to the title style comments. The length of the comments seemed longer now compared to back in the day. There were a similar number of joke / pun / silly comments which didn't get upvoted. I think there were less lame/mean/snarky comments in the past. I didn't see as much flame. Would be great to see some actual data analysis. reply zamadatix 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it's not the growth of a community which really causes decline in quality but where the growth comes from. Folks that come because they saw a discussion link in a git message or startup conversation are likely to have very different interactions than folks that come from search engine or social media share.if 100k users showed up tomorrow from the former category would quality here really go down? I agree it probably doesn't make sense to try to block growth sources though. Just considering the perspective \"it's not effective to try to play whack a mole anyways\" already seems enough evidence of that alone. All this reminds me though I've been using the site too much lately and my interaction quality has gone down. Time for another short break :). Anyways reply supriyo-biswas 2 hours agorootparentprevOn that note, Discourse nudges you to do a tutorial on how to use their forum through the private messages from Discobot. I wonder if something like that which shows the kinds of comments that the community needs, along with the upvote limitations I’ve talked about elsewhere and privately messaged you about, may provide a sufficient mitigation to this concern and help users be better contributors in this forum. Also, stuff like Erlang day isn’t a bad idea: it is also a kind of nudge to remind the community about what kinds of discussions and comments to prioritize. reply defrost 2 hours agorootparentprev> p.s. @dang doesn't work blame those dang programmers! reply loveparade 1 hour agorootparentprevI disagree with the harder problem. I agree that the problem is low-quality comments, but not the lame or mean kind. When I see comments on a topic I happen to be an expert in it's obvious to me that the majority of them are misinformation or uninformed users. These people don't mean harm, they are legitimately misinformed or inexperienced. There typically are insightful comments as well, and often they are upvoted, but they have become the minority compared to the low quality comments. This ratio has steadily gotten worse over the past years. It's not as bad as reddit, but every pseudonymous community seem to suffer this problem as it's directly tied to trust and identity. There is very little to be gained from comments on HN anymore, I mostly come here for the links now since it's a decent source of news curation. reply dang 49 minutes agorootparentI think I'd include those under \"lame\". Misinformed comments aren't lame if they're curious and (therefore) open to correction, but when they are categorical statements (usually some form of denunciation or grandiose generalization), yeah that's lame. > This ratio has steadily gotten worse over the past years I'm not sure. Everything has always been getting worse, or feels like it has. You'd have to discount for this universal tendency to get an accurate reading of whether things have really gotten worse, and no one really knows how to do that, nor really wants to. It's more satisfying to feel the decline of civilization setting in as one ages. Yes, that's a grandiose generalization and therefore lame. Or, to flip it into a positive, you're more experienced and informed than you used to be, so more comments appear misinformed or inexperienced. reply supriyo-biswas 5 hours agoparentprevMentions do not work here, you should send an email to hn [at] ycombinator.com.

That's not possible or necessary. Not possible, because it simply isn't possible in the general case to differentiate real papers from scrapers, without using device attestation.

Not necessary, because scrapers for AI training data an entirely separate problem completely unrelated to marketing, and because robots.txt will serve to stop the majority of search engine indexing, which is all that we need. Actual blocking of engines isn't necessary, because all the big ones are well-behaved, and after they stop indexing HN, marketers won't care about HN for the purposes of SEO-related influence campaigns any more. reply wodenokoto 3 hours agorootparentprevWhile @‘s aren’t an implemented feature, dang has quite the ability to find them. reply dang 2 hours agorootparentIt's random.

So I always assumed not showing up was intentional, as in dang has been delisting it on purpose and blocking bots. Now that it's showing up, I kind of want it to go back the way it was. The only reason I read HN so much is because I have given it a high degree of trust, that even though I don't know most commenters, I can easily reason about content, find the sources, discover amazing tools and read from founders directly.

It seems likely that HN content would appear more regularly because it's one of few places left on the net that regular fresh discussion on recent topics is occurring with solid moderation. Community is hard. And requires moderation. And it's done here with great care. Don't worry about the spam, the fight is real but the problem is also very appreciated on the ground here by Dang and mods as you can tell. Keep it up. And meanwhile you can help by submitting quality content from regularly reliable sources, not upvoting dupes, contributing thoughtful discussion and keeping discussion focused/organized, as many of you do. reply kgbcia 11 hours agoprevWe need more sites like hackernews. X /twitter used to be that , but it's now overwhelmed with bots and SEO. The more boring you make a site (no colors, no images, no links) the better the defense against spammers. reply spartanatreyu 9 hours agoparentSlight disagree. \"More boring\" is a defence against spammers, but not the only the one. There's also: \"Take commercial incentives of the running company out of the picture.\" The most prominent example of that is Mastodon. It's software is opensourced, and it's most popular server instance: https://mastodon.social is run by a gGmbH non-profit. (It's hosting company runs it as a non-profit charity for the social good) Since it's developed in the open without financial incentives muddying up the experience, no advertisements are added and there aren't any algorithmic rankings to be gamed. And since it's also based on open source, it's easy to share content from other server instances (it's all ActivityPub protocol underneath), and it's also easy to block (defederate) server instances with trolls and other problematic users. ------------------------------ It's like how twitter was at the start, but better. If you want to try it out, you can make an account on any server then follow some developers in your languages/libraries/tooling of your choice. You'll also see what those maintainers are discussing in the open and get an idea of how your languages/libraries/tools are going to evolve in the next version, or even participate in their evolution. reply jerbear4328 9 hours agorootparentAnother important factor, imo, is size. Quality on platforms like Twitter, Reddit, HN, Mastodon is inversely proportional to their size. If a platform gets big enough, regardless of its motives or polish, there will be more incentive to game it. Platforms like HN and Mastodon are great because they are small. They cater more towards a smaller, more technical community, which it isn't worth it to game with spam or whatnot because they're small and more aware of this kind of manipulation. Smaller \"gems\" in bigger platforms (think a small, old subreddit) can be good for the same reason. I guess this advocates more for the small web, which I'm all for, but there's less money in that. I wonder what could practically what incentives could make the web smaller and more useful. reply spartanatreyu 7 hours agorootparentI don't see Mastodon getting worse by getting larger. You only see who you follow, and there's no like/karma/upvotes algorithm. Everything is sorted chronologically, and if anyone tries to \"game\" that by posting too much, they'd get unfollowed and/or banned. Mastodon is a nurtured cultivated twitter. Personally I follow the CSS/JS/TS community (for work), the gamedev community (for fun), and the space community (for passion) reply jerbear4328 1 hour agorootparentOh, I don't mean that scale is the only factor. Clearly, the structure of Mastodon is way better than the structure of Twitter. But, I'd bet that if Mastodon was as big as Twitter, if it was that juicy of a target, it would have way more spam than it does today. reply hollerith 8 hours agorootparentprevHN is not small and hasn't been for many years.

Ycombinator benefits if HN is the best place to discuss the creation of technology/software because it boosts their brand and gives their companies a communication and recruiting advantage; most other platforms are primarily interested in ad revenue and are only incentivized to provide a good experience to users as a factor in that equation. Defense against spammers/bots is a tough problem though. Having great moderators and users who are savvy and intolerant of bad content probably helps but I think it would only go so far on a large site.

    "originBody": "How I Taught The Iliad to Chinese Teenagers 30 May, 2021Tags:, Books and Literature, Education INTRODUCTION Several years ago I had the chance to lead two seminars with a group of high-performing Chinese high school seniors. Each seminar had between 20-35 kids; each of these students was a graduating senior enrolled in the international department of a prestigious high school in Beijing. The purpose of these seminars was twofold. First, they were designed to provide these students with an idea of what an American college course might be like and teach them the skills they need to succeed in such a course. Chinese students enrolled in American universities tend to face a few common challenges: they have little experience ‘participating’ in class discussions (and even less participating in class discussions in English), they are unfamiliar with conventions or the purpose of a standard English research essay (most, for example, have never heard the word ‘thesis’), and they are utterly at a loss when asked to cite their sources. The seminars were intended as a remedy for all of these problems. But I had a second goal in the design of each seminar. As this was the final course these students would take before they began their lives as adults in a foreign country, I wanted to make sure this course would be an opportunity for them to learn something they might use in the life they were about to begin. I wanted these to be classes that mattered. I crafted my seminars to that end. I called the first “The Good Life.” It was a high-school take on ethical philosophy. The highlight of that course was the requirement that students not only think and write about the ethical systems discussed in class; they also had to set aside a day every week to try and live the ethical system they were studying that week. The second seminar I named “War.” Seminar participants were required to watch or read poems, films, novels, personal accounts, essays, short stories, and epics—well, one epic—on the experience of war. These materials came from different times and places across the span of human civilization. Half of the seminar’s time, however, was spent on one work: The Iliad. When the seminar was over, many students reported to me that reading and discussing this one book was the highlight of the three years they spent in high school. This reading was popular enough that a small group of students who had taken the other seminar asked me to teach the Iliad section of the class to them privately over the summer. I have heard the opinion voiced that works like the Iliad are too daunting or too boring even for university students. I disagree. My experience teaching the Iliad proved to me that even high school students can find the epic engrossing. Most teenagers need help to get there, however. In this post I am going to outline how I taught the Iliad to a gaggle of Chinese teenagers. I am indebted to the many educators who have posted online the materials, methods, and lesson plans they use to teach the humanities. It would have been impossible for me to teach many of the history and literature classes that I did without the aid of this free material. This post is an attempt to ‘pay it forward.’ My hope is that future teachers will find this post as useful for their classes as I found the guides and lesson plans created by teachers who preceded me. For this reason I include links to all of the PDFs and powerpoints of the Iliad-related materials I used for this class. For this reason I will also frequently descend into the nitty-gritty of the various activities, assignments, and presentations that made the class work. Those not asked to teach may find these details overwhelming. If you are one of those people, do not feel obligated to read through the entire piece. I expect this post will be quite long before I finish it; I will not be offended if you only read the parts of most interest to you! TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION TABLE OF CONTENTS CAVEATS, PREPARATION, & TRANSLATION CHOICES GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY REACHING THE CYNICAL TEENAGER GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY TEACHING LARGE GROUPS OF CYNICAL TEENAGERS AT ONE TIME WEEK I-II: INTRODUCING THE ILIAD & ITS WORLD WEEK III-IV: FINDING MEANING IN MORTALITY WEEK V-VI: THE DESCENT & REDEMPTION OF ACHILLES APPENDIX: THE OTHER THINGS TAUGHT IN THE “WAR SEMINAR” CAVEATS, PREPARATION, & TRANSLATION CHOICES The circumstances in which I taught the Iliad were unique. These circumstances forced me to make some unusual choices in the content, presentation, and organization of the seminar. I was asked to create a ten week course. I would meet the students for five hours each week, but those five hours would be distributed among two blocks: a stretch of three 45 minute ‘periods’ on Tuesdays and a two period stretch on Thursdays. No class should ever be three periods long. I often had to adopt creative expedients to productively fill this time. As I never had a block less than 90 minutes long, the activities I developed tend towards the longer side. I am not sure how I would adapt them to fit in a more equally distributed schedule. Because I was teaching students who did not speak English as their mother tongue, I had to be particularly cognizant of the language I used and of the need to slowly and carefully define new terms. Some of the teaching methods I discuss in section #5 were especially useful in making sure all of my students, regardless of language ability, were on the same page. Despite their language hurdles, I suspect these students were an easier lot to teach than many of the classrooms readers of this post might face. As a rule Chinese students are more attentive and less rebellious than their American counterparts. Because these students were attached to the most competitive international school in Beijing, the majority of my students were very bright and very motivated. Many students were still overwhelmed by the pace of the class and the difficulty of its assignments. At a less selective school this curriculum may be a harder sell. I consider this course to be about the same difficulty of a one-semester AP course at a normal school or perhaps a senior year Honors course. I would not advise teaching this way to freshmen. If you are not willing to put an unusual amount of preparation into this course, I do not advise teaching it at all. It took me about a year to create this seminar. In that year I read two separate translations of the Iliad, as many articles on Homer as I could get my hands on, and several book-length studies about the Iliad and its age. I do not know if you need to go to that extreme. But I think it would be difficult to teach this course without some of the back ground reading that informs my approach. Two books were especially influential: Jonathan Shay’s Achilles in Vietnam and Caroline Alexander’s The War That Killed Achilles. I cannot overstate the excellence of either book. Both are fantastically readable. They are penetrating and beautiful. Buy them and read them. There are many translations of the Iliad. For my class, I used the Robert Fagles translation. I do not think this is the best translation of the epic. I would probably award that title to Caroline Alexander’s stunning 2016 translation of the Iliad, which achieves a rare combination of fidelity and fluency. The Fagles translation, in contrast, is decried by purists for its looser translation. I am willing to forgive Fagles for his wanderings. His translation is extremely readable yet still written in verse. If you have your students read it out loud, dramatically as possible, you will discover that it is as transporting as any other translation available in English. For students intimidated by the large size and imposing reputation of the Iliad it was important that we read the most accessible and fluid version of the poem. Fagles’ work meets that standard. For my students there was an additional benefit: they were required to purchase their own books. The Fagles translation is cheap and widely available, even in China. You will notice that I do not read every page of the Iliad with my students. About 280 pages (out of 540) are read as homework; a few other important passages are read together in class. This is about two thirds of the total. Why not read the entire thing? First off, the Iliad contains several episodes peripheral to the main plot, not closely tied to the central themes of the work as a whole, or that seem repetitive and monotonous in comparison to what came before. As a teacher, you should read these parts in preparation for the course. It is not necessary for high school students to do the same. As a general rule, no unit in a high school literature course should last longer than five or six weeks. Anything longer than this tends to push students to desperation and boredom. You could try and get around this by packing more of the epic into a smaller amount of time. I believe that approach is unreasonable. It will be overwhelming for students who may already feel overwhelmed. It will also impact your pedagogy. You will be forced to cover more with less. With an epic as profound as this one, your students deserve something more focused and fine grained. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY REACHING THE CYNICAL TEENAGER The reasons you give teenagers for forcing them through hundreds of pages of epic poetry matter. I feel strongly that the ‘why’ for reading a work like this is more important than the ‘how’ of teaching it. In many ways your answers to the first question will shape your approach to the second. Over the last few years a debate has been raging among both educators and classicists regarding what place, if any, the “classics” should have in modern education, for what purpose they should be taught, and how best to teach them. I come to this debate from an unusual perspective: someone tasked with getting zonked-out Chinese teenagers to care about a book most of them assume they could never possibly finish. Chinese students live in a social world that is quite alien to the culture wars that divide the Anglosphere and which underlay many of the debates we have about how to teach the classics. They don’t have a dog in that fight. Because of this I found teaching them to be a clarifying experience. Those who defend and those who attack the classics tend to focus their fire on the role the classics play, for good or ill, as the foundation stone of Western high culture. This context is entirely irrelevant to the Chinese teenager. The Western tradition is not their tradition. They have no special reason to adore or revile it. They must approach a work like the Iliad on its own terms and for its own sake. If it means anything to them, it is as a human story, not a Western one. Why, my Chinese students asked, will we read this? Because you need to prepare for American university classes, I replied. But more importantly: because this book might just change your life! I said this without apology or awkwardness. I believed it! Ultimately, if a great work of history and literature does not have the potential to change a student’s life, to shape their character or transform their worldview, there is no point in teaching it! Most students believe this themselves. They can tell whether you believe the books you are assigning are that important. If you do not believe the works you are assigning matter, students will not think they matter either. I presented the Iliad as a meditation on universal problems of the human condition. My students read it as such. Most students hunger for work that has real meaning. If they must study, they would prefer to study something that matters. They want to matter themselves. That is the second key to reaching cynical teenagers: they must be treated like men and women whose decisions and opinions matter. I was eager to learn from their observations and opinions. I genuinely believe I have as much to learn from my classes as they do from me. I was insistent that the books we read had great moral significance, but it was not my part to force ‘morals of the story’ down my student’s throats. Teenagers rarely respond well to blunt didactics. My role was to provide sufficient historical or literary background so that students could understand works like the Iliad, and then push them to wrestle with the questions these texts posed. The conclusions they developed were their own. Students were eager to tell me of these conclusions because they believed (rightly) that I valued their insights and experiences. My classes were demanding; I was delighted to discover that students made memes parodying how difficult my classes were. Yet my electives were always full. I can chalk some of this up to an entertaining presentation style, but I attribute it mostly to my attitude towards my students. Taking students seriously means setting high expectations for their work. This is the harder path: requiring more of students means investing more time and effort into their growth. My approach towards essay assignments illustrates how I operationalize this principle. Every essay I receive is graded with a terrible harshness. Almost no one gets an A on the first try. But all students are given a second try. I return their essays with dozens of comments in the margins, a graded rubric, and a paragraph of instructions on how they should improve their work. Students can accept the grade they are given, or they can rewrite their essay for higher credit. This process requires double the work on my part, but it makes the students better writers. Teach things that matter. Believe your students matter. Set high standards, but invest the time to ensure your students can meet the standards you set. Forgive me if these three injunctions sound trite! Perhaps they are trite. But they worked wonders for me, and have become the core of my teaching philosophy. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON SUCCESSFULLY TEACHING LARGE GROUPS OF CYNICAL TEENAGERS AT ONE TIME On engaging teaching methods I am a believer in tables. I have taught students in neatly ordered rows. I have taught them in large circles. I have taught students in lecture halls with desks lined up on both sides of the room. I have taught them on walking tours. Nothing has been more effective than small group tables. Teaching becomes magically easier when you can arrange desks into tables of four to six students. I have suspicions for why this is so, but no doubt that it is so. When a teacher complains to me that he or she has difficulty getting students to focus, my first question is always “have you arranged their desks into tables?” The wonderful thing about tables is the sort of learning activities that naturally flow from them. If, as was true in my case, you must teach in 80 to 120 minute blocks, then a lecture oriented pedagogy is simply untenable. While the common claim that humans only have an attention span of 15-20 minutes is not actually supported by the psychological literature, I personally found that if I did not break lectures up with small activities every fifteen minutes or so, I was in for trouble. The benefit of small group tables is that they provide an easy and natural way to “break up” the lectures. In its simplest form, this requires nothing more than asking the class a question. Instead of directly telling the class (and the teacher) their answers, I will give students three to six minutes to discuss the question with the students at their table instead. This can easily be transformed into a more complex activity: students from different tables can be given different passages to read and summarize, they can be asked to develop counter-points to ideas that either I, a reading, or another table has put forward, or they can be asked to relate a topic or a reading to something earlier in the course, pop culture, or their life experience. The possibilities are endless. In all cases I would conclude the activity by spending three to four minutes by picking on one individual from each table to summarize what their group came up with. Here is why this works: Students learn better when they are forced to actively wrestle with the concepts presented. This is widely recognized, but often poorly implemented. Many teachers assume that simply asking questions to the class at large is sufficient for this purpose. But there are problems with this approach. If you really believe that forcing a student to articulate their opinion will help them remember and use class material, then simply asking the class a question and picking on a few students to answer it cannot accomplish your objective. You have created a learning activity that only a few students actually engaged in! Even if you go out of your way to ignore attention-seeking hand-waivers by picking on class introverts, you are left with a method that benefits the few at the expense of the many. The question-group discussion-answer format opens the activity up to dozens more students but takes only a little bit more of your class time. This sort of activity is also useful for ensuring that slower students are not left behind. Students are vigilant creatures, living in constant fear that their stupidity will be exposed in front of their peers. Those who most need to slow down and ask “why?” loathe most to do it. Small groups discussions help immensely with this problem. Students are almost always more willing to admit confusion to four or five friends than they are to the entire class; even if they are not, they benefit from hearing the explanations of the other students in their group. Likewise, if all of the students in a group are confused, they are far more likely to tell you this when they can say “my entire group doesn’t understand…” instead of “I don’t understand…” This is especially true for ESL students. ESL students often do comprehend what is being asked of them, but are nervous about their ability to articulate their thoughts in English. By asking them to first share their thoughts with a small group (or barring that, a partner) they are given a free “practice run” expressing their ideas in English. This method was something of a lucky charm for coaxing reticent Chinese students into class participation: the more opportunities students had to articulate their position out loud before being asked to articulate it to the entire class, the happier they were to do it. Something similar can be said for questions controversial enough that most students are chary about staking a position in public. Finally, because group discussions give students more time to think through their answers, the answers they come up with tend to be more thoughtful than what they might have said had you called on them to give an impromptu performance. Of course, not every question that I throw at a class uses the question-group discussion-selected answers format. But it is one of the central tools I used in making otherwise foreboding books like the Iliad approachable to teenagers. I found the tool so useful, in fact, that I integrated it into the daily routine. After class announcements and a short reading quiz, I would give every group three minutes to discuss amongst themselves if they had any questions or points of confusion about the reading from the night before. Each group was required to produce at least one question (but no more than one) to ask me. If the lecture or class activity of that day (or of some other day that week) would answer their query, I told them hold on to it. I would then explicitly cite their question when I came to it in the course of my lecture. Otherwise, I would spend two to three minutes attempting an answer then and there. This whole process would usually take no more than eight minutes. It was time well spent—not only for the students, who had their questions answered, but also for me. I was sometimes surprised by the things students focused on; often the passages they found difficult or mysterious were completely different from what I expected. This sort of feedback made me a sharper teacher and gradually helped me develop better class materials as well. And it is all because of tables. On getting students to do the readings Students are more likely to “do the readings” if the readings are engaging, of course, but this is an imperfect solution. Students are busy. If they can pass a class without reading anything you have assigned them, they will. If they can pass a class by cramming everything you have assigned them to read in the week before the final, they will try that too. The number of students capable of such feats is far smaller than the number of students who think themselves capable of such feats. The challenge of the teacher is to gently convince them otherwise. This problem is even more critical in a class like this one, which is discussion based and therefore dependent on students having actually done the reading. My personal solution to this problem is the three-minute reading quiz. At the beginning of every class, as soon as the bell has sounded, I launch into a reading quiz. I create these quizzes the night before giving them; each is five questions long. The questions are simple, factual questions with three important features: 1) They are not open to interpretation or argument 2) The questions are easy to answer, if one has actually done the reading 3) Their answers would be difficult to answer if one had only read the Sparknotes version of the book in question. As it would take far too much time to grade a quiz for every student during every class period, I have the students grade each others’ quizzes. This is done just after the students have taken the quiz; once everyone has finished their quiz, they exchange their quiz with a neighbor, who marks off the score of the quiz as I tell the class the answers to each question. All told this process takes about 5 minutes of class time. This is time well spent: like leaven in bread, elevates the remainder of the time we spend together. It also provides a strong incentive for students to arrive on time. I do not give the quizzes to students who were absent; instead, I have a policy of “dropping” the two lowest quiz scores from every student’s grade, which allows them two absences without consequence. On formal seminar discussions When I surveyed American university professors in 2017 about the gaps that separated their Chinese students from their American ones, they regularly identified two problem areas: Chinese students had difficulty participating in class discussions, and Chinese students did not know how to write a research essay. To work on the first of these problems, I made formal “seminar discussions” a regular feature of my courses. Generally speaking, we would do one seminar discussion every three weeks. Most books would get one seminar each; the Iliad had two. To prepare for the seminar I required students to complete a “seminar preparation paper.” In this short paper, the student would type out two quotations from the reading that they found meaningful, interesting, or mysterious. They would include a Chicago-style citation for their chosen passages, and would also write a short paragraph explaining why they chose each of their passages. In addition, they were required to write three questions “that you would ask the seminar participants to ponder if you were the official seminar leaders for this round.” All of this might seem like busywork, but it assured that students came prepared to participate. For the seminar itself, I had the students arrange the desks in two concentric circles, each with about 15 students in it. In my mind the ideal discussion group is 12-15 students; anything more than 20 means that individual students do not have enough opportunities to pose questions and give their opinions. My solution to this problem is suboptimal: I divide the students into two groups, with those in the outer circle filling out a work-sheet that tracks the discussion being had by the students in the inner circle. At the halfway point I then have students switch from participants to observers. The benefit of this approach is that is allows all students to participate in a smaller group discussion; the cost is that students spend half of their time discretely checking their phones instead of participating. In some classes I led these discussions myself; in others I assigned students to do it. I honestly did not see a great difference in the quality of the seminars either way. Students must know that they are being graded on their participation in the seminars. They must come prepared with a seminar preparation paper. If they meet these two requirements, seminars are usually powerful experiences. WEEK I-II: INTRODUCING THE ILIAD & ITS WORLD Class I: “Among the Deathless Gods:” The Mythic World of Ancient Greece Power Point Slides: The Greek Mythic World Handout: Iliad Important Names Glossary; Destiny of Achilles; Scholarly Takes: Honor Cultures. I begin class with a gloriously booming, melodramatic recitation of the Iliad’s opening stanza (“Rage! Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus son Achilles! Murderous, doomed…”). This unexpected performance never fails to arrest the student’s attention. I then tell the students, without somewhat less melodrama, that they just heard the words that began Western civilization. The Western tradition begins with a world at war. But this story is more than a tale of ancient combat: it is a meditation on the meaning of life. It asks us to ponder the reality of death, the nature of fame, and the demands of duty. It touches the heart of all who take it seriously. But to understand this epic the students must be familiar with the mythological over-story that it fits into. The powerpoint slides are arranged to cover this material. First the gods: Zeus, Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, and Thetis. Then some key individuals: Achilles, Menelaus, Agamemnon, Helen, and Paris. With these names a few key events are narrated: Zeus dethroning his father, the prophecy that Thetis’ son would be greater than his father, the marriage of Helen, the trial of Paris, the sack of Troy. This lecture is more of an info-dump than most classes will be. In my presentation I introduce a few themes that we will return to as the class goes on: the arbitrary nature of Zeus’ power, the significance of the prophecies surrounding Achilles’s fate, the curse on the Atrides, and the fact that Achilles was not part of Helen’s wedding pact and thus was one of the few leaders not obligated by covenant to be at Troy. I also emphasize that the hearers of the Iliad knew how the story would end already. They knew going in who would live and would who die, what would happen to Hector’s Troy. So what is the purpose of the Iliad? I ask my students to imagine a world without writing, where knowledge must be passed on through memorization and recitation. What would they choose to cram inside their minds to pass on to the next generation? They have in their hands the answer generations of Greeks gave to that question. The Homeric poets receive from their oral tradition a legend of a ten year war. But the Iliad is only two weeks of that ten years. What is it about these two weeks that were so significant to the ancient Greeks that they would spin a 600 page epic out of it? Why would their audiences gladly spend hours listening to the bards recite its episodes—even though this audience knew exactly how the stories would end? I do not answer these questions. But I pose them to the students and challenge them to try and develop out their own answers to them by the time this unit is complete. Writing Homework: “Know Your Greek Gods” worksheet. This is to be filled out at home; students are free to use any resource they want to complete the assignment, including Wikipedia. The purpose is to drill the names of these gods into their heads. Reading Homework: Iliad, Book I (pp. 77-98); “Scholarly Takes: Honor Cultures” Warn students that they will be quizzed on both of these readings. Class II: “The Best of the Achaeans”: Achilles, Agamemnon, and the Greek Culture of Honor Power Point Slides: Honor Cultures Handouts: Scholarly Takes: Achilles’ Showdown with the King Begin with a reading quiz, and then open the class up to questions. Answer questions about Apollo directly. Questions about the conflict between Agamemnon and Achilles can be held off, as they will likely be addressed in the lecture itself. Observe that the Iliad is about the anger of Achilles and its consequences. This anger might strike students as childish, silly, or alien. It seems like these two fully grown warriors react to challenges a bit like toddlers. They are part of what we call an “honor culture.” That culture seems removed from us, but it may not be as distant from our life as 21st century sophisticates would like to think. At this point I will have the class watch this scene from the TV series Louie. Ask the class if Louie did the right thing. If most say yes, summarize what happens next in the scene (the woman on a date with Louie rejects him for being something of an unmanly nerd). Does this change how they think about the scene? Given all of this, how many of the students would have done just what Louie did? What else could he have done? Can you understand why he might have chosen to react very differently—perhaps more aggressively?—than he actually did? The class should have a good 5-8 minutes to discuss this question. Once students have had the chance to air their views, I ask them to turn to page 83 of the Iliad. Start at line 221 (“He broke off and anguish gripped…”) and read together out loud until line 240 (“pay for his arrogance with his life”) on page 84. This is the scene where Achilles contemplates lashing out and killing Agamemnon to avenge the insult given to him. Ask: what are they really arguing over? Is this similar to or different from the Louie scene we just watched? Note that Louie comes from a very different world than Achilles does. But there are places in the modern world where people must live by the logic of honor. Ask a student to read this quote from Ta-Nehisi Coates about his youth: “Respect and reputation are everything there. These values are often denigrated by people who have never been punched in the face. But when you live around violence there is no opting out. A reputation for meeting violence with violence is a shield.” Ask students what Coates means when he describes as a “shield.” But unlike a real shield, a reputation is not a tangible thing. How do you maintain it? How do you know your shield is strong enough? Now ask them to consider this quote from Thomas Hobbes: “Glory is like honour; if all men have it no man hath it, for they consist in comparison and precellence .” For honor to be meaningful, it must be limited. It is something only some can have—something that must be competed for. Ask them to read the passage labeled ‘One irony of honor’ on the “Achilles Showdown” handout. I give the tables several minutes to try and restate the authors’ main point in their own words. Miller’s essential point: honor is a public thing. You only have honor if others think you do. And who those ‘others’ are really matters—real honor comes from having someone else of high status acknowledge your achievements. I usually give my (Chinese) students this example: imagine that they are complimented for having excellent English by their grandmother (who is almost certainly an old Chinese lady who doesn’t speak a word of it) vs. a younger Chinese who just obtained a PhD from Harvard. Which compliment would mean more to them? Why? But this process also works in reverse: if other people can give you honor, then other people can take it away. Achilles and Agamemnon both believe the other is trying to strip them of the honor that they deserve. Show them the insult-wrath-revenge slide, and remind them that they read about this cycle as part of their homework. Most of this epic records the wrath-revenge part of the cycle—but to understand this story we need to have a strong understanding of the insult part. That is what the next assignment is for. At this point hand out the “Achilles vs. Agamemnon worksheet.” Ideally you should have ten to fifteen minutes for them to work on this assignment in class, with the rest to finish as homework. The worksheet asks them to closely reread much of Book I and restate what is happening—especially what is being argued over—in their own words. It is designed to force their attention on some of the aspects of the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon that are not immediately obvious (for example, the significance of Achilles’ decision to smash to scepter of Agamemnon to pieces). I tend to grade this assignment lightly—as long as students turn something half coherent in, I will give them full points. They will need those points later on in the semester. Writing Homework: Achilles vs. Agamemnon worksheet Reading Homework: Iliad, Book II.1-572 (pp. 99-115), Class III: “The Honors Dealt a King”: Ruling Gods and Men Power Point Slides: Honor Cultures Handouts: A Memory from the Vietnam War: Themis Destroyed; Scholarly Takes: An Explanation of Themis Start class with a reading quiz and a question session, like always. Begin the lecture with an observation: we see two kings at work in Book I and II: Agamemnon and Zeus. This juxtaposition is not a coincidence. We see both Zeus and Agamemnon because the Homeric poet wants us to notice something important about each. So here is a question to ponder: how does Zeus’ leadership work? To answer the question, split the class into three parts. Give each part one of these sections from the Iliad: Book I, lines 673-697 (pg. 96-97) Book VIII, lines 1-37 (pg. 231-231). Book XV, lines 18-59 (pg. 388-389). Ask the students first to read the sections by themselves, then discuss the sections with their tables. Each table is to be prepared to 1) Summarize what they read to the entire class 2) Explain what Zeus’ authority rests on, as seen in that section. When all of the students have done this and announced their results to the class, they will discover a common theme: Zeus is obeyed by the other gods because they are afraid of him. They consent to his rule because they must. He is simply more powerful than they. The source of Zeus’s authority is force and fear. Move to the next slide, which asks: Is the authority that Zeus has over his fellow Olympians the same as that which Agamemnon has over the Greeks? If not, what makes human leadership different from the Olympian version? Have the students discuss this first in small groups, then as a class. Things the class may discuss: why does the majority pay homage to Agamemnon? In what ways is Agamemnon’s leadership style similar to Zeus’s? Why does it get different results? What are Agamemnon’s largest flaws as a leader? Would they be considered flaws on Olympus? Transition to a discussion of the Greek word Themis, central to the Greek understanding of leadership and group cohesion. Read together the “An Army is a Moral Construct” passage on the themis handout. To give Chinese students a more concrete idea of what themis means, I give them an example they are familiar with from other classes: Confucius’ statement that a kingdom is governed well when “a father fathers, a son acts as a son, a minister acts as a minister, and lord acts as a lord.” We then proceed to read the second hand-out that contains an excerpt from Jonathan Shay’s Achilles in Vietnam. This passage describes an incident that destroys the sense of themis held by an American soldier who was accidentally involved in a war atrocity. (You may have to provide some additional context about the Vietnam War for this story to make sense to students). Ask: what do you think was the themis of the Greek army? What might it mean to a warrior like Achilles to see this themis broken? Writing Homework: None. Reading Homework: Iliad, Book II.1-572, 897-980; Book III (pp. 99-115, 124-144). Class IV: “Cities That I Love Best of All:” An Introduction to Homeric History Power Point Slides: Homeric History Handouts: Homeric Characters Worksheet Start class with a reading quiz and a question session, as is usual. I begin the class with an overview of “Homeric question,” briefly relating both the traditional story of Homer’s origins and Milman Perry’s discoveries in Serbia on the nature of epic poetry. The work of Perry and subsequent scholars suggests that the Iliad was child of many voices, the end product of centuries of oral transmission. Its final form was probably secured in the 700-600s BC, and most of the technology, art, and so forth described in the poem matches the archeology of this period. But hidden in the Iliad are remnants of an earlier era. The third slide of this presentation includes an image of a boar tusk helmet dug up from a 14th century BC archaeological site and a passage from the Iliad describing this same sort of helmet. Its appearance in the narrative would be something like a galleon from the Spanish Armada appearing in a World War II drama. What do we know about that Greece, Greece as it was during the supposed years of the Trojan War, the Greece where noble warriors wore boar-tusk helmets? I spend about 15 minutes outlining what we know about Mycenaean civilization through archaeological discoveries: the grandeur of their palaces, how they fought, their role in an entire ecosystem of Near Eastern civilizations. But most of all I focus on the mystery of their fall, the “Bronze Age Collapse” that littered the Greek isles with Mycenaean ruins, ruins that would have towered over the humble abodes of “Dark Age” Greece (pictures of Dark Age archaeological finds are included in the slides to drive home this point). I then have students read Book IV.35-62. Here Hera declares that in exchange for the destruction of Troy, she will allow Zeus to destroy Argos, Sparta, and Mycenae without complaint. These three cities were devastated in the Bronze Age collapse. This gives us another way to think about the Iliad. Post-apocalyptic fiction is a popular genre with high schoolers. But if you actually lived in a post-apocalyptic setting… what would your fiction be about? Homer’s Greeks lived in the ruins of a golden age. They had forgotten how to write and read, but they still remembered a time when the Aegean was full of great cities, wealthy kings, and enormous armies. The Iliad portrayed that golden world as it was imagined hundreds of years later—and explained why this golden age was no more. It is a true piece of post-apocalyptic fiction. For the second hour of this class, I have the students divide up into small groups of five to six each for a group project: the “Homeric Characters” assignment. The assignment handout explains the details of this assignment sufficiently, so I will not describe it at length here. Students will not be able to complete this assignment before the class period ends, but they will be able to coordinate how they will divide up the labor and will be able to ask any questions they have about the passages they have been assigned. This is a two-purpose assignment: first, it calls attention to Homer’s skill at effective characterization in miniature scenes (many of which we will not otherwise read) and teaches the students to read this text with the careful attention the Iliad deserves. Secondly, it gives students a strong sense of the “who’s who” of the story. As we often skip several books between readings, a strong familiarity with the character of Homer’s characters is helpful. Homework Reading: Iliad Book IV (pp. 145-164) Writing Homework: Homeric Characters Worksheet Class V: “Where Men Win Glory”: Understanding Ancient Battle Power Point Slides: Ancient Warfare Handouts: Start class with a reading quiz and a question session, like always. They have just read Book IV, which is the first book of the Iliad that includes scenes of pitched battle. I remind the students that this is only one of a dozen books devoted to this topic. Today’s class is devoted to understanding the logic of Homeric battle. I start by having the students read a short passage from a battle scene later on in the Iliad (Book XI, lines 253-309; pp. 303-5). This short passage is not relevant to the broader plot of the epic; in fact, in our homework reading we will skip Book XI altogether. One of the characters involved in this battle scene we know: his adversaries, the brothers Iphidamas and Coon, will be unfamiliar to us. They do not appear outside these three pages. I give the students several minutes to read this passage, then ask them to discuss in their tables the following questions: What sticks out most to you in this passage? Is there anything unexpected about the way Homer describes these warriors or their fighting? What does this scene have in common with the battle scenes you read in Book IV? Students often identify the lines that Homer spends narrating Iphidamas’ courtship as an unusual inclusion: isn’t this supposed to be an action scene? Why this aside? This is a standard Homeric trick. A new character, one who will almost always be killed a few lines after he appears, is introduced with a vignette from his past life in times of peace. Imagine, I say, the following scenario: you boot up a game like Call of Duty. But just before your bullet kills one of your enemies, the action suddenly pauses. You now have to play through a short visual novel, where you see the childhood or the wedding of the NPC you are fighting. Just when the scene ends, you return to the battle, your foe dead at your feet. What would it feel like to play that game? Why does Homer force us through an analogous narrative trip every time one of our heroes gets into a fight? Just as significant: Homer gives this honor to both the Greeks and the Trojans. Homer was a Greek. All of these vignettes of Trojan domesticity, I told my Chinese students, would be as if the WWII dramas on Chinese television gave little domestic stories for each Japanese soldier the communists killed! There are two explanations for all of this. The first, and perhaps the more likely for students to articulate on their own, is that these scenes humanize the enemy and illustrate the tragedy of war. But this is not the entire story. Read with the students Book IV, lines 256-8. Homer calls battle the place “men win glory,” and it is for such glory Agamemnon joins battle. “Glory” is also why, at the beginning of Book IV, the Trojan warrior Lyacon breaks the truce and restarts the war. Emphasize that by recording the unique stories and names of otherwise interchangeable warriors, Homer is giving these warriors the renown they are fighting for. This is what battle means for the Homeric warrior—it is their chance to be remembered by the story tellers of the future. The rest of the class is devoted to how battle was fought in the Homeric age. (Much of the material for this section is drawn from Phillip Sabin’s journal article “The Face of Roman Battle;” see my post “Pre-modern Warfare Was Absolutely Terrifying” for a summary). As part of this presentation I show the first few minutes of the fight between Achilles and Hector in the 2004 film Troy (I cut the scene off before Hector’s death). How does this fight differ from those we have been reading in the Iliad? The answer is fairly obvious: action movies like Troy imagine fighting as an elaborate exchange of a dozen blows, parries, and counter attacks. In the Iliad combat is never like that. In the Book XI example which we began class with, Agamemnon is attacked by a spear thrust that fails to dent his armor. He pulls the spear aside and cuts down the man who speared him. That is it! There is no long exchange of blows. The action is almost always decided by the success or failure of the first thrust. This is how pre-modern conflict actually worked. To drill in this point I show the class a few clips from modern HEMA competitions. It is obvious from these clips that most duels were “settled” within a few seconds of being joined together. Melee battle were a series of four to seven second engagements, each of which could end your life. Understanding this, I tell the class, helps us understand the psychological impact that battle has on the Iliad’s characters. Ancient battles were not prolonged hackathons where a soldier on the front line meets warrior after warrior in an endless press. This was physically too tiring to have ever happened, but more important still, it was psychologically too demanding. Exposing yourself to multiple multi-second death matches was terrifying. And so few soldiers did this. In most ancient battlefields the majority of deaths come to an army in rout: the easiest people to kill are those running away. The goal of ancient war, then, was to terrify the enemy into flight. That required extreme bravery on the part of leaders (like the main characters of the Iliad), whose job was to either goad their terrified compatriots into a charge by rushing the enemy line themselves, or who instead would try to rush forward to stop the leaders of an enemy charge before their forces had built up momentum. If you read the Iliad carefully you will see the most battle scenes take place in this framework, with one side leading an onslaught, and the other side in flight. End the class by reminding students how much gumption it would take to play this role: leading a charge or counter-charge were acts of incredible, even super-human, bravery. Little wonder characters in the Iliad spend so much time goading each other into action! No surprise they see divinity as the source for the courage hand-to-hand combat demands! No wonder the Iliad exults in men who rush gladly into battle! We honor people who get into Harvard or who make a lot of money: the ancients honored those who did something far harder. Writing Homework: Reading Homework: Iliad, Book VI (pp. 195-214). WEEKS 3-4: FINDING MEANING IN MORTALITY Class VI: The Homeric Homefront Power Point Slides: Handouts: Start class with a reading quiz and a question session, like always. You are very likely to deal with some questions about Glaucus and Diomedes. I usually take a few moments to summarize what happened in Book V—the crazed rampage of Diomedes, where Diomedes become so enthralled that he attacks all around him indiscriminately, going so far as to attack the gods on the battlefield himself. What a contrast with his behavior in Book VI. If this moment of comity seems out of place in the carnage of the Iliad perhaps it is meant to suggest that even for the beserker, peace is an option. The rest of the class is spent considering two scenes: Hector’s meeting with Paris, and Hector’s meeting with Andromache. If time is available, we will read the first episode as a class (p. 206-208, lines 380-438). Questions I like to ask: Do you sympathize with Helen? What motivates Hector? What motivates Paris? Why is this scene included in the epic? We then will definitely read the scene where Hector meets with Andromache, one of the most stirring in the book. This is the central event of this class. I will usually assign somebody to be Hector, someone to be Andromache, and someone to be the narrator for this scene. I will pick out particularly exuberant students for this purpose. Together then we will read p. 208-212 (lines 462-600). I will repeatedly stop them as we go to ask questions to the class at large. I will begin by re-iterating something interesting first mentioned in last class: the Trojans are the Greek’s enemies. We now get a glimpse of the Greek’s enemies at home, with their children and wives. But there is something else for them to watch for: Andromache is not just lamenting the sadness of war—she offers Hector a choice. She claims that he does not need to go out to field of battle on the plains of Troy. I ask students to look for that suggestion (lines 510-520), be ready to summarize what it is, and what the main reasons she offers (lines 480-490; 508-512) for taking it. It is especially worthwhile to discuss her opening remark: “Reckless one, my Hector—your own fiery courage will destroy you!” (line 484). What does she mean by this? Lines 520-230 are Hector’s answer. Andromache never replies—do you think she finds his reasoning convincing? If time allows, it may be worth while to take the class back to Sarpedon’s rebuke of Hector on pg. 180 (lines 540-565) as context for Hector’s reasoning. Does his position as commander of the Trojan coalition demand that he lead the Trojan armies out to meet the Greeks? What might Hector fear will happen if he doesn’t? (Again, refer to page 180). What does Hector mean when he says he has “learned it all too well?” What has he learned, exactly? Why “too well?”” What does the class think of Hector’s digression on lines 534-555? What does it tell us about Hector’s priorities? In lines 566-574 he offers a prayer to Zeus for his son. What does he wish for? What does it mean to Hector for his son to be “first in glory?” Do you think being first in glory will actually bring “joy to his mother’s heart?” What do you think Andromache wishes for her son? Do you see the tension between his desires for his son and his decision to rejoin the battle? What do you think of Hector’s parting claim that fate “is born with us the day we are born?” Does Hector really believe this, or is he just saying this to comfort his wife? Do you think Andromache believes it? Would Hector behave differently if he believed something different? There are many different ideas and emotions present in these scenes, and students will be quick to catch a fair number of them. Multiple students remarked to me that this book was the first time they felt like they were dealing with “real humans.” But one of the important things happening in this chapter will likely escape student’s notice unless you explicitly point it out. We have spent the last two weeks discussing the Greek honor culture and its imperatives. Now we see that characters in the Iliad are starting to question these imperatives themselves. Andromache’s pleadings are a protest against the culture of glory and honor. In the next reading we will see these rather subtle pleadings morph into an all out assault. Writing Homework: Reading Homework: Iliad, Book IX (pp. 251-276). Class VII: Honor Upturned Power Point Slides: Handouts: Seminar Preparation Paper Guidelines; Start class with a reading quiz, but hold the questions to the end. Begin by reading the conversation between Sarpedon and Glaucus in Iliad XII.323-381 (pp. 334-335). Tell students that this passage is one of the most famous in the Iliad; it is a statement that explains why many of the warriors in the Iliad are fighting. Ask them to read it and then as a small group come up with a two sentence summary of why these two Trojans warriors agree to fight. Have each table share what they have written with the class. Suggest that this is about more than war—Sarpedon and Glaucus have articulated a philosophy of life. They recognize something we like to forget: you shall die. Every single one of us in this room will die, I tell the students. This is what makes us and the human characters of the Iliad different from the Olympians—the Olympians neither die, nor age. Time’s winged chariot does not press them on. But precisely because they live forever, the gods’ actions are of little consequence. Their conflicts never amount to anything more than another turn in an endless round of squabbles. But for us it is different. Our time on Earth is limited: how we spend that time matters. Every decision we make is pregnant with great meaning. Sarpedon and Glaucus’s response to this predicament is stirring. They look at the face of death and say: we shall die, so let us live for glory now before it is too late to do so! That is one way to face the closing of the day. In Book IX, Achilles suggests another. As a class we will read Achilles’ logic, starting with p. 261-263 (lines 373-419; “Royal son of Laertes….He’ll never win me over!”). Then read p. 264-265 (lines 450-505; “Go back and tell him…. come on me quickly”). Finally read p. 271-72 (lines 730-756; “But you, you wipe such thoughts… sail home or hold out here”). After you have read this back and forth, pose the following questions to the class: How is this Achilles different from the Achilles we met before? How is his philosophy different from that of Sarpedon and Glaucus? “The same honor waits for the coward and the brave. They both go down to death.” Why does Achilles bring this up? What is the relevance here to the request made by his friends? Why don’t Agamemnon’s gifts placate Achilles? Could anything placate Achilles? Is this just about the insult, or is there something more? In lines 497-505 Achilles says he has been offered a choice. Is this choice only offered to Achilles, or is it more general? If you had to translate this choice into our 21st century world, how would you do so? In line 741 Achilles declares that he does not need the honor of the Greek host, for his honor “lies in the great decree of Zeus.” What does Achilles mean by this? Homework Writing: Seminar Prep Paper #1 Homework Reading: Class VIII: Seminar #1 Power Point Slides: Handouts: This seminar discussion covers the entire Iliad up to Book IX. While the discussion ultimately will be driven by student questions and concerns, the most stimulating discussions I have experienced centered on the following questions: Do any of the characters in the Iliad deserve the epithet “hero?” Which ‘hero’ do you personally find most sympathetic? Why? Is ‘glory’ worth it? We have seen arguments presented on both sides of the question. Whose are the more convincing? Can we use the word ‘selfish’ to describe any of the main characters of the Iliad? Is Achilles’ decision to forsake battle a selfish one? Was Hector’s decision to join battle selfish? Or would it have been more selfish for him to stay within the walls with Andromache? How about Paris’ decision to stay with Helen instead of return immediately to battle? What aspect of the Iliad do you think is most relevant to modern day concerns? End the class by briefly summarizing what happens between book IX and book XVI, where the next reading begins. Homework Writing: Homework reading: Iliad, Book XVI, XVIII.1-546 (pp. 412-442; 467-483). Weeks 5-6: The Descent and Redemption of Achilles Class IX: “The Gods Are Hard To Handle:” What are the Homeric Gods Good For? Power Point Slides: Handouts: “Scholarly Takes: The Berserker State;” “What to Make of the Homeric Gods“ Begin this class with the usual quiz and question time. Questions will likely revolve around the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus. Answer these questions as they are asked, but hold off extended discussion of the question for the next lesson. This lesson is about the Homeric Gods. Print out six copies of the “What to Make of the Homeric Gods” handout. This handout includes six passages, each about a page long, written by various scholars of literature, psychology, or history. Each attempts a different interpretation of what the Homeric gods “mean.” Table #1 should receive six copies of passage #1, table #2 should receive six copies of passage #2, and so forth. Give students several minutes to digest the passage they have been given and discuss it among themselves. They need to choose someone who will be able to explain their table’s understanding of this passage to the entire class. They will not actually be explaining their passage to the entire class, however. Instead, each table must send all of their students except the chosen explainer to all of the other tables (ideally this means one student sent out to one table each). Once students have traveled to the new table, the chosen explainer will teach his or her roving guests about the ideas in the passage they have been given, and will end his or her presentation by giving the guests a copy of their passage. When this is done the roving students return to their tables. This process should take about ten minutes. Now every table should have a copy of every passage, as well as one student who has discussed the passage’s meaning before. For the next ten minutes each student will present what he or she has learned to her original table. By the time this ten minutes is over, ever student in the class will have heard the arguments of every scholar. At this point I usually ask the tables to vote on which interpretation they find most convincing. This activity may seem overly complicated to some teachers. I admit it sort of is. However, this is a useful sort of complexity. Simply asking students to read all of the passages by themselves leads to lower levels of comprehension; asking students to present to each other the scholars’ arguments puts pressure on them to carefully read and consider their ideas. Students also find this sort of activity a refreshing change of pace from normal lectures or close readings. I usually try to do one of these ‘roving table’ activities once a month or so (later on in the “War Literature” course I will repeat this activity with a series of WWI war poems). The last five-to-ten minutes should be spent counting vote tallies and discussing the merits and weaknesses of the various interpretations. If time allows I pull some examples from the last reading (regarding the story of Patroclus) to discuss as case studies, though usually the activity takes enough time to make this unnecessary. Homework Reading: Iliad, Book IXX, XX.403-end; XXI (pp. 488-503; 515-540); “Scholarly Takes: The Berserker State” Homework Writing: Class X: “You and I Alone:” Friendship, Loss, and Rage on the Battlefield Power Point Slides: Handouts: Iliad Essay Assignment Before class begins draw on the blackboard a series of concentric circles. Label the outer circle “mankind.” The next circle in, “The Argives.” The next circle in, “Friends-in-arms.” The final circle, “Patroclus and Achilles.” Last of all, in the very center of the circle, leave an unmarked dot. After the standard round of quizzing and questions, explain that in today’s class we return to Achilles. Achilles is not the same person he once was. In literature departments they would call Achilles a “dynamic” character. His personality and motives are changed by the events of the story. Ask the students to ponder this question (first in their table, later with the whole class): What motivates Achilles now? How is this different from the Achilles of Book IX? Book I? If none of the students brings it up, ask the class to open up to Book XXI.79-135 (“He ducked… drench the earth”). This is the scene where Achilles refuses to spare the life of Lycaon, the man who he had once taken captive before. In this speech Achilles says once “it warmed my heart a bit to spare some Trojans” but now “not a single Trojan flees his death.” Why? What has happened to Achilles? The obvious answer: Patroclus is dead. But why would this drive Achilles to barbarity? Tell the class that the diagram you have put up on the board is one way to conceptualize what has happened to Achilles. At some point in the past—say when Lycaon was taken captive—Achilles had affection for all mankind, respecting even those he fought. But war, by necessity, often forces those who fight it to view their enemies as alien, or somewhat less than human. Erase the outer circle. That still left Achilles with a large community of fellow soldiers, the army of the Argives. But his connection with this community was broken when Achilles was humiliated in the council of Book I. Erase the next circle. At this point Achilles still felt comradeship with the other commanders and close friends, who fought by his side for many years. But this comradeship now has conditions. Have the class read Book IX.748-750. What would cause Achilles to “hate” these old friends? Have a student read aloud Book XVI.113-119 (“Oh would to god… you and I alone!”). Note how Achilles puts the Argives on the same plane as the Trojans. Erase the next circle. Now the only circle left is the one labeled “Achilles and Patroclus.” And indeed, that is what our passage says (“You and I Alone!”). Achilles’ entire world has been reduced to his relationship with one man, the one comrade to have stayed loyal to him as the Greek ships burn. And now that man is dead. Erase the final circle. Have one of the students turn to page 502 and read lines 498-500 (“I am destined to die here…”). Remind students that this sentiment is the polar opposite of Achilles’ pronouncements in Book IX. The Achilles of Book IX said that nothing at Troy was worth dying for; the Achilles of Book XX says that nothing is worth living for. I then remind students of the handout they read for their homework, an excerpt from Jonathan Shay’s Achilles in Vietnam. He describes “devoid of fear” and “inattentive to own safety” as common characteristics of soldiers he treated that ‘went berserk’ in Vietnam. For the remainder of the class period, I have the students, as tables, search for other examples from the last few chapters (with page and line citations) that match Shay’s description. They write these down on a piece of paper and turn it in at the end of class. Homework Writing: Homework reading: Iliad, Book XII (pp. 541-559); Iliad Essay Assignment Class XI: “No Oaths Between Men and Lions:” Achilles Unleashed Power Point Slides: Achilles Unleashed Handouts: I usually begin this class (after the usual quizzes and questions) by asking for a few reactions to this chapter, one of the darkest in the Iliad. What did students feel as they read it? Last class we discussed how Achilles became progressively isolated from the society of mankind. With each step away from his community Achilles does not just lose touch with humanity—he loses some of his humanity. Turn to the slide that has the following set of readings. Have each table assign a different one of their members to read one of the following passages and report to the table what they read: Group I: Book 19. 246-256, 404-420 (p.495, 499-500) Group II: Book 19.427-436 (p. 500) Group III: Book 19.478-501 (p. 500-501) Group IV: Book 22.9-25 (p. 541-2) Group V: Book 22.406-410; (p. 553); Book 4.35-42 (p.146) The tables should be given about six minutes to read the passages and explain what they have read to each other. Ask the tables to discuss what these vignettes have in common. Most will draw the following connection: each depicts Achilles in suprahuman situations: eating the food of the gods, wearing god-given armor, challenging gods to battle, uttering god-like curses, and being forewarned by god-given prophecies. You may connect these incidents with other ones in the story (such as Achilles’ attack on the river). Tell the class that through passages like these the Homeric poet dramatizes Achilles alienation from mankind. Achilles is no longer portrayed as human, but as something else altogether—something more than a human (“godlike”), or something less than one. The latter is how Achilles sees himself. Turn to the slide with this quote from p. 550 of Book XXII: Hector, stop! You unforgivable, you… Don’t talk to me of pacts. There are no binding oaths between men and lions— Wolves and lambs can enjoy no meeting of minds— They are all bent on hating each other to the death. So with you and me. Ask the class: if there are no oaths between men and lions, which of these two is the man, and which is the lion? One way to think about the Iliad is that it tells the story of Achilles’ fall and redemption. Ask the class to open to Book 24. After briefly summarizing the contents of Book 23, read lines 1-21, where Achilles desecrates Hectors body. Even after killing Hector, Achilles rages on. He remains beyond the pale of humankind. But if vengeance could not salve Achilles’ soul, what could? How can Achilles become human again? That is the subject of the final book of the Iliad. Ask students to pay special attention to this question (and to scenes that show his return to humanity) as they read this book for their homework. I usually conclude this class by taking questions about the essay assignment handout that I gave students last class. This inevitably takes up a great deal of time, so it is best to keep the book discussion section of this class concise. Homework Writing: Seminar Prep Paper #2 Homework Reading: Iliad Book XIII.1-328; Book XIV (pp.559-568; 588-614). Class XII: Seminar #2 Power Point Slides: Handouts: I do not give a lecture on the final book of the Iliad. If properly prepared in the class before, most students pick out the things I would call their attention to without explicit direction on my part. Some of the more fruitful discussion questions I have seen in this seminar: Is the reconciliation of Priam and Achilles believable? Why does Achilles treat Priam so generously? Why does he return Hector’s body? Why does the Iliad focus on these two weeks of the war? Why does it start and end where it does? Would the story have been better if it included the Trojan horse, the sack of Troy, and all that? Now that you have read the entire epic: How strange do you find Homer’s characters? Are the emotions in this story universal, or particular to a specific time and place? Is the Iliad pro-war, anti-war, or something else? Does the Iliad have a message? If so, what is it? Homework Writing: Iliad Essay Homework Reading (if part of a larger “War” course): All Quiet on the Western Front Appendix: Other Works Read in the War Literature Class I won’t do a class by class breakdown of the rest of this course. However, I am happy to list the other books, poems, films, short stories, and essays we read in the class. I designed two units to follow the Iliad unit: “The Soldier’s Perspective” and “The Civilian’s Perspective.” My classes were nine weeks long; had I another three weeks I would have added a fourth unit titled “The Leader’s Perspective.” The material for that section remain tentative, but I likely would have watched the film Fog of War as a bridge and read the book Killer Angels as the centerpiece of the unit. Novel: Erich Maria Remarque, All is Quiet on the Western Front Poems: Rupert Brooke, “The Soldier“ Wilfred Owen, “Dulce et Decorum Est“ Siegfried Sassoon, “Dreamers” and “The Hero” John McRae, “In Flanders Field“ Marjorie Pickthall, “Marching Men” Charles H. Sorley, “When You See Millions of the Mouthless Dead” W.B. Yeats, “An Irishman Foresees His Death” Julian Grenfell, “Into Battle“ Essays: William Broyles Jr., “Why Men Love War” Virginia Woolf, “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid” Films: Korengal (dir.

    "commentBody": "I taught the Iliad to Chinese teenagers (2021) (scholars-stage.org)237 points by StefanBatory 16 hours agohidepastfavorite286 comments bane 4 hours agoThis is awesome. I can't believe how much pedagogical material is put forward here. Incredible stuff. All that being said, I think the larger concept is that one of the foundations of Western civ has found a way to be presented to Students and children of Eastern civ. What about the other way around? I know that in university I had to specifically seek out Eastern civ courses qualified for my major. 20+ years later I find them perpetually a source of knowledge and inspiration when trying to understand modern geopolitics. The Illiad, Beowolf, and other foundations of Western Civilization are no doubt important, but they are only part of the pantheon of modern global civilization for which classics like \"Journey to the West\" and the tales of the travels of Ibn Battuta are part of. These stories have provided an important framework I have enjoyed when I'm trying to interpret what's happening in the world, and have helped me numerous times in building bridges with my fellow humans from across my planet. Despite being a graduate of a world class Computer Science program, I am more proud that I know of the importance of Mansa Musa, Qin Shi Huang, Salah ad-Din, Shaka Zulu, and other global rulers were and the time spent considering the civilizations they came from. I can only imagine being a Chinese teen, learning about the Iliad for the first time. It would be like learning who Hanuman and other legendary Eastern Asian heroes are. I wish that these legends were taught to Western students as mandatory. I had to learn \"Foundations of Western Civ\" in school, but I would have found \"Foundations of Eastern Civ\" just as enlightening. reply Shawnj2 10 minutes agoparentNot the same as reading the source material but the youtube channel Overly Sarcastic Productions has great overviews/retellings of mythology/legends/ancient stories and they have a great ongoing series on Journey To The West and some decent one off eastern myths along with western stuff which they generally cover more. Especially since the source is in another language and a lot of it isn't super accessble to modern readers without being retold anyways I think it's great. reply p-e-w 2 hours agoparentprevI'd wager you will find far more Westerners who are familiar with (some of) the Eastern classics than the other way round. No idea how you would come to believe that the reverse is the case, or that correction is needed in that regard. In fact, I suspect that more people in the West have read the Tao Te Ching or The Art of War than the Iliad, by quite a margin (if only because of the difference in length). The former two are certainly much more common to see in bookstores than the latter. Also, I'm not sure whether Beowulf should be counted among the \"foundations of Western Civilization\". It's very rarely read outside the Anglosphere, and even there its importance is primarily linguistic. reply anthk 2 hours agorootparentThis. Beowulf has near nothing to do with the Western Civilization. The Anglosphere it's delusional, sorry. It's was all about either Greek or Roman legacy. Or maybe, Don Quixote, shaping up the Modern Western civilization by making fun on the old Medieval farts (Don Quixote) against the more pragmatical and non-brainwashed Enlightenment era common folk people (Sancho Panza). Even Lazarillo from Tormes has a more caustic and Western shaping anti-epic than Beowulf, as it depicts a cynical and treacherous society where even the old literal blind outsmarts the rogue kid. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarillo_de_Tormes reply rramadass 2 hours agoparentprev> I wish that these legends were taught to Western students as mandatory. Agreed. Due to colonial history, the entirety of \"Western Education\" has a decidedly \"European\" slant. \"Eastern Civilizations\" are covered only as much as they are \"Exotic\". But in this current day and age History needs to taught in a truly \"Global\" manner. reply YeGoblynQueenne 9 hours agoprev>> I have heard the opinion voiced that works like the Iliad are too daunting or too boring even for university students. I disagree. My experience teaching the Iliad proved to me that even high school students can find the epic engrossing. Most teenagers need help to get there, however. In this post I am going to outline how I taught the Iliad to a gaggle of Chinese teenagers. I grew up in Greece and we were taught the Iliad and the Odyssey at school. I didn't find them daunting. I liked reading them both, despite being extremely annoyed at the translation into Demotic Greek - a made-up, wooden language that nobody has ever spoken, nor will. I also couldn't stand the way the epics were taught, by literary \"analysis\" that bored every child out of their head. But I liked the Iliad because it was basically more of the epic battles in the songs and movies I liked at the time: I listented to a lot of epic Metal and Connan the Barbarian was my favourite movie (with a soundtrack by Basil Poledouris that could easily have been written for the Iliad). And I liked the Odyssey because it was like the fantasy books I read and the games I played: a big adventure, with many monsters encountered along the way where the hero lost companions, rather than Hit Points, I guess. All this came natural to me. I needed no \"help to get there\". I probably very much didn't get to any place a literature professor would want me to get. I decided that Achilles is a bloodthirsty assshole and fuck him and his μήνις, whereas Odysseus was a smart guy, an engineer, but one with a heart who guided him home, one of my childhood heroes [1]. But I think the ancient bards [2] would have been happy. They would have found the literary analysis boring and preferred the spontaneous enjoyment of a young child to a thousand eloquent analyses about the cultural value of their epics. What cultural value does an epic have, with monsters and warriors, if it can't get a teenager to be interested in it? ____________ [1] Together with Socrates and, er, Alexander. The Great - great butcher. What was I thinking? [2] Yeah, I mean the people we collectively call \"Homer\". reply pyuser583 6 hours agoparentOne reason I love the Iliad is that the closer you look, the more of a paradox it becomes. For example, in parts of Iliad bronze is given as a valuable gift. In other parts, it’s thrown away on the heads of spears and arrows. So was it composed before or after the fall of the Bronze Age? Likewise, some wedding have dowries, others have bride-prices. You can’t have both! But Homer has no problem going back and forth. It’s almost like Homers trying to confuse future historians. There’s actually a thesis that the Iliad was intended to be heard by clubs of war veterans on public holidays. The veterans would get the inside jokes, but the civilians would miss them. reply PeterisP 2 hours agorootparent> For example, in parts of Iliad bronze is given as a valuable gift. In other parts, it’s thrown away on the heads of spears and arrows. So was it composed before or after the fall of the Bronze Age? I'm confused by what paradox do you see there - the most useful metal you can get always gets put on spears and arrows, it's not \"throwing things away\", it's the most important usage for high quality metal, and it is a valuable gift exactly because it allows you to make more or better spearheads and arrowheads. What would they be saving for otherwise? Shovels are important, but your spear is literally a matter of life and death and does get priority. Also, it's not generally destroyed or discarded, all the valuable stuff does get picked up from battlefield afterwards. reply hnbad 1 hour agorootparentFor a modern analogy: we treat gold as a luxury good we convert into prized jewelry and yet we use it to make disposable technology we carelessly throw away once no longer fit for use. And although of course the amounts of precious metals in modern hardware are minute compared to that in luxury jewelry, we still send that hardware scrap over to underdeveloped countries where the precious metals are extracted with great harm to health and lives. If anything, picking up the arrows, spears and swords off a battlefield is a much easier, safer and more rewarding process, making the use of precious bronze for those wares much less wasteful and frivolous. reply IncRnd 5 hours agorootparentprevEven today there are places where both a bride-price and dowry both happen. There is no reason they cannot coexist - because they do. The bride-price is a sort of contract of exclusivity payment from the groom's parents to the bride's parents, and the dowry is from the bride's parents to the groom/couple in order for the bride to have a certain level of life. They serve entirely different purposes. reply hnbad 54 minutes agorootparent> the dowry is from the bride's parents to the groom/couple in order for the bride to have a certain level of life There are actually three distinct concepts that can all occur within the same culture: - the dowry is paid by the bride's family and can either go to the groom or the groom's family - the bride price is paid by the groom's family and can either go to the bride or the bride's family - the dower is paid by the groom or the groom's family to the bride The dower specifically functions to protect the bride against poverty in the event the husband dies or becomes unfaithful or neglectful. The bride price or dowry can either function as payment for securing the bride/groom into wedlock or to fund the couple's new family. The terms \"bride price\" and \"dowry\" seem to be only defined by who pays it and either can refer to something paid to the other side's family or to the newly wed couple. That distinction seems to be entirely down to the cultural attitudes. IIRC there are even cultures where a bride price or dowry paid to the other side's family (as a form of \"reimbursement\" or \"exclusivity payment\" as you say) depends more on the relative status of each family, so a higher status family would be paid either way even if the amounts might differ due to the way inheritances are handled (e.g. if only the sons get to inherit their parents property, a son might be more valuable than a daughter). Keep in mind that marriages often also served to unite the two families/tribes/dynasties as a form of diplomacy. reply pyuser583 5 hours agorootparentprevThank you! I did not know that! reply defrost 6 hours agorootparentprevI'm not seeing the paradox. Gold today is considered a valuable gift. It is also consumed at 70 tonnes per quarter in the global consumer electronics sector, much of which is later discarded. https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/gold-demand-trends/gol...

The amount of e-waste generated is expected to grow at about 3.5% per year and will reach 74.7 Mt by 2030.

There's money in e-recycling but it doesn't justify the expenses of doing it in a more sophisticated way than that, especially one that requires paying workers a reasonable wage and maintaining workplace safety requirements. reply pyuser583 5 hours agorootparentprevWe aren’t “gifting” our enemies gold debris on the battlefield. reply defrost 5 hours agorootparent* ipsum2 has asserted that \"Gold is definitely not discarded, it's usually recycled out of electronics.\" * many HN comments strongly suggest that China is the sleeping enemy of the USofA (not my position, but it's a commonly held stance here). * a great deal of US electronics is sourced from Chinese companies. Is China gifting a country that considers China an enemy gold debris? reply hnbad 27 minutes agorootparentprevIf we assume that both sides of historical battles were either expecting to win or desperate enough to have no other option than fight (because why would a commander field a battle they could avoid if they don't think they'd win?): neither were they \"gifting\" their enemies bronze debris, except incidentally. That also ignores that historically most battles weren't fought to the bloody end because there was no point to do so once it was clear who would come out victorious. More likely, at some point the nobles would retreat or surrender and the common folk would be routed and flee to avoid being massacred. Even as late as WW1 soldiers would often be hesitant to kill their enemies because as it turns out killing other humans actually goes against our nature. Even in WW2 German soldiers and reserve police officers tasked with carrying out massacres had to rely on peer pressure and self-deception (i.e. trying to rationalize their actions as morally good[0]). It took us decades to refine the process of dehumanization that now allows modern soldiers to calmly wipe out dozens or hundreds of targets at the push of a button. Also with trained professional soldiers in ancient times the cost of a single soldier would easily rival or even outclass the cost of their equipment. And on the occasion that common folk would have military-grade gear available to them it would more likely be a prized artifact passed down across generations. [0]: There's one account of a German reserve police officer who participated in the massacres in Poland and specifically asked his comrades that he would kill the children but only after they would first kill their mothers because then he would be doing the children a favor because they could not go on living after seeing their mothers killed. Yes, it's twisted logic and ethically despicable but it served him to rationalize his cruel actions as a moral good and remain the hero of his own story. In fact, after the war many of them would be appalled at being considered war criminals rather that victims of injustice for having \"had to\" commit the massacres despite there being no formal or legal consequences to not participating. Those refusing to participate would be considered \"traitors\" by their comrades for \"not sharing the burden\" but not face any form of punishment. reply lupire 9 hours agoparentprevHow is Demotic Greek made up?

They also murder a Trojan they easily could have taken hostage. And what about the part of the Odyssey when he comes home and murders the suitors until the goddess steps in? The Iliad is particularly challenging when we project our current values back onto this ancient story. If we can suspend that, it contains timeless human questions, particularly on the role of fate and the forces that drive us. I feel that we lose the thread if we focus too much on whether the characters are likable. Also, why are you so certain that the bards would have found the analysis boring?

Movies have a self referential quality that makes them more intellectually engaging than mere novels. reply Ludleth19 6 hours agorootparent>Movies have a self referential quality that makes them more intellectually engaging than mere novels. This was written by someone who hasn't seriously engaged in reading novels lol Novels have been doing this sort of thing on a pretty deep level since basically their inception, and in more modern contexts no movie could replicate something like Pale Fire or Gravity's Rainbow for example. Self-referentiality is also a pretty boring trick after awhile, self-awareness and referentiality are very juvenile creative traits that often (not always) are seeking some sort of pat on the back for the mere act of referentiality itself. These things should be starting points, not the focus of an entire work unless there's a broader point to be made. Fredric Jameson has written a great deal about this sort of thing, it's basically the default position of culture in a lot of ways now, there's nothing inherently exciting about it. This isn't to say one medium is superior to the other or anything, I just find it to be a very weird critique of \"mere\" novels when self-referentiality goes way deeper there, the only things I can really think of that come close are 8 1/2 or maybe some of Charlie Kaufman's work like Adaptation. reply phist_mcgee 5 hours agorootparentTangentially, this is where the works of Dan Harmon (Community, Rick and Morty) fall down; his shows slide into self-referential, in-group pleasing messes. reply Ludleth19 5 hours agorootparentHard agree.

I don't know if this was the professor's intention, but he made you think about the movie more, he made you think either \"He has a point because of x, y and z\" or \"I think he is wrong because of x, y and z\", which is a valuable lesson. One issue with modern films is that people seem to follow or look for the general opinion of them. Lord of the Rings? Good. Morbius? Bad but memeable. Tarantino?

There are of course exceptions. Famously, Palahniuk has said the Fight Club film captured his intent better than his novel did. I also think film of The English Patient, which covers only a tiny section of what I consider a forgettable novel, is quite good, but even if you disagree I think almost anyone would say the film is better. And of course plenty of films aren't novel adaptations. Regardless, if you're looking for a \"story that could change my life\" you're likely to get much more from the text than the adaptation.

I've watched a bunch of new movies in the last few years, and more and more often, I sit there an hour later and think \"I can't remember anything all that interesting happening in the movie.\" I mean, there was action and conflict, protagonists and antagonists, and I can tell you the movie's genre and describe a few of the characters. But the dialog was bland and mumbly, the cinematography was all gray and washed out, the setting was kind of standard for that sort of movie, there were no interesting character arcs or twists, and it all kind of played out exactly as you'd expect a movie like that to play out. Willing to consider that maybe it's just old age and cognitive decline, but I feel something is just off about a lot of recent movies. reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparentMost media is forgettable and always has been. If anything has changed it's that we're consuming more of it, and it takes more for any given thing to stand out enough for it be something special, while more of what we consume isn't the peak of whats on offer. There's also less shared context. E.g. I firmly believe that a lot of our memories of a lot of the media we've consumed in the past is down to conversations about it reinforcing it as much as the initial memory. reply yterdy 12 hours agorootparentprevI dunno. Everything, Everywhere, All At Once was widely praised, and I saw it twice in theaters; and while I can remember a few key moments, I couldn't tell you the full plot from beginning to end. I still feel like I took something away from the experience of watching it (particularly the second time, with my mother). I'm beginning to think that there is an overemphasis on the breaking-down, atomizing, and overanalysis of fictional works. There's a place for that, of course, and such endeavors can bring you great insight. But maybe a work is an experience unto itself. You can take away something useful and meaningful from just being there and engaging with it as a viewer and reader as it streams through your sensory experience, and sitting with the emotions it brings afterwards.

The most interesting parts of the movie existed in the real-world plot but the movie kept running away from it. Even then, all universes (real-world included) had cringe-worthy levels of cliché metanarrative. It was a chore to make it to the end. It's even worse that any criticism of the movie was actively shut down and nothing negative about it could be found online. If you did find a shred of criticism, viewers either accused you of ignorance, unappreciative of art, or racism. I liked the actors playing the parents. I thought Stephanie Hsu and Ke Huy Quan were good in the real-life scenes. reply filoleg 10 hours agorootparent> If you did find a shred of criticism, viewers either accused you of ignorance, unappreciative of art, or racism. To be fair, the first 2 out of those 3 things are the coming go-to accusations when it comes to making a “you didn’t like this and this is why you are wrong” point. For any kind of media. The last one is situational, and depending on the movie could be swapped with something else. So I wouldn’t worry much about those accusations. With that said, I haven’t watched Everything Everywhere All at Once myself yet (it is on my “very soon” list), but all of my friends (who all have very different tastes in movies) ended up liking it.

Some generic American films are about Italian-American crime families in New York, some are about Indigenous teenagers in Oklahoma, some are about detectives in Minneapolis. And some are about Chinese-American immigrants in Los Angeles county. Generic American film audiences often get excited about films that tell stories they can easily identify with or that speak to their own life experiences, especially if those films are relatively rare. reply Spooky23 4 hours agorootparentprevIn your ignorance, you accidentally captured the scenario that American Born “Asians” find themselves in. As second or third generation Americans, they aren’t quite homogenized enough to be Americans. Bonus points for racist attitudes.

Which is why “Asian” American content is usually so awful to watch as an immigrant.

I’ve never met an Italian American that purports to have some special affinity for The Godfather. They don’t care whether Coppola was Italian nor do they care Brando wasn’t the least bit Italian.

I have had the same opinion for years, so I'm glad to see someone else write it. Aggrandized uncritical positive reception and raving about the newest Asian American movie reeks of media representation desperation. Pan-Asianism is a very weird phenomenon to me that seems common in the USA outside of California (very popular in Midwest and East Coast). Asian Americans have an \"Asian American identity\" that, while I understand why it exists due to how average Americans treat Asian Americans, I find very odd because it conflates a huge range and their happiness basically hinges on what white Americans think. Part of donning this \"Asian American\" identity reduces the ability to appreciate massive, wholly-contained independent Asian film industries. I enjoy watching Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean films, but so far, when I watch an \"Asian American\" film, I end up rolling my eyes hard. Films centering around \"Asian American\"-specific issues are not fun to watch. They feel cringy because they exhaust their main points within minutes on-screen. I'm glad pan-Asianism isn't as big in the Bay Area simply because coalescence isn't as necessary when respective Asian populations become sufficiently large. reply matt_j 9 hours agorootparentprevSeems an unpopular opinion but I thought EEAAO was pretty daft and I'm surprised at the reception it received and all the Oscars it won. Now don't get me wrong, it's a fun flick and I'm genuinely glad for the three actors that won an Oscar (bless 'em), but it seemed like fan service from a waning institution trying to generate goodwill more than cinematic mastery from anyone involved. The film is slightly better than a super bowl Pepsi commercial.

For just about everything else, we accept that different people have different tastes, and just because something can be great to one group of people doesn't mean that it's going to be great for another. I can guess which people I know would like a movie like Jaws, and which wouldn't. If you really understand a piece of media, understand what the author is trying to accomplish, what choices are being made narratively and stylistically, what narrative tradition the author is consciously or unconsciously following, etc., then you should have a pretty good idea of who this work would appeal to and who it wouldn't appeal to.

Through Endgame, it was an unprecedented undertaking involving the hard work of tens (hundreds?) of thousands of talented artists and technicians across the globe, marshalling untold resources over the span of a decade. And they actually pulled it off, producing a series of critical and commercial blockbusters that form (more or less) a single, sprawling narrative. It's unlikely we'll ever see anything like it again in our lifetimes. The day when the project would lose its luster was always coming - as anyone who knows the history of Hollywood westerns and action flicks and blaxploitation could tell you - and you may gloat now that it's arrived.

Neil Gaiman does decently well in the adaptations that involve him, I must say. reply vehemenz 8 hours agorootparentprevA more compelling thesis would be that the MCU films presided over a vacuum of good blockbusters during a period of decline in American cinema, brought about by risk-averse studios during the mortgage crisis. The legacy of the films—technical achievements, continuity and coherence of narrative, ambition, etc.—are laudatory in some respects. Obviously, they made an enormous amount of money. But it's worth examining their \"critical\" success. Putting my personal opinions aside, do any of these films hold up to the standard bearers of early 90s and 00s blockbusters? I'm not convinced. The MCU films are inherently derivative works with little dramatic tension; we already know the characters and that they will win. The narrative and dialogue is paint-by-numbers, and the action sequences are exhausting, low-stakes, and sterile. That's fine for a theme park ride—get some thrills if that's your cup of tea—but it's not enough for a critically good blockbuster film. That's fine for teen boys and young adults, but it's not enough for a more diverse, discerning audience. Does anyone think any of these films, let alone their entirety, hold a candle to Jurassic Park, The Matrix, or The Pirates of the Caribbean?

I'm pretty sure we can find some people for which some of the 200 movies in the Avengers franchize resonated with them and changed their life. Especially since billions saw them (and unprobable events will tend to happen as the sample size grows). After all, Hallmark movies also resonate with many people. And in the right conditions, say our dog just died, they can make even the more cynical of us cry. But generally, better movies have that quality more. This is what makes the better in the first place: touching on some essential aspect of humanity in a non-trite way. Doesn't have to be classics as in \"old movies favored by critics\", just generally movies made with more vision, integrity, and core message than \"look 2 hours of explosions and fancy effects mixed with reshased cookie cutter dialog\", or \"look at these two cute young people fall in love, have a falling out, and getting back again\") will tend to resonate with people more deeply and in more nuanced ways. reply pests 12 hours agorootparentprevNot everyone watchs a film for intellectual pursuits, some just want to enjoy a story or relax and unwind. reply coldtea 11 hours agorootparentWell, then they're wrong, and should change their ways, similar to someone who just eats fast food because \"that's what they like, they don't want to be challenged by food\".

On the other hand \"don't be an elitist, the mailman doesn't need to read the Iliad\" is not as humanistic of a position as many people think it is.

Why is it not okay for the mailman to have pursuits that aren't some way related to improving oneself or related to intellectual curiosity? Maybe they read the Iliad some other day or when they have more time or are in the mood for it, no judgement there. I think people are talking past my original comment's point.

That’s yet another argument for not putting “classics” on a pedestal as the “best” movies. reply coldtea 11 hours agorootparentWell, classics and \"the best movies\" is pretty much synonymous: the classics are what are considered the best movies. reply Exoristos 6 hours agorootparentprevOf course not. reply genman 15 hours agoparentprevI completely get your point. Still I would advise to be careful. Movies don't follow the same scrutiny than say, academic papers. Deliberate inaccuracies are common. Obviously, of course. Why I'm saying this then? First it can of course create a false understanding of the past events (if of course the movie was set into some historical context). This by itself might be not dangerous, but it may lead to drawing completely wrong conclusions. What requires even more care is a deliberate psychological manipulations by the director to bypass critical rational thinking.

Neo-classicism wasn't a counter culture from Britain -- it was just as popular in London as it was in Washington -- it's not like England was living in the dark ages while America was in the enlightenment. Homer is a fairly core part of western culture and you see references to it everywhere. Somewhat famously in O Brother Where Art There, but there's a long list of movies and novels that have referenced it.

I don't know about memorising translations, but the Iliad was composed specifically so it could be memorised, and it was long repeated (even in competition form!) before it was ever written down. The Greek original follows a strict dactylic hexameter with rhymes and other tricks to make it easier to memorize. It's crazy to think in a world of writing that back then people memorised entire books/songs/poems like the Iliad instead of simply reading a copy. It makes sense, in a way; copying such a long text would take ages, especially with writing implements at the time, but I'm still amazed by the dedication these ancient people had. reply lnauta 11 hours agorootparentLast summer I read a translation that tries to keep the rhyme and rythm.

Don't expect the full version on Youtube, though; the 24 books seem to all take an hour of each, and I don't think anyone has cared to spend a full day reading ancient Greek into a microphone yet, let alone recite it for an audience.

Consider also the degree of investment this requires from society as a whole. To learn to recite large works from memory like that pretty much requires a person who dedicates their life entirely to the craft (excluding other productive work), not just learning the techniques and the stories themselves, but also eventually teaching others to carry on.

If you want to just retell stories broadly, only preserving the overall narrative, then no, it's not necessary. But if you want to recite them word for word consistently - which many cultures did and do value - then yes, it requires a lot of rote learning, and learning of various associated memorization techniques. Thus not all cultures evolved such a distinct profession, but many did. Some particularly impressive examples include the Mongolian Epic of Gesar and the Kyrgyz Epic of Manas. The latter is notable for having over 500,000 lines of verse, and there are living performers capable of reciting the whole thing end to end (which takes several days). reply bitwize 12 hours agorootparentprevI've always found it fascinating how the Polynesians kept records of their families' history.

As you can see from the above: Chinese and American students reacted very differently to a change (a difficult study exercise). In principle this contradicts your claim that Americans embrace any change - not at all. Why different groups of people react differently to the change applied to them?

You can frame history in whatever narrative makes you feel good but it's not scientific or true. > Why different groups of people react differently to the change applied to them? It can be that they have different cultural memory about what is the outcome of a personal stand. Your average Chinese student is more likely to have immediate family members who participated in revolutionary activity than just \"being rice farmers\". Whereas your average American is not very likely to have ancestors who participated in revolutionary activity (much less cowboys or adventurers). I am trying to illustrate that your initial assumption (Americans are always pushing boundaries, and the Chinese just live quiet lives) is totally inaccurate when taking into account which of the two countries has had more instability over the last two centuries. So in the \"cultural memory\" wouldn't Americans be the ones who are used to peaceful and stable lives? Your point fails on another level, which is that both the rice farmer and cowboy example are stereotypes that serve to find an example without any serious analysis. It's a nice hand-wavy explanation that doesn't pass a quick smell test an also doesn't encourage the people who buy into the explanation to investigate any further.

Cowboys aka cow herders were just one very limited part of the American society, it misses everybody else who were free in their lives. Chinese communist regime (as it has been with all communist regimes) first deceived the population with good sounding promises and then created another oppressive regime. Chinese peasants didn't push personal boundaries, it was a collective action where they stepped right into one of the biggest blunders of the century that led to the death of tens of millions people (close to 100 million). \"Cultural\" revolution displayed to them that they have to learn to walk on the rope or else.

    "title": "Diseconomies of Scale: Tech Company Trust Issues",
    "originLink": "https://danluu.com/diseconomies-scale/",
    "originBody": "If I ask myself a question like \"I'd like to buy an SD card; who do I trust to sell me a real SD card and not some fake, Amazon or my local Best Buy?\", of course the answer is that I trust my local Best Buy1 more than Amazon, which is notorious for selling counterfeit SD cards. And if I ask who do I trust more, my local reputable electronics shop (Memory Express, B&H Photo, etc.), I trust my local reputable electronics shop more. Not only are they less likely to sell me a counterfeit than Best Buy, in the event that they do sell me a counterfeit, the service is likely to be better. Similarly, let's say I ask myself a question like, \"on which platform do I get a higher rate of scams, spam, fraudulent content, etc., [smaller platform] or [larger platform]\"? Generally the answer is [larger platform]. Of course, there are more total small platforms out there and they're higher variance, so I could deliberately use a smaller platform that's worse, but I'm choosing good options instead of bad options, in every size class, the smaller platform is generally better. For example, with Signal vs. WhatsApp, I've literally never received a spam Signal message, whereas I get spam WhatsApp messages somewhat regularly. Or if I compare places I might read tech content on, if I compare tiny forums no one's heard of to lobste.rs, lobste.rs has a very slightly higher rate (rate as in fraction of messages I see, not absolute message volume) of bad content because it's zero on the private forums and very low but non-zero on lobste.rs. And then if I compare lobste.rs to a somewhat larger platform, like Hacker News or mastodon.social, those have (again very slightly) higher rates of scam/spam/fraudulent content. And then if I compare that to mid-sized social media platforms, like reddit, reddit has a significantly higher and noticeable rate of bad content. And then if I can compare reddit to the huge platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Google search results, these larger platforms have an even higher rate of scams/spam/fraudulent content. And, as with the SD card example, the odds of getting decent support go down as the platform size goes up as well. In the event of an incorrect suspension or ban from the platform, the odds of an account getting reinstated get worse as the platform gets larger. I don't think it's controversial to say that in general, a lot of things get worse as platforms get bigger. For example, when I ran a Twitter poll to see what people I'm loosely connected to think, only 2.6% thought that huge company platforms have the best moderation and spam/fraud filtering. For reference, in one poll, 9% of Americans said that vaccines implant a microchip and and 12% said the moon landing was fake. These are different populations but it seems random Americans are more likely to say that the moon landing was faked than tech people are likely to say that the largest companies have the best anti-fraud/anti-spam/moderation. However, over the past five years, I've noticed an increasingly large number of people make the opposite claim, that only large companies can do decent moderation, spam filtering, fraud (and counterfeit) detection, etc. We looked at one example of this when we examined search results, where a Google engineer said Somebody tried argue that if the search space were more competitive, with lots of little providers instead of like three big ones, then somehow it would be *more* resistant to ML-based SEO abuse. And... look, if *google* can't currently keep up with it, how will Little Mr. 5% Market Share do it? And a thought leader responded like 95% of the time, when someone claims that some small, independent company can do something hard better than the market leader can, it’s just cope. economies of scale work pretty well! But when we looked at the actual results, it turned out that, of the search engines we looked at, Mr 0.0001% Market Share was the most resistant to SEO abuse (and fairly good), Mr 0.001% was a bit resistant to SEO abuse, and Google and Bing were just flooded with SEO abuse, frequently funneling people directly to various kinds of scams. Something similar happens with email, where I commonly hear that it's impossible to manage your own email due to the spam burden, but people do it all the time and often have similar or better results than Gmail, with the main problem being interacting with big company mail servers which incorrectly ban their little email server. I started seeing a lot of comments claiming that you need scale to do moderation, anti-spam, anti-fraud, etc., around the time Zuckerberg, in response to Elizabeth Warren calling for the breakup of big tech companies, claimed that breaking up tech companies would make content moderation issues substantially worse, saying: It’s just that breaking up these companies, whether it’s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,” Zuckerberg said “And, you know, it doesn’t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. It doesn’t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now ... all the processes that we’re putting in place and investing in, now we’re more fragmented It’s why Twitter can’t do as good of a job as we can. I mean, they face, qualitatively, the same types of issues. But they can’t put in the investment. Our investment on safety is bigger than the whole revenue of their company. [laughter] And yeah, we’re operating on a bigger scale, but it’s not like they face qualitatively different questions. They have all the same types of issues that we do.\" The argument is that you need a lot of resources to do good moderation and smaller companies, Twitter sized companies (worth ~$30B at the time), can't marshal the necessary resources to do good moderation. I found this statement quite funny at the time because, pre-Twitter acquisition, I saw a much higher rate of obvious scam content on Facebook than on Twitter. For example, when I clicked through Facebook ads during holiday shopping season, most were scams and, while Twitter had its share of scam ads, it wasn't really in the same league as Facebook. And it's not just me — Arturo Bejar, who designed an early version of Facebook's reporting system and headed up some major trust and safety efforts noticed something similar (see footnote for details)2. Zuckerberg seems to like the line of reasoning mentioned above, though, as he's made similar arguments elsewhere, such as here, in a statement the same year that Meta's internal docs made the case that they were exposing 100k minors a day to sexual abuse imagery: To some degree when I was getting started in my dorm room, we obviously couldn’t have had 10,000 people or 40,000 people doing content moderation then and the AI capacity at that point just didn’t exist to go proactively find a lot of harmful content. At some point along the way, it started to become possible to do more of that as we became a bigger business The rhetorical sleight of hand here is the assumption that Facebook needed 10k or 40k people doing content moderation when Facebook was getting started in Zuckerberg's dorm room. Services that are larger than dorm-room-Facebook can and do have better moderation than Facebook today with a single moderator, often one who works part time. But as people talk more about pursuing real antitrust action against big tech companies, tech big tech founders and execs have ramped up the anti-antitrust rhetoric, making claims about all sorts of disasters that will befall humanity if the biggest companies are broken up into the size of the biggest tech companies of 2015 or 2010. This kind of reasoning seems to be catching on a bit, as I've seen more and more big company employees state very similar reasoning. We've come a long way since the 1979 IBM training manual which read A COMPUTER CAN NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEREFORE A COMPUTER MUST NEVER MAKE A MANAGEMENT DECISION The argument is now, for many critical decisions, it is only computers that can make most of the decisions and the lack of accountability seems to ultimately a feature, not a bug. But unfortunately for Zuckerberg's argument3, there are at least three major issues in play here where diseconomies of scale dominate. One is that, given material that nearly everyone can agree is bad (such as bitcoin scams, spam for fake pharmaceutical products, fake weather forecasts, adults sending photos of their genitals to children), etc., large platforms do worse than small ones. The second is that, for the user, errors are much more costly and less fixable as companies get bigger because support generally becomes worse. The third is that, as platforms scale up, a larger fraction of users will strongly disagree about what should be allowed on the platform. With respect to the first, while it's true that big companies have more resources, the cocktail party idea that they'll have the best moderation because they have the most resources is countered by the equally simplistic idea that they'll have the worst moderation because they're the juiciest targets or that they'll have the worst moderation because they'll have worst fragmentation due to the standard diseconomies of scale that occur when you scale up organizations and problem domains. Whether or not the company having more resources or these other factors dominate is too complex to resolve theoretically, but can observe the result empirically. At least at the level of resources that big companies choose to devote to moderation, spam, etc., having the larger target and other problems associated with scale dominate. While it's true that these companies are wildly profitable and could devote enough resources to significantly reduce this problem, they have chosen not to do this. For example, in the last year before I wrote this sentence, Meta's last-year profit before tax (through December 2023) was $47B. If Meta had a version of the internal vision statement of a power company a friend mine worked for (\"Reliable energy, at low cost, for generations.\") and operated like that power company did, trying to create a good experience for the user instead of maximizing profit plus creating the metaverse, they could've spent the $50B they spent on the metaverse on moderation platforms and technology and then spent $30k/yr (which would result in a very good income in most countries where moderators are hired today, allowing them to have their pick of who to hire) on 1.6 million additional full-time staffers for things like escalations and support, on the order of one additional moderator or support staffer per few thousand users (and of course diseconomies of scale apply to managing this many people). I'm not saying that Meta or Google should do this, just that whenever someone at big tech company says something like \"these systems have to be fully automated because no one could afford to operate manual systems at our scale\", what's really being said is more along the lines of \"we would not be able to generate as many billions a year in profit if we hired enough competent people to manually review cases our system should flag as ambiguous, so we settle for what we can get without compromising profits\".4 One can defend that choice, but it is a choice. And likewise for claims about advantages of economies of scale. There are areas where economies of scale legitimately make the experience better for users. For example, when we looked at why it's so hard to buy things that work well, we noted that Amazon's economies of scale have enabled them to build out their own package delivery service that is, while flawed, still more reliable than is otherwise available (and this has only improved since they added the ability for users to rate each delivery, which no other major package delivery service has). Similarly, Apple's scale and vertical integration has allowed them to build one of the all-time great performance teams (as measured by normalized performance relative to competitors of the same era), not only wiping the floor with the competition on benchmarks, but also providing a better experience in ways that no one really measured until recently, like device latency. For a more mundane example of economies of scale, crackers and other food that ships well are cheaper on Amazon than in my local grocery store. It's easy to name ways in which economies of scale benefit the user, but this doesn't mean that we should assume that economies of scale dominate diseconomies of scale in all areas. Although it's beyond the scope of this post, if we're going to talk about whether or not users are better off if companies are larger or smaller, we should look at what gets better when companies get bigger and what gets worse, not just assume that everything will get better just because some things get better (or vice versa). Coming back to the argument that huge companies have the most resources to spend on moderation, spam, anti-fraud, etc., vs. the reality that they choose to spend those resources elsewhere, like dropping $50B on the Metaverse and not hiring 1.6 million moderators and support staff that they could afford to hire, it makes sense to look at how much effort is being expended. Meta's involvement in Myanmar makes for a nice case study because Erin Kissane wrote up a fairly detailed 40,000 word account of what happened. The entirety of what happened is a large and complicated issue (see appendix for more discussion) but, for the main topic of this post, the key components are that there was an issue that most people can generally agree should be among the highest priority moderation and support issues and that, despite repeated, extremely severe and urgent, warnings to Meta staff at various levels (engineers, directors, VPs, execs, etc.), almost no resources were dedicated to the issue while internal documents indicate that only a small fraction of agreed-upon bad content was caught by their systems (on the order of a few percent). I don't think this is unique to Meta and this matches my experience with other large tech companies, both as a user of their products and as an employee. To pick a smaller scale example, an acquaintance of mine had their Facebook account compromised and it's now being used for bitcoin scams. The person's name is Samantha K. and some scammer is doing enough scamming that they didn't even bother reading her name properly and have been generating very obviously faked photos where someone holds up a sign and explains how \"Kamantha\" has helped them make tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is a fairly common move for \"hackers\" to make and someone else I'm connected to on FB reported that this happened to their account and they haven't been able to recover the old account or even get it banned despite the constant stream of obvious scams being posted by the account. By comparison, on lobste.rs, I've never seen a scam like this and Peter Bhat Harkins, the head mod says that they've never had one that he knows of. On Mastodon, I think I might've seen one once in my feed, replies, or mentions. Of course, Mastodon is big enough that you can find some scams if you go looking for them, but the per-message and per-user rates are low enough that you shouldn't encounter them as a normal user. On Twitter (before the acquisition) or reddit, moderately frequently, perhaps an average of once every few weeks in my normal feed. On Facebook, I see things like this all the time; I get obvious scam consumer good sites every shopping season, and the bitcoin scams, both from ads as well as account takeovers, are year-round. Many people have noted that they don't bother reporting these kinds of scams anymore because they've observed that Facebook doesn't take action on their reports. Meanwhile, Reuven Lerner was banned from running Facebook ads on their courses about Python and Pandas, seemingly because Facebook systems \"thought\" that Reuven was advertising something to do with animal trading (as opposed to programming). This is the fidelity of moderation and spam control that Zuckerberg says cannot be matched by any smaller company. By the way, I don't mean to pick on Meta in particular; if you'd like examples with a slightly different flavor, you can see the appendix of Google examples for a hundred examples of automated systems going awry at Google. A reason this comes back to being an empirical question is that all of this talk about how economies of scale allows huge companies to bring more resources to bear on the problem on matters if the company chooses to deploy those resources. There's no theoretical force that makes companies deploy resources in these areas, so we can't reason theoretically. But we can observe that the resources deployed aren't sufficient to match the problems, even in cases where people would generally agree that the problem should very obviously be high priority, such as with Meta in Myanmar. Of course, when it comes to issues where the priority is less obvious, resources are also not deployed there. On the second issue, support, it's a meme among tech folks that the only way to get support as a user of one of the big platforms is to make a viral social media post or know someone on the inside. This compounds the issue of bad moderation, scam detection, anti-fraud, etc., since those issues could be mitigated if support was good. Normal support channels are a joke, where you either get a generic form letter rejection, or a kafkaesque nightmare followed by a form letter rejection. For example, when Adrian Black was banned from YouTube for impersonating Adrian Black (to be clear, he was banned for impersonating himself, not someone else with the same name), after appealing, he got a response that read unfortunately, there's not more we can do on our end. your account suspension & appeal were very carefully reviewed & the decision is final In another Google support story, Simon Weber got the runaround from Google support when he was trying to get information he needed to pay his taxes accounting data exports for extensions have been broken for me (and I think all extension merchants?) since April 2018 [this was written on Sept 2020]. I had to get the NY attorney general to write them a letter before they would actually respond to my support requests so that I could properly file my taxes There was also the time YouTube kept demonetizing PointCrow's video of eating water with chopsticks (he repeatedly dips chopsticks into water and then drinks the water, very slowly eating a bowl of water). Despite responding with things like we're so sorry about that mistake & the back and fourth [sic], we've talked to the team to ensure it doesn't happen again He would get demonetized again and appeals would start with the standard support response strategy of saying that they took great care in examining the violating under discussion but, unfortunately, the user clearly violated the policy and therefore nothing can be done: We have reviewed your appeal ... We reviewed your content carefully, and have confirmed that it violates our violent or graphic content policy ... it's our job to make sure that YouTube is a safe place for all These are high-profile examples, but of course having a low profile doesn't stop you from getting banned and getting the same basically canned response, like this HN user who was banned for selling a vacuum in FB marketplace. After a number of appeals, he was told Unfortunately, your account cannot be reinstated due to violating community guidelines. The review is final When paid support is optional, people often say you won't have these problems if you pay for support, but people who use Google One paid support or Facebook and Instagram's paid creator support generally report that the paid support is no better than the free support. Products that effectively have paid support built-in aren't necessarily better, either. I know people who've gotten the same kind of runaround you get from free Google support with Google Cloud, even when they're working for companies that have 8 or 9 figure a year Google Cloud spend. In one of many examples, the user was seeing that Google must've been dropping packets and Google support kept insisting that the drops were happening in the customer's datacenter despite packet traces showing that this could not possibly be the case. The last I heard, they gave up on that one, but sometimes when an issue is a total showstopper, someone will call up a buddy of theirs at Google to get support because the standard support is often completely ineffective. And this isn't unique to Google — at another cloud vendor, a former colleague of mine was in the room for a conversation where a very senior engineer was asked to look into an issue where a customer was complaining that they were seeing 100% of packets get dropped for a few seconds at a time, multiple times an hour. The engineer responded with something like \"it's the cloud, they should deal with it\", before being told they couldn't ignore the issue as usual because the issue was coming from [VIP customer] and it was interrupting [one of the world's largest televised sporting events]. That one got fixed, but, odds are, you aren't that important, even if you're paying hundreds of millions a year. And of course this kind of support isn't unique to cloud vendors. For example, there was this time Stripe held $400k from a customer for over a month without explanation, and every request to support got a response that was as ridiculous as the ones we just looked at. The user availed themself of the only reliable Stripe support mechanism, posting to HN and hoping to hit #1 on the front page, which worked, although many commenters said made the usual comments like \"Flagged because we are seeing a lot of these on HN, and they seem to be attempts to fraudulently manipulate customer support, rather than genuine stories\", with multiple people suggesting or insinuating that the user is doing something illicit or fraudulent, but it turned out that it was an error on Stripe's end, compounded by Stripe's big company support. At one point, the user notes While I was writing my HN post I was also on chat with Stripe for over an hour. No new information. They were basically trying to shut down the chat with me until I sent them the HN story and showed that it was getting some traction. Then they started working on my issue again and trying to communicate with more people And then the issue was fixed the next day. Although, in principle, as companies become larger, they could leverage their economies of scale to deliver more efficient support, instead, they tend to use their economies of scale to deliver worse, but cheaper and more profitable support. For example, on Google Play store approval support, a Google employee notes: a lot of that was outsourced to overseas which resulted in much slower response time. Here stateside we had a lot of metrics in place to fast response. Typically your app would get reviewed the same day. Not sure what it's like now but the managers were incompetent back then even so And a former FB support person notes: The big problem here is the division of labor. Those who spend the most time in the queues have the least input as to policy. Analysts are able to raise issues to QAs who can then raise them to Facebook FTEs. It can take months for issues to be addressed, if they are addressed at all. The worst part is that doing the common sense thing and implementing the spirit of the policy, rather than the letter, can have a negative effect on your quality score. I often think about how there were several months during my tenure when most photographs of mutilated animals were allowed on a platform without a warning screen due to a carelessly worded policy \"clarification\" and there was nothing we could do about it. If you've ever wondered why your support person is responding nonsensically, sometimes it's the obvious reason that support has been outsourced to someone making $1/hr (when I looked up the standard rates for one country that a lot of support is outsourced to, a fairly standard rate works out to about $1/hr) who doesn't really speak your language and is reading from a flowchart without understanding anything about the system they're giving support for, but another, less obvious, reason is that the support person may be penalized and eventually fired if they take actions that make sense instead of following the nonsensical flowchart that's in front of them. Coming back to the \"they seem to be attempts to fraudulently manipulate customer support, rather than genuine stories\" comment, this is a sentiment I've commonly seen expressed by engineers at companies that mete out arbitrary and capricious bans. I'm sympathetic to how people get here. As I noted before I joined Twitter, commenting on public information Turns out twitter is removing ~1M bots/day. Twitter only has ~300M MAU, making the error tolerance v. low. This seems like a really hard problem ... Gmail's spam filter gives me maybe 1 false positive per 1k correctly classified ham ... Regularly wiping the same fraction of real users in a service would be [bad]. It is actually true that, if you, an engineer, dig into the support queue at some giant company and look at people appealing bans, almost all of the appeals should be denied. But, my experience from having talked to engineers working on things like anti-fraud systems is that many, and perhaps most, round \"almost all\" to \"all\", which is both quantitatively and qualitatively different. Having engineers who work on these systems believe that \"all\" and not \"almost all\" of their decisions are correct results in bad experiences for users. For example, there's a social media company that's famous for incorrectly banning users (at least 10% of people I know have lost an account due to incorrect bans and, if I search for a random person I don't know, there's a good chance I get multiple accounts for them, with some recent one that has a profile that reads \"used to be @[some old account]\", with no forward from the old account to the new one because they're now banned). When I ran into a senior engineer from the team that works on this stuff, I asked him why so many legitimate users get banned and he told me something like \"that's not a problem, the real problem is that we don't ban enough accounts. Everyone who's banned deserves it, it's not worth listening to appeals or thinking about them\". Of course it's true that most content on every public platform is bad content, spam, etc., so if you have any sort of signal at all on whether or not something is bad content, when you look at it, it's likely to be bad content. But this doesn't mean the converse, that almost no users are banned incorrectly, is true. And if senior people on the team that classifies which content is bad have the attitude that we shouldn't worry about false positives because almost all flagged content is bad, we'll end up with a system that has a large number of false positives. I later asked around to see what had ever been done to reduce false positives in the fraud detection systems and found out that there was no systematic attempt at tracking false positives at all, no way to count cases where employees filed internal tickets to override bad bans, etc.; At the meta level, there was some mechanism to decrease the false negative rate (e.g., someone sees bad content that isn't being caught then adds something to catch more bad content) but, without any sort of tracking of false positives, there was effectively no mechanism to decrease the false positive rate. It's no surprise that this meta system resulted in over 10% of people I know getting incorrect suspensions or bans. And, as Patrick McKenzie says, the optimal rate of false positives isn't zero. But when you have engineers who have the attitude that they've done enough legwork that false positives are impossible, it's basically guaranteed that the false positive rate is higher than optimal. When you combine this with normal big company levels of support, it's a recipe for kafkaesque user experiences. Another time, I commented on how an announced change in Uber's moderation policy seemed likely to result in false positive bans. An Uber TL immediately took me to task, saying that I was making unwarranted assumptions on how banning works, that Uber engineers go to great lengths to make sure that there are no false positive bans, there's extensive to review to make sure that bans are valid and, in fact, the false positive banning I was concerned about could never happen. And then I got effectively banned due to a false positive in a fraud detection system. I was remind of that incident when Uber incorrectly banned a driver who had to take them to court to even get information on why he was banned, at which point Uber finally actually looked into it (instead of just responding to appeals with fake messages claiming they'd looked into it). Afterwards, Uber responded to a press inquiry with We are disappointed that the court did not recognize the robust processes we have in place, including meaningful human review, when making a decision to deactivate a driver’s account due to suspected fraud Of course, in that driver's case, there was no robust process for review, nor was there a robust appeals process for my case. When I contacted support, they didn't really read my message and made some change that broke my account even worse than before. Luckily, I have enough Twitter followers that some Uber engineers saw my tweet about the issue and got me unbanned, but that's not an option that's available to most people, leading to weird stuff like this Facebook ad targeted at Google employees, from someone desperately seeking help with their Google account. And even when you know someone on the inside, it's not always easy to get the issue fixed because even if the company's effectiveness doesn't increase as the company gets bigger, the complexity of the systems does increase. A nice example of this is Gergely Orosz's story about when the manager of the payments team left Uber and then got banned from Uber due to some an inscrutable ML anti-fraud algorithm deciding that the former manager of the payments team was committing payments fraud. It took six months of trying to get the problem fixed to mitigate the issue. And, by the way, they never managed to understand what happened and fix the underlying issue; instead, they added the former manager of the payments team to a special whitelist, not fixing the issue for any other user and, presumably, severely reducing or perhaps even entirely removing payment fraud protections for the former manager's account. No doubt they would've fixed the underlying issue if it were easy to, but as companies scale up, they produce both technical and non-technical bureaucracy that makes systems opaque even to employees. Another example of that is, at a company that has a ranked social feed, the idea that you could eliminate stuff you didn't want in your ranked feed by adding filters for things like timeline_injection:false, interstitial_ad_op_out, etc., would go viral. The first time this happened, a number of engineers looked into it and thought that the viral tricks didn't work. They weren't 100% sure and were relying on ideas like \"no one can recall a system that would do something like this ever being implemented\" and \"if you search the codebase for these strings, they don't appear\", and \"we looked at the systems we think might do this and they don't appear to do this\". There was moderate confidence that this trick didn't work, but no one would state with certainty that the trick didn't work because, as at all large companies, the aggregate behavior of the system is beyond human understanding and even parts that could be understood often aren't because there are other priorities. A few months later, the trick went viral again and people were generally referred to the last investigation when they asked if it was real, except that one person actually tried the trick and reported that it worked. They wrote a slack message about how the trick did work for them, but almost no one noticed that the one person who tried reproducing the trick found that it worked. Later, when the trick would go viral again, people would point to the discussions about how people thought the trick didn't work, with this message noting that it appears to work (almost certainly not by the mechanism that users think, and instead just because having a long list of filters causes something to time out, or something similar) basically got lost because there's too much information to read all of it. In my social circles, many people have read James Scott's Seeing Like a State, which is subtitled How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human World Have Failed. A key concept from the book is \"legibility\", what a state can see, and how this distorts what states do. One could easily write a highly analogous book, Seeing like a Tech Company about what's illegible to companies that scale up, at least as companies are run today. A simple example of this is that, in many video games, including ones made by game studios that are part of a $3T company, it's easy to get someone suspended or banned by having a bunch of people report the account for bad behavior. What's legible to the game company is the rate of reports and what's not legible is the player's actual behavior (it could be legible, but the company chooses not to have enough people or skilled enough people examine actual behavior); and many people have reported similar bannings with social media companies. When it comes to things like anti-fraud systems, what's legible to the company tends to be fairly illegible to humans, even humans working on the anti-fraud systems themselves. Although he wasn't specifically talking about an anti-fraud system, in a Special Master's System, Eugene Zarashaw, a director a Facebook made this comment which illustrates the illegibility of Facebook's own systems: It would take multiple teams on the ad side to track down exactly the — where the data flows. I would be surprised if there’s even a single person that can answer that narrow question conclusively Facebook was unfairly and mostly ignorantly raked over the coals for this statement (we'll discuss that in an appendix), but it is generally true that it's difficult to understand how a system the size of Facebook works. In principle, companies could augment the legibility of their inscrutable systems by having decently paid support people look into things that might be edge-case issues with severe consequences, where the system is \"misunderstanding\" what's happening but, in practice, companies pay these support people extremely poorly and hire people who really don't understand what's going on, and then give them instructions which ensure that they generally do not succeed at resolving legibility issues. One thing that helps the forces of illegibility win at scale is that, as a highly-paid employee of one of these huge companies, it's easy to look at the millions or billions of people (and bots) out there and think of them all as numbers. As the saying goes, \"the death of one man is a tragedy. The death of a million is a statistic\" and, as we noted, engineers often turn thoughts like \"almost all X is fraud\" to \"all X is fraud, so we might as well just ban everyone who does X and not look at appeals\". The culture that modern tech companies have, of looking for scalable solutions at all costs, makes this worse than in other industries even at the same scale, and tech companies also have unprecedented scale. For example, in response to someone noting that FB Ad Manager claims you can run an ad with a potential reach of 101M people in the U.S. aged 18-34 when the U.S. census had the total population of people aged 18-34 as 76M, the former PM of the ads targeting team responded with Think at FB scale And explained that you can't expect slice & dice queries to work for something like the 18-34 demographic in the U.S. at \"FB scale\". There's a meme at Google that's used ironically in cases like this, where people will say \"I can't count that low\". Here's the former PM of FB ads saying, non-ironically, \"FB can't count that low\" for numbers like 100M. Not only does FB not care about any individual user (unless they're famous), this PM claims they can't be bothered to care that groups of 100M people are tracked accurately. Coming back to the consequences of poor support, a common response to hearing about people getting incorrectly banned from one of these huge services is \"Good! Why would you want to use Uber/Amazon/whatever anyway? They're terrible and no one should use them\". I disagree with this line of reasoning. For one thing, why should you decide for that person whether or not they should use a service or what's good for them? For another (and this this is a large enough topic that it should be its own post, so I'll just mention it briefly and link to this lengthier comment from @whitequark) most services that people write off as unnecessary conveniences that you should just do without are actually serious accessibility issues for quite a few people (in absolute, not necessarily, percentage, terms). When we're talking about small businesses, those people can often switch to another business, but with things like Uber and Amazon, there are sometimes zero or one alternatives that offer similar convenience and when there's one, getting banned due to some random system misfiring can happen with the other service as well. For example, in response to many people commenting on how you should just issue a chargeback and get banned from DoorDash when they don't deliver, a disabled user responds: I'm disabled. Don't have a driver's license or a car. There isn't a bus stop near my apartment, I actually take paratransit to get to work, but I have to plan that a day ahead. Uber pulls the same shit, so I have to cycle through Uber, Door dash, and GrubHub based on who has coupons and hasn't stolen my money lately. Not everyone can just go pick something up. Also, when talking about this class of issue, involvement is often not voluntary, such as in the case of this Fujitsu bug that incorrectly put people in prison. On the third issue, the impossibility of getting people to agree on what constitutes spam, fraud, and other disallowed content, we discussed that in detail here. We saw that, even in a trivial case with a single, uncontroversial, simple, rule, people can't agree on what's allowed. And, as you add more rules or add topics that are controversial or scale up the number of people, it becomes even harder to agree on what should be allowed. To recap, we looked at three areas where diseconomies of scale make moderation, support, anti-fraud, and anti-spam worse as companies get bigger. The first was that, even in cases where there's broad agreement that something is bad, such as fraud/scam/phishing websites and search, the largest companies with the most sophisticated machine learning can't actually keep up with a single (albeit very skilled) person working on a small search engine. The returns to scammers are much higher if they take on the biggest platforms, resulting in the anti-spam/anti-fraud/etc. problem being extremely non-linearly hard. To get an idea of the difference in scale, HN \"hellbans\" spammers and people who post some kinds of vitriolic comments. Most spammers don't seem to realize they're hellbanned and will keep posting for a while, so if you browse the \"newest\" (submissions) page while logged in, you'll see a steady stream of automatically killed stories from these hellbanned users. While there are quite a few of them, the percentage is generally well under half. When we looked at a \"mid-sized\" big tech company like Twitter circa 2017, based on the public numbers, if spam bots were hellbanned instead of removed, spam is so much more prevalent that all you'd see if you were able to see it. And, as big companies go, 2017-Twitter isn't that big. As we also noted, the former PM of FB ads targeting explained that numbers as low as 100M are in the \"I can't count that low\" range, too small to care about; to him, basically a rounding error. The non-linear difference in difficulty is much worse for a company like FB or Google. The non-linearity of the difficulty of this problems is, apparently, more than a match for whatever ML or AI techniques Zuckerberg and other tech execs want to brag about. In testimony in front of Congress, you'll see execs defend the effectiveness of these systems at scale with comments like \"we can identify X with 95% accuracy\", a statement that may technically be correct, but seems designed to deliberately mislead an audience that's presumed to be innumerate. If you use, as a frame of reference, things at a personal scale, 95% might sound quite good. Even for something like HN's scale, 95% accurate spam detection that results in an immediate ban might be sort of alright. Anyway, even if it's not great, people who get incorrectly banned can just email Dan Gackle, who will unban them. As we noted when we looked at the numbers, 95% accurate detection at Twitter's scale would be horrible (and, indeed, the majority of DMs I get are obvious spam). Either you have to back off and only ban users in cases where you're extremely confident, or you ban all your users after not too long and, as companies like to handle support, appealing means that you'll get a response saying that \"your case was carefully reviewed and we have determined that you've violated our policies. This is final\", even for cases where any sort of cursory review would cause a reversal of the ban, like when you ban a user for impersonating themselves. And then at FB's scale, it's even worse and you'll ban all of your users even more quickly, so then you back off and we end up with things like 100k minors a day being exposed to \"photos of adult genitalia or other sexually abusive content\". The second area we looked at was support, which tends to get worse as companies get larger. At a high level, it's fair to say that companies don't care to provide decent support (with Amazon being somewhat of an exception here, especially with AWS, but even on the consumer side). Inside the system, there are individuals who care, but if you look at the fraction of resources expended on support vs. growth or even fun/prestige projects, support is an afterthought. Back when deepmind was training a StarCraft AI, it's plausible that Alphabet was spending more money playing Starcraft than on support agents (and, if not, just throw in one or two more big AI training projects and you'll be there, especially if you include the amortized cost of developing custom hardware, etc.). It's easy to see how little big companies care. All you have to do is contact support and get connected to someone who's paid $1/hr to respond to you in a language they barely know, attempting to help solve a problem they don't understand by walking through some flowchart, or appeal an issue and get told \"after careful review, we have determined that you have [done the opposite of what you actually did]\". In some cases, you don't even need to get that far, like when following Instagram's support instructions results in an infinite loop that takes you back where you started and the \"click here if this wasn't you link returns a 404\". I've run into an infinite loop like this once, with Verizon, and it persisted for at least six months. I didn't check after that, but I'd bet on it persisting for years. If you had an onboarding or sign-up page that had an issue like this, that would be considered a serious bug that people should prioritize because that impacts growth. But for something like account loss due to scammers taking over accounts, that might get fixed after months or years. Or maybe not. If you ever talk to people who work in support at a company that really cares about support, it's immediately obvious that they operate completely different from typical big tech company support, in terms of process as well as culture. Another way you can tell that big companies don't care about support is how often big company employees and execs who've never looked into how support is done or could be done will tell you that it's impossible to do better. When you talk to people who work on support at companies that do actually care about this, it's apparent that it can be done much better. While I was writing this post, I actually did support at a company that does support decently well (for a tech company, adjusted for size, I'd say they're well above 99%-ile), including going through the training and onboarding process for support folks. Executing anything well at scale is non-trivial, so I don't mean to downplay how good their support org is, but the most striking thing to me was how much of the effectiveness of the org naturally followed from caring about providing a good support experience for the user. A full discussion of what that means is too long to include here, so we'll look at this in more detail another time, but one example is that, when we look at how big company support responds, it's often designed to discourage the user from responding (\"this review is final\") or to justify, putatively to the user, that the company is doing an adequate job (\"this was not a purely automated process and each appeal was reviewed by humans in a robust process that ... \"). This company's training instructs you to do the opposite of the standard big company \"please go away\"-style and \"we did a great job and have a robust process, therefore complaints are invalid\"-style responses. For every anti-pattern you commonly see in support, the training tells you to do the opposite and discusses why the anti-pattern results in a bad user experience. Moreover, the culture has deeply absorbed these ideas (or rather, these ideas come out of the culture) and there are processes for ensuring that people really know what it means to provide good support and follow through on it, support folks have ways to directly talk to the developers who are implementing the product, etc. If people cared about doing good support, they could talk to people who work in support orgs that are good at helping users or even try working in one before explaining how it's impossible to do better, but this generally isn't done. Their company's support org leadership could do this as well, or do what I did and actually directly work in a support role in an effective support org, but this doesn't happen. If you're a cynic, this all makes sense. In the same way that cynics advise junior employees \"big company HR isn't there to help you; their job is to protect the company\", a cynic can credibly argue \"big company support isn't there to help the user; their job is to protect the company\", so of course big companies don't try to understand how companies that are good at supporting users do support because that's not what big company support is for. The third area we looked at was how it's impossible for people to agree on how a platform should operate and how people's biases mean that people don't understand how difficult a problem this is. For Americans, a prominent case of this are the left and right wing conspiracy theories that pop up every time some bug pseudo-randomly causes any kind of service disruption or banning. In a tweet, Ryan Greeberg joked: Come work at Twitter, where your bugs TODAY can become conspiracy theories of TOMORROW! In my social circles, people like to make fun of all of the absurd right-wing conspiracy theories that get passed around after some bug causes people to incorrectly get banned, causes the site not to load, etc., or even when some new ML feature correctly takes down a huge network of scam/spam bots, which also happens to reduce the follower count of some users. But of course this isn't unique to the right, and left-wing thought leaders and politicians come up with their own conspiracy theories as well. Putting all three of these together, worse detection of issues, worse support, and a harder time reaching agreement on policies, we end with the situation we noted at the start where, in a poll of my Twitter followers, people who mostly work in tech and are generally fairly technically savvy, only 2.6% of people thought that the biggest companies were the best at moderation and spam/fraud filtering, so it might seem a bit silly to spend so much time belaboring the point. When you sample the U.S population at large, a larger fraction of people say they believe in conspiracy theories like vaccines putting a microchip in you or that we never landed on the moon, and I don't spend my time explaining why vaccines do not actually put a microchip in you or why it's reasonable to think that we landed on the moon. One reason that would perhaps be reasonable is that I've been watching the \"only big companies can handle these issues\" rhetoric with concern as it catches on among non-technical people, like regulators, lawmakers, and high-ranking government advisors, who often listen to the listen to and then regurgitate nonsense. Maybe next time you run into a lay person who tells you that only the largest companies could possibly handle these issues, you can politely point out that there's very strong consensus the other way among tech folks5. If you're a founder or early-stage startup looking for an auth solution, PropelAuth is targeting your use case. Although they can handle other use cases, they're currently specifically trying to make life easier for pre-launch startups that haven't invested in an auth solution yet.

Appendix: techniques that only work at small scale This post has focused on the disadvantages of bigness, but we can also flip this around and look at the advantages of smallness. As mentioned, the best experiences I've had on platforms are a side effect of doing things that don't scale. One thing that can work well is to have a single person, with a single vision, handling the entire site or, when that's too big, a key feature of the site. I'm on a number of small discords that have good discussion and essentially zero scams, spam, etc. The strategy for this is simple; the owner of the channel reads every message and bans and scammers or spammers who show up. When you get to a bigger site, like lobste.rs, or even bigger like HN, that's too large for someone to read every message (well, this could be done for lobste.rs, but considering that it's a spare-time pursuit for the owner and the volume of messages, it's not reasonable to expect them to read every message in a short timeframe), but there's still a single person who provides the vision for what should happen, even if the sites are large enough that it's not reasonable to literally read every message. The \"no vehicles in the park\" problem doesn't apply here because a person decides what the policies should be. You might not like those policies, but you're welcome to find another small forum or start your own (and this is actually how lobste.rs got started — under HN's previous moderation regime, which was known for banning people who disagreed with them, Joshua Stein was banned for publicly disagreeing with an HN policy, so Joshua created lobsters (and then eventually handed it off to Peter Bhat Harkins). There's also this story about craigslist in the early days, as it was just getting big enough to have a serious scam and spam problem ... we were stuck at SFO for something like four hours and getting to spend half a workday sitting next to Craig Newmark was pretty awesome. I'd heard Craig say in interviews that he was basically just \"head of customer service\" for Craigslist but I always thought that was a throwaway self-deprecating joke. Like if you ran into Larry Page at Google and he claimed to just be the janitor or guy that picks out the free cereal at Google instead of the cofounder. But sitting next to him, I got a whole new appreciation for what he does. He was going through emails in his inbox, then responding to questions in the craigslist forums, and hopping onto his cellphone about once every ten minutes. Calls were quick and to the point \"Hi, this is Craig Newmark from craigslist.org. We are having problems with a customer of your ISP and would like to discuss how we can remedy their bad behavior in our real estate forums\". He was literally chasing down forum spammers one by one, sometimes taking five minutes per problem, sometimes it seemed to take half an hour to get spammers dealt with. He was totally engrossed in his work, looking up IP addresses, answering questions best he could, and doing the kind of thankless work I'd never seen anyone else do with so much enthusiasm. By the time we got on our flight he had to shut down and it felt like his giant pile of work got slightly smaller but he was looking forward to attacking it again when we landed. At some point, if sites grow, they get big enough that a person can't really own every feature and every moderation action on the site, but sites can still get significant value out of having a single person own something that people would normally think is automated. A famous example of this is how the Digg \"algorithm\" was basically one person: What made Digg work really was one guy who was a machine. He would vet all the stories, infiltrate all the SEO networks, and basically keep subverting them to keep the Digg front-page usable. Digg had an algorithm, but it was basically just a simple algorithm that helped this one dude 10x his productivity and keep the quality up. Google came to buy Digg, but figured out that really it's just a dude who works 22 hours a day that keeps the quality up, and all that talk of an algorithm was smoke and mirrors to trick the SEO guys into thinking it was something they could game (they could not, which is why front page was so high quality for so many years). Google walked. Then the founders realised if they ever wanted to get any serious money out of this thing, they had to fix that. So they developed \"real algorithms\" that independently attempted to do what this one dude was doing, to surface good/interesting content. ... It was a total shit-show ... The algorithm to figure out what's cool and what isn't wasn't as good as the dude who worked 22 hours a day, and without his very heavy input, it just basically rehashed all the shit that was popular somewhere else a few days earlier ... Instead of taking this massive slap to the face constructively, the founders doubled-down. And now here we are. ... Who I am referring to was named Amar (his name is common enough I don't think I'm outing him). He was the SEO whisperer and \"algorithm.\" He was literally like a spy. He would infiltrate the awful groups trying to game the front page and trick them into giving him enough info that he could identify their campaigns early, and kill them. All the while pretending to be an SEO loser like them. Etsy supposedly used the same strategy as well. Another class of advantage that small sites have over large ones is that the small site usually doesn't care about being large and can do things that you wouldn't do if you wanted to grow. For example, consider these two comments made in the midst of a large flamewar on HN My wife spent years on Twitter embroiled in a very long running and bitter political / rights issue. She was always thoughtful, insightful etc. She'd spend 10 minutes rewording a single tweet to make sure it got the real point across in a way that wasn't inflammatory, and that had a good chance of being persuasive. With 5k followers, I think her most popular tweets might get a few hundred likes. The one time she got drunk and angry, she got thousands of supportive reactions, and her followers increased by a large % overnight. And that scared her. She saw the way \"the crowd\" was pushing her. Rewarding her for the smell of blood in the water. I've turned off both the flags and flamewar detector on this article now, in keeping with the first rule of HN moderation, which is (I'm repeating myself but it's probably worth repeating) that we moderate HN less, not more, when YC or a YC-funded startup is part of a story ... Normally we would never late a ragestorm like this stay on the front page—there's zero intellectual curiosity here, as the comments demonstrate. This kind of thing is obviously off topic for HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html. If it weren't, the site would consist of little else. Equally obvious is that this is why HN users are flagging the story. They're not doing anything different than they normally would. For a social media site, low-quality high-engagement flamebait is one of the main pillars that drive growth. HN, which cares more about discussion quality than growth, tries to detect and suppress these (with exceptions like criticism of HN itself, of YC companies like Stripe, etc., to ensure a lack of bias). Any social media site that aims to grow does the opposite; they implement a ranked feed that puts the content that is most enraging and most engaging in front of the people its algorithms predict will be the most enraged and engaged by it. For example, let's say you're in a country with very high racial/religious/factonal tensions, with regular calls for violence, etc. What's the most engaging content? Well, that would be content calling for the death of your enemies, so you get things a livestream of someone calling for the death of the other faction and then grabbing someone and beating them shown to a lot of people. After all, what's more engaging than a beatdown of your sworn enemy? A theme of Broken Code is that someone will find some harmful content they want to suppress, but then get overruled because that would reduce engagement and growth. HN has no such goal, so it has no problem suppressing or eliminating content that HN deems to be harmful. Another thing you can do if growth isn't your primary goal is to deliberately make user-signups high friction. HN adds does a little bit of this by having a \"login\" link but not a \"sign up\" link, and sites like lobste.rs and metafilter do even more of this. Appendix: Theory vs. practice In the main doc, we noted that big company employees often say that it's impossible to provide better support for theoretical reason X, without ever actually looking into how one provides support or what companies that provide good support do. When the now-$1T were the size where many companies do provide good support, these companies also did not provide good support, so this doesn't seem to come from size since these huge companies didn't even attempt to provide good support, then or now. This theoretical, plausible sounding, reason doesn't really hold up in practice. This is generally the case for theoretical discussions on disceconomies of scale of large tech companies. Another example is an idea mentioned at the start of this doc, that being a larger target has a larger impact than having more sophisticated ML. A standard extension of this idea that I frequently hear is that big companies actually do have the best anti-spam and anti-fraud, but they're also subject to the most sophisticated attacks. I've seen this used as a justification for why big companies seem to have worst anti-spam and anti-fraud than a forum like HN. While it's likely true that big companies are subject to the most sophisticated attacks, if this whole idea held and it were the case that their systems were really good, it would be harder, in absolute terms, to spam or scam people on reddit and Facebook than on HN, but that's not the case at all. If you actually try to spam, it's extremely easy to do so on large platforms and the most obvious things you might try will often work. As an experiment, I made a new reddit account and tried to get nonsense onto the front page and found this completely trivial. Similarly it's completely trivial to take over someone's Facebook account and post obvious scams for months to years, with extremely markers that they're scams, many people replying in concern that the account has been taken over and is running scams (unlike working in support and spamming reddit, I didn't try taking over people's Facebook accounts, but given people's password practices, it's very easy to take over an account, and given how Facebook responds to these takeovers when a friend's account is taken over, we can see that attacks that do the most naive thing possible, with zero sophistication, are not defeated), etc. In absolute terms, it's actually more difficult to get spammy or scammy content in front of eyeballs on HN than it is on reddit or Facebook. The theoretical reason here is one that would be significant if large companies were even remotely close to doing the kind of job they could do with the resources they have, but we're not even close to being there. To avoid belaboring the point in this already very long document, I've only listed a couple of examples here, but I find this pattern to hold true of almost every counterargument I've heard on this topic. If you actually look into it a bit, these theoretical arguments are classic cocktail party ideas that have little to no connection to reality. A meta point here is that you absolutely cannot trust vaguely plausible sounding arguments from people on this since they virtually all of them fall apart when examined in practice. It seems quite reasonable to think that a business the size of reddit would have more sophisticated anti-spam systems than HN, which has a single person who both writes the code for the anti-spam systems and does the moderation. But the most naive and simplistic tricks you might use to put content on the front page work on reddit and don't work on HN. I'm not saying you can't defeat HN's system, but doing so would take a little bit of thought, which is not the case for reddit and Facebook. And likewise for support, where once you start talking to people about how to run a support org that's good for users, you immediately see that the most obvious things have not been seriously tried by big tech companies. Appendix: How much should we trust journalists' summaries of leaked documents? Overall, very little. As we discussed when we looked at the Cruise pedestrian accident report, almost every time I read a journalist's take on something (with rare exceptions like Zeynep), the journalist has a spin they're trying to put on the story and the impression you get from reading the story is quite different from the impression you get if you look at the raw source; it's fairly common that there's so much spin that the story says the opposite of what the source docs say. That's one issue. The full topic here is big enough that it deserves its own document, so we'll just look at two examples. The first is one we briefly looked at, when Eugene Zarashaw, a director at Facebook, testified in a Special Master’s Hearing. He said It would take multiple teams on the ad side to track down exactly the — where the data flows. I would be surprised if there’s even a single person that can answer that narrow question conclusively Eugene's testimony resulted in headlines like , \"Facebook Has No Idea What Is Going on With Your Data\", \"Facebook engineers admit there’s no way to track all the data it collects on you\" (with a stock photo of an overwhelmed person in a nest of cables, grabbing their head) and \"Facebook Engineers: We Have No Idea Where We Keep All Your Personal Data\", etc. Even without any technical knowledge, any unbiased person can plainly see that these headlines are inaccurate. There's a big difference between it taking work to figure out exactly where all data, direct and derived, for each user exists, and having no idea where the data is. If I Google, logged out with no cookies, Eugene Zarashaw facebook testimony, every single above the fold result I get is misleading, false, clickbait, like the above. For most people with relevant technical knowledge, who understand the kind of systems being discussed, Eugene Zarashaw's quote is not only not egregious, it's mundane, expected, and reasonable. Despite this lengthy disclaimer, there are a few reasons that I feel comfortable citing Jeff Horwitz's Broken Code as well as a few stories that cover similar ground. The first is that, if you delete all of the references to these accounts, the points in this doc don't really change, just like they wouldn't change if you delete 50% of the user stories mentioned here. The second is that, at least for me, the most key part is the attitudes on display and not the specific numbers. I've seen similar attitudes in companies I've worked for and heard about them inside companies where I'm well connected via my friends and I could substitute similar stories from my friends, but it's nice to be able to use already-public sources instead of using anonymized stories from my friends, so the quotes about attitude are really just a stand-in for other stories which I can verify. The third reason is a bit too subtle to describe here, so we'll look at that when I expand this disclaimer into a standalone document. If you're looking for work, Freshpaint is hiring (US remote) in engineering, sales, and recruiting. Disclaimer: I may be biased since I'm an investor, but they seem to have found product-market fit and are rapidly growing. Appendix: Erin Kissane on Meta in Myanmar Erin starts with But once I started to really dig in, what I learned was so much gnarlier and grosser and more devastating than what I’d assumed. The harms Meta passively and actively fueled destroyed or ended hundreds of thousands of lives that might have been yours or mine, but for accidents of birth. I say “hundreds of thousands” because “millions” sounds unbelievable, but by the end of my research I came to believe that the actual number is very, very large. To make sense of it, I had to try to go back, reset my assumptions, and try build up a detailed, factual understanding of what happened in this one tiny slice of the world’s experience with Meta. The risks and harms in Myanmar—and their connection to Meta’s platform—are meticulously documented. And if you’re willing to spend time in the documents, it’s not that hard to piece together what happened. Even if you never read any further, know this: Facebook played what the lead investigator on the UN Human Rights Council’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar (hereafter just “the UN Mission”) called a “determining role” in the bloody emergence of what would become the genocide of the Rohingya people in Myanmar.2 From far away, I think Meta’s role in the Rohingya crisis can feel blurry and debatable—it was content moderation fuckups, right? In a country they weren’t paying much attention to? Unethical and probably negligent, but come on, what tech company isn’t, at some point? As discussed above, I have not looked into the details enough to determine if the claim that Facebook played a \"determining role\" in genocide are correct, but at a meta-level (no pun intended), it seems plausible. Every comment I've seen that aims to be a direction refutation of Erin's position is actually pre-refuted by Erin in Erin's text, so it appears that very few people who are publicly commenting who disagree with Erin read the articles before commenting (or they've read them and failed to understand what Erin is saying) and, instead, are disagreeing based on something other than the actual content. It reminds me a bit of the responses to David Jackson's proof of the four color theorem. Some people thought it was, finally, a proof, and others thought it wasn't.. Something I found interesting at the time was that the people who thought it wasn't a proof had read the paper and thought it seemed flawed, whereas the people who thought it was a proof were going off of signals like David's track record or the prestige of his institution. At the time, without having read the paper myself, I guessed (with low confidence) that the proof was incorrect based on the meta-heuristic that thoughts from people who read the paper were stronger evidence than things like prestige. Similarly, I would guess that Erin's summary is at least roughly accurate and that Erin's endorsement of the UN HRC fact-finding mission is correct, although I have lower confidence in this than in my guess about the proof because making a positive claim like this is harder than finding a flaw and the area is one where evaluating a claim is significantly trickier. Unlike with Broken Code, the source documents are available here and it would be possible to retrace Erin's steps, but since there's quite a bit of source material and the claims that would need additional reading and analysis to really be convinced and those claims don't play a determining role in the correctness of this document, I'll leave that for somebody else. On the topic itself, Erin noted that some people at Facebook, when presented with evidence that something bad was happening, laughed it off as they simply couldn't believe that Facebook could be instrumental in something that bad. Ironically, this is fairly similar in tone and content to a lot of the \"refutations\" of Erin's articles which appear to have not actually read the articles. The most substantive objections I've seen are around the edges which, such as The article claims that \"Arturo Bejar\" was \"head of engineering at Facebook\", which is simply false. He appears to have been a Director, which is a manager title overseeing (typically) less than 100 people. That isn't remotely close to \"head of engineering\". What Erin actually said was ... Arturo Bejar, one of Facebook’s heads of engineering So the objection is technically incorrect in that it was not said that Arturo Bejar was head of engineering. And, if you read the entire set of articles, you'll see references like \"Susan Benesch, head of the Dangerous Speech Project\" and \"the head of Deloitte in Myanmar\", so it appears that the reason that Erin said that \"one of Facebook’s heads of engineering\" is that Erin is using the term head colloquially here (and note that the it isn't capitalized, as a title might be), to mean that Arturo was in charge of something. There is a form of the above objection that's technically correct — for an engineer at a big tech company, the term Head of Engineering will generally call to mind an executive who all engineers transitively report into (or, in cases where there are large pillars, perhaps one of a few such people). Someone who's fluent in internal tech company lingo would probably not use this phrasing, even when writing for lay people, but this isn't strong evidence of factual errors in the article even if, in an ideal world, journalists would be fluent in the domain-specific connotations of every phrase. The person's objection continues with I point this out because I think it calls into question some of the accuracy of how clearly the problem was communicated to relevant people at Facebook. It isn't enough for someone to tell random engineers or Communications VPs about a complex social problem. On the topic of this post, diseconomies of scale, this objection, if correct, actually supports the post. According to Arturo's LinkedIn, he was \"the leader for Integrity and Care Facebook\", and the book Broken Code discusses his role at length, which is very closely related to the topic of Meta in Myanmar. Arturo is not, in fact, a \"random engineers or Communications VP\". Anway, Erin documents that Facebook was repeatedly warned about what was happening, for years. These warnings went well beyond the standard reporting of bad content and fake accounts (although those were also done), and included direct conversations with directors, VPs, and other leaders. These warnings were dismissed and it seems that people thought that their existing content moderation systems were good enough, even in the face of fairly strong evidence that this was not the case. Reuters notes that one of the examples Schissler gives Meta was a Burmese Facebook Page called, “We will genocide all of the Muslims and feed them to the dogs.” 48 None of this seems to get through to the Meta employees on the line, who are interested in…cyberbullying. Frenkel and Kang write that the Meta employees on the call “believed that the same set of tools they used to stop a high school senior from intimidating an incoming freshman could be used to stop Buddhist monks in Myanmar.”49 Aela Callan later tells Wired that hate speech seemed to be a “low priority” for Facebook, and that the situation in Myanmar, “was seen as a connectivity opportunity rather than a big pressing problem.”50 The details make this sound worse than a small excerpt, so I recommend reading the entire thing, but with respect to the discussion about resources, a key issue is that even after Meta decided to take some kind of action, the result was: As the Burmese civil society people in the private Facebook group finally learn, Facebook has a single Burmese-speaking moderator—a contractor based in Dublin—to review everything that comes in. The Burmese-language reporting tool is, as Htaike Htaike Aung and Victoire Rio put it in their timeline, “a road to nowhere.\" Since this was 2014, it's not fair to say that Meta could've spent the $50B metaverse dollars and hired 1.6 million moderators, but in 2014, it was still the 4th largest tech company in the world, worth $217B, with a net profit of $3B/yr, Meta would've \"only\" been able to afford something like 100k moderators and support staff if paid at a globally very generous loaded cost of $30k/yr (e.g., Jacobin notes that Meta's Kenyan moderators are paid $2/hr and don't get benefits). Myanmar's share of the global population was 0.7% and, let's say that you consider a developing genocide to be low priority and don't think that additional resources should be deployed to prevent or stop it and want to allocate a standard moderation share, then we have \"only\" have capacity for 700 generously paid moderation and support staff for Myanmar. On the other side of the fence, there actually were 700 people: in the years before the coup, it already had an internal adversary in the military that ran a professionalized, Russia-trained online propaganda and deception operation that maxed out at about 700 people, working in shifts to manipulate the online landscape and shout down opposing points of view. It’s hard to imagine that this force has lessened now that the genocidaires are running the country. These folks didn't have the vaunted technology that Zuckerberg says that smaller companies can't match, but it turns out you don't need billions of dollars of technology when it's 700 on 1 and the 1 is using tools that were developed for a different purpose. As you'd expect if you've ever interacted with the reporting system for a huge tech company, from the outside, nothing people tried worked: They report posts and never hear anything. They report posts that clearly call for violence and eventually hear back that they’re not against Facebook’s Community Standards. This is also true of the Rohingya refugees Amnesty International interviews in Bangladesh In the 40,000 word summary, Erin also digs through whistleblower reports to find things like …we’re deleting less than 5% of all of the hate speech posted to Facebook. This is actually an optimistic estimate—previous (and more rigorous) iterations of this estimation exercise have put it closer to 3%, and on V&I [violence and incitement] we’re deleting somewhere around 0.6%…we miss 95% of violating hate speech. and [W]e do not … have a model that captures even a majority of integrity harms, particularly in sensitive areas … We only take action against approximately 2% of the hate speech on the platform. Recent estimates suggest that unless there is a major change in strategy, it will be very difficult to improve this beyond 10-20% in the short-medium term and While Hate Speech is consistently ranked as one of the top abuse categories in the Afghanistan market, the action rate for Hate Speech is worryingly low at 0.23 per cent. To be clear, I'm not saying that Facebook has a significantly worse rate of catching bad content than other platforms of similar or larger size. As we noted above, large tech companies often have fairly high false positive and false negative rates and have employees who dismiss concerns about this, saying that things are fine. Appendix: elsewhere Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing's On Nonscalability: The Living World Is Not Amenable to Precision-Nested Scales Glen Weyl on radical solutions to the concentration of corporate power Zvi's collection of Quotes from Moral Mazes Appendix: Moderation and filtering fails Since I saw Zuck's statement about how only large companies (and the larger the better) can possibly do good moderation, anti-fraud, anti-spam, etc., I've been collecting links I run across when doing normal day-to-browsing of failures by large companies. If I deliberately looked for failures, I'd have a lot more. And, for some reason, some companies don't really trigger my radar for this so, for example, even though I see stories about AirBnB issues all the time, it didn't occur to me to collect them until I started writing this post, so there are only a few AirBnB fails here, even though they'd be up there with Uber in failure count if I actually recorded the links I saw. These are so frequent that, out of eight draft readers, at least two draft readers ran into an issue while reading the draft of this doc. Peter Bhat Harkins reported: Well, I received a keychron keyboard a few days ago. I ordered a used K1 v5 (Keychron does small, infrequent production runs so it was out of stock everywhere). After some examination, I've received a v4. It's the previous gen mechanical switch instead of the current optical switch. Someone apparently peeled off the sticker with the model and serial number and one key stabilizer is broken from wear, which strongly implies someone bought a v5 and returned a v4 they already owned. Apparently this is a common scam on Amazon now. In the other case, an anonymous reader created a Gmail account to used as a shared account for them and their partner, so they could get shared emails from local services. I know a number of people who've done this and this usually works fine, but in their case, after they used this email to set up a few services, Google decided that their account was suspicious: Verify your identity We’ve detected unusual activity on the account you’re trying to access. To continue, please follow the instructions below. Provide a phone number to continue. We’ll send a verification code you can use to sign in. Providing the phone number they used to sign up for the account resulted in This phone number has already been used too many times for verification. For whatever reason, even though this number was provided at account creation, using this apparently illegal number didn't result in the account being banned until it had been used for a while and the email address had been used to sign up for some services. Luckily, these were local services by small companies, so this issue could be fixed by calling them up. I've seen something similar happen with services that don't require you to provide a phone number on sign-up, but then lock and effectively ban the account unless you provide a phone number later, but I've never seen a case where the provided phone number turned out to not work after a day or two. The message above can be read two ways, the other way being that the phone number was allowed but had just recently been used to receive too many verification codes but, in recent history, the phone number had only once been used to receive a code, and that was the verification code necessary to attach a (required) phone number to the account in the first place. I also had a quality control failure from Amazon, when I ordered a 10 pack of Amazon Basics power strips and the first one I pulled out had its cable covered in solder. I wonder what sort of process could leave solder, likely lead-based solder (although I didn't test it) all over the outside of one of these and wonder if I need to wash every Amazon Basics electronics item I get if I don't want lead dust getting all over my apartment. And, of course, since this is constant, I had many spam emails get through Gmail's spam filter and hit my inbox, and multiple ham emails get filtered into spam, including the classic case where I emailed someone and their reply to me went to spam; from having talked to them about it previously, I have no doubt that most of my draft readers who use Gmail also had something similar happen to them and that this is so common they didn't even find it worth remarking on. Anyway, below, in a few cases, I've mentioned when commenters blame the user even though the issue is clearly not the user's fault. I haven't done this even close to exhaustively, so the lack of such a comment from me shouldn't be read as the lack of the standard \"the user must be at fault\" response from people. Google \"I had to get the NY attorney general to write them a letter before they would actually respond to my support requests so that I could properly file my taxes\" Google photo search for gorilla returns photos of black people, fixed after Twitter thread about this goes viral; 3 years later, there are stories in the press about how Google fixed this by blocking search results for the terms \"gorilla\", \"chimp\", \"chimpanzee\", and \"monkey\" and has not unblocked the terms On 2024-01-06, I tried uploading a photo of a gorilla and searching for gorilla, which returned no results both immediately after the upload as well as a few weeks later, so this still appears to be blocked?

the carrier the phone is locked to agrees that the phone is incorrectly carrier locked, but they can't do anything about it since the original purchaser of the phone would have to call the carrier, but apparently the warranty replacement is a locked, used, phone Possibly due to the reddit thread, Google support agrees to swap user's phone, but support continues to insist that the phone is not carrier locked Malware uses Google OAuth to hijack accounts Google claims they've mitigated this for all accounts that were compromised, which could be true GCP account suspended for no discernable reason after years of use Support was useless, but since the user used to work at Google, they emailed a former co-worker who sent an internal email, which caused the issue to get fixed immediately Obviously fake Google reviews for movie not removed for quite some time (obviously fake because many reviews copy+paste the exact same text) Google doesn't detect obviously fake restaurant reviews I've noticed this as well locally — a new restaurant will have 100+ 5 star reviews, almost all of which look extremely fake; these reviews generally don't get removed, even years later Owner and developer at SaaS app studio 7 out of 100 apps (that use the same code) start getting rejected from app store The claimed reason is that the apps allow user generated content (UGC) and therefore need a way to block and report the content, but the apps already have this The developer keeps emailing support, explaining that they already have this and support keeps responding with nonsense like \"We confirm that your app ... does not contain functionality to report objectionable content ... For more information or a refresher, we strongly recommend that you review our e-learning course on UGC before resubmission.\" All attempts to escalate were also rejected, e.g., \"Can you escalate this?\" was responded to with \"Unfortunately, we do not handle this kind of concern. You may continue to communicate with the appropriate team for further assistance in resolving your issue. Please understand that I am not part of the review team so I'm not able to give further information about your concern.

If you don't have any other concerns, I will now have to end our chat to assist other developers. I apologize and thank you for understanding. Have a great day. Bye!\" Multiple developers suggest that instead of interacting with Google support as if anyone actually pays attention or cares, you should re-submit your app with some token change, such as incrementing an internal build number; because Google's review process is nonsense, even serious concerns can be bypassed this way. The idea is that it's a mistake to think that the content of their messages makes any sense at all and that you're dealing with anything resembling a rational entity (see also.

    "commentBody": "Diseconomies of scale in fraud, spam, support, and moderation (danluu.com)230 points by davidmckenna 10 hours agohidepastfavorite156 comments BrenBarn 3 hours agoI think the post underestimates the scope of these problems. It touches on it briefly, but I've mostly come to believe that it is in general bad for companies to become extremely large. It's not just an issue of content moderation. One reason that the article does touch on is the detachment from support. Large companies no longer need to care about the individual consumer, so they stop doing so. A sort of corollary for this is the tendency for large companies to shift from \"doing what they do\" to protecting their market position. That means spending more time on non-core activities, and in some cases even trying to expand into totally unrelated markets (as seen with large conglomerates). It is only when we talk about \"economics\" in the sense of money-making for an individual company that \"economies of scale\" are a good thing. In the sense of benefit to the overall economy, to the society in which that economy sits, or to humanity in general, virtually all economies of scale are actually harmful. I think we should view economies of scale like the rampant growth of grass or weeds: they are natural phenomena, but that doesn't mean they're good, and in fact for most practical purposes they need to be actively opposed. It's natural for grass to grow, and if it doesn't, it may indicate a problem, but you should still cut the grass every so often. Likewise it is natural for companies to grow, but big companies should regularly be broken up simply because they have become big. reply jakewins 3 hours agoparent> In the sense of benefit to the overall economy, to the society in which that economy sits, or to humanity in general, virtually all economies of scale are actually harmful You had me until here. Economies of scale in commodities is the thing that makes it so we don’t have to do sustenance farming and everyone gets to have sewn clothes on :) There’s truth in both sides there - we want nail production to not be done by hand, but also real humans with power to change things to answer the phone when we call support. reply BrenBarn 2 hours agorootparentI guess I forgot to repeat the part about \"extremely large\" there. But I mean like \"all economies of scale beyond a certain point\". In any case, I'm not sure I agree that economies of scale are the thing keeping food on the table. Like, yes, we want nails to be made in some efficient way, but that's not what I mean by \"economies of scale\". What I'm talking about is the size of the companies involved. If there are 10 factories making nails, I'd rather have them be run by 10 different companies than one. And you might be able to convince me that 9 or 8 or even 5 companies is reasonable, but not one or two. The process that the companies use can involve something that you might call an \"economy of scale\" in the sense that you need to be making X number of nails before it becomes feasible to shift from artisans to factories. But you have to make sure that the economies of scale are facilitating the making of nails rather than the making of money for the nail companies. reply jakewins 5 minutes agorootparentI’m being unnecessarily confrontational because I’m having a bad day, sorry, that’s not helpful. I would say this: I agree with you that massive faceless monopolies with no accountability are terrible, and often a direct consequence of economies of scale. It is also, simultaneously, true that the labour saving effects - human hours spent per calorie of food or pair of socks - is a number of orders of magnitude such that modern society (ie the not starving/not freezing part of it) could not exist without it. These two things are simultaneously true, which is what makes the problem hard; we want one effect of economies of scale and not the other. reply ric2b 5 minutes agorootparentprevYou're not using the common definition of \"economy of scale\" and that is leading to confusion. Maybe use \"mega-corporations\" or something like that? Your mention of 9 companies vs 2 also tells me you're trying to describe oligopolies. reply Anotheroneagain 2 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure about that though. Ready to wear clothing is obviously inferior to tailored clothes, and it's not clear to what extent it's actually cheaper, and how much it abuses cheap labor. There may be an optimal scale for everything, and you start losing once you exceed it. reply jakewins 2 hours agorootparentTailored vs ready-made is a rounding error in the economies of scale involved in making clothes - both will use factory made fabric, dyed with factory dyes, woven from factory thread, made from factory farm cotton, grown from factory fertilizer, made from massive scale fracked natural gas, produced with millions of tonnes of factory steel, mined from factory mines.. The economies of scale that put food on your table and mine and clothe our kids - for all the horrors - will not be replaced by artisans doing small batch t-shirts from yard-grown cotton using hand made tools. reply Anotheroneagain 1 hour agorootparent\"will not be replaced by artisans doing small batch t-shirts from yard-grown cotton using hand made tools.\" That isn't what I'm talking about. There is a lot between that and transporting everything multiple times across the globe just for the sake of making it as large scale as possible. What is the gain after you can reliably feed a few looms? There are no better tools by the way. It's people sitting behind sewing machines, just on the other side of the planet. reply jakewins 11 minutes agorootparentSorry I’m having a crap day; you’re totally right there’s a ton of gradients between “one mega factory makes all t-shirts” and “we all make clothes ourselves with hand made cotton thread.” I think my argument was mostly like - don’t throw out the baby with the bath water; economies of scale are a real thing that brings us real benefits, and that should go in the scale too. reply kombookcha 51 minutes agorootparentprevYou're framing the above poster as an anarcho-primitivist for saying that we would be better off with 5 global conglomerates controlling t-shirt production than 2. I don't think obfuscating \"there is a dropoff point in size where economies of scale stop being better for humanity and start getting worse\" with \"we must switch to artisinal backyard t-shirt making\" is really steelmanning here. reply ric2b 2 minutes agorootparentThe poster is against oligopolies but is using the term \"economy of scale\" instead, which is incorrect and causes confusion. XorNot 14 minutes agorootparentprevNo he's pointing out the poster hasn't defined any of their terms accurately enough to really be saying anything. The sheer size and scale of the economy we live in, and it's benefits, is so big that people tend to make sweeping pronouncements without really understanding their impact. The point about industrially produced cotton is exactly right: people pick some niche thing they view as \"wasteful\" and vastly over estimate it's importance or impact. reply exe34 2 hours agorootparentprevWhy stop at tailoring?

When will the cost of transport and distribution overtake any gains? What is there to gain after all that gets big enough to produce a reasonable assortment of fabrics? reply jonathanlydall 4 hours agoprevThe problem with internet fraud is that no one is really trying to make the fraudsters accountable for their actions, instead what they’re doing is essentially “shoo’ing them away”, and fraudsters after being shoo’ed away simply try again until they, almost invariably, eventually do succeed. Subsequently, the industry of fraud is generally lucrative and is thus constantly growing. When I worked at Blizzard, there were many mechanisms in place to spot fraudulent credit card transactions and cancel them before they actually billed the card holder, but there was no process for reporting the fraudsters to prevent them doing the same thing again tomorrow. This is probably the same strategy that every company does, because there is no practical action any company can do to try make fraudsters accountable and thus discourage them from simply trying again. So the problem of fraud is getting ever bigger and increasingly unmanageable and out of control. The problem is a non-trivial political one, governments need to create task forces to work to reduce the size of the fraud industry, perhaps by catching fraudsters and making them accountable. The problem is even harder than simple political will though, because it’s cross jurisdictional, meaning governments of different countries all need to work together on this. This may seem impossible at the moment, but I believe until it is achieved fraud is only going to get increasingly worse. reply Nextgrid 19 minutes agoparent> The problem is a non-trivial political one It's even less trivial when corporation-on-consumer fraud has been normalized (see dark patterns, or companies outright taking money for no/sub-par service).

One of my favorite things was to redirect bounce messages that were targeted at innocent FastMail customers to the actual spammer's email address -- which I found stopped the spam from them very quickly, once their inbox filled up with thousands of bounce messages!

Either way, there are agencies who's directives are about dealing with international fraud. Global commerce comes with global agreements. 1) There's certainly cards coming from non completely sanctioned countries. This means legal pathways. 2) If fraud is prevalent and these numbers can be tracked it makes for better policy decisions. It's not uncommon knowledge that we don't have the best privacy and security. This is at least ammo to do something about it. reply godelski 3 hours agoparentprevThis is why I have a problem with a lot of the legal structure and incentives. If you measure in number of arrests you aren't solving the problems. I'm not sure there's any good metric to measure that. To take an analogy I'll mention the drug war. The main target was always low level drug dealers and users. They're easy to arrest and easy to say you're doing something. But they are fairly inconsequential to the business of selling drugs and thus the availability on the streets. But it's orders of magnitude harder to go after the root of the problem. I don't want to detract this conversation with the other aspects or conspiracies (real or contrived), but just focus on the incentive structures. I think the same is here. Blizzard gets no short term reward for reporting fraudulent activity. It's hard to know if they get long term. But at the end of the day it would be the right thing to do. That's what matters. Doing the right thing. Move fast and break things it's a great strategy. But it can't be used in isolation. If it is you're left with a trail of destruction which never gets cleaned up. It's hard to quantify objectives and so every objective function is misaligned. You need to rely on humans to see through that and correct the course as best they can. You need both the people pushing to move fast and the people pushing to slow down and repair. There's a harmony in that competition. Pick your camp but recognize that there's value in the other one too. reply Nextgrid 22 minutes agorootparentWhen it comes to the war on drugs there's a perverse incentive problem - said war provides endless amounts of easy to catch/prosecute crime which can be used to meet & exceed their performance targets without much effort. So there might not be too much incentive to kill this \"cash cow\" of low-level users/dealers by actually curtailing upstream supply. This might not be too different from the payment anti-fraud industry (which is just varying degrees of snake oil). There are solutions that can be implemented such as actually strong two-factor authentication that could cut down on payment fraud dramatically but this would significantly reduce demand for this industry, so a lot of the field has a monetary incentive to keep the underlying primitives not so secure as to keep demand for their snake-oil. reply Anotheroneagain 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't think so, on the contrary, they ignore the dealers in vain hope to catch some \"big fish\", but there are no big fishes there. reply godelski 46 minutes agorootparentI find that a strange comparison. Certainly there are bigger fish to fry. In both drugs and credit cards there is a whole ecosystem. Cards probably more straight forward as these are typically being sold on websites and you thus have a clear marketplace. Which I'd differentiate a marketplace from a dealer on a corner. Go after the people who are the generators. That's people making the drugs or people stealing the cards in the first place.

The thing fell apart only around 2016 with the rise of apps and the inflection point was a complete misery hard to forget: drivers taking your order and not moving, drivers calling you to ask about the destination point and then refusing to go there, drivers telling you that you should've put the destination point into comments, driver asking you to cancel the order and pay them in cash etc. However the apps were able to price-dump for around three years until all small players died, then hiked the prices back again. I'm not saying anything about the \"typical experience back then\" however I do know that in right circumstances (high demand, cheap supply, no lock-in) competition between independent small companies can have remarkable results. reply tsimionescu 1 hour agorootparentI think this varied greatly between different places. In my own country&city, Uber came in as a premium-ish option initially (regular taxis were already dirt cheap), with nicer cars and excellent service. Of course over time things normalized back down to the same sorts of cars and the same drivers, but the first few years it was beautiful, not a race to the bottom. Still, even today (and with Uber mostly having lost the market to Bolt), the average ride is much, much better than the average taxi ride ever was (and I was a regular user of both). The cars are still cleaner, and it's virtually unheard of to have drivers try to overcharge or otherwise scam you - which were both regular occurrences with taxis. reply throwaway2037 6 hours agorootparentprevDid you report these drivers to the app owner?

It's time to acknowledge the company that walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, is a duck. If Facebook was so inclined to change their governance model, a plethora of prior art exists, in public sector government implementations, for them to build from.

This is a n=1 experience but I wonder whether Facebook is 'falling apart' into these groups. reply aldonius 7 hours agorootparentMakes sense to me. The admins of the groups are responsible for managing the discussion in groups including frontline anti-spam against the porn bots and the shoe bots and whatever. So it's semi-distributed moderation. (Assuming group admins care, but if they don't then users just abandon the group.) Compared to e.g. Reddit, FB groups aren't as world readable or writable as subreddits are so you don't really get that classic inter-subreddit drama. Where global moderation is still needed from FB's perspective is when group activities start spilling outside of that group, e.g. because they're coordinating extremist activity. This probably won't be the result of user reports though.

I set up and tested their documented best practices, and had no issues corresponding with a lot of people. Spam is not an issue in practice. Two basic filters drop 95% of spam without scanning the content, and an open source reputation+content engine drops the rest to the tune of maybe 1 spam a day.

Small platforms have way less fraud because they are way less valuable to exploit, in general. And that's caused by _the very fact that they are small_. The big platforms actually are radically more competent at anti-fraud / anti-spam / etc, but the scope of their operations make them such juicy targets that there is a lot of it anyways. It the entire world of fraudsters against Amazon, or Google, or Facebook. That's a highly unequal battle and it's surprising how well the platforms fare, all things considered. reply alexey-salmin 8 hours agoparentI don't see any mistake. > Small platforms have way less fraud because they are way less valuable to exploit, in general.

If their business model (scale above everything) results in shitty customer experience I don't really care how competent they are. They are fighting the problem they created themselves: a platform too valuable for scammers. reply 8note 7 hours agorootparent> If their business model (scale above everything) results in shitty customer experience I don't really care how competent they are. It's a tradeoff. If your customer service is good such that more people shop there, there will be more fraud attempts overall. It's not that a platform is too valuable for scammers, it's that a platforms is valuable at all. All platform value is value for scammers, and the most useful platform will also have the most scammers on it reply alexey-salmin 7 hours agorootparentThis is like saying that everything (including scam attempts) is proportional to the scale so the scale doesn't really matter. It's not true. Scale bring synergy and reduces costs. But it's a two-way road which works for scams too: scamming one big platform and fighting one anti-fraud system is ten times more cost-efficient than adjusting to ten smaller ones. reply pdonis 7 hours agoparentprevIt's not just that the big platforms provide a much stronger incentive for fraudsters. It's that providing that stronger incentive is not a bug for the big platforms, it's a feature. It goes hand in hand with their business model, which is to sell access to as large a pool of users as possible. > The big platforms actually are radically more competent at anti-fraud / anti-spam / etc No, they're not. They are purposely incompetent at those things, because it's part of their business model. They cannot implement actual competence (which would mean providing sufficient actual human support to deal with the volume of mistakes that their automated algorithms make), not because it would cost too much (the article quite correctly points out that their huge profits provide plenty of cash to pay for human moderation), but because it would reduce their value to their actual customers, who are not their users. reply CityOfThrowaway 7 hours agorootparentI don't see how spam or fraud brings value to advertisers (which is what I assume you're talking about?) or any one else for that matter (other than the spammer/fraudster). Perhaps I can squint and see how an email platform like Gmail could be read as a protection racket, but I don't see it in other platforms. reply Nextgrid 4 minutes agorootparent> I don't see how spam or fraud brings value to advertisers Spam and fraud still generates \"engagement\" (whether the bad content itself or the people getting outraged by it) which contributes to the numbers they use to attract & bill advertisers. The modus operandi of these platforms when it comes to moderation is to quickly take down whatever will get them in trouble fast with the law (DMCA takedowns, CSAM), or what will provide ammunition for attack pieces in the media (pornography, sometimes drug- or weapon-related content). But anything else is fair game to stay and earn \"engagement\" even in the face of user-submitted reports. In the unlikely event that this \"anything else\" does get reported on in some big media, then it'll be taken down and they'll issue an apology and how they will do better in the future, and everyone seems to buy it no matter how many times they've done this. reply pdonis 6 hours agorootparentprev> I don't see how spam or fraud brings value to advertisers It doesn't; that's not the point. The point is, as I said, that the big platforms make money by selling access to as large a pool of users as possible, and that requires them to not crack down on spammers and fraudsters--because at their scale, it is impossible for them to reliably distinguish the spammers and fraudsters from the rest of their users. So they can't crack down on spammers and fraudsters without also reducing the size of their user pool and thereby killing their business model. The article explicitly talks about this: Either you have to back off and only ban users in cases where you're extremely confident, or you ban all your users after not too long and, as companies like to handle support, appealing means that you'll get a response saying that \"your case was carefully reviewed and we have determined that you've violated our policies. This is final\", even for cases where any sort of cursory review would cause a reversal of the ban, like when you ban a user for impersonating themselves. And then at FB's scale, it's even worse and you'll ban all of your users even more quickly, so then you back off and we end up with things like 100k minors a day being exposed to \"photos of adult genitalia or other sexually abusive content\". reply tareqak 8 hours agoparentprevOK, fraud exists. Irrespective of whether or not a platform is small or large, can they make their customer whole 100% of the time? Why or why not? reply CityOfThrowaway 8 hours agorootparentTo take your question seriously – one of the primary surface areas for fraud is exploiting the customer service function. Just to work one (real) example: 1. Buy expensive face cream from Amazon 2. Take out the expensive stuff and replace it with junk 3. Complain to Amazon that you got junk and need a refund. The challenge here becomes obvious. Even in claims where the customers was allegedly a victim, some portion of those customers are fraudsters. So any policy that results in a large, profitable company will likely result in something less than 100% of legitimate fraud cases from being satisfactorily resolved. In the case of the small business, they are very unlikely to be targeted by industrial scale fraud and will probably just be able to solve this with personal relationships and human judgment. That said, the price you pay the small operator is very likely to be meaningfully higher than the price of the scaled operator. If you care more about having near 100% probability of having fraud/abuse cases addressed than you care about benefiting from the economies of scale, then yeah, go with the small operator. In things like communities, my general sense is that there is almost no beneficial economies of scale. So I like to hang out in smaller places. But in things like information retrieval (ie. Google), the benefits are usually worth it for me to use that. reply tareqak 7 hours agorootparentThe kind of experiences that the post and I am talking about are where the platform user or the customer end are dissatisfied by the platform's conduct. The question of the company itself being defrauded by some number of customers and having to defend against that as it becomes increasing larger is definitely valid and difficult to tackle at scale. However, I think it is a totally separate one. I do not think it is a necessity for the company to compromise the ability to make any one dissatisfied customer whole just because they are being targeted by a whole lot of fraudsters all at once. The company might have to increased their costs on their products to pay for things like additional training, tamper-evident packaging, improving supply chain management, and so on. reply CityOfThrowaway 7 hours agorootparentThey aren't separate questions, and there is a trade-off between protecting themselves and attempting to do right by good-faith customers. The correct amount of fraud the platforms tolerate against themselves is definitely >0%, and it's for the reason you're identifying. It seems that you're assuming it's obvious to identify good-faith consumers and do right by them. In some cases that's true. If you're a loyal, repeat customer of Amazon's they will basically just do whatever you ask them (within reason). But there are many cases where the act of discriminating between fraudster and Good Samaritan is in fact the whole of the challenge. Indeed, one of the most common exploits is to hack the account of good customers and abuse merchants that way. There's a dark, dark underbelly of crime out there. And the cost of that is borne by all of us in occasionally-less-than-good customer experiences. reply pdonis 7 hours agorootparentprev> can they make their customer whole 100% of the time? They do make their customers (i.e., the companies who pay them for access to their users) whole. But their users (at least the vast majority of them) are not their customers; they don't pay for the service. (It's true, as the article points out, that even paid support at the big platforms is very poor, but that's because the money involved is still not even rounding error compared to the astronomical profits being made from selling access to their users.) They can't make their users whole, or even a significant fraction of them, without breaking their business model. That's why they don't do it. reply CityOfThrowaway 7 hours agorootparentThose who have run meaningful amounts of ads in The Platforms will know quite well that they are very frequently defrauded and almost never made whole. There is a fair (but tolerable) amount of click-fraud, etc that you basically factor as a cost of doing busines.

Thats my takeaway here is that we should as a matter of regulation / spirit of market competition lean on incentivizing creating medium (mid?) size companies worth collective $100 billion+ than a few giant trillion dollar corporations, as it relates to majority software companies. I think with hardware it’s A bit different when it comes to economies of scale so I don’t know how that could break down and I don’t want to include that for the sake of argument but there could be something there too reply Geisterde 8 hours agoparentIt is the general consensus that competition in the market place is good for consumers and propels business to find creative solutions that create value in the econony. I would say that isnt always the case, Rockefeller had something like 90% market share before litigation of antitrust began, by the time the case was adjucated their market share had already slipped; what this indicates is that even when one party holds 90% of market share (and probably total wealth for that matter), the market will eventually cut them down to size. At the same time, rockefeller was responsible for bringing a groundbreaking innovation to society. So, it was good that initially all that capital flowed to him, because he was using it to move society forward (at least in this regard), and it was also good to see that capital flow away on its own, because it was needed elsewhere. I would also point out that the centralization of companies into todays megacorps is influenced by many factors, economies of scale may be one, but so are intellectual property laws (we really dont need them!). In fact, I would venture a guess that most regulation is written by the companies that are being regulated, that keeps competition at bay, and they wont regulate themselves downwards in the food chain. Finally, I would say the centralization really took place during WWI/WW2, it was convenient for the government to shout orders at a whole 3 people to build tanks instead of automobiles; this centralization is a strategic goal of the united states government, and enacting it through secret deals (rather than law) is a preferable method to preserve state secrecy. reply pixl97 8 hours agoparentprevOtherwise summed up as \"Monocultures suck\" reply graemep 8 hours agoparentprevThat is true in any market, not just software.

On the ad front, anyone who runs an ad for a third party should have to be able to produce the actual name and address of the advertiser on request, or accept responsibility for the contents of the ad.

Fraudsters will have forums full of ID fraud services to fix their KYC problem. Big platforms won't blink at the costs involved with verification. Fraudsters will simply rinse and repeat when their scheme collapses. Normal business people will have yet another headache. Corner cases will exist where users are condemned to unending bureaucratic limbo. A human support person, if they exist at all, will repeat a meaningless mantra, \"I'm sorry sir, we've been unable to verify your identity with the documents provided. This is a compliance requirement as per the online platform safety act of 2026\" All the while, scammers will be churning out new KYC'd accounts. The process will have nothing to do with safety, as the platform will only care about complying with the new regulation. Don't forget that Amazon still earns fees from each sale. Large platforms will enjoy the compliance requirements as an additional barrier to entry for competitors. Not to mention the inevitable day when all of that personal data is released. Breeches exposed for all to see. Another headache the fraudsters won't have. The regulars of the ID fraud forum will probably enjoy it. I could start my own VC fund if I had $1 for every post on HN claiming, \"It is so simple and easy!

One of the advantages these large platforms enjoy over smaller ones is their ability to pass the buck on consumer law, to their benefit and to the scammers. By making it the platform's liability, always, this could start to change. If the companies that think of themselves as large 'platforms' end up erecting barriers to legitimate business in the process, then that becomes their problem and is likely to result in more competition in the market from companies who act as actual stores themselves.

One could easily write a highly analogous book, Seeing like a Tech Company about what's illegible to companies that scale up, at least as companies are run today. A simple example of this is that, in many video games, including ones made by game studios that are part of a $3T company, it's easy to get someone suspended or banned by having a bunch of people report the account for bad behavior. What's legible to the game company is the rate of reports and what's not legible is the player's actual behavior (it could be legible, but the company chooses not to have enough people or skilled enough people examine actual behavior); and many people have reported similar bannings with social media companies. When it comes to things like anti-fraud systems, what's legible to the company tends to be fairly illegible to humans, even humans working on the anti-fraud systems themselves. I think legibility is one aspect of it, but I think another could very well be empathy. If you want to support a user who has a problem, then you have to want to help them and follow through.

Politicians don't mean moderation as in everyone is being civil with each other or garbage results. That isn't a political issue. They mean things like supporting the local censorship regime which is usually country-specific. So from a political perspective, more centralisation is the only way to successfully implement moderation. Because moderation doesn't mean \"behave to community standards\" - it means \"comply with politician's standards\". Ie, moderating what people can say as part of their legal and political engagement with society. I recall when Australia had a suppression order about Cardinal Pell, high ranking official in the Catholic church who was convicted of various sex offences. And in fairness the case was a political football so the order was reasonable.

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) Read More By VANESSA GERA Updated 6:56 PM UTC, February 13, 2024 Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Poland’s new prime minister said Tuesday he has documentation proving that state authorities under the previous government used the powerful Pegasus spyware illegally and targeted a “very long” list of hacking victims. Donald Tusk made the announcement during a news briefing alongside President Andrzej Duda, a political opponent aligned with the previous ruling party. The use of Pegasus was alleged to have occurred under the government led by the right-wing Law and Justice party. Pegasus gives operators complete access to a mobile device, allowing them to extract passwords, photos, messages, contacts and browsing histories, and to activate the microphone and camera for real-time eavesdropping. Tusk said he was sharing information with Duda that showed wide use of the spyware in Poland. READ MORE Polish prime minister says his country and Finland want changes on EU border policies on migration Biden to host Polish president and prime minister on March 12, 25 years after Poland joined NATO Trump puts allies at risk by saying Russia can ‘do whatever the hell they want,’ NATO leader says “This is only a sample of the documents that are at your disposal, Mr. President,” he said at the start of a meeting of the Cabinet Council, a consultation format between the president and the government. Duda called the meeting to discuss other matters. The prime minister said he asked the justice minister and prosecutor general to provide Duda with documents which “confirm 100% the purchase and use of Pegasus in a legal and illegal manner.” The president has not publicly responded. Tusk took power in December following an October election which he won as the head of a broad centrist alliance. It marked the end of eight years of rule by Law and Justice, a populist party that the European Union accused of eroding democratic norms. The new parliament has set up a special commission to investigate who used Pegasus and against whom during Law and Justice’s years in government. “The list of victims of these practices is unfortunately very long,” Tusk said. That list has not been publicly released. Several Polish opponents of the previous government were targeted with Pegasus, a spyware program made by Israel’s NSO Group, according to findings by the University of Toronto’s nonprofit Citizen Lab that were exclusively reported by The Associated Press. “This vindicates the victims and the technical and forensic methods we used to confirm infections,” said John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher with Citizen Lab who discovered the first cases of Pegasus use in Poland. “Commercial spyware like Pegasus is dangerous to democracy and carries a baked-in abuse potential,” Scott-Railton said in a statement to the AP. The NSO Group has said that it only sells its spyware to legitimate government law enforcement and intelligence agencies vetted by Israel’s Defense Ministry for use against terrorists and criminals. But evidence has emerged of human rights activists and politicians being targeted by governments worldwide. Some of those who were hacked received notifications on their iPhones from phone maker Apple, then turned to Citizen Lab for confirmation. Scott-Railton said Tusk’s confirmation “affirms the key role Apple’s threat notifications play in driving accountability for commercial spyware abuses. In Poland, these notifications were the first sign for researchers and reporters that a spyware scandal was lurking.”",

I don't blame the hackers in the slightest. It's also not useful to blame governments. More useful to blame the systemic issues that allow these things to take place: the one that pops to the front of my mind is that the FCC has such a high degree of standards with modems that it results in a severe lack of competition. Google and Apple choose to release phones without contractually demanding full source access to the entirety of it so that it can be audited by their security teams. Those are things that can and should change. reply Veserv 10 hours agorootparentWhat? Pegasus is not enabled by modem vulnerabilities. The primary vulnerabilities used on iOS phones are in Apple designed and implemented components and the primary vulnerabilities used on Android phones are in Google designed and implemented components. The problem is not that Google and Apple did not have the opportunity to secure the vulnerable components. The problem is that their best teams with thousands of people and billions of dollars are completely incapable of designing systems secure against moderately resourced attackers. They openly admit that their systems are defenseless against attackers with resources. Every single time their security is completely invalidated they make press releases like: \"It was a unprecedented attack using never-before-seen techniques by highly sophisticated attackers.\" implying that they can not be blamed because look, they were \"highly sophisticated\" and it was \"unprecedented\" there is no way we could stop that. Even though every single attack is described that way. You would be hard pressed to find a single technically competent security developer in any of these organizations which would claim their systems could stop their systems being totally and utterly compromised and their security completely invalidated by a single, individual, lone competent hacker with a year to work on attacks. A team of 3, forget about it. That is only in the low millions of dollars to completely invalidate their entire security story for all hundreds of millions to billions of systems worldwide. No, the problem is not a lack of accessibility, effort, resources, or focus. The problem is that all of these large companies have failed for literal decades to develop systems secure against competent attackers. And the entire time they have been intentionally deceiving the public into thinking they can even though they know and admit they can not. The solution is to stop believing these perennial incompetents and liars until they present solid, auditable proof. At least then they can not suck all of the air out of the room from people who actually know what they are doing. reply cvalka 5 hours agoprevWhy not target the NSO group headquarters with a drone? reply IYasha 34 minutes agoparentBecause that must be helluva drone! reply agilob 13 hours agoprev\"and illegally\" is strangely missing from the title reply dang 12 hours agoparentThat's no doubt an artifact of HN's 80 char title limit, which required the submitter to shorten the title.

We were trying to hike to a cabin but a snow storm cropped up and had to find a fast way down - his skills with a compass and that map were amazing and we made it back to his jeep in 30 minutes what it had taken us the previous 3 hours to hike (we had a couple of daring downhill rides/jumps).

    "originBody": "A beginner’s guide to making beautiful slides for your talks Feb 17, 2024 DESIGN 7 minute read I’ve done quite a bit of conference speaking over the years, and I love designing slides and coming up with a new visual theme for each topic. It’s fun and keeps me motivated to put in the work and actually write my talks. People often ask me for tips and tooling recommendations, so in this guide, I’m sharing some of my not-so-secret secrets and three beginner-friendly steps for how you can up your slides game for the upcoming conference season! Some of my slides designs over the years Disclaimer (since this post also got widely shared outside of my circles): This blog post is not intended as a general-purpose guide to making universally good slides. It mostly collects some tips based on how I make my slides, which are quite specific and targeted to a certain type of conference, talk style and audience. I get a lot of questions from people who like my slides and want to do something similar for their talks, which is what inspired this post. 1. A good font can make a world of difference Fonts are truly a secret weapon and it’s my number one recommendation for a quick and easy way to spice up your slides. Even if you do nothing else, a good font can add a lot of personality, and discovering new fonts is a lot of fun. (Just be careful because it can become very addictive – if you enjoy buying domains you don’t need, you’ll love shopping for fonts!). Two recent sets of slides I made are almost entirely carried by their respective font: Mangrove Sans and Script for Matt’s talk on beating GPT-4 on predictive tasks, and Marjorie for my keynote on LLMs from prototype to production. I also took inspiration from the examples provided of the fonts in context and used some of them in the overall design to really use the fonts to their full potential. Example of slides almost entirely carried by fonts Of course, you don’t need to pick or buy a new font for every talk – if there’s a font you particularly like, it can become your “signature font” and it will give your slides a unique, but consistent look. For instance, I’ve been using GT Walsheim on this site since pretty much the beginning, and Calibre has been the primary font for most of my slides and Explosion’s websites for years. Budget option: free fonts Over the years, Google Fonts has amassed a significant collection of free fonts you can try out in the browser and download for use in your project, and even find suitable font pairings for. If you’re looking for interesting fonts for slide titles, the “Display” category is a good one to start browsing through, and you can also define more fine-grained filtering. The site also provides a handy glossary that explains all relevant font terminology. For a less curated and more hit-or-miss selection, there’s also Dafont, which offers over 80k and mostly free fonts including many niche types of styles. Premium fonts High-quality fonts available on sites like Fonts.com can sometimes get pretty expensive but marketplaces like Creative Market offer many great alternatives by independent creators, often for under $20 per font family. As a nice bonus, many font stores include not only plain examples of the font itself but also designs showing the font in use that you can take inspiration from. Preview of fonts and design examples on Creative Market (#1, #2) Remember that fonts are made by people and require significant design effort, so please don’t pirate them. You can always try them out interactively in your browser, and many fonts also offer free trial versions with limited character sets so you can test them in your project before you commit. Pro tip: Get a font manager The default font apps that come with standard operating systems aren’t particularly nice so if you’ve already downloaded a lot of fonts, it can be helpful to install a font manager with features for previewing, sorting, filtering, organising and activating your fonts. I use RightFont for Mac, which integrates with Google Fonts out of the box, and there’s also FontBase, which is free and supports Windows and Linux as well. 2. Focus on the most powerful editing features You don’t need to become an expert at graphic design to make beautiful slides! I wouldn’t even consider myself a designer because there’s so much I can’t do and I rely a lot on existing design assets – the only advantage I have, really, is that I’ve been hacking around with Photoshop and web design since I was a teenager. Using effects in Adobe Photoshop Photoshop can be intimidating at first because there’s just so much that’s possible and so many tools and features. But once you have a basic grasp of the controls, moving things around, copy-pasting and working with layers (you can find many beginner tutorials online), there are really only two killer features you need to know to take your visuals to the next level: actions and smart objects. Actions are essentially programmed workflows that perform a series of steps on your image. There are many cool effects you can buy and download from sites like Creative Market to transform images or text into cool designs in a single click. Different Photoshop effects with examples available on Creative Market (#1, #2) Smart objects are editable containers for images and text that are then used or transformed as part of a larger design – so basically, a Photoshop file within a Photoshop file. Many pre-made design assets come with smart objects that you can edit by double-clicking on the layer and saving when you’re done. A classic example of this are mockups: you copy your content into the smart object, and it’s transformed into a realistic-looking paper flyer, book or even an embroidered patch or enamel pin. Mockups for realistic-looking patches and enamel pins using smart objects (#1, #2) If you know how to use actions and make small edits in Photoshop, there’s an abundance of high-quality design assets and effects for all kinds of different styles to choose from online. You’ll also find many design packs or bundles that consist of different elements: seamless patterns for backgrounds, textures, effects, images, pre-designed vector graphics and sometimes even matching fonts. They also typically come with several examples that show what’s possible and are great for inspiration. Working with colours If you’re unsure which colours work well together, there are many tools for creating colour palettes, like Coolors, which is one of my favourites. You can generate random combinations, or add your existing colours, lock them in and generate a matching palette. There’s also uiGradients, which provides a collection of colourful gradients that can work well as backgrounds to give your slides a more designed touch. The interactive Coolors palette generator and the uiGradients collection If you’re creating graphs and visualisations, make sure your colours are clearly distinguishable and accessible for people with visual impairments. This guide has many helpful tips and infographics, as well as a generator for accessible colour palettes. As a general strategy, try to not solely rely on colour to get your point across – in addition, you can use style (like solid versus dotted lines), or emoji and icons (The Noun Project has an icon for everything!). Pro tip: Presenting code with syntax highlighting When presenting code on your slides, you want it to be clear and easily understood. Did you know that if you’re using Visual Studio Code, your syntax highlighting is automatically copied to your clipboard as well? If you paste it into an app like Keynote, the colours will be preserved and you’ll end up with out-of-the-box pretty code. The same might be true for other code editors as well, but I haven’t tried it. Another option is to use images or screenshots, but be careful here: you can easily end up with lower image quality, which is especially problematic for text. For beautiful high-quality code screenshots, I recommend Carbon, which supports many languages, themes and customisations in a cool terminal-style look. Examples of code with syntax highlighting presented in different styles 3. Less is more Good design doesn’t mean “more stuff” – it’s often the opposite. When you discover the magic of design elements and effects, it can be tempting to go overboard, like many did with the introduction of Word Art and Clip Arts back in the 90s. Slides should support your talk Ultimately, what your talk is about is the content. Anything visual that you add is only there to support your points, keep your listeners interested and help them follow along. There’s a fine line between making your slides stand out and making them work against you. You don’t want your audience to get distracted and stop paying attention to your talk because they’re busy processing the slides or reading long texts instead of listening. I personally prefer slides that only include short summaries of the main points and examples or illustrations, and only use them as a visual guide through what I’m saying while a slide is on. This means that the slides might not always be fully understood on their own and out of context, but I’m okay with that. (Of course, how you handle this depends a lot on the type of talk and venue. For academically-oriented talks, it can be common to include a lot more text and content, whereas keynote speakers at industry conferences may sometimes present with slides showing only supporting images.) You don’t need fancy animations Tools like Keynote and PowerPoint offer a lot of options for animating elements on your slides, but the only built-in animation I ever use is “appear”. Fancier animations can be nice as a little gag, but they’re not only distracting, they also come with a big disadvantage: they only work in your program. I typically export my slides with all animation steps as a PDF as a fallback, in case there are technical issues at the conference and I can’t use my laptop, and so I can upload them to Speakerdeck later. This won’t support animations anyway, so I don’t bother with them in the first place. Pick a theme and stick to it For my talks, I usually decide on a single theme or “aesthetic” that I use consistently across all slides as a visual through line, reflected in the headline fonts, colours, background and style of graphics and illustrations. For example, glitchy analog vibes, 80s, 70s, paper collage or a Y2K-inspired design. How playful you want to go with it is up to you, your personality and the type of event. If you feel good about your slides and style, it’ll show and will help you feel more comfortable on stage. If you’re ever stuck on a slide and not sure how to present a piece of information, take a step back and ask yourself: What styles and elements does my theme and aesthetic have that could fit? Maybe it’s a ripped piece of paper if you’re going for a DIY vibe. Or maybe it’s an asymmetric box, or a browser window illustration with a strong shadow. Maybe your content works best on a minimalistic statement slide with a strong colour and no visual distractions. If you’re not sure, go with “less” instead of “more”.

If you've never done a presentation before, the most fundamental graphic design principle to keep in mind (long before you might start thinking about Photoshop plugins!) is consistency. I think that the first thing I would recommend for a beginner is to set the basic layout, typeface and background/foreground colours to something tasteful, perhaps also distinctive or using corporate colours if appropriate. These options will be under something like 'Styles' or 'Master Slide View' depending on the presentation software. Sometimes, it can feel to me like a presentation flits between styles, as if it has been assembled by copying-and-pasting slides piecemeal from other talks. Starting by setting the default style, however, keeps a thread of visual consistency there while you experiment. After that, you can add logos that look like embroidery, glitch effects and what have you, but it will look much less chaotic than the result of creating the special effects first. It will truthfully be decoration, because you've already got a solid visual foundation to build upon. If you'll excuse the vanity, following are the slides for a couple of my own presentations which I'm rather proud of :) https://media.libreplanet.org/mgoblin_media/media_entries/27... https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2719-... reply nox101 8 hours agoparentIt's a pretty common POV that bullet point slides are bad (there's an opposing view as well). https://www.google.com/search?q=bullet+point+presentations+a... From the POV that built point slides are bad, generally there is no consistency from slide to slide because each slide is just an image, graph, or diagram. I've seen plenty of great talks with zero consistency in the slides. reply gxs 4 hours agorootparentAll platitudes are pure baloney, including this one. Good slides are good slides, bullet points or not. Slide’s message immediately grockable, not too jarring color scheme that’s appropriate for the occasion, and clear, crisp and concise language. You can over do bullet points, but that’s true of every single element that’s commonly used in slides. reply gnicholas 15 hours agoprevThese are ways to make beautiful slides. But \"beauty\" is not typically the measure I aim to optimize when prepping for a presentation. Given the tradeoff between spending time making the content great, and finding a beautiful font, I will always choose the former. If your job is to make beautiful slides (e.g., you work for someone who gives presentations, and you make the decks), then beauty is your north star. But for me, beauty is one small aspect of what makes a presentation good. I personally spend most of my time on the spoken content, and then build mostly-minimalist slides to accompany the content and help make it memorable. I spend near-zero time making the slides beautiful. reply adamhartenz 13 hours agoparentIt sounds like you are actually in a really good place to understand the science of graphic design. It is unfortunate the author used the term \"beauty\", because it make non-visual people assume something. The word is loaded, so skews how you think about the subject. But this is also how graphic design works. The visual look of your slide deck can skew how your audience perceives your content. Humans are extremely susceptible to this, so knowing a little bit can have massive benefits. The article does seem to cover the basics pretty well, which is only the tip of the iceberg. reply gnicholas 12 hours agorootparentWhat word would you have used in place of \"beauty\"? If the author had argued in favor of optimizing the visual look of your slide deck to maximize its impact on your audience (a rough paraphrasing of one of your sentences), I wouldn't have disagreed. But if her first bullet point had been about choosing/buying the right font, I'd have demurred (and I say this as someone whose livelihood focuses 100% on the visual presentation of text!). reply idopmstuff 9 hours agorootparentAesthetics.

Why? People have trained for decades on these templates, sitting through boring talk after boring talk, slowly learning how to extract as much info as they need from a glance. The real meat of a talk is what the person is saying, and if the slides are too fancy, then people are forced to split focus. reply qingcharles 5 hours agoparentprevCounter-point: \"Two studies explore the extent to which this deeper processing engendered by disfluency interventions can lead to improved memory performance. Study 1 found that information in hard-to-read fonts was better remembered than easier to read information in a controlled laboratory setting.\" https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-06-hard-fonts-retention..... reply mdekkers 4 hours agorootparentCounter-Counter point, those studies were not of very high quality. Very small groups, and the “hard to read font” was Comic Sans which isn’t actually hard to read, just different. Also, Comic Sans is well known to be the butt of all font jokes, which could have been acting as some kind of marker for the content. A lot for variable unaccounted for. On the other hand, the author of OPs “beginners’ guide” treats presentations like a brochure, which is in itself a beginners’ mistake. If you want to provide truly *excellent* advice to a beginner, point them to Guy Kawasaki’s 10/20/30 rule, you cannot really go wrong with that - yes, it is geared towards pitching for VCs but the approach makes sense regardless. For a bit more of an in-depth approach, see this dude: https://www.presentationzen.com reply sealeck 8 hours agoprevIf you look at the slides in the article they are quite cluttered – a lot of the time text has been made smaller or larger or put in a weird place (relative to a normal justification/alignment) to fit a visual motif which is unrelated to the subject matter of the presentation (e.g. the cover slide on NLP in Python). I think this is emblematic of how the author misses a really important basic principle: layout. If you set up a twelve column grid in PowerPoint and align everything to this your presentation will immediately look much cleaner. In terms of fonts I think much better recommendations are fonts such as Akzidenz-Grotesk or Avenir (seriously underrated font). reply PeterStuer 30 minutes agoprev'Beauty' is in the eye of the beholder. For me the slide examples presented are garish, cluttered, near illegible and very unappealing. Then again, my decks usually have near zero text on them and consist of mostly full bleed photos for emotional engagement and illustratoons/graphs for supporting technical details. The downside is if you need to supply handoits or a standalone uou have to make an entirely separate deck. (I'm assuming the article was in good faith and not meant as a hoax) reply jimmar 8 hours agoprevIn my opinion, she buried the most important part under point 3 - \"Slides should support your talk.\" Too many beginners see the slides as the presentation, and they are there to direct peoples' attention through the slides. People present.

I will say the \"billion times\" can be reduced if the slides are simply a prop for the talk. But if you're trying to convey actual information on the slides, they have to be readable and not just distracting. reply raincole 4 hours agoprevNot sure if parody or not.

You try to align things and they get fractions of an inch off or one slide is pt size 18, then then next is 18.5 or there's alignment that's the baseline as opposed to the whatever the line below letters like p q j use ... it's constant monitoring and watching, flipping back and forth making sure it didn't just \"smart move\" shit around the screen trying to help me out. Then there's other things, like you're trying to move something and it selects the ruler guide instead. Can't you just lock those down? (the answer is NO) It's really insane. They appear to assume I'm not serious about professional style and consistency. And yes, I've tried editing the theme, going through online guides, reading the documentation. reply mhd 13 hours agoprevI thought it was just a couple of years ago when we started moving away from the age-old \"three bullet points\" formula to the \"one slide per HUGE Helvetica word\" template so beloved by TED talks. So I obviously can't say a lot about the style preferences, last presentations I held just used the company style. But hooh, that font section couldn't get any more generic, even mentioning Calibri. No hints at what font characteristics you're looking for, or good examples of that (I'd say that you're better off with something that has a lot of weights, and if it isn't already condensed/compressed, at least one option for that) reply KTibow 12 hours agoparentYou've confused Calibre with Calibri reply deezzer 7 hours agoprevHeard of spotlight.is? It can beautify your presentation with audio triggering your slides. The way you design it is either with the inbuilt basic options. But where it gets interesting is if there is something you want to do that’s not offered on the layer options, just right click on the element to open your browsers web inspector and spotlight.is will save what you see: https://youtu.be/Tgw9X47PTg4 Here’s a post: https://a.spotlight.is/on/redundancy/made/Feb-16-2024 reply saltyoutburst 12 hours agoprevMy favourite meta-talk post is Zach Holman's 'The Talk on Talks'. https://zachholman.com/talk/the-talk-on-talks/ It covers some of the same basic design territory but also touches on delivery, Q&A, etc. reply tamersalama 7 hours agoparentI came to recommend this as well.

But the article states just as much: > Ultimately, what your talk is about is the content. Anything visual that you add is only there to support your points, keep your listeners interested and help them follow along. Further, this article is specifically about the aesthetics of slides! a topic not written about often, and therefore quite interesting to read. reply bluGill 9 hours agoprevSometimes you don't want pretty. If you are trying to convince people to support something then crayons can direct people to not look at details that should noc be decided yet reply WalterBright 4 hours agoprevI'd throw this guide in the trash: 1. tiny fonts 2. too busy slides 3. way too much text in them People complain my slides are too simple. (They're supposed to be!) Stick to 3 points. Remove all unnecessary words. Make the font as big as you can. Never, ever show a slide full of code. reply userbinator 5 hours agoprevMy perspective may be a little biased from being a compulsive adblocker for over 2 decades, but I think those slides are far too much visual overload and will distract from the content; and I suspect those who do see ads all the time may be fatigued by and mentally try to \"block\" a lot of the content too. reply Scubabear68 9 hours agoprevShe leads with fonts being the most important aspect of beautiful slides? Sorry, that is very backward thinking. And not very helpful at all if you have to follow a style guide (like for your company). Content is the most important thing for any slides. “Beauty” means keeping slides simple and to the point. Very simple graphical composition can go a long way. I also am not a fan but personally of overly cartoony kind of presentations. It fits in some contexts, but when I see it in engineering or development it rankles me. Maybe I’m just old. reply dheera 12 hours agoprevThe MOST unfortunate thing about slide presentations is that in many contexts (particularly academic talks, and investor pitches, among other things) is that people ask for your slides before or after the talk, as a substitute for listening during the talk. The best talks are those where the slides supplement the talk and provide visuals for the talk, and aren't trying to BE the talk. But these people above often ask for slides because they don't plan on listening but do still plan on judging you based on your talk that they didn't listen to, so you're forced to slap every piece of information on them. (I'm guilty of this too; many times I plan on attending an interesting virtual talk in my company but I get a meeting scheduled at the same time, so the best I can do is to open both the talk and the meeting at the same time, mute the audio on the talk and screenshot every slide of the talk while nodding in the meeting.) For this reason, good slides work for motivational and TED Talk speakers where you have undivided attention, but they don't work well in real business because people plan to not listen during the talk. reply gnicholas 11 hours agoparentThis hints at the key problem, which is that there are two kinds of slide decks: those meant to accompany a live presentation, and those meant to be flipped through with no accompaniment. When the former are used for the latter purpose, they are near useless. When the latter are used for the former purpose, they are worse than useless. reply ryandrake 10 hours agorootparentYes. Almost every slide deck I have been asked to put together in 25 years of work has been the second kind. And they don’t always even accompany a presentation. Stop me when you’ve heard this one: you have a detailed status doc and a spreadsheet full of data on a particular project. Your boss tells you Director X or VP Y wants to read about that project. Those docs would be perfect! They are the canonical source of truth about the project, but the big shots just won’t read them so you need to summarize everything into a slide deck instead, which apparently people high up on the food chain can read. No matter how good that deck is it’s not going to be compete, and exec will end up with questions anyway. So much of my career has been converting information in various forms into slide decks for people with a child’s attention span. This is one thing I’d love it if AI could do effectively and reliably. I could work 10 hour weeks. reply bananaflag 10 hours agorootparentprev> When the latter are used for the former purpose, they are worse than useless. I passionately disagree with this. I find it much better to focus on a talk (granted, I'm talking here about math talks primarily) if I know that all there is to know is contained in what I'm seeing, and that it's alright if I occasionally don't pay attention to the speaker. (I'm much more attuned to the written word than to the spoken word, and I imagine I'm not alone in this.) reply recursivecaveat 4 hours agorootparentYeah, the more talks I attend, the more I differ with 'powerpoint minimalism orthodoxy'. I would much rather your presentation be a subset of the slides than a superset. Then I can relax and appreciate it rather than worry about transcribing you or something. If its actually important to me than I will spend much more time reviewing the material than listening to it this once, so focus on providing a comprehensive reference. And we both know you're not going to write up a whole separate document that's the exact same material in more detail, kept up to date, so just make it the slides. The preference for minimalism I think comes from a thought process that conflates entertaining with effective. (all else equal, obviously more entertaining will make you more engaged which is more effective, but the equal is carrying some heavy weight there) reply kergonath 10 hours agoparentprev> The MOST unfortunate thing about slide presentations is that in many contexts (particularly academic talks, and investor pitches, among other things) is that people ask for your slides before or after the talk, as a substitute for listening during the talk. I don’t know about the other contexts, but unfortunately it’s a fact of life in academia that half your audience is not really motivated to attend your talk a priori, and that a significant fraction of the other half will be distracted at some point and stop following for 5 to 30 seconds. You lose too much of the audience if the slides are not enough to follow. Another common case, besides the “I could not attend because of diary conflicts” is sending the slides to someone who could be interested but did not attend for whatever reason (after asking politely the author whether they were ok with it). Now, that’s not an excuse for how dreadful most of academic presentations are, but you just cannot go too deep into the minimalism rabbit hole. reply jfim 4 hours agoparentprev> But these people above often ask for slides because they don't plan on listening but do still plan on judging you based on your talk that they didn't listen to, so you're forced to slap every piece of information on them. Or they may be unable to. For many people who have English as a second or third language, reading text is much easier than listening. Without having slides, they may be unable to follow, just like they'd need captions to follow TV shows. reply jimhefferon 9 hours agoparentprevSometimes people who ask are unable to make the talk. I might have an ill student, for instance. Just to broaden the point, what is a good set of slides very much depends on what kind of talk you are giving, it seems to me. reply sebastianconcpt 11 hours agoprevI love these guides. One that I want is excluding brutalism. I really can't stand it. At all. reply slily 15 hours agoprevAs cool as these look, I can't think of a single instance where pretty slides made a talk more interesting or memorable to me. Buying (okay, pirating) Photoshop might be worth it if you're pitching to investors/businesspeople, but if you're presenting at a conference focus on the content and as long as the slides strike the right balance between information density and readability, it'll be fine. reply paulgb 13 hours agoparentIt’s hard for me to think of an example where thoughtfully-designed slides alone set a presentation apart, partly because good slides are often the result of someone clearly putting the time/thought into their presentation. But they can be the difference between a good presentation and a great one. For example, Gary Bernhardt’s Birth and Death of JavaScript is one of my favorites and certainly benefits from having nicely-designed slides. https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death... reply layer8 12 hours agorootparentThey are good slides that visually communicate effectively, but that’s not the same as “pretty” or “beautiful” (which are also much more subjective). Focusing on the latter doesn’t achieve the former. reply 2cynykyl 13 hours agoparentprevThere is a general feeling in STEM that when someone's presentation is a bit too slick looking they actually undermine their message and raise suspicions about their motives...like people start to feel like they are hiding something. I guess the moral is just say what you need to say and don't over think it. Or maybe the moral is that it all depends on your audience. reply snoman 14 hours agoparentprevThis is one of those instances where I wonder if there are different expectations in a more visually creative industry like Hollywood, fashion, or something where the appeal of your deck makes a meaningful difference. reply throwaway99989 14 hours agorootparentEvery year I spend as a developer I grow more fond of plain HTML websites like https://www.kleinbottle.com/ and slides like https://youtu.be/wGoM_wVrwng. Maybe the more I learn how exhausting and competitive it is to be a PM or designer, the more I want to differentiate myself from them, so I can chill and work on engineering. reply dheera 11 hours agoparentprevThe reality is people go to conferences (a) to network or (b) to boost their ego. Not to actually listen to talks. Especially in CS-adjacent fields, Github repos with working code are 100x more valuable than conference talks. So yeah, nobody really cares about conference talks or the slides except the loud bearded dude whose moves between rooms questioning the rigor of every talk. reply deezzer 10 hours agorootparentyou’re right, people are in a talk because they hope to get access to someone in the room, or for data insight, you either have big visuals or you are a big deal : P reply bluGill 9 hours agorootparentprevThat is mhe right reason for a confrence.

Can't really think of a bigger advantage than that. reply 1propionyl 5 hours agoprevYuck. Style over substance. If you want to make better slide decks forget all of this, pick a readable typeface, a title weight and a content weight, and move on to the real meat: Your guiding light is the rule of 7 +/- 2. That is the model of your audience's short term memory. It's how many things they can keep track of at any given moment. If you overflow 7 +/- 2, your audience will not follow. Also be wary of recency. If you haven't mentioned something in a while you may need to bring it back up again to keep it on top of that stack. Next: one slide, one statement. Ideally it should be in the title of the slide. If you need more than a few bullet points and a figure to elaborate, it's too busy. Lastly: your slides are props. They do not need to be \"complete\" in their coverage. They are props for you to use while you give the REAL presentation which is in the medium of spoken word. If your slides do not facilitate understanding of your speech, or worse if they hinder it or distract from it, your slides suck. At the same time, avoid the trap of single bold word slides that give no guidance. Your slides are the map, your speech is the territory. Both matter. P.S. As a rule of thumb any sentence that needs to wrap around to a second line deserves scrutiny. Always ask \"could this have been a diagram?\". Running examples, especially coupled with good illustration, are also excellent. reply K0balt 7 hours agoprev [–] While there are some cool artistic works in the article, I don’t think that they make great slides. They seem to be more of an infographic style. Something meant to be examined in detail. A talk shouldn’t be focused on the slides, it should be an exercise in audience engagement. Slides should inform, not distract, but support the speakers interactive process with the audience. Simple, clear, uncluttered layouts that require minimal focus to support the speaker are what slides should strive to be. Just my $.02.

So I decided to de-obfuscate it and add comments. The code was too large for a comment, so here's the gist: https://gist.github.com/paskozdilar/48d7532733ccd11144bb43fe... The approach is quite interesting - it (ab)uses the preprocessor to shorten the syntax of for loops: #define l(a, b, c, d) for (int y = a; yAnd then it does the heavy lifting by iterating over the whole map thousand times, randomly selecting a rectangle on the map and checking if the selected area is adjacent to an already-generated cave. It's a probabilistic algorithm, so there's a tiny chance that it will just print a single cave in the middle and nothing else. Yeah, it's surprising how well this approach works. Performance is actually decent. There is a chance of \"dud\" levels that only have a couple of rooms, but it's rare. The nice thing about this approach is that it guarantees by construction that every room in the dungeon will be reachable from every other one. reply userbinator 13 hours agoprevThat functionality could probably fit in 1 line of APL... which means a business card could be enough space for a 3D renderer of the random dungeon.

Robert Nystrom, aka munificient, is well-known in the roguelikedev community for his game programming tutorials.

    "title": "Are All Statistical Tests Actually Linear Models?",
    "originLink": "https://danielroelfs.com/blog/everything-is-a-linear-model/",
    "originBody": "← back to blog Everything is a Linear Model 18 March 2022 Let’s imagine you’re incredibly lazy and you want to learn R, but you only want to learn one function to do statistics. What function do you learn? I’d recommend to learn to use the lm() function. Why? Because most common statistical tests are in fact nothing more than some variation of a linear model, from the simplest One-Sample T-test to a repeated-measures ANOVA. I think most people that have Googled for this question have found Jonas Lindeløv’s post on how common statistical tests are linear models (as they should, it’s an amazing post). Here I want to go a bit more in depth into the mathematics behind this statement to show how common statistical tests are in fact variations of a linear model. Don’t believe me? Fine, I’ll show you. Let’s load the packages we’ll use today and set a seed so it’s reproducible. library(tidyverse) library(patchwork) set.seed(2022) One-Sample T-test Let’s start simple with the One-Sample T-test. This test can be used to test how the mean value of your sample measure differs from a reference number. Throughout this post, I’ll throw around a bunch of formulas, which, depending on your background, can either be informative or confusing. The formula for a One-Sample T-test is: The 𝑥 ― is commonly called “x-bar” in conversation 𝑡 = 𝑥 ― − 𝜇 𝜎 𝑛 = 𝑠 𝑎 𝑚 𝑝 𝑙 𝑒 𝑚 𝑒 𝑎 𝑛 − 𝑝 𝑜 𝑝 𝑢 𝑙 𝑎 𝑡 𝑖 𝑜 𝑛 𝑚 𝑒 𝑎 𝑛 𝑠 𝑡 𝑎 𝑛 𝑑 𝑎 𝑟 𝑑 𝑑 𝑒 𝑣 𝑖 𝑎 𝑡 𝑖 𝑜 𝑛 𝑠 𝑎 𝑚 𝑝 𝑙 𝑒 𝑠 𝑖 𝑧 𝑒 What this says is that the effect size ( 𝑡 ) is equal to the sample mean minus the population mean (or reference number) and you divide it by the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size. This formula will output the 𝑡 -value that you would usually report when doing a T-test. The formula requires the standard deviation (σ) of the sample values, which is: 𝜎 = ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ― ) 2 𝑛 − 1 In this formula, you’d subtract the average across the sample values from each individual value, square it, and sum all these resulting values. This sum you would then divide by the size of the sample minus one (or the degrees of freedom), and take the square root of the whole thing. This will give the standard deviation (σ). Alright, let’s now consider a study where we collected blood samples from a number of patients and measured for instance sodium levels in the blood. We don’t have a control group for this study, but we know from medical textbooks that the reference value for sodium in healthy individuals for the age and sex distribution in our sample is for instance 2.5 mmol/L. Then we measure the sodium levels for 30 patients, we can simulate some fake measurements by generating a random sequence of values with a mean of 3 and a standard deviation of 1.2. I cannot condone generating data for your study using rnorm() but this is just for illustrative purposes ref_concentration |t|) (Intercept) 0.3551 0.2113 1.681 0.104 Residual standard error: 1.157 on 29 degrees of freedom Again, we find the same 𝑡 - and 𝑝 -value as when we ran the t.test()! How exciting is that! We now have three ways to obtain the same values. Later I’ll go into what the Residuals, Estimate and Std. Error mean when running comparing group means with a linear model. Two-Sample T-test Now we’ll apply the same logic we used for the One-Sample T-test to show how an Two-Sample T-test is in essence a linear model. First we’ll look at the formula again, then the implementation using the t.test() function, and then the linear model. Let’s now consider another experiment using the blood measurements we had before, but now we actually do have a control sample. We have 30 participants in both samples. Let’s generate some random data: nfilter(group == \"HC\") |> pull(concentration) g2filter(group == \"PAT\") |> pull(concentration) (mean(g1) - mean(g2)) / sqrt((sd(g1)^2 / length(g1)) + (sd(g2)^2 / length(g2))) [1] -5.268195 Then running the regular T-test is easy. t.test(g1, g2) Welch Two Sample t-test data: g1 and g2 t = -5.2682, df = 44.011, p-value = 3.956e-06 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 95 percent confidence interval: -3.571748 -1.595147 sample estimates: mean of x mean of y 4.162838 6.746285 Look at that! We find the same 𝑡 -value! Before we move on to the linear model, I first want to do some plotting, it will help us visualize how the linear model applies here later. Let’s make a boxplot: ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = concentration, fill = group)) + geom_violin(width = 0.5, alpha = 0.2) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) + geom_jitter(width = 5e-2, size = 2, alpha = 0.75) + scico::scale_fill_scico_d(palette = \"hawaii\") + theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = \"none\") Great! Now we have a visual representation of the data. Now, since the T-test compares means, we can might also add a point indicating the mean for both groups. Let’s look just at the jittered points and add a line connecting the two mean values. mean_concentrationgroup_by(group) |> summarise(mean_conc = mean(concentration)) ggplot(data, aes(x = group)) + geom_jitter(aes(y = concentration), width = 5e-2, size = 2, alpha = 0.75 ) + geom_point( data = mean_concentration, aes(y = mean_conc), color = \"violet\", size = 5 ) + geom_line( data = mean_concentration, aes(y = mean_conc), group = 1, linewidth = 2, color = \"violet\" ) + theme_minimal() You might see where we are going with this. The parameters from the linear model will describe the angle of the diagonal line and I’ll illustrative this a further down. Let’s get the values from the linear model: tst_model |t|) (Intercept) 4.1628 0.3468 12.005mutate(group = as_factor(group)) Those of you that have used the aov() function before might have noticed the similarity in syntax between aov() and lm(), this is not a coincidence. The aov() function in R is actually just a wrapper for the lm() function, the anova() function reports the ANOVA calculations. That’s why I just want to compare them both side-by-side now. Let’s run the ANOVA first: aov_model F) group 3 47872 15957 17.79 1.45e-09 *** Residuals 116 104058 897 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 And then the linear model: anova_lm_model |t|) (Intercept) 73.600 5.468 13.460filter(group == \"SCZ\") |> pull(score) |> mean() anova_group_meansgroup_by(group) |> summarise(score = mean(score)) |> mutate( ref_mean = ref_mean, mean_adj = score - ref_mean ) ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = score - ref_mean)) + stat_summary( fun = mean, geom = \"point\", size = 10, color = \"violet\", shape = 18 ) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + ggtext::geom_richtext( data = anova_group_means, aes(label = str_glue(\"x&#772; = {round(mean_adj, 2)}\")), fill = \"#ffffff80\", nudge_x = 1 / 3 ) + theme_minimal() Oh, would you look at that! The differences between the group means and the reference mean (in this case SCZ) correspond with the Estimate of the linear model! Let’s also see if we can reproduce the sum of squares from the ANOVA summary. We’ll go a bit more in depth into the sum of squares further down, but I just wanted to go over a few formulas and calculations: 𝑡 𝑜 𝑡 𝑎 𝑙 𝑠 𝑢 𝑚 𝑜 𝑓 𝑠 𝑞 𝑢 𝑎 𝑟 𝑒 𝑠 = ∑ 𝑗 = 1 𝐽 𝑛 𝑗 × ( 𝑥 ― 𝑗 − 𝜇 ) 2 𝑟 𝑒 𝑠 𝑖 𝑑 𝑢 𝑎 𝑙 𝑠 𝑢 𝑚 𝑜 𝑓 𝑠 𝑞 𝑢 𝑎 𝑟 𝑒 𝑠 = ∑ 𝑗 = 1 𝐽 ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 𝑗 ( 𝑦 𝑖 𝑗 − 𝑦 ― 𝑗 ) 2 We’ll come back to residual sum of squares further down Just briefly, the first formula takes the mean value for the group in question, subtracts the overall mean (or grand mean) and squares the result. Then it multiplies this number by the sample size in this group. In this case we’ll only do it for the first group since that’s the one listed in the summary(aov_model) output. The second formula calculates the residual sum of squares (or sum of squared error). In essence it substracts the group mean from each of the individual values, squares it, and sums it first within the group, and then sums it again across the groups. We can do both calculations in one go with the following quick code: data |> mutate(overall_mean = mean(score)) |> group_by(group) |> summarise( group_mean = mean(score), group_n = n(), overall_mean = first(overall_mean), sq_group = group_n * (group_mean - overall_mean)^2, sq_error = sum((score - group_mean)^2) ) |> ungroup() |> summarise( ss_group = sum(sq_group), ss_error = sum(sq_error) ) # A tibble: 1 × 2 ss_group ss_error 1 47872. 104058. Now look back at the output from summary(aov_model) and we’ll find the same values! I’ll leave it here for now, but we’ll come back to sum of squares (of different varieties later). A linear model is a linear model Well that’s a statement of unequaled wisdom, isn’t it? No wonder they give us doctorates to talk about this stuff. I don’t think I need a lot of effort to convince anyone that a linear model is a linear model. Actually, I’m so convinced that you are aware that a linear model is a linear model that I wanted to about something else instead. Instead I wanted to dive into residuals and R2. Before we start, let’s first simulate some data, We’ll create an age column, a sex column, and a measure column. We’ll make it so that the measure column correlates with the age column. nmutate(measure = 1e-2 * age + sqrt(1e-2) * rnorm(n)) We’ve used the formula for a straight line in previous sections ( 𝑦 = 𝑎 𝑥 + 𝑐 ), we can apply it here too, but instead of the difference in the mean between two groups, the slope of the line (denoted by 𝑎 ) is now derived from the slope at which the line has the least distance to all points, referred to as the best fit. We will plot this later, but first we should maybe just run the linear model: lm_model |t|) (Intercept) -0.049454 0.089850 -0.550 0.589 age 0.011142 0.002026 5.499 3.2e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 Residual standard error: 0.1083 on 18 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.6268, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6061 F-statistic: 30.24 on 1 and 18 DF, p-value: 3.196e-05 We find that there is a significant association between age and our measure, and the R2 is about 47%. Recall that R2 denotes the amount of variance explained by the predictor, or age in our case. We can plot the linear model in ggplot with the geom_smooth() function, and then setting the method to \"lm\": ggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = measure)) + geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 0.8) + geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"grey30\") + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(18, 60)) + theme_minimal() The line in the figure above shows the line that best fits the points with a ribbon indicating the standard error. Back to our data. We know that a linear models fits a line that “predicts” outcome based on some other variable. This is heavily simplified, but it’ll make clear what we’ll do next. So what we did before with the best fit line was create one line that best fits all the data points, but now we want to relate that back to our data points. What would our values be if they would be exactly on this line? To get this, all we have to do is calculate the difference between the current data point and the value of the best fit line at the corresponding “predictor” value. We could do it by hand, but since this section is quite long already, I’ll skip straight to the R function, which is appropriately called predict.lm(). It takes the linear model we created with the lm() function earlier as input. It outputs a vector with the predicted values based on the model. datamutate(measure_pred = predict.lm(lm_model)) With that we can quickly calculate the residual standard error (oversimplified, it’s a measure of how well a regression model fits a dataset). The formula for the residual standard error is this: 𝑅 𝑒 𝑠 𝑖 𝑑 𝑢 𝑎 𝑙 𝑠 𝑡 𝑎 𝑛 𝑑 𝑎 𝑟 𝑑 𝑒 𝑟 𝑟 𝑜 𝑟 = ∑ ( 𝑜 𝑏 𝑠 𝑒 𝑟 𝑣 𝑒 𝑑 − 𝑝 𝑟 𝑒 𝑑 𝑖 𝑐 𝑡 𝑒 𝑑 ) 2 𝑑 𝑒 𝑔 𝑟 𝑒 𝑒 𝑠 𝑜 𝑓 𝑓 𝑟 𝑒 𝑒 𝑑 𝑜 𝑚 or in R terms (the degrees of freedom is 18 here, too complicated to explain for now): sqrt(sum((data$measure - data$measure_pred)^2) / 18) [1] 0.1082947 So that checks out. What we can then also do is calculate the difference between the observed and the predicted values values, this is called the residual: datamutate(residual = measure - measure_pred) We can check that this is correct too by comparing the residuals we calculated with the output from the predict.lm() function to the output of the residuals(lm_model): tibble( residual_manual = data$residual, residual_lm = residuals(lm_model) ) |> glimpse() Rows: 20 Columns: 2 $ residual_manual0.020849595, 0.144178221, -0.075260734, -0.036675981, … $ residual_lm0.020849595, 0.144178221, -0.075260734, -0.036675981, … Predictably, when we sum all the individual differences (or residuals) we would get 0 (allowing for rounding errors) since the regression line perfectly fits in between the datapoints. sum(data$residual) [1] 1.970646e-15 We can visualize the residuals using the geom_smooth() function. First I just want to show the difference visually in the scatter plot we had before. I added points along the regression line to indicate where each point will move to, and an arrow to indicate the size and the direction of the difference between the observed and the predicted value: Show code You might have noticed now that the size of the arrow is defined as the difference between the observed and predicted value, i.e. the residual! Now, you might have come across the term “sum of squared error” in different textbooks. With the values that we’ve calculated so far we can illustrate where this comes from. Imagine that the arrow in the figure above is one side of a square. How do you get the area of a suqare? You multiply the length of one side of the square by itself, i.e. you square it! That’s where the “squared error” part of that comes from. Perhaps the figure below helps illustrate it: Show code The “sum” part of “sum of squared error” refers to the sum of the areas of those squares. Simply, you sum the square of the sides. You can also look at it in mathematical form: We’ll use this formula again a bit later to calculate the R2. ∑ ( 𝑟 𝑒 𝑠 𝑖 𝑑 𝑢 𝑎 𝑙 𝑜 𝑟 𝑑 𝑖 𝑓 𝑓 𝑒 𝑟 𝑒 𝑛 𝑐 𝑒 𝑤 𝑖 𝑡 ℎ 𝑟 𝑒 𝑔 𝑟 𝑒 𝑠 𝑠 𝑖 𝑜 𝑛 𝑙 𝑖 𝑛 𝑒 2 ) In order to calculate the squared regression coefficient, we should also calculate the mean value of the measure across all points. This is necessary because the squared regression coefficient is defined as a perfect correlation (i.e. a correlation coefficient of 1) minus the explained variance divided by the total variance, or in formula form: 𝑅 2 = 𝑝 𝑒 𝑟 𝑓 𝑒 𝑐 𝑡 𝑐 𝑜 𝑟 𝑟 𝑒 𝑙 𝑎 𝑡 𝑖 𝑜 𝑛 − 𝑒 𝑥 𝑝 𝑙 𝑎 𝑖 𝑛 𝑒 𝑑 𝑣 𝑎 𝑟 𝑖 𝑎 𝑛 𝑐 𝑒 𝑡 𝑜 𝑡 𝑎 𝑙 𝑣 𝑎 𝑟 𝑖 𝑎 𝑛 𝑐 𝑒 = 1 − ∑ ( 𝑑 𝑖 𝑓 𝑓 𝑒 𝑟 𝑒 𝑛 𝑐 𝑒 𝑤 𝑖 𝑡 ℎ 𝑟 𝑒 𝑔 𝑟 𝑒 𝑠 𝑠 𝑖 𝑜 𝑛 𝑙 𝑖 𝑛 𝑒 2 ) ∑ ( 𝑑 𝑖 𝑓 𝑓 𝑒 𝑟 𝑒 𝑛 𝑐 𝑒 𝑤 𝑖 𝑡 ℎ 𝑚 𝑒 𝑎 𝑛 𝑣 𝑎 𝑙 𝑢 𝑒 2 ) Explained variance is defined here as the sum of squared error. You might notice the sum symbols and the squares, so you might guess that this formula is also some kind of sum of squares, and it is! As we already discovered, the numerator in this formula is the sum of squared error, the denominator is referred to as the sum of squared total. And the composite of those two is referred to as the sum of squared regression. Making three different sum of squares. Important here is to notice that the error term has switched from the difference between the values with the group mean (as in ANOVA) to the difference between the values and the regression line. Where in the linear model the predicted value was the regression line, in the ANOVA is represented as group mean instead. We’ve already plotted the sum of squared error, now we’ll also illustrate sum of squared total. Remember the sum of squared total is the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the mean value. I’ll also add the original regression line in the background to show the difference with the sum of squared error. Show code We already calculated the difference with the regression line, then to calculate the difference with the mean is simple: datamutate( measure_mean = mean(measure), difference_mean = measure - measure_mean ) Sidenote, if you wanted to calculate the total variance the formula for that would look like this: 𝑆 2 = ∑ ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ― ) 2 𝑛 − 1 Notice how the numerator is the same calculation as the sum of squared total, then divided by the sample size minus 1 (like the degrees of freedom). To calculate the squared regression coefficient (R2) from the formula above is then simple. We take 1 (perfect correlation) and subtract the sum of the squared residuals (explained variance) divided by the sum of the squared difference with the mean (total variance). In R terms, that would look like this: 1 - sum(data$residual^2) / sum(data$difference_mean^2) [1] 0.6268363 And there we have it, the regression coefficient R2! You can check that it’s the same by scrolling up to where we ran summary(lm_model) and you’ll find the same number. We could also calculate the F-statistic and the 𝑡 - and 𝑝 -values, but I think this tutorial has drained enough cognitive energy. For this last section, I hope it’s become clear what we mean when we talk about “residuals”, “sum of squares”, and “variance” in the context of linear models. I also hope it’s enlightened you a bit on what a linear model does and how it works. Conclusion There’s many more things we could go over, multiple linear regression, non-parametric tests, etc., but I think we have done enough nerding for today. I hope I managed to show you the overlap in different statistical tests. Does that mean that you should only run linear models for now? No, of course not. But I do think it may be good to have an overview of where the values you get come from and what they might mean in different contexts. Hope this was enlightening. Happy learning!

Splines can easily take care of that. The \"linear\" part of linear model just means \"linear in the predictor space.\" You can add a non-linear predictor easily via spline basis (similar/sometimes identical to \"kernels\" in ML). My series of lm/glm/gam/gamm revelations was: 1. All t-tests and ANOVA flavors are just linear models 2. Linear models are just a special case of generalized linear models (GLMs), which can deal with binary or count data too 3. All linear models and GLMs are just special cases of generalized linear mixed models, which can deal with repeated measures, grouped data, and other non-iid clustering 4. Linearity is usually a bad assumption, which can easily be overcome via splines 5. Estimating a spline smoothing penalty is the same thing as estimating the variance for a random effect in a a mixed model, so #3 and #4 can be combined for free And then you end up with a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM), which can model smooth nonlinear functions of many variables, smooth interaction surfaces between variables (e.g. latitude/longitude), handle repeated measurements and grouping, and deals with many types of outcomes, including continuous, binary yes/no, count, ordinal categories, or survival time measurements.

I have also heard great things about Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies which uses a slightly different approach (still spline-based though), but I haven't read it. His other writing is fantastic though. reply EvgeniyZh 5 hours agoparentprev\"You can make linear model non linear by adding non linearity\" is kind of vacuous statement, isn't it reply ivan_ah 5 hours agorootparentNo no, linear just means some expression of the form y = b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bp*xp which is in the heart of the model (perhaps more specific description would be linear combination). Whatever you call it, it's just some quantity y, that is constructed via an additive process from components x1...xp, and each component is multiplied by some constant (the coefficient of the linear combination). This linear combination \"core\" of the model can be used directly (in which case it is geometrically a hyperplane), but you could also use non-linear transformation of the inputs or the outputs. E.g. x1 could be a spline basis function, or log-transformed data, or anything. Similarly, the output y can be passed though some non-linearity to force a particular output (like in logistic regression). Hence the statement is not vacuous reply EvgeniyZh 3 hours agorootparentWell yeah, but what is the non trivial statement here? Linear model is linear, and if you add to your model non-linear steps (such as pre- or post- processing) then it is not longer linear and can handle non-linear data. In the same spirit, you could say that GPT4 is a linear model (token logits) with a very large preprocessing (transformer). Maybe what OP meant is that particular non linearities (splines) allow to keep some goodies from the linear model in non-linear settings.

For example phase transitions, commonly touted as an example of discontinuity, don't actually occur until the matter has gone a bit over the point and a transition nucleates somewhere. The probability of a phase transition is a continuous function of temperature, with continuous derivatives. I'm skeptical that discontinuities can exist because, if they did, they'd serve as infinitely powerful microscopes. If there's a discontinuity in nature, it must exist at absolute zero.

If the model is y = f(x) + e, where for example f is a neural net, there is not much we can say about the “quality” of parameters of f. That is, we can’t attach confidence interval. We will have to resort to expensive simulations and for most practical applications this is not workable (size of dataset). What you say is useful in a different context. Local linearization is a very powerful idea. reply whatshisface 6 hours agorootparentMaybe not if there are many more parameters in f than there are samples in the dataset, but if there are a handful of parameters in f then a typical step is to take the inverse of the derivative of goodness-of-fit with respect to each fit parameter, to determine the precision with which each parameter was determined by the fit. reply simulo 16 hours agoprevI knew the linked-in-the-article https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/ which is also great.

Really what you are saying is that you are more likely to find a field for your problem, and fields don't exist in more than 2 dimensions.

(Some exceptions will orthogonal dimensions like EM) reply dist-epoch 14 hours agoparentprevWell, you can create a non-linear model by piece-wise combining multiple linear models. The famous ReLU non-linearity is just that - two linear functions joined. reply nyrikki 13 hours agorootparentsame thing with any feed forward network too. They are all piece-wise linear in respect to inputs. Layers reduce resource requirements and make some patterns easier or even practical to find, but any ANN that is a FNN supervised learning could be represented as a parametric linear regression. Unsupervised learning, that tends to use clustering is harder to visualize but is the same thing. You still have ANNs, which have binary output, which can be viewed through the lens of deciders. They have to have unique successor and predecessor functions. Really this is just set shattering that relates to a finite VC dimensionality being required for something to be PAC learnable. But the title of this is confusing the map for the territory. It isn't that 'Everything is a linear model' but that linear models are the preferred, most practical form. The efforts to leverage spikey neutral networks, which is a more realistic model of cortical neurons, and which have continuous output (or more correctly the computable reals) tend to run into problems like riddled basins. https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02160 Obviously setting rectified linear unit at 0 = 1 resolves to differentiation problem, but many functions may not be so simple Perhaps a useful lens is how TSP with a discreet Euclidean metric is in NP-complete while the continuous version is in NP-hard. But it isn't that everything is linearizable, but rather that linearized problems tend to be the most practical. reply btdmaster 10 hours agorootparentprevI see what you mean. Though in my mind, and this is clearly subjective, piece-wise linear is at least less strict than a linear model.

Every paragraph represents a slide in the presentation. Especially for presentations using the Takahashi method this is very nice and allows you to write down the presentation for a quick lightning talk within a few minutes. The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window colored black on white for maximum contrast even if the sun shines directly onto the projected image. The content of each slide is automatically scaled to fit the window so you don't have to worry about alignment. Instead you can really focus on the content. Dependencies Xlib and Xft for building farbfeld tools to use images in the presentations (if you don't want to use farbfeld, sent-0.2 was the last version with just png support, but may lack fixes and further improvements since its release) Demo To get a little demo, just type make && ./sent example You can navigate with the arrow keys and quit with q. (Non-)Features A presentation is just a simple text file. Each paragraph represents one slide. Content is automatically scaled to fit the screen. UTF-8 is supported. Images can be displayed (no text on the same slide). Just around 1000 lines of C No different font styles (bold, italic, underline) No fancy layout options (different font sizes, different colors, …) No animations No support for automatic layouting paragraphs No export function.

This reads like a parody of Suckless software. Why would anyone use this over the most basic alternative with something like Markdown or HTML in conjunction with a PDF viewer? It's not as if anyone using computers now doesn't have a PDF viewer, so I fail to see the practical utility in re-implementing a tiny fraction of its functionality. If I may be so bold and scathing, I would like to generalise this to Suckless as a whole. Their issue seems to be with \"bloat\" in modern computers, but we have the disk space and CPU cycles to accommodate featureful software written in safe and simple programming languages. Writing software only in C and putting a strict line limit on it simply isn't necessary. The code produced will be of a lower quality and the software produced will have insufficient features. I stand by my belief that it is is possible to write software that provides many features, to do so with a responsive and pleasing UI, in a manner that does not excessively use system resources, and with code that is open to extension and modification. In short: good software is possible. Yet the Suckless style seems to ignore many of the aspects of good software under the false assertion that they come at the cost of others. A piece of software that lacks features is worse than a bloated piece of software with sufficient features as the latter can actually achieve what user wants, though both are worse than non-bloated software with sufficient features. reply crq-yml 3 hours agoparentSuckless has always hinged on parody of \"good\" software, but it retains an audience of modders who take the core that doesn't work, and add the two or three things they want.

You get the added benefit of any personal touches, opinions, or human aspects pre-stripped for your enjoyment! reply samatman 9 hours agorootparent> But don’t shit all over someone’s work This is an ironic thing to say in a discussion of suckless. reply alexwennerberg 11 hours agoprevI’ve used Adelie, which has its own postscript-like notation to render font and graphics inside a tiny VM. I love it https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/adelie.html reply nikau 9 hours agoprevPandoc can create powerpoints from markdown which is my preferred workflow reply Aachen 14 hours agoprevI like simple tools, but this may be too minimalist for most presentations I see being held, or virtually any presentation I make. Adding an image on the side of text, or even anywhere on a text slide, is something I'll want in probably 80% of the presentations I do. One could use image editing for the same effect, particularly if this supports SVG and thus the added text won't get blurry, but that seems rather roundabout My employer has a Latex template which we use by default (I've also made a LibreOffice one for the one time I wanted a video in there). The only annoying thing is that you need to memorize or look up a handful of things like how to align an image the way you want (e.g. below/besides text), but other than that it's about as simple to use as this tool. The advantage of Sent would be skipping the initial setup, but then Sent also doesn't give you any design elements like a title page or slide numbers for people to refer back to I'm also wondering in what version of 2014 (initial git commit: https://git.suckless.org/sent/commit/2e435b7da8067f4e6934bbd...) it made sense to write a GUI tool in plain old C, or why this git server makes you press \"parent commit\" 30 times to find the initial commit reply bee_rider 11 hours agoparentYeah I like: Latex/Beamer with a good template and, like, don’t add anything that is fighting against the framework. Of course you can do anything in Latex, so bring your own restraint IMO. reply muxl 11 hours agoprevI've done a number of text-based slide presentations with `marp` and I've been pleased with the results. Mostly it's just plain markdown slides but if you want to get into the weeds with HTML and have a 2-column slide or something you can do it. https://marp.app/ reply lencastre 2 hours agoprevThis is cool, I’ve been using https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/minimal-folio/id385429744 — minimal folio — for a while and like that simplicity and presentation controls as well. reply barnacs 13 hours agoprevMight as well just xdg-open files in a directory in alphanumeric order by name as a \"presentation\" at this point. reply dash2 13 hours agoparentI once watched a Nobel prize winner present. His presentation was a Word document, and he presented by scrolling down. For bonus points you could do the same with `less`. reply pests 12 hours agorootparentI bet presentations or Word documents weren't what he won his Nobel for! reply godDLL 11 hours agorootparentAha. So he won his prize by his alonesome. With no exchanging of any ideas to any other party. Like, in his parents' basement, right. reply pests 10 hours agorootparentWhat? My point being is people communicate and share ideas in a variety of ways. And if it works it works! We tech people like to get the \"correct system\" in place but for many it's just a means to an end. If he wants to use Word over PowerPoint or a proper presentation software that's completely fine. And he has the Nobel to prove it. reply macintux 10 hours agorootparentYes, that was a bizarre interpretation of your comment. reply arp242 10 hours agoparentprevThat's what I do. Well, \"vim *\" and increase font size. Works well enough. Can't do images, but never had a desire to. Saves mucking about with tools. reply jrm4 12 hours agoprevThis reminds me a bit of the thing I started doing years ago, tweaked to my liking and never looked back -- and I'm just now thinking \"Wow, it's weird that no one has made this better in a more formal way.\" Anyway, its S5 slides, like this: https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ And I just tweaked the CSS and added a bit of logic to included the possibility of one image per slide; as well as editing slides not with raw HTML but with https://zim-wiki.org (because that's what I'm really used to, I'm sure any Markdown thing would work just as well). reply tamimio 10 hours agoprevI believe in the opposite, when it comes to presentations, you better include pictures and videos or even 3D render with animation, highlight words with other colors or size and so on, if I am for a plaintext slide, send it as an email, presentations are already boring using the default templates don’t make it worse. This whole “bare minimalistic” approach can be useful in some scenarios, just don’t try to force it every where, windows Vista UI for example was probably one of the best UI before going to minimal/flat design and such. reply nonrandomstring 10 hours agoparentBoth extremes are good. I've used Pure-Data and Unreal as daily drive presentation tools for hundreds of lectures. The former is really live coding, which is a great way to teach and communicate. A complex presentation can be just like a bunch of boxes (subpatches) connected together to do stuff - and its easy to build almost like a \"mind map\" by connecting them. For Unreal, I found the best way to teach game/VR concepts was from within the world. It got tedious switching between PDF slides and the engine, so why not just build a slide presenter inside the bare constructor space. As for plain text... I love it for presentations. Emacs org-mode is perfect when you want to execute code via babel, and just see stuff in a simple, foldable list, then dive down into the content. reply Jtsummers 10 hours agoparentprevIt supports images (though not videos and animations). > sent does not need latex, libreoffice or any other fancy file format, it uses plaintext files to describe the slides and can also display images The plaintext part is how you describe the presentation, not the presentation itself. reply xmprt 13 hours agoprevI think if the information in a presentation can be represented this simply then it probably doesn't have to be a presentation. reply jntnctrs 13 hours agoprevThis made me think of LookAtMe, a python markdown-to-text-presentation tool, which supports embedded terminal among other features. https://lookatme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.ht... reply twobitshifter 9 hours agoprevFirst time hearing of the Takahashi Method. The way I transform text to slides is with quarto support for reveal.js This does everything you need and means you can keep it plain text and code in a qmd file. reply IshKebab 11 hours agoprevEh there are loads of these based on Markdown that are much better. I think revealjs is the most popular, but I like remarkjs: https://github.com/gnab/remark There's a list of them here: https://gist.github.com/johnloy/27dd124ad40e210e91c70dd1c24a... I don't know why this needs to exist given all those... I guess it was just a fun project? reply chrisnight 8 hours agoparent> I don't know why this needs to exist given all those... I guess it was just a fun project? The answer is already in your reply. This is a pure approach that has 3 dependencies: xlib, xft, and farbfield, while the other solutions proposed (except perhaps some cli options at the bottom) have much larger and complex dependencies like Electron, Node, React, etc. The point of this isn't to have features but be the absolute bare minimum (to the point of being almost unusable albeit). Personally, I see suckless apps as more of an experiment to see just how bare you can go while keeping foundational functionality. They definitely aren't made to be a featureful app though, only the bare minmimum. As for why was it made then? Why not? reply 3abiton 11 hours agoparentprevThe beamer in me is too stubborn to change. reply zelphirkalt 14 hours agoprevThe title reminded me of the Racket sublanguage for presentations. reply bitwize 8 hours agoprevJust use PowerPoint.

    "commentBody": "Why is everything based on likelihoods even though likelihoods are so small? (stats.stackexchange.com)172 points by cl3misch 21 hours agohidepastfavorite92 comments fergal_reid 19 hours agoI think most of the replies, here and on stack exchange, are answering slightly the wrong question. It is fair to ask why the likelihoods are useful if they are so small, and it's not a good answer to talk about how they could be expressed as logs, or even to talk about the properties of continuous distributions. I think the answer is: Yes, individual likelihoods are so small, that yes even a MLE solution is extremely unlikely to be correct. However, the idea is that often a lot of the probability mass - an amount that is not small - will be concentrated around the maximum likelihood estimate, and so that's why it makes a good estimate, and worth using. Much like how the average is unlikely to be the exact value of a new sample from the distribution, but it's a good way of describing what to expect. (And gets better if you augment it with some measure of dispersion, and so on). (If the distribution is very dispersed, then while the average is less useful as an idea of what to expect, it still minimises prediction error in some loss; but that's a different thing and I think less relevant here). reply bscphil 18 hours agoparent> It is fair to ask why the likelihoods are useful if they are so small The way the question demonstrates \"smallness\" is wrong, however. They quote the product of the likelihoods of 50 randomly sampled values - 9.183016e-65 - as if the smallness of this value is significant or meant anything at all. Forget the issue of continuous sampling from a normal distribution, and just consider the simple discrete case of flipping a coin. The combined probability of any permutation of 50 flips is 0.5 ^ 50, a really small number. That's because the probability is, in fact, really small! reply knightoffaith 15 hours agorootparentRight - and so the more appropriate thing to do is not look at the raw likelihood of any one particular value but instead look at relative likelihoods to understand what values are more likely than other values. reply adiM 5 hours agorootparentTherefore, likelihood ratios! (Or log likelihood ratios) reply anon946 11 hours agorootparentprevFor the discrete case, it seems that a better thing to do is consider the likelihood of getting that number of heads, rather than the likelihood of getting that exact sequence. I am not sure how to handle the continuous case, however. reply lupire 11 hours agorootparentOf course you ignore irrelevant ordering of data points. That's not the issue. The issue, for discrete or continuous (which are mathematically approximations of each other), is that the value at a point is less important than the integral over a range. That's why standard deviation is useful. The argmax is a convenient average over a weightable range of values. The larger your range, the greater the likelihood that the \"truth\" is in that range. If you only need to be correct up to 1% tolerance, the likelihood of a range of values that have $SAMPLING_PRECISION tolerance is not importance. Only the argmax is, to give you a center of the range. reply jvanderbot 18 hours agoparentprevYes - the most enlightening concept for me was \"Highest Probability Density Interval\" which basically always is clustered around the mean. But you can choose any interval which contains as much probability mass! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval#Choosing_a_c... It's a fairly common \"mistake\" to assume that the MLE is useful as a point estimate and without considering covariance/spread/CI/HPDI/FIM/CRLB/Entropy/MI/KLD or some other measure of precision given the measurement set. reply TobyTheCamel 15 hours agoparentprev> However, the idea is that often a lot of the probability mass - an amount that is not small - will be concentrated around the maximum likelihood estimate, and so that's why it makes a good estimate, and worth using. This may be true for low dimensions but doesn’t generalise to high dimensions. Consider a 100-dimensional standard normal distribution for example. The MLE will still be at the origin but most of the mass will live in a thin shell of distance roughly 7 units from the origin. reply lupire 11 hours agorootparentConcentration of mass is density. A shell is not dense. If I am looking for a needle in a hyperhaystack, it's not important to know that it's more likely to be \"somewhere on the huge hyperboundary\" than \"in the center hypercubic inch\". reply kgwgk 10 hours agorootparentAnd yet your parent comment was right in saying that it won't be true that \"a lot of the probability mass - an amount that is not small - will be concentrated\" in the center hypercubic inch. reply zmgsabst 8 hours agorootparentprevDisagree: A lot of why large corporations fail to make products that people enjoy is tied up in this behavior and that mass is not independently distributed along each distribution — you end up with “continents of taste” your centroid product sucks for equally. reply astrange 2 hours agorootparentThis is similar to how they originally tried to build fighter jet seats for the average pilot, but it failed because it turned out there were no average pilots, so they had to make them adjustable. reply blt 15 hours agorootparentprevI think the \"mass\" they are referring to might the mass of the Bayesian posterior in parameter space, not the mass of the data in event space. reply fergal_reid 15 hours agorootparentYes, in parameter space. However, TobyTheCamel's point is valid in that there are some parameter spaces where the MLE is going to be much less useful than others. Even without having to go to high dimensions, if you've got a posterior that looks like a normal distribution, the MLE is going to the you a lot, whereas if it's a multimodal distribution with a lot of mass scattered around, knowing the MLE much less informative. But this is a complex topic to address in general, so I'm trying to stick to what I see as the intuition behind the original question! reply agnosticmantis 12 hours agoparentprev> However, the idea is that often a lot of the probability mass - an amount that is not small - will be concentrated around the maximum likelihood estimate, and so that's why it makes a good estimate, and worth using. This is a Bayesian point of view. The other answers are more frequentist, pointing out that likelihood at a parameter theta is NOT the probability of theta being the true parameter (given data). So we can't and don't interpret it like a probability. reply klipt 11 hours agorootparentGiven enough data, Bayesian and frequentist models tend to converge to the same answer anyway. Bayesian priors have similar effect to regularization (e.g. ridge regression / penalizing large parameter values). reply LudwigNagasena 6 hours agorootparentprevThat's not a Bayesian point of view. You can re-word it in terms of a confidence interval / coverage probability. It is true that in frequentist statistics parameters don't have probability distributions, but their estimators very much do. And one of the main properties of a good estimator is formulated in terms of convergence in probability to the true parameter value (consistency). reply crazygringo 17 hours agoparentprev> Yes, individual likelihoods are so small, that yes even a MLE solution is extremely unlikely to be correct. Can you elaborate? An MLE is never going to come up with the exact parameters that produced the samples, but in the original example, as long as you know it's a normal distribution, MLE is probably going to come up with a mean between 4 and 6 and a SD within a similar range as well (I haven't calculated it, just eyeballing it) -- when the original parameters were 5 and 5. I guess I don't know what you mean by \"correct\", but that's as correct as you can get, based on just 50 samples. reply fergal_reid 16 hours agorootparentRight - I think this is what's at the heart of the original question. I know they asked with a continuous example, but I don't interpret their question as limited to continuous cases, and I think it's easier to address using a discrete example, as we avoid the issue of each exact parameter having infinitesimal mass which occurs in a continuous setting. Let's imagine the parameter we're trying to estimate is discrete and has, say, 500 different possible values. Let's say the parameter can have the value of the integers between 1 and 500 and most of the mass is clustered in the middle between 230 and 270. Given some data, it would actually be possible that MLE would come up with the exact value, say 250. But maybe given the data, a range of values between 240 and 260 are also very plausible, so the likelihood of exactly 250 has a fairly low probability. The original poster is confused, because they are basically saying, well, if the actual probability is so low, why is this MLE stuff useful? You are pointing out they should really frame things in terms of a range and not a point estimate. You are right; but I think their question is still legitimate, because often in practice we do not give a range, and just give the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter. (And also, separately, in a discrete parameter setting, specific parameter value could have substantial mass.) So why is the MLE useful? My answer would be, well, that's because for many posterior distributions, a lot of the probability mass will be near the MLE, if not exactly at it - so knowing the MLE is often useful, even if the probability of that exact value of the parameter is low. reply aquafox 18 hours agoparentprevI agree with your points and thats why it's useful to compare a MLE to an alternative model via a likelihood ratio test, in which case one sees how much better the generative model performs as compared to the wrong model. Similarly, AIC values do not make a lot of sense on an absolute scale but only relative to each other, as written in [1]. [1] Burnham, K. P., & Anderson, D. R. (2004). Multimodel inference: understanding AIC and BIC in model selection. Sociological methods & research, 33(2), 261-304. reply hedora 18 hours agoprevHow I'd put it: They are useful because the integral of the likelihoods is not infinitesimal. The probability that your yard stick measures 1.0000000000000 yards is basically zero, but the probability that it's within one inch of that is close to one. We generally prefer to use probability density functions with the property that most of the probability density is close to the maximum likelihood. So, in the yard stick example, the yard stick lengths are probably gaussian, so if check enough lengths, you'll get a mean (== length with the maximum likelihood) that approaches 1.00000000000 yards (you'd hope) with some small standard deviation (probably less than an inch). reply sega_sai 20 hours agoprevIt is very strange that this is on a main page. The key thing is likelihood is probability density of your data! I.e. if your probability density is a Gaussian N(0,0.00001), then the likelihoods of data-points next to the mean will be very large, if your PDF is N(0,10000) they'll be very small. Furthermore the amount of data matters as likelihoods will be multiplied for each datapoint, so if they were small in the beginning, they'll be even smaller, if they were large they'll be larger. reply kgwgk 17 hours agoparent> The key thing is likelihood is probability density of your data! In fact the important thing to understand about the likelihood function is that it’s not a probability density. reply LudwigNagasena 6 hours agorootparentI think there is some language misunderstanding going on. Likelihood function is not a probability density. Likelihood function evaluated for D is equal to probability density of D (by definition). In other words, f(x;theta) as a function of x is a probability density function. f(x;theta) as a function of theta is a likelihood function. But f(x;theta) for given x and theta is just a value, which, one can say, is both likelihood and probability density. reply sega_sai 16 hours agorootparentprevFor continuous data it is exactly a probability density evaluated on your data (for discrete it's PMF instead). L(params)=P(D|params) reply kgwgk 16 hours agorootparentThe point is that L(params) is not a probability density. The integral of L(params) over params is not one. reply vermarish 14 hours agorootparentRight. But if you make the notation slightly more explicit, then the integral of L(data, params) over data is 1. This follows from the independence assumption. So we ARE working with a probability function. Its output can be interpreted as probabilities. It's just that we're maximizing L = P(eventsparams) with respect to params. reply kgwgk 13 hours agorootparentThe likelihood function is a function of params for a fixed value of data and it is not a probability function. There is another function - a function of data for fixed params - which is a probability density. That doesn’t change the fact that the likelihood function isn’t. reply 331c8c71 12 hours agorootparentprevThe independence has nothing do with the integral being 1 to be honest. You could write a model where the observations are not independent but the (multivariate) integral over their domain will still be 1. reply vermarish 8 hours agorootparentBut for such a model, the joint pdf would not be written simply as a product of each individual pdf. That's what independence provides. reply kgwgk 2 hours agorootparentIf by “joint probability” you mean function(params, data) there is no joint probability here in general. L(params, data) is constructed from a family density functions p(data) for each possible value of param. The integral of L(params, data) may be anything or diverge. You don’t need any extra independence assumption either. Or maybe you mean “joint probability” as p(data1, data2) when data is composed of two observations, for example. But you don’t need any independence assumption for that probability density to integrate to one! It necessarily does that - whether you can factorize it as p’(data1)p’’(data2) or not. reply 331c8c71 12 hours agorootparentprevThat's exactly the reason why frequentist approach sucks by the way;) Parameters are treated specially and there is no internal consistency - to have it you need to introduce priors... reply 3abiton 11 hours agorootparentIt's the bayes vs frequentist war again. reply acc_297 20 hours agoparentprevA likelihood could be referring to data drawn from discrete distribution though and this wouldn’t change much about how it’s treated and it would be a proper probability not prob-density reply nerdponx 19 hours agoparentprevI'm surprised it's here as well. Of all the interesting questions on CV, I would not consider this one of them. I wonder if this was sent through the second-chance pool. reply hinkley 14 hours agoprevThe weirdest “likelihood” conversation I ever had, the putative team lead didn’t want to change priorities to fix a bug because, “how often does that happen?” My reply was, “it happens to every user, the first time they use the app.” And then something about how frequency has nothing to do with it. Every single user was going to encounter this bug. Even if they only used the app once. I already had a toolbox full of conversations about how bad we are at statistics, but that one opened up a whole new avenue of things to worry about. One that was reinforced by later articles about the uselessness of p95 stats - particularly where 3% of your users are experiencing 100% outage. But the one that is more apropos to the linked question, vs HN in general, is how people are bad at calculating the probability that “nothing bad happens” when there are fifty low probability things that can go wrong. Especially as the number of opportunities go up. And the way that, if we do something risky and nothing bad happens, we estimate down the probability of future calamity instead of counting ourselves lucky and backing away. reply opportune 14 hours agoparentI've seen this exact same fallacy happen several times throughout my career, which isn't even very long. I think in many cases it boils down to some subtype not being identified and evaluated on its own. As in your case it's especially impactful, and yet IME also usually where these kinds of things get improperly prioritized, when it's a user's first impression or when it occurs in a way that causes a user to have to just sit and wait on the other end as these are often \"special\" cases with different logic in your application code. OTOH sometimes users try to weird/wrong/adversarial shit and so their high failure rate is working as intended. But it pollutes your stats such that it can hide real issues with similar symptoms and skew distributions. reply itronitron 13 hours agoparentprevYeah, and I'd also add that the total # of bugs in an application will always be greater than the total # of 'known' bugs. Tracking down and fixing the oddball bugs usually prevents a larger set of related issues from popping up later. reply hinkley 2 hours agorootparentSome bugs have multiple symptoms, it’s true. reply NoPicklez 9 hours agoparentprevThis is interesting, I wonder if there are principles from other types of engineering, civil, structural, aeronautical etc which provide some additional thoughts around probabilities of failure and now to deal with them Particularly where you have a lot of low probability bugs reply l_e_o_n 17 hours agoprevYou flip a possibly-biased coin 20 times and get half heads, half tails, e.g. \"THHHTTTTTHTHTTHHHTHH\". Under the model where the bias is 0.5—a fair coin—the probability of that sequence is (0.5)^20 or about one in a million. In fact, the probability of any sequence you could observe is one in a million. Under the model where the bias is 0.4 the probability is (0.4)^10 × (0.6)^10 or about one in two million. That is, the sequence we observed supplies about twice as much evidence in favor of bias = 0.5 as compared with bias = 0.4—this is likelihood. Likelihood ratios are all that matter. Morals: - The more complex the event you're predicting (the rarer the tyical observed result) the smaller the associated likelihoods will tend to be - It's possible that every observed result has a tiny probability under every model you're considering - Nonetheless it makes sense to use the ratios of these numbers to compare the models - This has nothing to do with probability densities or logarithms, though the fact that we often work with densities also makes absolute likelihood values relative to the choice of units Added in edits: - You could summarize the sequence with the number of heads or tails and then the likelihood values would be larger but the ratios would remain the same (it's a sufficient statistic). Similarly in the CrossValidated question one could summarize the data with the mean and sum of squares. But this doesn't work in general, e.g. if we have i.i.d. draws from a Cauchy distribution. reply mturmon 9 hours agoparentYou have given a nice clean answer that does not make any errors (such as talking about the likelihood as a density in parameters, which of course it is not). Thanks for writing it down. The only other thing worth adding to what you have written is that the likelihood is a product of N factors. As such, it will essentially always diverge toward infinity (if the density factors are on average greater than 1) or collapse fast towards zero (if the factors are on average less than 1, as in your example and in OP). So this very structure (arising from the IID observations) implies that no “stable” density will pop out. It’ll always blow up or down! One way to stabilize things is to take (1/N) times the log of the likelihood. Then you will indeed converge to something familiar - the entropy, - E log p(x). reply b10nic 17 hours agoparentprevNot quite; the probability of n/2 successes in n trials is given as Binomial(n,p) not p^n. p^n is correct for a single sequence but there are many possible sequences that result half heads, half tails and so you have a factor of \"N choose X\" or the so called \"Binomial Coefficient\". > (0.4)^20 × (0.6)^20 and I think you mean (0.4)^10 × (0.6)^10 or more generally p^x*(1-p)^n-x. reply l_e_o_n 16 hours agorootparentI'm talking about the whole sequence; you're talking about the number of heads (or) tails in the sequence. The number of heads is a sufficient statistic, so we'll get the same likelihood ratios out, but the likelihood values themselves will be larger. You could make a similar point about the original CrossValidated Normal(0, 1)^N example by summarizing the data with the mean and sum of squares. This doesn't work if the data were Cauchy(0, 1)^N instead. reply qup 17 hours agoparentprev> half heads, half tails. > Under the model where the bias is 0.5—a fair coin—the probability of that outcome is (0.5)^20 or about one in a million. No. Edit: someone downvoted, ha. It's closer to 1 in 6. reply cj 16 hours agorootparent1 in a million is the probability of correctly predicting a unique sequence of 20 coin flips, in the exact order. (E.g. first 10 flips heads, 2nd 10 flips tails, in that order - 1 in a million) reply BeetleB 16 hours agorootparentprevI'm surprised people are conflating the Binomial distribution with OP's statement. He is talking about one specific outcome of half heads/half tails (where order matters). There is exactly one way to get that outcome. reply l_e_o_n 16 hours agorootparentprevEdited for clarity. reply lukego 15 hours agoprevLikelihoods aren’t fundamentally small. The center of a normal distribution has high likelihood (e.g. 1000000) if the standard deviation is small or low likelihood if the standard deviation is large (e.g. 1/1000000.) This effect is amplified when you are working with products of likelihoods. They can be infinitesimal or astronomical. Giant likelihoods really surprised me the first time I experienced them but they’re not uncommon when you work with synthetic test data in high dimensions and/or small scales. They still integrate to the same magnitude because the higher likelihood values are spread over shorter spans. reply jdhwosnhw 14 hours agoparentAnother issue is that likelihoods associated with continuous distributions very often have units. You can’t meaningfully assign “magnitude” to a quantity with units. You can always change your unit system to make the likelihood of, say, a particular height in a population of humans to be arbitrarily large. reply ronald_raygun 20 hours agoprevAnother thing to note is that you're multiplying probabilities together. Since each probability is between 0 and 1, youre always shrinking the likelihood with each new data point. When you're doing this kind of analysis, the question you're asking is \"given a model with these parameters, what's the probability I get exactly this sample?\" Which, when you phrase it that way, it becomes more apparent why the likelihood is so small. reply cobbal 19 hours agoparentMultiplying them together certainly magnifies the effect, but it would magnify it the other way if the likelihoods were larger than one. (Easy to get, just tweak the variance of the normal distributions to be smaller). Likelihoods are more like infinitesimal fractions of a probability, that need to be integrated over some set of events to get back a probability. In the case of the joint distribution of 50 Gaussian, you can think of the likelihood having \"units\" of epsilon^50. reply j7ake 18 hours agorootparentWait how do you get likelihoods greater than one? Definitely won’t work for likelihoods like Poisson or other count based models. reply blackbear_ 18 hours agorootparentFor discrete distributions you indeed cannot, but for continuous distributions all you need is sufficiently small variance. Try for example a Gaussian with variance 1e-12 reply KeplerBoy 17 hours agorootparentThe value of a continuous probability density distribution at a specific point is pretty meaningless though; You have to talk about the integral between two values and that won't go above one. reply blackbear_ 13 hours agorootparentIn context of maximum likelihood the value of the density at the maximizer is actually quite useful, for example for model comparison. reply kjhcvkek77 20 hours agoprevBecause it works well in practice. And to elaborate, usually when something works well in practice it's because it has multiple desirable properties - the one you \"ask for\", but also other ones you get for free. In this case maximum likelihood approximate bayesian estimation with a mostly reasonable prior. Furthermore you could look at the convergence properties which are good. You could probably design some degenerate probability distribution that ml-estimation behaves really badly for, but those are not common in practice. reply nerdponx 19 hours agoparentIt's better than \"it works well in practice\". The question is misguided as stated. It's like asking why chemists care about density for measuring mass. If you are looking at the likelihood of any particular outcome of a continuous random variable, then you do not understand how probability works. The probability of any particular real number arising from a probability distribution on the real numbers is exactly 0. It's not an arbitrarily small epsilon greater than zero, it's actually zero. This definition is in fact required for probability to sense mathematically. You might ask questions like why does maximum likelihood work as an optimization criterion, but that's very different from asking why we care about likelihood at all. The comments on the original question do a good job of cutting through this confusion. reply kjhcvkek77 14 hours agorootparentI appreciate your response but I don't really agree. They say that likelihood can be multiplied by any scale factor or that it's only the comparative difference that matters, or we can make a little plot, but they don't actually explain why. I can try to make an explanation from the bayesian framework(but as I mentioned it's not the only relevant one) Likelihood is P(measurement=measurement'|parameter=parameter'). This is a small value. Given a prior we can P(parameter=parameter'|measurement=measurement'). This is also small. But when we compute P(parameter'-k The probability of any particular real number arising from a probability distribution on the real numbers is exactly 0. It's not an arbitrarily small epsilon greater than zero, it's actually zero. Nitpicking somewhat, but e.g. `max(1, uniform(0, 2))` has a very non-zero probability of evaluating to 1. reply ronald_raygun 19 hours agoparentprev> You could probably design some degenerate probability distribution that ml-estimation behaves really badly for, but those are not common in practice. Anything multimodal... reply ultra_nick 18 hours agoprevIn a storm, the likelihood of A raindrop hitting your computer dwarfs the likelihood of THE raindrops[5927] hitting your computer. Hence why using A and THE is important. reply devit 9 hours agoprevWell, because any specific outcome from sampling a random distribution is indeed very unlikely. In practice, that means that if you have an alternate \"non-random\" or \"less random\" explanation for the data, you'll be convinced that it's almost surely the correct one after just a few samples (via the obvious Bayesian decision framework, or just \"common sense\"). For example, imagine that you are rolling a die and 3 always comes up. On every roll, the likelihood of the die being a fair random die (as opposed to a loaded die) is divided by the number of sides, so with a 6-sided die, you'll usually be convinced that it's loaded after just 3-20 times of giving the same result (depending on your prior on it being loaded vs fair and your decision threshold). Likewise, if only 1 and 2 come up you'll quickly be convinced that it's an unusual die that only has 1 and 2 symbols on the face. Or another way to look at it is that processes are usually not random at all (rather they are usually deterministic, but the initial state is unknown) so a random distribution is a very bad model, and having any information about the initial state at all will drastically increase the likelihood and thus make the model with information strongly preferred; the likelihood of the random model is so low because that model is very bad, even though it may be the best available. reply data-ottawa 18 hours agoprevProbability is the probability mass distributed over your data with fixed parameters, and likelihood is mass distributed over your model parameters with fixed data. The absolute most important thing to know about likelihood is that it is not a measure of probability, even thought it looks a lot like probability. If I look at coin flip data, I know the data comes from a coin flip, but any specific count of heads vs tails becomes less and less likely the more flips we do. So likelihood being small tells us nothing on its own. The value of likelihood comes from the framework you use in. If I wanted to make a best guess at what the balance of the coin is then I could find the maximum of the likelihood over all coin balances to get the most representative version of my model. Similarly, I can compare two specific coin biases and determine which is more likely, but that alone can’t tell me anything about the probability of the coin being biased. reply shiandow 10 hours agoprevFor questions like these I sometimes prefer translating everything to thermodynamics. In this case the question then becomes \"Why are we looking at energy if at most ordinary temperatures systems aren't anywhere near 0 energy?\". The overly simplified answer is \"Because bowling balls still roll down, even at room temperature.\" Which is actually kind of interesting to think about. Why do bowling balls roll down when they have vastly more thermal energy than gravitational potential? To get an answer you have to invoke the second law of thermodynamics. Which is annoyingly a bit hard to really get to understand. In short it implies that energy likes to become more disorganised, so something like gravitational potential which is very organised will eventually devolve into heat which is (by definition) disorganised. So bowling ball roll down. reply kgwgk 16 hours agoprev> Thus, it appears to be very unlikely in a certain sense that these numbers came from the very distribution they were generated from. “It appears to be very unlikely in a certain sense that this comment is written in English.

Well then there are all these “heuristics” to look at, AIC, BIC, some sort of trick with a chi^2 distribution function- these are all just ways to penalize the objective function based on the # of parameters but it’s somewhat debatable which one to apply when and I have read that some parameter estimation softwares don’t even compute these values in the exact same way - I am not a statistician by training I just apply “industry standard practices” in as reasonably intuitive a way as I can but my impression has always been that if you wander far enough into the weeds you’ll find that stats often becomes a debate between many approximations with different sorts of tradeoffs and much of this is smoothed over by the fancy scientific software packages that get used by non-statistics-researchers one of the most frustrating parts of my job is reproducing SAS output (an extensively used statistics product) using free R language tools since a SAS license costs more than some sports cars… But what is SAS actually doing? And it’s never just taking a mean or pooling variance in the standard way you’d read about in an intermediate stats textbook it’s always doing some slight adjustment based on this or that approximation or heuristic This tangent may have been unrelated or irrelevant but I’ve long concluded that in practice statistics is far less solved than people might expect if they’ve never had to reproduce any of the numbers given to them by statistical analysis reply praptak 19 hours agoprevI don't have a problem with very small probabilities as long as they stay within math and kind of \"cancel out\".
