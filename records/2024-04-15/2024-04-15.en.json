    "commentBody": "Visualizing Attention, a Transformer's Heart [video] (3blue1brown.com)548 points by rohitpaulk 10 hours agohidepastfavorite86 comments Xcelerate 33 minutes agoAs someone with a background in quantum chemistry and some types of machine learning (but not neural networks so much) it was a bit striking while watching this video to see the parallels between the transformer model and quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, the state of your entire physical system is encoded as a very high dimensional normalized vector (i.e., a ray in a Hilbert space). The evolution of this vector through time is given by the time-translation operator for the system, which can loosely be thought of as a unitary matrix U (i.e., a probability preserving linear transformation) equal to exp(-iHt), where H is the Hamiltonian matrix of the system that captures its “energy dynamics”. From the video, the author states that the prediction of the next token in the sequence is determined by computing the next context-aware embedding vector from the last context-aware embedding vector alone. Our prediction is therefore the result of a linear state function applied to a high dimensional vector. This seems a lot to me like we have produced a Hamiltonian of our overall system (generated offline via the training data), then we reparameterize our particular subsystem (the context window) to put it into an appropriate basis congruent with the Hamiltonian of the system, then we apply a one step time translation, and finally transform the resulting vector back into its original basis. IDK, when your background involves research in a certain field, every problem looks like a nail for that particular hammer. Does anyone else see parallels here or is this a bit of a stretch? reply lagrange77 7 minutes agoparentI only understand half of it, but it sounds very interesting. I've always wondered, if the principle of stationary action could be of any help with machine learning, e.g. provide an alternative point of view / formulation. reply bdjsiqoocwk 19 minutes agoparentprevI think you're just describing a state machine, no? The fact that you encode the state in a vector and steps by matrices is an implementation detail...? reply seydor 5 hours agoprevI have found the youtube videos by CodeEmporium to be simpler to follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw_PJdmydZY Transformer is hard to describe with analogies, and TBF there is no good explanation why it works, so it may be better to just present the mechanism, \"leaving the interpretation to the viewer\". Also, it's simpler to describe dot products as vectors projecting on one another reply mjburgess 2 hours agoparentThe explanation is just that NNs are a stat fitting alg learning a conditional probability distribution, P(next_word|previous_words). Their weights are a model of this distribution. LLMs are a hardware innovation: they make it possible for GPUs to compute this at scale across TBs of data. Why does, 'mat' follow from 'the cat sat on the ...' because 'mat' is the most frequent word in the dataset; and the NN is a model of those frequencies. Why is 'London in UK' \"known\" but 'London in France' isnt? Just because 'UK' much more frequently occurs in the dataset. The algorithm isnt doing anything other than aligning computation to hardware; the computation isnt doing anything interesting. The value comes from the conditional probability structure in the data. -- that comes from people arranging words usefully, because they're communicating information with one another reply nerdponx 2 hours agorootparentI think you're downplaying the importance of the attention/transformer architecture here. If it was \"just\" a matter of throwing compute at probabilities, then we wouldn't need any special architecture at all. P(next_word|previous_words) is ridiculously hard to estimate in a way that is actually useful. Remember how bad text generation used to be before GPT? There is innovation in discovering an architecture that makes it possible to learn P(next_word|previous_words), in addition to the computing techniques and hardware improvements required to make it work. reply mjburgess 1 hour agorootparentYes, it's really hard -- the innovation is aligning the really basic dot-product similarity mechanism to hardware. You can use basically any NN structure to do the same task, the issue is that they're untrainable because they arent parallizable. There is no innovation here in the sense of a brand new algorithm for modelling conditional probabilities -- the innovation is in adapting the algorithm for GPU training on text/etc. reply bruce343434 1 hour agorootparentI don't know why you seem to have such a bone to pick with transformers but imo it's still interesting to learn about it, and reading your dismissively toned drivel of \"just\" and \"simply\" makes me tired. You're barking up the wrong tree man, what are you on about. reply mjburgess 54 minutes agorootparentNo issue with transformers -- the entire field of statistical learning, decision trees to NNs, do the same thing... there's no mystery here. No person with any formal training in mathematical finance, applied statistics, hard experimental sciences on complex domains... etc. would be taken in here. I'm trying my best to inform people who are interested in being informed, against an entire media ecosystem being played like a puppet-on-a-string by ad companies. The strategy of these companies is to exploit how easy is it to strap anthropomorphic interfaces over models of word frequencies and have everyone lose their minds. Present the same models as a statistical dashboard, and few would be so adamant that their sci-fi fantasy is the reality. reply divan 29 minutes agorootparentDo you have blog or anything to follow? reply mjburgess 5 minutes agorootparentI may start publishing academic papers in XAI as part of a PhD; if I do, I'll share somehow. The problem is the asymmetry of bullshit: the size of paper necessary for academics to feel that claims have been evidenced is book-length for critique but 2pg for \"novel contributions\". YetAnotherNick 23 minutes agorootparentprevNo. This is blatantly false. The belief that recurrent model can't be scaled is untrue. People have recently trained MAMBA with billions of parameters. The fundamental reason why transformers changed the field is that they are lot more scalable context length wise, and LSTM, LRU etc doesn't come close. reply albertzeyer 2 hours agorootparentprevYou are more speaking about n-gram models here. NNs do far more than that. Or if you just want to say that NNs are used as a statistical model here: Well, yea, but that doesn't really tell you anything. Everything can be a statistical model. E.g., you could also say \"this is exactly the way the human brain works\", but it doesn't really tell you anything how it really works. reply cornholio 1 hour agorootparent> \"this is exactly the way the human brain works\" I'm always puzzled by such assertions. A cursory look at the technical aspects of an iterated attention - perceptron transformation clearly shows it's just a convoluted and powerful way to query the training data, a \"fancy\" Markov chain. The only rationality it can exhibit is that which is already embedded in the dataset. If trained on nonsensical data it would generate nonsense and if trained with a partially non-sensical dataset it will generate an average between truth and nonsense that maximizes some abstract algorithmic goal. There is no knowledge generation going on, no rational examination of the dataset through the lens of an internal model of reality that allows the rejection of invalid premises. The intellectual food already chewed and digested in the form of the training weights, with the model just mechanically extracting the nutrients, as opposed to venturing in the outside world to hunt. So if it works \"just like the human brain\", it does so in a very remote sense, just like a basic neural net works \"just like the human brain\", i.e individual biological neurons can be said to be somewhat similar. reply mjburgess 1 hour agorootparentprevMy description is true of any statistical learning algorithm. The thing that people are looking to for answers, the NN itself, does not have them. That's like looking to Newton's compass to understand his general law of gravitation. The reason that LLMs trained on the internet and every ebook has the structure of human communication is because the dataset has that structure. Why does the data have that structure? this requires science, there is no explanation \"in the compass\". NNs are statistical models trained on data -- drawing analogies to animals is a mystification that causes people's ability to think clearly he to jump out the window. No one compares stock price models to the human brain; no banking regulator says, \"well your volatility estimates were off because your machines had the wrong thoughts\". This is pseudoscience. Animals are not statistical learning algorithms, so the reason that's uninformative is because it's false. Animals are in direct causal contact with the world and uncover its structure through interventional action and counterfactual reasoning. The structure of animal bodies, and the general learning strategies are well-known, and having nothing to do with LLMs/NNs. The reason that I know \"The cup is in my hand\" is not because P(\"The cup is in my hand\"|HistoricalTexts) > P(not \"The cup is in my hand\"|HistoricalTexts) reply vineyardmike 58 minutes agorootparent> The reason that I know \"The cup is in my hand\" is not because P(\"The cup is in my hand\"|HistoricalTexts) > P(not \"The cup is in my hand\"|HistoricalTexts) I mostly agree with your points, but I still disagree with this premise. Humans (and other animals) absolutely are statistical reasoning machines. They're just advanced ones which can process more than \"text\" - they're multi-modal. As a super dumb-simple set of examples: Think about the origin of the phrase \"Cargo Cult\" and similar religious activities - people will absolutely draw conclusions about the world based on their learned observations. Intellectual \"reasoning\" (science!) really just relies on more probabilities or correlations. The reason you know the cup is in your hand is because P(\"I see a cup and a hand\"|HistoryOfEyesight) + P(\"I feel a cylinder shape\"|HistoryOfTactileFeeling) + .... > P(Inverse). You can pretend it's because humans are intelligent beings with deep reasoning skills (not trying to challenge your smarts here!), but humans learn through trial and error just like a NN with reinforcement learning. Close your eyes and ask a person to randomly place either a cup from your kitchen in your hand or a different object. You can probably tell which one is it is. Why? Because you have learned what it feels like, and learned countless examples of cups that are different, from years of passive practice. Thats basically deep learning. reply mjburgess 41 minutes agorootparentI mean something specific by \"statistics\": modelling frequency associations in static ensembles of data. Having a body which changes over time that interacts with a world that changes over time makes animal learning not statistical (call it, say, experimental). That animals fall into skinner-box irrational behaviour can be modelled as a kind of statistical learning, but it actually isnt. It's a failure of ecological salience mechanisms in regulating the \"experimental learning\" that animals engage in. Eg., with the cargo cults the reason they adopted that view was because their society had a \"big man\" value system based on material acquisition and western waring powers seemed Very Big and so were humiliating. In order to retain their status they adopted (apparently irrational) theories of how the world worked (gods, etc). From the outside this process might seem statistical, but it's the opposite. Their value system made material wealth have a different causal salience which was useful in their original ecology (a small island with small resources), but it went haywire when faced with the whole world. Eventually these mechanisms update with this new information, or the tribe dies off -- but what's going wrong here is that the very very non-statistical learning ends up describable that way. This is indeed, why we should be very concerned about people skinner-boxing themsleves with LLMs reply vineyardmike 2 minutes agorootparent> Having a body which changes over time that interacts with a world that changes over time makes animal learning not statistical (call it, say, experimental). The \"experiment\" of life is what defines the statical values! Experimentation is just learning what the statistical output of something is. If I hand you a few dice, you'd probably be able to guess the statistical probability of every number for given roll. Because you've learned that through years of observation building a mental model. If I hand you a weighted die, suddenly your mental model is gone, and you can re-learn experimentally by rolling it a bunch. How can you explain experimental learning except \"statistically\"? > they adopted (apparently irrational) theories of how the world worked (gods, etc) They can be wrong without being irrational. Building an airport doesn't make planes show up, but planes won't show up without an airport. If you're an island nation with little understanding of the global geopolitical environment of WWII, you'd have no idea why planes started showing up on your island, but they keep showing up, and only at an airport. It seems rational to assume they'd continue showing up to airports. > that animals fall into skinner-box irrational behaviour can be modelled as a kind of statistical learning, but it actually isnt What is it if not statistical? Also skinner boxes are, in a way, perfectly rational. There's no way to understand the environment, and if pushing a button feeds you, then rationally you should push the button when hungry. Humans like to think we're smart because we've invented deductive reasoning, and we quote \"correlation is not causation\" that we're not just earning to predict the world around us from past experiences. Demlolomot 1 hour agorootparentprevIf learning in real life over 5-20 years shows the same result as a LLM being trained by billions of tokens, than yes it can be compared. And there are a lot of people out there who do not a lot of reasoning. After all optical illusions exist, our brain generalizes. The same thing happens with words like the riddle about the doctor operating on a child were we discover that the doctor is actually a female. And while llms only use text, we can already see how multimodal models become better, architecture gets better and hardware too. reply mjburgess 1 hour agorootparentI don't know what your motivation in comparison is; mine is science, ie., explanation. I'm not interested that your best friend emits the same words in the same order as an LLM; i'm more interested that he does so because he enjoys you company whereas the LLM does not. Engineer's overstep their mission when they assume that because you can substitute one thing for another, and sell a product in doing so, that this is informative. It isnt. I'm not interested in whether you can replace the sky for a skybox and have no one notice -- who cares? What might fool an ape is everything, and what that matters for science is nothing. reply IanCal 1 hour agorootparentprevThis is wrong, or at least a simplification to the point of removing any value. > NNs are a stat fitting alg learning a conditional probability distribution, P(next_word|previous_words). They are trained to maximise this, yes. > Their weights are a model of this distribution. That doesn't really follow, but let's leave that. > Why does, 'mat' follow from 'the cat sat on the ...' because 'mat' is the most frequent word in the dataset; and the NN is a model of those frequencies. Here's the rub. If how you describe them is all they're doing then a sequence of never-before-seen words would have no valid response. All words would be equally likely. It would mean that a single brand new word would result in absolute gibberish following it as there's nothing to go on. Let's try: Input: I have one kjsdhlisrnj and I add another kjsdhlisrnj, tell me how many kjsdhlisrnj I now have. Result: You now have two kjsdhlisrnj. I would wager a solid amount that kjsdhlisrnj never appears in the input data. If it does pick another one, it doesn't matter. So we are learning something more general than the frequencies of sequences of tokens. I always end up pointing to this but OthelloGPT is very interesting https://thegradient.pub/othello/ While it's trained on sequences of moves, what it does is more than just \"sequence a,b,c is followed by d most often\" reply mjburgess 51 minutes agorootparentAny NN \"trained on\" data sampled from an abstract complete outcome space (eg., a game with formal rules; mathematical sequences, etc) can often represent that space completely. It comes down to whether you can form conditional probability models of the rules, and that's usually possible because that's what abstract rules are. > I have one kjsdhlisrnj and I add another kjsdhlisrnj, tell me how many kjsdhlisrnj I now have. 1. P(number-word|tell me how many...) > P(other-kinds-of-words|tell me how many...) 2. P(two|I have one ... I add another ...) > P(one|...) > P(three|...) > others This is trivial. reply IanCal 42 minutes agorootparentRight, learning more abstract rules about how things work is the goal and where the value comes in. Not all algorithms are able to do this, even if they can do what you describe in your first comment. That's why they're interesting, othellogpt is interesting because it builds a world model. reply mjburgess 32 minutes agorootparentIt builds a model of a \"world\" whose structure is conditional probabilities, this is circular. It's like saying you can use a lego model to build a model of another lego model. All the papers which \"show\" NNs building \"world\" models arent using any world. It's lego modelling lego. The lack of a world model only matters when the data NNs are trained on aren't valid measures of the world that data is taken to model. All the moves of a chess game are a complete model of chess. All the books ever written aren't a model of, well, anything -- the structure of the universe isnt the structure of text tokens. The only reason all statistical algorithms, including NNs, appear to model the actual world is because patterns in data give this appearance: P(The Sun is Hot) > P(The Sun is Cold) -- there is no model of the sun here. The reason P(\"The Sun is Hot\") seems to model the sun, is because we can read the english words \"sun\" and \"hot\" -- it is we who think the machine which generates this text does so semantically.. but the people who wrote that phrase in the dataset did so; the machine is just generating \"hot\" because of that dataset. reply IanCal 24 minutes agorootparentOthellogpt is fed only moves and builds a model of the current board state in its activations. It never sees a board. > It's like saying you can use a lego model to build a model of another lego model. No it's like using a description of piece placements and having a picture in mind about what the current model looks like. reply mjburgess 14 minutes agorootparentThe \"board\" is abstract. Any game of this sort is defined by a series of conditional probabilities: {P(Pawn_on_sqare_blah|previous_moves) ... etc.} What all statistical learning algorithms model is sets of conditional probabilities. So any stat alg is a model of a set of these rules... that's the \"clay\" of these models. The problem is the physical world isn't anything like this. The reason I say, \"I liked that TV show\" is because I had a series of mental states caused by the TV show over time (and so on). This isnt representable as a set of conditional probs in the same way. You could imagine, at the end of history, there being a total set of all possible conditional probabilities: P(I liked show|my_mental_states, time, person, location, etc.) -- this would be uncomputable, but it could be supposed. If you had that dataset then yes, NNs would learn the entire structure of the world, because that's the dataset. The problem is that the world cannot be represented in this fashion, not that NNs could model it if it could be. A decision tree could. P(I liked the TV show) doesnt follow from any dataset ever collected. It follows from my mental states. So no NN can ever model it. They can model frequency associations of these phrases in historical text documents: this isnt a model of hte world reply IanCal 1 minute agorootparent> Any game of this sort is defined by a series of conditional probabilities: {P(Pawn_on_sqare_blah|previous_moves) ... etc.} That would always be 1 or 0, but also that data is not fed into othellogpt. That is not the dataset. It is not fed in board states at all. It learns it, but it is not the dataset. michaelt 1 hour agorootparentprevThat's not really an explanation that tells people all that much, though. I can explain that car engines 'just' convert gasoline into forward motion. But if a the person hearing the explanation is hoping to learn what a cam belt or a gearbox is, or why cars are more reliable now than they were in the 1970s, or what premium gas is for, or whether helicopter engines work on the same principle - they're going to need a more detailed explanation. reply mjburgess 1 hour agorootparentIt explains the LLM/NN. If you want to explain why it emits words in a certain order you need to explain how reality generated the dataset, ie., you need to explain how people communicate (and so on). There is no mystery why an NN trained on the night sky would generate nightsky-like photos; the mystery is why those photos have those patterns... solving that is called astrophysics. Why do people, in reasoning through physics problems, write symbols in a certain order? Well, explain physics, reasoning, mathematical notation, and so on. The ordering of the symbols gives rise to a certain utility of immitating that order -- but it isnt explained by that order. That's circular: \"LLMs generate text in the order they do, because that's the order of the text they were given\" reply seydor 2 hours agorootparentprevPeople specifically would like to know what the attention calculations add to this learning of the distribution reply ffwd 2 hours agorootparentJust speculating but I think attention enables differentiation of semantic concepts for a word or sentence within a particular context. Like for any total set of training data you have a lesser number of semantic concepts (like let's say you have 10000 words, then it might contain 2000 semantic concepts, and those concepts are defined by the sentence structure and surrounding words, which is why they have a particular meaning), and then attention allows to differentiate those different contexts at different levels (words/etc). Also the fact you can do this attention at runtime/inference means you can generate the context from the prompt, which enables the flexibility of variable prompt/variable output but you lose the precision of giving an exact prompt and getting an exact answer reply ffwd 31 minutes agorootparentI'm not one to whine about downvotes but I just have to say, it's a bad feeling when I can't even respond to the negative feedback because there is no accompanying comment. Did I misinterpret something? Did you? Who will ever know when there is no information. :L reply nextaccountic 2 hours agorootparentprev> Why does, 'mat' follow from 'the cat sat on the ...' because 'mat' is the most frequent word in the dataset; and the NN is a model of those frequencies. What about cases that are not present in the dataset? The model must be doing something besides storing raw probabilities to avoid overfitting and enable generalization (imagine that you could have a very performant model - when it works - but it sometimes would spew \"Invalid input, this was not in the dataset so I don't have a conditional probability and I will bail out\") reply forrestthewoods 2 hours agorootparentprevI find this take super weak sauce and shallow. This recent $10,000 challenge is super super interesting imho. https://twitter.com/VictorTaelin/status/1778100581837480178 State of the art models are doing more than “just” predicting the probability of the next symbol. reply mjburgess 1 hour agorootparentYou underestimate the properties of the sequential-conditional structure of human communication. Consider how a clever 6yo could fake being a physicist with access to a library of physics textbooks and a shredder. All the work is done for them. You'd need to be a physicist to spot them faking it. Of course, LLMs are in a much better position than having shredded physics textbooks -- they have shreddings of all books. So you actually have to try to expose this process, rather than just gullibly prompt using confirmation bias. It's trivial to show they work this way, both formally and practically. The issue is, practically, gullible people aren't trying. reply nerdponx 2 hours agoparentprev> TBF there is no good explanation why it works My mental justification for attention has always been that the output of the transformer is a sequence of new token vectors such that each individual output token vector incorporates contextual information from the surrounding input token vectors. I know it's incomplete, but it's better than nothing at all. reply eurekin 1 hour agorootparent> TBF there is no good explanation why it works I thought the general consesus was: \"transformers allow neural networks to have adaptive weights\". As opposed to the previous architectures, were every edge connecting two neurons always has the same weight. EDIT: a good video, where it's actually explained better: https://youtu.be/OFS90-FX6pg?t=750&si=A_HrX1P3TEfFvLay reply rcarmo 1 hour agorootparentprevYou're effectively steering the predictions based on adjacent vectors (and precursors from the prompt). That mental model works fine. reply rayval 3 hours agoprevHere's a compelling visualization of the functioning of an LLM when processing a simple request: https://bbycroft.net/llm This complements the detailed description provided by 3blue1brown reply bugthe0ry 33 minutes agoparentWhen visualised this way, the scale of GPT-3 is insane. I can't imagine what 4 would like here. reply tylerneylon 5 hours agoprevAwesome video. This helps to show how the Q*K matrix multiplication is a bottleneck, because if you have sequence (context window) length S, then you need to store an SxS size matrix (the result of all queries times all keys) in memory. One great way to improve on this bottleneck is a new-ish idea called Ring Attention. This is a good article explaining it: https://learnandburn.ai/p/how-to-build-a-10m-token-context (I edited that article.) reply danielhanchen 4 hours agoparentOh with Flash Attention, you never have to construct the (S, S) matrix ever (also in article) Since its softmax(Q @ K^T / sqrt(d)) @ V, you can form the final output in tiles. In Unsloth, memory usage scales linearly (not quadratically) due to Flash Attention (+ you get 2x faster finetuning, 80% less VRAM use + 2x faster inference). Still O(N^2) FLOPs though. On that note, on long contexts, Unsloth's latest release fits 4x longer contexts than HF+FA2 with +1.9% overhead. So 228K context on H100. reply rahimnathwani 4 hours agoparentprevHe lists Ring Attention and half a dozen other techniques, but they're not within the scope of this video: https://youtu.be/eMlx5fFNoYc?t=784 reply promiseofbeans 9 hours agoprevHis previous post 'But what is a GPT?' is also really good: https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gpt reply abotsis 5 hours agoprevI think what made this so digestible for me were the animations. The timing, how they expand/contract and unfold while he’s speaking.. is all very well done. reply _delirium 4 hours agoparentThat is definitely one of the things he does better than most. He actually wrote his own custom animation library for math animations: https://github.com/3b1b/manim reply divan 28 minutes agorootparentAlso check out community edition: https://www.manim.community reply bjornsing 52 minutes agoprevThis was the best explanation I’ve seen. I think it comes down to essentially two aspects: 1) he doesn’t try to hide complexity and 2) he explains what he thinks is the purpose of each computation. This really reduces the room for ambiguity that ruins so many other attempts to explain transformers. reply justanotherjoe 3 hours agoprevIt seems he brushes over the positional encoding, which for me was the most puzzling part of transformers. The way I understood it, positional encoding is much like dates. Just like dates, there are repeating minutes, hours, days, months...etc. Each of these values has shorter 'wavelength' than the next. The values are then used to identify the position of each tokens. Like, 'oh, im seeing january 5th tokens. I'm january 4th. This means this is after me'. Of course the real pos.encoding is much smoother and doesn't have abrupt end like dates/times, but i think this was the original motivation for positional encodings. reply nerdponx 2 hours agoparentThat's one way to think about it. It's clever way to encode \"position in sequence\" as some kind of smooth signal that can be added to each input vector. You might appreciate this detailed explanation: https://towardsdatascience.com/master-positional-encoding-pa... Incidentally, you can encode dates (e.g. day of week) in a model as sin(day of week) and cos(day of week) to ensure that \"day 7\" is mathematically adjacent to \"day 1\". reply bilsbie 8 hours agoprevI finally understand this! Why did every other video make it so confusing! reply chrishare 8 hours agoparentIt is confusing, 3b1b is just that good. reply visarga 4 hours agorootparentAt the same time it feels extremely simple attention(Q,K,V) = softmax (Q K^T √ dK ) @ V is just half a row; the multi-head, masking and positional stuff just toppings we have many basic algorithms in CS that are more involved, it's amazing we get language understanding from such simple math reply Al-Khwarizmi 2 hours agoparentprevNot sure if you mean it as rhetorical question but I think it's an interesting question. I think there are at least three factors why most people are confused about Transformers: 1. The standard terminology is \"meh\" at most. The word \"attention\" itself is just barely intuitive, \"self-attention\" is worse, and don't get me started about \"key\" and \"value\". 2. The key papers (Attention is All You Need, the BERT paper, etc.) are badly written. This is probably an unpopular opinion. But note that I'm not diminishing their merits. It's perfectly compatible to write a hugely impactful, transformative paper describing an amazing breakthrough, but just don't explain it very well. And that's exactly what happened, IMO. 3. The way in which these architectures were discovered was largely by throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticked. There is no reflection process that ended on a prediction that such an architecture would work well, which was then empirically verified. It's empirical all the way through. This means that we don't have a full understanding of why it works so well, all explanations are post hoc rationalizations (in fact, lately there is some work implying that other architectures may work equally well if tweaked enough). It's hard to explain something that you don't even fully understand. Everyone who is trying to explain transformers has to overcome these three disadvantages... so most explanations are confusing. reply cmplxconjugate 1 hour agorootparent>This is probably an unpopular opinion. I wouldn't say so. Historically it's quite common. Maxwell's EM papers used such convoluted notation it it quite difficult to read. It wasn't until they were reformulated in vector calculus that they became infinitely more digestible. I think though your third point is the most important; right now people are focused on results. reply thomasahle 7 hours agoparentprevI'm someone who would love to get better at making educational videos/content. 3b1b is obviously the gold standard here. I'm curious what things other videos did worse compared to 3b1b? reply bilsbie 6 hours agorootparentI think he had a good, intuitive understanding that he wanted to communicate and he made it come through. I like how he was able to avoid going into the weeds and stay focused on leading you to understanding. I remember another video where I got really hung up on positional encoding and I felt like I could t continue until I understood that. Or other videos that overfocus on matrix operations or softmax, etc. reply ur-whale 5 hours agoparentprev> Why did every other video make it so confusing! In my experience, with very few notable exceptions (e.g. Feynmann), researchers are the worst when it comes to clearly explaining to others what they're doing. I'm at the point where I'm starting believe that pedagogy and research generally are mutually exclusive skills. reply namaria 1 hour agorootparentIt's extraordinarily difficult to imagine how it feels not to understand something. Great educators can bridge that gap. I don't think it's correlated with research ability in any way. It's just a very rare skill set, to be able to empathize with people who don't understand what you do. reply Solvency 8 hours agoparentprevBecause: 1. good communication requires an intelligence that most people sadly lack 2. because the type of people who are smart enough to invent transformers have zero incentive to make them easily understandable. most documents are written by authors subconsciously desperate to mentally flex on their peers. reply penguin_booze 6 hours agorootparentPedagogy requires empathy, to know what it's like to not know something. They'll often draw on experiences the listener is already familiar with, and then bridge the gap. This skill is orthogonal to the mastery of the subject itself, which I think is the reason most descriptions sound confusing, inadequate, and/or incomprehensible. Often, the disseminating medium is a one-sided, like a video or a blog post, which doesn't help, either. A conversational interaction would help the expert sense why someone outside the domain find the subject confusing (\"ah, I see what you mean\"...), discuss common pitfalls (\"you might think it's like this... but no, it's more like this...\") etc. reply WithinReason 1 hour agorootparentprev2. It's not malice. The longer you have understood something the harder it is to explain it, since you already forgot what it was like to not understand it. reply YossarianFrPrez 8 hours agoprevThis video (with a slightly different title on YouTube) helped me realize that the attention mechanism isn't exactly a specific function so much as it is a meta-function. If I understand it correctly, Attention + learned weights effectively enables a Transformer to learn a semi-arbitrary function, one which involves a matching mechanism (i.e., the scaled dot-product.) reply hackinthebochs 8 hours agoparentIndeed. The power of attention is that it searches the space of functions and surfaces the best function given the constraints. This is why I think linear attention will never come close to the ability of standard attention, the quadratic term is a necessary feature of searching over all pairs of inputs and outputs. reply namelosw 6 hours agoprevYou might also want to check out other 3b1b videos on neural networks since there are sort of progressions between each video https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/neural-networks reply mastazi 8 hours agoprevThat example with the \"was\" token at the end of a murder novel is genius (at 3:58 - 4:28 in the video) really easy for a non technical person to understand. reply hamburga 7 hours agoparentI think Ilya gets credit for that example — I’ve heard him use it in his interview with Jensen Huang. reply mehulashah 5 hours agoprevThis is one of the best explanations that I’ve seen on the topic. I wish there was more work, however, not on how Transfomers work, but why they work. We are still figuring it out, but I feel that the exploration is not at all systematic. reply rollinDyno 6 hours agoprevHold on, every predicted token is only a function of the previous token? I must have something wrong. This would mean that within the embedding of \"was\", which is of length 12,228 in this example. Is it really possible that this space is so rich as to have a single point in it encapsulate a whole novel? reply jgehring 28 minutes agoparentThat's what happens in the very last layer. But at that point the embedding for \"was\" got enriched multiple times, i.e., in each attention pass, with information from the whole context (which is the whole novel here). So for the example, it would contain the information to predict, let's say, the first token of the first name of the murderer. Expanding on that, you could imagine that the intent of the sentence to complete (figuring out the murderer) would have to be captured in the first attention passes so that other layers would then be able to integrate more and more context in order to extract that information from the whole context. Also, it means that the forward passes for previous tokens need to have extracted enough salient high-level information already since you don't re-compute all attention passes for all tokens for each next token to predict. reply vanjajaja1 6 hours agoparentprevat that point what it has is not a representation of the input, its a representation of what the next output could be. ie. its a lossy process and you can't extract what came in the past, only the details relevant to next word prediction (is my understanding) reply rollinDyno 4 hours agorootparentIf the point was the presentation of only the next token, and predicted tokens were a function of only the preceding token, then the vector of the new token wouldn’t have the information to produce new tokens that kept telling the novel. reply faramarz 6 hours agoparentprevit's not about a single point encapsulating a novel, but how sequences of such embeddings can represent complex ideas when processed by the model's layers. each prediction is based on a weighted context of all previous tokens, not just the immediately preceding one. reply rollinDyno 4 hours agorootparentThat weighted context is the 12228 dimensional vector, no? I suppose that when you each element in the vector weighs 16 bits then the space is immense and capable to have a novel in a point. reply spacecadet 8 hours agoprevFun video.

    "title": "Introducing Redka: Redis Reimagined with SQLite",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/nalgeon/redka",
    "originBody": "Redka aims to reimplement the good parts of Redis with SQLite, while remaining compatible with Redis API. Notable features: Data does not have to fit in RAM. ACID transactions. SQL views for better introspection and reporting. Both in-process (Go API) and standalone (RESP) servers. Redis-compatible commands and wire protocol. This is a work in progress. See below for the current status and roadmap. Commands • Installation • Usage • Persistence • Performance • Roadmap • More Commands Redka aims to support five core Redis data types: strings, lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets. Strings Strings are the most basic Redis type, representing a sequence of bytes. Redka supports the following string-related commands: Command Go API Description ------- ------ ----------- DECR DB.Str().Incr Decrements the integer value of a key by one. DECRBY DB.Str().Incr Decrements a number from the integer value of a key. GET DB.Str().Get Returns the value of a key. GETSET DB.Str().GetSet Sets the key to a new value and returns the prev value. INCR DB.Str().Incr Increments the integer value of a key by one. INCRBY DB.Str().Incr Increments the integer value of a key by a number. INCRBYFLOAT DB.Str().IncrFloat Increments the float value of a key by a number. MGET DB.Str().GetMany Returns the values of one or more keys. MSET DB.Str().SetMany Sets the values of one or more keys. MSETNX DB.Str().SetManyNX Sets the values of one or more keys when all keys don't exist. PSETEX DB.Str().SetExpires Sets the value and expiration time (in ms) of a key. SET DB.Str().Set Sets the value of a key. SETEX DB.Str().SetExpires Sets the value and expiration (in sec) time of a key. SETNX DB.Str().SetNotExists Sets the value of a key when the key doesn't exist. The following string-related commands are not planned for 1.0: APPEND GETDEL GETEX GETRANGE LCS SETRANGE STRLEN SUBSTR Lists Lists are lists of strings sorted by insertion order. Redka aims to support the following list-related commands in 1.0: LINDEX LINSERT LLEN LPOP LPUSHX LRANGE LREM LSET LTRIM RPOP RPOPLPUSH RPUSH RPUSHX Sets Sets are unordered collections of unique strings. Redka aims to support the following set-related commands in 1.0: SADD SCARD SDIFF SDIFFSTORE SINTER SINTERSTORE SISMEMBER SMEMBERS SMOVE SPOP SRANDMEMBER SREM SUNION SUNIONSTORE Hashes Hashes are field-value (hash)maps. Redka supports the following hash-related commands: Command Go API Description ------- ------------------ ----------- HDEL DB.Hash().Delete Deletes one or more fields and their values. HEXISTS DB.Hash().Exists Determines whether a field exists. HGET DB.Hash().Get Returns the value of a field. HGETALL DB.Hash().Items Returns all fields and values. HINCRBY DB.Hash().Incr Increments the integer value of a field. HINCRBYFLOAT DB.Hash().IncrFloat Increments the float value of a field. HKEYS DB.Hash().Keys Returns all fields. HLEN DB.Hash().Len Returns the number of fields. HMGET DB.Hash().GetMany Returns the values of multiple fields. HMSET DB.Hash().SetMany Sets the values of multiple fields. HSCAN DB.Hash().Scanner Iterates over fields and values. HSET DB.Hash().SetMany Sets the values of one or more fields. HSETNX DB.Hash().SetNotExists Sets the value of a field when it doesn't exist. HVALS DB.Hash().Exists Returns all values. The following hash-related commands are not planned for 1.0: HRANDFIELD HSTRLEN Sorted sets Sorted sets are collections of unique strings ordered by each string's associated score. Redka aims to support the following sorted set related commands in 1.0: ZADD ZCARD ZCOUNT ZINCRBY ZINTERSTORE ZRANGE ZRANK ZREM ZSCORE Key management Redka supports the following key management (generic) commands: Command Go API Description ------- ------ ----------- DEL DB.Key().Delete Deletes one or more keys. EXISTS DB.Key().Count Determines whether one or more keys exist. EXPIRE DB.Key().Expire Sets the expiration time of a key (in seconds). EXPIREAT DB.Key().ExpireAt Sets the expiration time of a key to a Unix timestamp. KEYS DB.Key().Keys Returns all key names that match a pattern. PERSIST DB.Key().Persist Removes the expiration time of a key. PEXPIRE DB.Key().Expire Sets the expiration time of a key in ms. PEXPIREAT DB.Key().ExpireAt Sets the expiration time of a key to a Unix ms timestamp. RANDOMKEY DB.Key().Random Returns a random key name from the database. RENAME DB.Key().Rename Renames a key and overwrites the destination. RENAMENX DB.Key().RenameNotExists Renames a key only when the target key name doesn't exist. SCAN DB.Key().Scanner Iterates over the key names in the database. The following generic commands are not planned for 1.0: COPY DUMP EXPIRETIME MIGRATE MOVE OBJECT PEXPIRETIME PTTL RESTORE SORT SORT_RO TOUCH TTL TYPE UNLINK WAIT WAITAOF Transactions Redka supports the following transaction commands: Command Go API Description ------- ------ ----------- DISCARD DB.View / DB.Update Discards a transaction. EXEC DB.View / DB.Update Executes all commands in a transaction. MULTI DB.View / DB.Update Starts a transaction. Unlike Redis, Redka's transactions are fully ACID, providing automatic rollback in case of failure. The following transaction commands are not planned for 1.0: UNWATCH WATCH Server/connection management Redka supports only a couple of server and connection management commands: Command Go API Description ------- ------ ----------- ECHO - Returns the given string. FLUSHDB DB.Key().DeleteAll Remove all keys from the database. The rest of the server and connection management commands are not planned for 1.0. Installation Redka can be installed as a standalone Redis-compatible server, or as a Go module for in-process use. Standalone server Redka server is a single-file binary. Download it from the releases. Linux (x86 CPU only): curl -L -O \"https://github.com/nalgeon/redka/releases/download/v0.2.0/redka_linux_amd64.zip\" unzip redka_linux_amd64.zip chmod +x redka macOS (both x86 and ARM/Apple Silicon CPU): curl -L -O \"https://github.com/nalgeon/redka/releases/download/v0.2.0/redka_darwin_amd64.zip\" unzip redka_darwin_amd64.zip # remove the build from quarantine # (macOS disables unsigned binaries) xattr -d com.apple.quarantine redka chmod +x redka Or pull with Docker as follows (x86/ARM): docker pull nalgeon/redka Or build from source (requires Go 1.22 and GCC): git clone https://github.com/nalgeon/redka.git cd redka make setup build # the path to the binary after the build # will be ./build/redka Go module Install the module as follows: go get github.com/nalgeon/redka You'll also need an SQLite driver. Use github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 if you don't mind CGO. Otherwise use a pure Go driver modernc.org/sqlite. Install either with go get like this: go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 Usage Redka can be used as a standalone Redis-compatible server, or as an embeddable in-process server with Go API. Standalone server Redka server is a single-file binary. After downloading and unpacking the release asset, run it as follows: redka [-h host] [-p port] [db-path] For example: ./redka ./redka data.db ./redka -h 0.0.0.0 -p 6379 data.db Server defaults are host localhost, port 6379 and empty DB path. Running without a DB path creates an in-memory database. The data is not persisted in this case, and will be gone when the server is stopped. You can also run Redka with Docker as follows: # database inside the container # will be lost when the container stops docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 nalgeon/redka # persistent database # using the /path/to/data host directory docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 -v /path/to/data:/data nalgeon/redka # in-memory database, custom post docker run --rm -p 6380:6380 nalgeon/redka redka -h 0.0.0.0 -p 6380 Server defaults in Docker are host 0.0.0.0, port 6379 and DB path /data/redka.db. Once the server is running, connect to it using redis-cli or an API client like redis-py or go-redis — just as you would with Redis. redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 127.0.0.1:6379> echo hello \"hello\" 127.0.0.1:6379> set name alice OK 127.0.0.1:6379> get name \"alice\" In-process server The primary object in Redka is the DB. To open or create your database, use the redka.Open() function: package main import ( \"log\" _ \"github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3\" \"github.com/nalgeon/redka\" ) func main() { // Open or create the data.db file. db, err := redka.Open(\"data.db\", nil) if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) } // Always close the database when you are finished. defer db.Close() // ... } Don't forget to import the driver (here I use github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3). Using modernc.org/sqlite is slightly different, see example/modernc/main.go for details. To open an in-memory database that doesn't persist to disk, use the following path: // All data is lost when the database is closed. redka.Open(\"file:redka?mode=memory&cache=shared\") After opening the database, call redka.DB methods to run individual commands: db.Str().Set(\"name\", \"alice\") db.Str().Set(\"age\", 25) count, err := db.Key().Count(\"name\", \"age\", \"city\") slog.Info(\"count\", \"count\", count, \"err\", err) name, err := db.Str().Get(\"name\") slog.Info(\"get\", \"name\", name, \"err\", err) count count=2 err= get name=\"alice\" err= See the full example in example/simple/main.go. Use transactions to batch commands. There are View (read-only transaction) and Update (writable transaction) methods for this: updCount := 0 err := db.Update(func(tx *redka.Tx) error { err := tx.Str().Set(\"name\", \"bob\") if err != nil { return err } updCount++ err = tx.Str().Set(\"age\", 50) if err != nil { return err } updCount++ return nil }) slog.Info(\"updated\", \"count\", updCount, \"err\", err) updated count=2 err= See the full example in example/tx/main.go. See the package documentation for API reference. Persistence Redka stores data in a SQLite database using the following tables: rkey --- id integer primary key key text not null type integer not null -- 1 string, 2 list, 3 set, 4 hash, 5 sorted set version integer not null -- incremented when the key value is updated etime integer -- expiration timestamp in unix milliseconds mtime integer not null -- modification timestamp in unix milliseconds rstring --- key_id integer not null -- FK -> rkey.id value blob not null rhash --- key_id integer not null -- FK -> rkey.id field text not null value blob not null To access the data with SQL, use views instead of tables: select * from vstring; ┌────────┬──────┬───────┬───────┬─────────────────────┐ │ key_id │ key │ value │ etime │ mtime │ ├────────┼──────┼───────┼───────┼─────────────────────┤ │ 1 │ name │ alice │ │ 2024-04-03 16:58:14 │ │ 2 │ age │ 50 │ │ 2024-04-03 16:34:52 │ └────────┴──────┴───────┴───────┴─────────────────────┘ etime and mtime are in UTC. There is a separate view for every data type: vstring vhash Performance I've compared Redka with Redis using redis-benchmark with the following parameters: 10 parallel connections 1000000 requests 10000 randomized keys GET/SET commands SQLite settings: pragma journal_mode = wal; pragma synchronous = normal; pragma temp_store = memory; pragma mmap_size = 268435456; pragma foreign_keys = on; Hardware: Apple M1 8-core CPU, 16GB RAM Redis: redis-server --appendonly no redis-benchmark -p 6379 -q -c 10 -n 1000000 -r 10000 -t get,set SET: 133262.25 requests per second, p50=0.055 msec GET: 139217.59 requests per second, p50=0.055 msec Redka (in-memory): ./redka -p 6380 redis-benchmark -p 6380 -q -c 10 -n 1000000 -r 10000 -t get,set SET: 30084.24 requests per second, p50=0.255 msec GET: 63011.97 requests per second, p50=0.103 msec Redka (persisted to disk): ./redka -p 6380 data.db redis-benchmark -p 6380 -q -c 10 -n 1000000 -r 10000 -t get,set SET: 21913.01 requests per second, p50=0.335 msec GET: 56795.59 requests per second, p50=0.119 msec So while Redka is 2-6 times slower than Redis (not surprising, since we are comparing a relational database to a key-value data store), it can still do 22K writes/sec and 57K reads/sec, which is pretty good if you ask me. Note that running in a container may result in poorer performance. Roadmap The project is on its way to 1.0. The 1.0 release will include the following features from Redis 2.x (which I consider the \"golden age\" of the Redis API): ✅ Strings. ⬜ Lists. ⬜ Sets. ✅ Hashes. ⏳ Sorted sets. ✅ Key management. ✅ Transactions. ✅ = done, ⏳ = in progress, ⬜ = next in line Future versions may include additional data types (such as streams, HyperLogLog or geo), features like publish/subscribe, and more commands for existing types. Features I'd rather not implement even in future versions: Lua scripting. Authentication and ACLs. Multiple databases. Watch/unwatch. Features I definitely don't want to implement: Cluster. Sentinel. More information Contributing Contributions are welcome. For anything other than bugfixes, please first open an issue to discuss what you want to change. Be sure to add or update tests as appropriate. Acknowledgements Redka would not be possible without these great projects and their creators: Redis (Salvatore Sanfilippo).

    "commentBody": "Redis re-implemented with SQLite (github.com/nalgeon)388 points by tosh 21 hours agohidepastfavorite104 comments jitl 13 hours agoI’m not sure to what degree you want to follow the Redis no concurrency “everything serialized on one thread” model. You can get substantially better performance out of sqlite by using the lower level https://github.com/crawshaw/sqlite, turning on WAL etc, using a connection per goroutine for reads, and sending batches of writes over a buffered channel / queue to a dedicated writer thread. That way you can turn off SQLite’s built in per-connection mutex but still be thread safe since each connection is only used on a single thread at a time. For this use-case you will also probably save a lot of time if you use some large arena-style buffers (probably N per conn?) and copy incoming parameter bytes from the network request/socket to the buffer, or copy straight from sqlite out to the socket, instead of allocating and passing around a bunch of individual strings. Boxing those strings in interface{} (as done by the high level sql stdlib) slows things down even more. None of this is necessary to get usable perf, even decently good perf, just sharing some tips from my experience trying to get absolutely maximum write throughput from SQLite in Golang. reply SJC_Hacker 10 hours agoparent> You can get substantially better performance out of sqlite by using the lower level https://github.com/crawshaw/sqlite, turning on WAL etc, using a connection per goroutine for reads, and sending batches of writes over a buffered channel / queue to a dedicated writer thread. That way you can turn off SQLite’s built in per-connection mutex but still be thread safe since each connection is only used on a single thread at a time. Would this protect against a row update in the middle of a read? e.g. would a row at least be internally consistent at the time it was read? reply lanstin 9 hours agorootparentYes you would still get SQLite file locking; the thing you aren't using is SQLite thread locking around its own structures (according to GP, I don't know myself). But be sure not to use NFS mount for the files, the locking there is not that great. reply nalgeon 12 hours agoparentprevGreat tips, thank you! The thing is, getting maximum throughput is not the goal of the project (at least not at this stage). I'm using reasonable SQLite defaults (including WAL), but that's it for now. reply nalgeon 14 hours agoprevI'm a big fan of both Redis and SQLite, so I decided to combine the two. SQLite is specifically designed for many small queries[1], and it's probably as close as relational engines can get to Redis, so I think it might be a good fit. [1]: https://sqlite.org/np1queryprob.html reply sesm 11 hours agoparentWhat are the project goals? I assume it's a drop-in replacement for Redis that is supposed to be better in certain cases? If yes, then what cases do you have in mind? reply nalgeon 11 hours agorootparentThe goal is to have a convenient API to work with common data structures, with an SQL backend and all the benefits it provides. Such as: — Small memory footprint even for large datasets. — ACID transactions. — SQL interface for introspection and reporting. reply grobbyy 9 hours agorootparentprevI can tell you my use case. I have a lot of systems which I'd like to use on a single computer AND at scale. That's sometimes even just for development work. A lot of these use a common API to a more complex distributed store, as well as to something simple like files on disk, in memory, or SQLite. I'm most cases, it's one user at a time, so performance doesn't matter, but simplicity does. It can also be for the project which has a 1 percent chance of going viral. Etc. But I find relatively few cases between truly small scale and large scale. reply b33j0r 11 hours agoparentprevI love this, it’s the solution that makes sense for 90% of the times I have used redis with python. I’ve made several versions of this, and to be honest, it ended up being so straightforward that I assumed it was a trivial solution. This is pretty well-planned. This is 100% the way to go. Heh. I took a detour into making my idea of “streams” also solve event sourcing in native python; dumb idea, if interesting. Mission creep probably killed my effort! Nice work reply justinclift 6 hours agoparentprevThat's pretty cool. Reckon it would work with existing code that calls Redis over the wire for RQ? https://python-rq.org This RQ stuff has been a pain with a recent project because only Python seems to use it, so once an RQ job has been submitted only Python based things can do anything with it. :( If Redka works as a backend replacement, we could potentially have non-Python things check the SQLite database instead. reply nalgeon 5 hours agorootparentIt works with redis-py (which python-rq uses), but I doubt it will be any good in this case. python-rq seems to use Lua scripting in Redis, which is not planned for 1.0.

Some connectors to Redis like .NET IDistributedCache use lua. reply alerighi 13 hours agoparentprevAt that point why using Redis entirely? You can use any DBMS you want, either relational or NoSQL. The advantage of Redis is that it is a memory cache, if you take out the memory from it, just use Postgres or whatever DBMS you are using (I say Postgres because it has all the features of Redis). reply dalyons 12 hours agorootparentPostgres has nowhere near all the features of redis. Go and have a look at the redis command’s documentation. They’re not even really similar at all, once you get past basic GET/SET stuff. reply pshc 12 hours agorootparentI feel like one could implement most Redis commands as functions or PL/SQL using native Postgres hstore and json. Could be an interesting translation layer. reply from-nibly 12 hours agorootparentprevCan you name an explicit thing that postgres does not do that redis does? reply jitl 12 hours agorootparentThis is silly, Postgres doesn’t speak the Redis wire protocol. You will need a large army of connection proxies to get a Postgres database to handle the number of connections a single Redis shrugs off with no sweat. Maybe you like this answer more: At the end of the day you can embed a bunch of Turing-complete programming languages in Postgres, and Postgres can store binary blobs, so Postgres can do literally anything. Can it do it performantly, and for low cost? Probably not. But if you put in enough time and money I’m sure you can re-implement Redis on Postgres using BLOB column alone. Here’s a simpler answer: cuckoo filter is available out of the box in Redis, 2 seconds of Googling I didn’t find one for Postgres: https://redis.io/docs/latest/develop/data-types/probabilisti... reply codetrotter 12 hours agorootparentNot sure if this one could be used in order to do what you want but maybe? https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/bloom.html Have a look reply pgaddict 20 minutes agorootparentNo, that's a completely different thing - an index access method, building a bloom filter on multiple columns of a single row. Which means a query then can have an equality condition on any of the columns. That being said, building a bloom/cuckoo filter as a data type would be quite trivial - a basic version might take an hour or two, the more advanced stuff (to support partial aggregates etc) might take a bit more. Ultimately, this is not that different from what postgresql-hll does. reply jetbalsa 15 hours agoparentprevI've used SSDB[0] in the past for some really stupid large datasets (20TB)_and it worked really well in production [0] https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb reply welder 14 hours agorootparentI switched from SSDB to Kvrocks recently, because SSDB is abandoned and the author missing for 3 years now.

Redis is at the \"very fast, but unsafe\" side of the scale. ScyllaDB for me is in the middle of being high performance key-value store, but not really supporting transactions. FoundationDB is another one that I would consider. reply tyre 11 hours agorootparentDepends on the kind of safety you’re looking for. Redis is entirely safe from concurrency issues because it’s single-threaded. It supports an append-only file for persistence to disk. reply yuppiepuppie 15 hours agoparentprevCurious, What’s the use case? reply jitl 15 hours agorootparentRedis drops data semi randomly when under memory pressure. If you use Redis for queue tasks (this is popular in Rails and Django/Python web services), that means that during an incident where your queue jobs are getting added faster than they’re removed, you’re going to lose jobs if the incident goes on long enough. reply byroot 14 hours agorootparentThat depends on how the `maxmemory-policy` is configured, and queue systems based on Redis will tell you not to allow eviction. https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Using-Redis#memory (it even logs a warnings if it detects your Redis is misconfigured IIRC). reply kiitos 14 hours agorootparentprevWell, of course! Redis is not (and has never been) a database, it's a data structure server, at best described as a cache. If jobs are added faster than they're removed, this is straight queueing theory 101 -- ideally you'd reject jobs at add-time, but otherwise you have to drop them. reply gnarbarian 13 hours agorootparentRight. I think Redis hitting the disk would be a terrible tradeoff compared to making a new backend call. it probably wouldn't save you much time and I imagine it would lead to very strange and unpredictable behavior on the front end or trying to debug latency or data issues downstream reply prisenco 13 hours agorootparentprevSince Redis is an in-memory cache, and already doesn't guarantee the data, would it make sense to set PRAGMA SYNCHRONOUS on nalgeon to OFF to boost performance to something closer to standard Redis? reply qwertox 15 hours agorootparentprevMy same thought, because some don't require much memory. reply akie 14 hours agorootparentThe use case is caching 20 million API responses that almost never change, each about 20kb of JSON, for a high traffic site. Yes, I can pay for a 400Gb RAM instance of Redis, but it's expensive. I can also cache it on disk, but then I need to think about cache expiration myself. Or I can use something appropriate like a document database, but then I need additional code & additional configuration because we otherwise don't need that piece of infrastructure in our stack. It would be a lot easier if I could just store it in Redis with the other (more reasonably sized) things that I need to cache. reply seddonm1 13 hours agorootparentIn other abuses of SQLite, I wrote a tool [0] that exposes blobs in SQLite via an Amazon S3 API. It doesn't do expiry (but that would be easy enough to add if S3 does it). We were using it to manage a millions of images for machine learning as many tools support S3 and the ability to add custom metadata to objects is useful (harder with files). It is one SQLite database per bucket but at the bucket level it is transactional. 0: https://github.com/seddonm1/s3ite reply mannyv 4 hours agorootparentprevIf you're caching 20m api requests that almost never change use s3. I mean heck, it's cheaper, can be cdn'd, and can be pipelined by the browser. reply phamilton 13 hours agorootparentprevA few things: Redis Data Tiering - Redis Enterprise and AWS Elasticache for Redis support data tiering (using SSD for 80% of the dataset and moving things in and out). On AWS, a cache.r6gd.4xlarge with 100GB of memory can handle 500GB of data. Local Files > I can also cache it on disk, but then I need to think about cache expiration myself. Is the challenge that you need it shared among many machines? On a single machine you can put 20 million files in a directory hierarchy and let the fs cache keep things hot in memory as needed. Or use SQLite which will only load the pages needed for each query and also rely on the fs cache. S3 - An interesting solution is one of the SQLite S3 VFS's. Those will query S3 fairly efficiently for specific data in a large dataset. reply Nican 14 hours agorootparentprevThis looks like a good use case for ScyllaDB with Compression and TTL. It is pretty simple to setup a single-node instance. If you rather have something in-process and writes to disk, to avoid extra infrastructure, I would also recommend RocksDB with Compression and TTL. reply reese_john 13 hours agorootparentprevYou could try using Amazon S3 Express, a low-latency alternative for S3 buckets [0]. I imagine cache invalidation would be relatively simple to implement using lifecycle policies. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-exp... reply danpat 13 hours agorootparentprevOr shard it - divide your objects up based on some criteria (hash the name of the object, use the first N digits of the hash to assign to a shard), and distribute them across multiple redis instances. Yes, you then need to maintain some client code to pick the right redis instance to fetch from, but you can now pick the most $/memory efficient instance types to run redis, and you don't have to worry about introducing disk read latency and the edge cases that brings with it. Edit: looks like redis has some built-in support for data sharding when used as a cluster (https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/cluster-shards/) - I haven't used that, so not sure how easy it is to apply, and exactly what you'd have to change. reply yuliyp 13 hours agorootparentSharding doesn't help here at all. They'd still need the same amount of RAM to house all the data in redis. reply yuliyp 13 hours agorootparentprevYou're trying to get redis to be what it isn't. Use a thing that has the properties you want: a document or relational database. If you insist on this then running a system that allows a ton of swap onto a reasonably fast disk might work, but is still gonna perform worse than a system that's designed for concurrently serving queries of wildly differing latencies. reply minitech 9 hours agorootparentYes, that was the context: a Redis alternative to support the same operations but be what Redis isn’t. reply 0cf8612b2e1e 13 hours agorootparentprevWould DiskCache work for you? Runs via SQLite memory or persisted file database. Thread safe, has various expiration controls, etc. https://grantjenks.com/docs/diskcache/tutorial.html reply kiitos 12 hours agorootparentprevRedis is an in-memory cache by definition. If you don't want to cache in-memory, then don't use Redis. reply tayo42 8 hours agorootparentprevHave you looked at varnish for caching api responses?

You can run anything on top of a ramdisk (granted, you can save a few pointer additions and get rid of some safety checks if you know you're working with memory) reply yuliyp 13 hours agorootparentSure you can run things off a ramdisk, but the way you lay out data to achieve high performance from disk vs from RAM is different (disk assumes that you read pages of data at once, and tries to avoid reading extra pages, while RAM assumes that you read cache lines of data at once). reply 77pt77 14 hours agoparentprevYou can tun sqlite in memory by using the filename :memory: reply nasretdinov 13 hours agoprevBy the way, I noticed you're using SetMaxConnections(1), however in WAL mode (which you're using) SQLite does support writes that don't block reads, so you might benefit from allowing read concurrency (in theory). reply nalgeon 13 hours agoparentYeah, it's explained in the code[1] SQLite only allows one writer at a time, so concurrent writes will fail with a \"database is locked\" (SQLITE_BUSY) error. There are two ways to enforce the single writer rule: 1. Use a mutex for write operations. 2. Set the maximum number of DB connections to 1. Intuitively, the mutex approach seems better, because it does not limit the number of concurrent read operations. The benchmarks show the following results: - GET: 2% better rps and 25% better p50 response time with mutex - SET: 2% better rps and 60% worse p50 response time with mutex Due to the significant p50 response time mutex penalty for SET, I've decided to use the max connections approach for now. [1]: https://github.com/nalgeon/redka/blob/main/internal/sqlx/db.... reply Sytten 13 hours agorootparentThis is really not true in WAL mode with synchronous NORMAL, this was only true with the default journal mode and a lot of people are misusing sqlite because of that. You still have one writer at a time but you wont get the SQLITE_BUSY error. You can check the documentation [1], only some rare edge cases return this error in WAL. We abuse our sqlite and I never saw it happen with a WAL db. [1] https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html#sometimes_queries_return_sql... reply nasretdinov 13 hours agorootparentprevHow about having two pools, one for writes only, and the other one for reads? SQLite allows you to open the DB more than in one thread per application, so you can have a read pool and a write pool with SetMaxConnections(1) for better performance. This of course also means that reads should be handled separately from writes in the API layer too. reply nalgeon 13 hours agorootparentThought about it, decided to start with simpler and good enough option. The goal here is not to beat Redis anyway. reply nasretdinov 13 hours agorootparentWell I agree, that's a good starting point. You probably won't be able to beat Redis with SQLite anyway :), although given that WAL mode allows for concurrent reads it might give it a large enough performance boost to match Redis in terms of QPS if the concurrency is high enough. reply avinassh 6 hours agorootparentprevHave you tried setting BUSY_TIMEOUT and benched it? I believe it would be better too. https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout reply kiitos 12 hours agorootparentprev> The benchmarks show the following results Where are the benchmarks? reply mrinterweb 11 hours agoprevA lot redis's fantastic performance evaporates when network IO is added to the equation. Of course, you can host your own redis, but as soon as people start using a SaaS hosted redis service, performance usually takes a huge hit. If this makes running your own redis compatible key/val store easier for people in your own cluster, that's a win. reply surfingdino 11 hours agoprevBack when Foursquare made MongoDB famous someone posted a PoC of a NoSQL DB implemented in MySQL.

With this you can run a full SQL query. I did something similiar for my small baseball statistics website switchfielder.com/baseball. On server startup, I copy the relevant tables into memory. reply whoitwas 10 hours agorootparentI thought the point of Redis was to avoid hitting DB. Why not just use SQL? reply SJC_Hacker 7 hours agorootparentBecause you are guaranteeing everything is in memory, so its very fast and you aren't relying on the DB memory caching. Also it is in-process, which (supposedly) has some benefits as well. Theoretically DBs such as Postgres can be set up similarly, although they will be out of process, and in the case of Postgres, behind at least a UNIX domain socket. This may be a difference of maybe ~ms, I\"d love to see some benchmarks ... maybe I'll try that when I have time. Could make a decent Medium article ... For an OLAP (i.e., no writes), small databases with complicated queries(joins, grouping, partitioning, ordering, etc.) this works very well. Yes this is somewhat of an edge case, but I'd bet small shops could fit their entire DB into one of the bigger (several hundred GB) instances. reply TheChaplain 13 hours agoprevHmm, am I the only one who is not worried?

Users may perceive your product as a drop-in Redis replacement, and it may work fine in a PoC, but once it hits production, SQLite's performance and scalability will be severely challenged. It's much better to use RocksDB as the underlying storage engine for such a solution.

I will look into optimizing this part. other than that, gpt4 is expensive, but so far it’s been negligible so i am hopeful. i feel i can keep it around for long. reply RamblingCTO 4 hours agoprevA year ago I implemented this as well (albeit as a commercial offering with 100 free scrapes per month): https://2markdown.com It also has javascript-enabled browsing available in private beta. Will make it public this week. In my experience, people fall back to the simple scraping and not use js that much, if at all. reply LeonidBugaev 14 hours agoprevOne of the cases when AI not needed.

Edit - This is an excellent use of it, a free text human input capable of doing things like extracting summaries. It does not seem to be used at all for the basic task of extracting content, but for post filtering. reply cactusfrog 13 hours agorootparentI think “copy from a PDF” could be improved with AI. It’s been 30 years and I still get new lines in the middle of sentences when I try to copy from one. reply IanCal 13 hours agorootparentThat's a great use case, you might be able to do this if you've got a copy and paste on the command line with https://github.com/simonw/llm In between. An alias like pdfwtf translating to \"pastellm commandcopy\" reply genewitch 11 hours agorootparentprevi've long assumed that is a \"feature\" of PDF akin to DRM. Making copying text from a PDF makes sense from a publisher's standpoint. reply hombre_fatal 12 hours agorootparentprevMeh, it’s just the “how does it work?” question. How content extractors work is interesting and not obvious nor trivial. And even when you see how readability parser works, AI handles most of the edge cases that content extractors fail on, so they are genuinely superseded by LLMs. reply fbdab103 12 hours agoparentprevI was honestly expecting it to be mostly black magic, but it looks like the meat of the project is a bunch of (surely hard won) regexes.

Pandoc is up there as one of the most useful tools that exist, that almost no one talks about. It's amazing, easy to use, and works. I regularly see new tools in the space pop-up, but someone would have to have a REALLY unique and compelling feature, or highly optimized use case to get me to use anything else (besides Pandoc). reply thangalin 12 hours agorootparentI wrote a series of blog posts about typesetting Markdown using pandoc: https://dave.autonoma.ca/blog Eventually, I found pandoc to be a little limiting: * Awkward to use interpolated variables within prose. * No real-time preview prior to rendering the final document. * Limited options for TeX support (e.g., SVG vs. inline; ConTeXt vs. LaTeX). * Inconsistent syntax for captions and cross-references. * Requires glue to apply a single YAML metadata source file to multiple documents (e.g., book chapters). * Does not (reliably) convert straight quotes to curly quotes. For my purposes, I wanted to convert variable-laden Markdown and R Markdown to text, XHTML, and PDF formats. Eventually I replaced my tool chain of yamlp + pandoc + knitr by writing an integrated FOSS cross-platform desktop editor. https://keenwrite.com/ KeenWrite uses flexmark-java + Renjin + KeenTeX + KeenQuotes to provide a solution that can replace pandoc + knitr in some situations. Note how the captions and cross-reference syntax for images, tables, and equations is unified to use a double-colon sigil: https://gitlab.com/DaveJarvis/KeenWrite/-/blob/main/docs/ref...

    "originBody": "Home » Posts Kate on all Platforms - 2024 April 14, 2024 · 4 min · Christoph Cullmann Unix like systems with X11 or Wayland All Unix like systems with either X11 or Wayland are well supported since ever. Linux with X11 and now Wayland is for a long time the primary system on that Kate work happens. Over the years it was, like most of the KDE applications, ported to various BSD variants. Be it some mainstream Linux distribution like Fedora or a niche one like NixOS, Kate is available as binary package. You love BSD? From FreeBSD to OpenBSD, you can get a Kate package via your normal package system. And in the normal case, you can just build it from source on your own, all needed patches should be in our repositories upstream. If that is not the case for your system, please help to upstream them. Below the current state of the master branch compiled on NixOS unstable with Wayland. How to compile Kate on your own on a Unix like system and start to help to develop it can be found out here. Windows Since several years there are activities in the KDE community to provide our libraries and applications for Windows. Even if that is a non-free platform, we can reach out to new users and developers that might later be then even interested to switch a full open platform. Progress is slow, but steady. We have Kate and some other applications in the official Windows Store and nightly build for more of them. With reasonable effort you can develop Kate on Windows with Craft. Below the current state of the master branch running on Windows 11 inside VirtualBox. If you like to try that, use the nighly installer linked on the Kate website. macOS Beside Windows, the major other non-free platform Kate tries to support is macOS. We have nighly build available for that and you can, like on Windows, develop Kate with the help of Craft. Below the current state of the master branch running native on my M2 ARM Mac Mini. Same as for Windows, if you like to try that, use the nighly installer for either ARM or Intel Macs linked on the Kate website. Other Platforms Naturally there are more than the above mentioned operating systems around. Beside the mobile ones like Android and iOS that are not that interesting for Kate, many other desktop operating systems exist. Even if the Kate team itself doesn’t put active work it them, that doesn’t mean Kate can’t run there. Without any active work on our side, for example a Kate port for Haiku was done. Some one-liner patches for that got even upstreamed. If you work on some port of our stuff and need to upstream stuff, please contact us. Even if you work on a non-mainstream system, as long as the patches are not too intrusive, we are interested to have them. Help us! Naturally the most of our developers are working on the Linux or some BSD. That means the other systems are always in need of more people to help out, both on the programming and testing side. For Kate, testing should be easy, grab a nighly build for Windows or macOS on the Kate website. Or even better, get Craft running, that will make it easier to contribute, too. One recent topic that needs love is the removal of DBus for Windows/macOS/Android and other systems that don’t use it normally. If you are up to help with that, here that is coordinated. The current state is already sufficient that the nightly builds of Kate no longer hang on e.g. macOS, but still some frameworks like KIO will need more work. Just don’t get that wrong, DBus is great on the Linux or BSD systems that use it natively, but it is a pain on systems that have no notion of DBus and leads there to hangs or the spawning of unwanted processes. Beside that, the usefulness is low there, as there are no services on the bus to communicate with anyways.

I had a lab in MySQL, and back then, the only option to develop in Windows was MySQL Workbench, which was as heavy as it got. Running an SQL statement was painfully slow, and iteration cycles were huge. In Linux, you would write your SQL in Kate, and run MySQL's cli in the embedded terminal. Once ready, you would click the button “pipe to terminal\". Instant run. What took many minutes in Windows took less than 2 seconds in Linux. How can you not love this? Another reason was Amarok, an (the) mp3 player. Do you like how Spotify and other providers create automatically infinite playlists, radios, etc based on your tastes? Yes, KDE had this since 2002 I think? It was first copied by iTunes, then by Spotify, and now is considered a standard function. :) reply jwrallie 10 hours agoparentAlso k3b was an amazing software for burning CDs back then, its interface easily rivaled contemporary proprietary software. KDE 3.5 was one of the peaks (if not the peak) of graphical interfaces on GNU/Linux. Experiencing KDE at the time I was used to the Windows XP interface felt amazing, and soon after Vista promises of innovation on interface were nothing compared to what could be done in Compiz (More on the Gnome 2 side). reply xvedejas 10 hours agorootparentKDE is still great! I continue to see improvements and KDE6 has some killer features like KDE Connect. (we still don't talk about KDE4 though) reply The_Colonel 6 hours agorootparentKDE4 is a sad story. It ruined the reputation of KDE for a very long time. I loved KDE 3.5, but then came back to KDE only in 2021. It's mostly just a problem of communication. KDE 4.0 should not have been marked as stable and should not been used by distros. If they baked KDE4 for two more years and on the side maintained/developed 3.5, the transition might be much smoother. reply adrian_b 1 hour agorootparentWhile there were some bugs in early KDE 4, those were not the main problem. No amount of baking could have saved it. The main problem was caused by the completely different purposes of the new developers, who have removed all the outstanding customization features of KDE 3.5. For me, indeed KDE 3.5 has been the best graphic desktop that I have ever seen. Neither before, nor after and neither on Apple or Windows have I encountered anything as good. The main reason for this was that KDE 3.5 allowed extreme customization, so you could make your own graphic desktop that did not resemble at all the default desktop. After the shock of experiencing the garbage KDE 4, even if I had waited a half of year before making the transition, with the hope that any major bugs would be solved, I have reverted to KDE 3.5 for a few years, until it had become much to painful to make upgrades in such a way as to not damage it. Then I have switched to XFCE, which does not provide as much as the old KDE 3.5, but at least it does not get in the way of your work with undesirable and hard to remove features. Moreover, any useful KDE applications, such as Kate, work perfectly fine on XFCE, together with any useful Gnome applications. The same kind of developer philosophy, that users are dumb and they must be prevented from customizing the application has characterized the developers who have converted the Mozilla browser into Firefox, which is another unwelcome change that I have greatly hated. reply bigstrat2003 5 hours agorootparentprevThat version thing was frustrating because it was an unforced error. Surely someone, at some point, brought up that people would expect the version number to mean that it was ready for use. But they chose to proceed with using their idiosyncratic version scheme, and unsurprisingly suffered a reputation hit for it. reply FeepingCreature 4 hours agorootparentprevKDE4 ruined Amarok too.

I recently switched from a very custom Linux setup with a tiling window manager and all kinds of bells and whistles. The Plasma 6 release in combination with running NixOS which makes trying things out both easily and safely convinced me to give it a shot and I simply haven't left. It took some setup, of course, but Plasma is wonderfully configurable and has everything I wanted available with some tweaking. Whereas GNOME and others required extensions, which are often out of date or somewhat sketchy -- before I could set things up how I like. Big fan so far. reply pimeys 2 hours agorootparentExactly what happened to me too! Been using a Sway setup on NixOS for many many years, and I was just curious to try out Plasma 6. After a small config change, I had the desktop up and running, and I was impressed how it felt like. You can even use plasma-manager to store your KDE settings to a nix configuration, which make it easy to have a unified configuration across different computers. https://github.com/pjones/plasma-manager reply 127 8 hours agorootparentprevKonqueror and KHTML was also the basis for Google Chrome IIRC. reply wlesieutre 8 hours agorootparentBy way of WebKit reply vundercind 8 hours agorootparentprevI had a love-hate relationship with k3b because years ago it was the only cd burner program that was both somewhat stable and otherwise not terrible on Linux, but also it was the only KDE program I just had to have on my XFCE Gentoo system, which meant compiling allllll of kde libs and qt and losing a bunch of disk space to them. reply BeetleB 5 hours agorootparentprevAh, k3b. Good memories. Seems the project is alive and well! reply jchmbrln 11 hours agoparentprevYes! When I started using Kate on Linux ca. 2005, I was coming from Notepad on Windows and couldn’t believe how nice it was. I believe it was my first experience of syntax highlighting. And Amarok! I haven’t thought of that in a while. Losing Amarok was my single biggest regret when I became a Max user. I’ve not used anything since that came close. reply doubled112 8 hours agorootparentWhat about Clementine or Strawberry? Clementine was a fork of Amarok 1.4, and Strawberry a fork of Clementine. I recently discovered Strawberry would play music off of my Subsonic server (Navidrome really) and was thrilled to have something for music that didn't feel like a web app. reply jraph 3 hours agorootparentprev> I was coming from Notepad on Windows Ouch. You didn't use Notepad++? reply Symbiote 2 hours agorootparentNotepad++ would have been very new at that time. I don't know what those early releases were like. But there were similar editors. I remember using SCIte which was similar to Notepad++. SCIte was first released in 1999. reply distances 25 minutes agorootparentMy editor of choice back in the Windows days was EditPlus, from 1998 (and looks like it's still maintained).

Kate fulfills for me the role that Np++ had back in the windows days. I use it when I want to work file based and not project- or directory based. reply p4bl0 14 hours agoparentIf you need to work file based and not project or directory based then you should probably be using Kwrite, which literary is a stripped down version of Kate specifically for this purpose. reply calvinmorrison 13 hours agorootparentWhich shows how far ahead KDE was even in 3.5 times with reusable embeddable components that were highly engineered. For example Konqueror has a long list of plugins including calling kwrite to render inside of it. The early kio tooling that predates fuse in having universal access through a single file viewer. reply doubled112 13 hours agorootparentWas that what they called KParts?

Np++ is starting to annoy me, with it's constant reopening of like 50 files every time it's started lol. reply copperx 14 hours agorootparentThe fix is a checkbox away in the np++ settings dialog. That just goes to show that defaults are incredibly powerful. reply gerdesj 13 hours agorootparentprevN++ can tail and follow files and colour code the output. Smashing! Kate recently opens a default start page which I now find annoying. Kate also opens all previously opened files by default. All of these things are defaults that are easy to override but changing defaults can be annoying, especially when you have been used the previous defaults for more than a decade ... reply Smar 8 hours agorootparentKwrite nowadays supports tabs.

The entire thing, like systemd and wayland, is a glorified excuse to reinvent the wheel so that a fresh batch of wizards can continue the cycle. reply The_Colonel 5 hours agorootparentAh, this thought stopping argument again. X11 is garbage which nobody wants to maintain, let alone develop. It's a very archaic design which is patched via extensions to sorta support some modern concepts which negate the network transparency anyway. Both Wayland and systemd have a very wide developer consensus, because they finally provide a maintainable solution to their respective problems. The drama is constructed by a small minority of contrarians. reply andreyv 5 hours agorootparentOld does not mean bad. Even a decade later Wayland struggles to provide basic features that were built in the X protocol. reply FeepingCreature 4 hours agorootparentWhen rewriting apps, people have a tendency to say: \"well, Oldversion provides X.

Good to see! If anything happens to BBEdit, Kate may be my next move reply leejoramo 7 hours agoparentNow I am interested BBEdit is the default editor for me. I say this has someone who has used BBEdit since around 1997. And while for the last 15 years I have moved on to primarily using Sublime and then VSCode, I always configure them to be as close to BBEdit as possible, though I can never match BBEdit’s Single/Multi-File Search and Replace or Compare features.

So I really need to give Kate a chance. reply bayindirh 12 hours agoparentprevI'm using KATE on Linux and BBEdit in macOS to develop in Golang mainly. Kate is snappy, robust and feature packed.

Years past you'd have to pay for things like UltraEdit and fight licenses, etc which are a nightmare if you cross boundaries with big companies. I find myself using Kate, Geany and Notepad++ at different points in time for different tasks across my Windows/macOS/Linux machines. Kate surprised me a few months ago, I had to write assembly for a fully custom processor whose ISA is not at all industry standard. Kate was able to do the syntax highlighting and with the right color theme and \"double-click to highlight\" it made the non-trivial changes I needed to make a LOT easier than anything else (VSCode/VSCodium included). reply patorick002 4 hours agoprevI logged in solely to say that Kate was the main reason I stuck with KDE as my desktop environment, back in the KDE 3 days. I switched to Mac some time ago but I still use Kate as my editor. I'm happy that it still exists. reply brabel 4 hours agoparentKate on MacOS is terrible. I've tried helping them fix the shortcuts which are all \"wrong\" (MacOS uses certain shortcuts that are unlike most Unix systems, but Kate doesn't actually use the right ones all Mac users expect so it's a nightmare until you manually override at least some of the shortcuts yourself). I tried using the build tool (suggested in the article) but building Kate was a nightmare even with that... I had to give up after a few days trying random things as suggested by people on the Kate chat (each build was taking hours, then finally failing with some completely inscrutable error). Even though I really enjoyed using Kate on Linux, as a mainly Mac user I had to forget about it and keep using emacs for random stuff, and IntelliJ for Java/Kotlin/Groovy/Dart and anything else well supported by Jetbrains. reply diffeomorphism 3 hours agorootparentThat sounds more like switching to macos being terrible.

Whatever your working on, you can save the session - including all open files and editor layouts, and restore it later on. reply opan 4 hours agorootparentThis is a killer feature in (n)vim as well. I had been trying out emacs + evil for some months at one point (was previously a vim user), but never got session restores working well at all. With vim it all restores, it's in the right spot, and even remote files opened with the scp:// syntax reopen perfectly. No plugins needed. I just use one session with the default filename of Session.vim, so a quick `nvim -S` gets me back in action and I don't mind restarting my editor much at all. With emacs I'd dread it and it was one of the worst parts of a session restart or reboot. Highly recommend anyone see if their favorite editor can do sessions. reply mxuribe 7 hours agoparentprevI suppose its a bit of several reasons: for sure taste, but also features, performance, etc. Its a GUI-based text editor, and not a big full-fledged IDE like VSCode. In my opinion, it pretty much follows the KDE philosophy (that I'll poorly paraphrase here) in that: using it and its features in their default settings will be totally fine to use as-is, but - like KDE Plasma for example - there are plenty of features that you can also unlock way beyond the default in order to allow for lots of customization and flexibility. It also is lightweight on resources considering its number of available features; closer to VIM, and lots lighter-weight than say VSCode. Many people would categorize Kate with other text editors like Geany, Notepad++, etc...and I agree with that categorization. Not sure if that helps! Then again, you could always check out some vidoes of Kate in use on youtube, or, if so inclined, perhaps try installing it and give it a run? reply derbOac 12 hours agoparentprevI've been using Kate for long time. I try other things but seem to gravitate back to Kate. It's relatively resource efficient and fast, very full-featured, open source, and I can use it on different OSes and it's pretty much the same everywhere. Also it's GUI, and has a standard GUI UX. I've never really had any problems with it at all until I started using it on ARM MacOS, where there were some weird bugs with filenames during saves (no corruption or anything, but would default to weird things and occasionally crash if the \"wrong\" filenames were used); but then the most recent major version seemed to fix all the problems. reply scaryclam 2 hours agorootparentI didn't know I could use it on MacOS. I recently started a new job where they have nothing but Mac, so I've been looking for a text editor that can do what Kate does. Everything seems to want to do 101 things before basic text editing, rather than just be a simple text editor with optional functionality, so I'm really excited to have Kate installed. I'm really hoping I don't run into too many issues as I've used Kate for years on my home & work setups and would really like to continue using it on mac now. reply IshKebab 13 hours agoparentprevIt's a lot lighter and faster than full IDEs like VSCode, and it also uses a modern GUI unlike Vim and Emacs. It's more like Notepad++. reply sneak 13 hours agoparentprevvim and emacs are TUI; Kate is a GUI app. VSCode is a full-fledged IDE; Kate is much simpler. Think of it as comparable to TextEdit or notepad.exe, but with more features. It's definitely trending in the VSCode direction, but VSCode is full of surveillance and corporate API clients, and Kate is not. reply nequo 13 hours agorootparentEmacs is not TUI. Its main frontend is GUI, you can display images, play videos, read PDFs in it if you want to. reply karmajunkie 8 hours agorootparentCome again?

All of the features you mentioned are things that have been added along the way as its container was able to support them. reply nequo 7 hours agorootparentHistorically being TUI-centric doesn’t mean that it is not GUI today, right?

    "originBody": "First Opinion Hospitals that make profits should pay taxes By Marty MakaryApril 14, 2024 Reprints Adobe As diligent taxpayers breathe a sigh of relief that the hassle of filing their tax forms is over for another year, the Internal Revenue Service continues to let most U.S. hospitals pay nothing in federal taxes. It’s time for Congress to take a hard look at the IRS’s hand in health care. The agency uses a vague “community benefit” standard to liberally grant tax-exempt status to so-called nonprofit hospitals even as many of them are financially taking advantage of sick Americans with inflated medical bills. Several of my Johns Hopkins colleagues and I published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that some nonprofit hospitals sue and garnish the wages of low-income patients who can’t afford to pay their medical bills. Where’s the community benefit in that? Nonprofit hospitals are supposed to be compassionate and merciful, not predatory and ruthless. advertisement Many hospitals force people who are suffering and seeking care in earnest to sign their financial life away as a condition of treatment. Some make contesting a bill difficult and others do not comply with the federal hospital transparency rule which requires hospitals to post prices for common shoppable services. The most recent money game that nonprofit hospitals are dialing up is adding billions of dollars in “facility fees” for routine care. These billing tricks are fleecing everyday Americans. Congress could make them disappear overnight if it passed a law disqualifying hospitals that use them from getting the coveted tax-exempt benefit. Many tax-exempt hospitals argue that they provide millions of dollars in free care. But here’s what’s really going on: Much of what they call free care is emergency care that hospitals are required to provide by law (the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act requires hospitals to care for anyone who walks in with an emergent condition). But after the care has been provided, patients are often hounded for payment, often at an artificially inflated price. Hospitals then report the difference between their high sticker price and what they actually collect after shaking down a patient as charity care. But that’s not charity. In a twist of irony, a 2021 study published in Health Affairs found that for-profit hospitals provided 65% more charity care than nonprofit ones. advertisement The bar for receiving tax-exempt status should not be simply abiding by the law. Related: HCA reports almost $1 billion more in charity care to Medicare than to its shareholders, drawing more taxpayer money Hospitals leaders across the nation have told me that they need to avoid federal taxes in order to survive. But the way taxes work, businesses are taxed only on their profits. Some hospitals hide their profits in cost-shift accounting and loan refinancing, even engaging in aggressive real estate and venture capital investing. According to public tax records, Cedars Sinai in Beverly Hills had an income surplus of $750 million in 2022 and paid no federal taxes. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York had $400 million and also paid no federal taxes. The top three hospital administrators there made nearly $20 million in salaries. Try booking an appointment at these or any nonprofit hospital and see if you can do it without insurance or cash up front. It’s nearly impossible. Most nonprofit hospitals will refuse to schedule appointments, even cancer care, unless you financially qualify by showing your ability to pay. If hospitals schedule appointments and operations only for people who financially qualify, arguing that they are a business, they should pay their fair share of taxes like every other American business. A Kaiser Family Foundation study estimated the total value of tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals was $28 billion in 2020 alone. By my calculation, that’s equivalent to a $107 tax credit for every American who filed a return that year. Momentum to stop this gaming of the system is growing. In August, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Bill Cassidy and Elizabeth Warren demanded more transparency from the IRS on the issue after a General Accountability Office report found that the agency “did not have a well-documented process” to ensure that hospitals met tax-exempt criteria. UPCOMING EVENT Connect with today's innovators & tomorrow's thought leaders We're hosting events nationwide (and virtually) to tackle the biggest questions in health and medicine. Browse our upcoming events to see what's on the horizon. Privacy Policy In October, Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee stressed the need to address the problem. “Many nonprofit hospital systems across the country are failing to provide low-income Americans with the affordable medical care required by their nonprofit status — despite receiving billions in tax benefits and providing exorbitant compensation packages to their senior executives,” he said in a statement. In another sign that government officials are getting fed up with hospitals paying no taxes, in 2023 a Pennsylvania judge revoked a hospital’s property tax exemption. This action came after the Pottstown school district sued the hospital, arguing that its special tax treatment resulted in $900,000 less revenue for the school each year. It’s not just the IRS’s lackadaisical approach to hospitals that’s mind-boggling. It’s also the agency’s hostility to direct primary care and other creative strategies developed by doctors to address chronic diseases. The IRS does not allow individuals or families who subscribe to direct primary care — a type of intensive primary care that takes extra time to focus on prevention — to include that cost as a tax-deductible health savings account expense. A 2019 White House executive order challenged this position to no avail. Last month, the IRS sternly warned Americans that they cannot use their own health savings account to buy healthy foods as directed by their doctors. The IRS continues to propagate a reactionary approach to sickness rather than a proactive approach to health. Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death in the U.S. and consume a majority of the $4.5 trillion Americans spend on health care. The current Whac-a-Mole system isn’t working. Most American adults take 4 or more prescription medications regularly, making the U.S. the most medicated population in the world. The country needs to try new approaches to health. Instead of scolding Americans who sign up for direct primary care or want to eat healthier foods, the IRS should hold hospitals accountable for the taxes they should be paying.

    "commentBody": "Hospitals that make profits should pay taxes (statnews.com)244 points by jyunwai 17 hours agohidepastfavorite181 comments mdasen 16 hours agoThis strikes at an issue we haven't really addressed enough in non-profits: how much community benefit do they need to offer? A non-profit simply means that there are no investors who can profit from the business. However, I think we haven't really thought enough about how much community benefit they need to offer to justify being tax exempt - and it's a hard problem. For example, let's say I run a non-profit hospital. We start getting a lot more revenue than costs. At a for-profit company, that's profits, but we don't have any investors. I decide \"No, we shouldn't lower prices or forgive medical debt. I want to use that excess money to create a fancy new medical building with my name on it and to create a medical research unit that will bring prestige to the hospital (and hopefully useful medical research that will help people in the future).\" Right now, that's an allowable non-profit use of that money. Universities do things like this all the time: a fancy new student center takes precedence over lower tuition. How do we deal with this? It's hard. New buildings aren't simply unjustified costs. My city wants to build a new elementary school because the current one is crumbling. A hospital or university will likewise need to invest in its facilities, but at some point it potentially crosses a threshold from necessary and useful spending toward vanity and serving the institution more than it serves the mission. Universities spend money on research-only professors who don't teach and things like that drive up tuition costs, but is that a reasonable expense for a university? It can depend on who you ask because different people will have different opinions on the purpose of a university. It's also hard because a successful non-profit will want to reinvest in itself and keep enough excess on hand in case something bad happens. Let's say I'm running a hospital and our costs are $1B in 2022 and we took in $1.2B. I use the excess $200M to rebate some of the fees to patients and forgive some medical debt. In 2023, our costs are again $1B and we took in $0.9B. Now I'm in a tough position. Do I lay off staff? Pay cuts? Take out a loan for $0.1B? What if 2024 is also a lean year? Likewise, let's say that I'm trying to run a patient-friendly facility. We take people without insurance and don't make them worry about the cost. Even if I'm able to successfully run my facility, other non-profit facilities that aren't as friendly are taking in more money. They start to pay their doctors better. Their facilities are newer and better kept. Nurses complain that I'm being stingy with their contract. The other hospitals are publishing fancy papers and their doctors are giving conference talks that attract donors away from my hospital. I think there's a survivorship thing happening here. If you have too little runway, you don't survive lean times. You run out of money and one of the less friendly hospitals \"buys\" your hospital (which often isn't a cash purpose since they're non-profits, but some sort of promise of keeping the mission of being a hospital alive). Should the government bail out non-profits who are serving the community better? Maybe, but it's hard to define that. The fancy non-profit hospitals will argue that they're serving the community even better. The rich and connected probably see the fancy hospitals as better and are likely their donors. The general public probably doesn't understand that one hospital might be more forgiving than another. So the general political consensus will likely be \"why should the taxpayer bail out a place that's 'poorly run' when the 'well run and better' hospital is willing to bail them out with no cost to the taxpayer?\" So, in order to keep my hospital, I can't run it too friendly. Plus, for my ego, I'd rather people think well of my hospital. I'd like to brag about the fancy new facility and have people think I'm doing something amazing. We give a lot more esteem to the president of Harvard than to the president of a school that's educating and helping way more people, but isn't as fancy. reply sarchertech 15 hours agoparent> This strikes at an issue we haven't really addressed enough in non-profits: how much community benefit do they need to offer? A non-profit simply means that there are no investors who can profit from the business. Non-profit and tax exempt aren’t the same thing. A non-profit must apply for tax exempt status and the IRS will look at things like public benefit vs private benefit, diversity of control etc… A vanity hospital that is controlled by 1 person who tends to put his his name on everything, and that benefits the person running it more than the public could lose their tax exempt status. reply briffle 14 hours agoparentprevMy local hospital just had a bit of a freak out a year or two ago, and laid people off, and cut back on services because they had a $13m salary shortfall. They are the busiest ER on the west coast. in 2019-20 (right before covid), they pad $140M cash for a new tower building, and they still have a $1B 'rainy day fund'. reply TheOtherHobbes 14 hours agoparentprevThe problem is more obvious in reverse: profit is money extracted from community wealth. It may be reinvested to create more community wealth. But until that happens it's effectively removed from the collective resource pool and monopolised by private owners for private ends. This is not great when it's abstract numbers, but it inevitably seems to concretise as privileged individual control over property, land, exclusive status symbols such as yachts and private jets, control of media outlets, and ownership of corporations - all of which are potent destroyers of community health and community wealth. The tail is wagging the dog. Community wealth is treated as the left-overs after privileged individuals have taken their share. It should be the other way around. reply johngladtj 14 hours agorootparent>The problem is more obvious in reverse: profit is money extracted from community wealth.

The piece argues that hospitals should not be allowed to take nonprofit status. The article isn’t saying that hospitals are unique tax-free businesses (as many of the comments are suggesting at the time of writing this comment).

Patients who are stable, we generally transport to the hospital \"routine\" (no lights/sirens). Similar for inter-facility transport (taking someone from a nursing facility to chemo or imaging).

But even patients presenting stable can deteriote en route. As an aside, generally, in most areas, what makes the biggest difference to getting a patient to definitive care in a timely manner is not lights/sirens, nor speed, it's \"Opticom\" (also known as traffic light pre-empting). Visual (strobe), or occasionally radio that communicates with traffic lights to give us a steady flow of green lights. That coupled with people moving over is the big difference. Speed is just an increased liability (fun fact, most state laws grant emergency vehicle drivers the ability to 'disregard' any road law while operating in any emergency mode, but that comes with a \"presumptively at-fault\" for any incident that occurs in that mode, i.e. you will be considered at fault unless there's evidence to the contrary). reply happytiger 16 hours agoparentprevGod forbid we don’t monetize the existence and care of life itself. reply jraph 15 hours agorootparentWe should not.

This way, you mostly solve the problem by making people with unhealthy choices fund the heath system they therefore need.

Then they can get healthcare. And we can see that because you're complaining about, for example, parkour stunts, but not the much more common sports that cause significant injuries. I get that it's a common desire to say \"this person does not deserve to live because I don't like their choices\", but like so many other things it turns out that the cost of trying to do this is always more significant than just not assigning value to people's lives, and those policies have a tendency to capture people you don't think it should apply to. Take the various conservative anti-women laws that suddenly became a problem when they interfered with IVF for middle aged white women, despite that being a completely consistent application of the claimed rationale for the law (if an embryo is a live human, then IVF requires murder, but everyone knows an embryo is not a person, the goal of these laws, much like your desire to restrict access to healthcare, is about punishing people for perceived slights). I might have thought you could also see how the costs associated with many illnesses might contribute to the proportionally higher tax rates on things like alcohol and tobacco in countries with public health services. But there's more to it than that, you're arguing against a Public Health Service as though your claimed concern about unreasonable costs from bad life choices does not apply to private healthcare+insurance, but that's simply not true. Your insurance premiums are priced to cover the YouTube stunters, the alcoholics, the people playing sports, the people driving, etc just like a Public Health Service. The only difference is that your insurance companies and hospitals are making a profit as well so definitionally cost more as applied to the total economy (a statistic that has been repeatedly shown is that the US spends more on healthcare than countries with PHS, but has lower coverage and worse outcomes). Because the metric for success in a public health service is treatment, the system is optimized to treat the most people. For private health care the metric is income, which means hospitals charge more, and optimize their billing to maximize the amount that can extract from insurance companies (that's why your anesthesia for a surgery is inexplicably billed as a separate procedure), and insurance companies optimize to deny or delay coverage as much as possible. reply echelon 11 hours agorootparent> Sounds like you want to apply value calculation to people To behavior. If you buy a sports car, you pay higher car insurance. If you buy a motorcycle, you should pay higher health insurance.

It's essential to extending a home loan, but not when granting a college loan. Decoupling risk leads to bad outcomes. > but not the much more common sports that cause significant injuries.

A collective where if there’s a lot of illness in a part of it, it makes us all sick. Second off we literally do not need more taxes to have proper healthcare in this country. We do not have a money problem, but a politics and policy problem. We have a problem that a lot of people think that by helping others, they’re the ones getting punished. A healthy society means a society that has more energy and time to work on problems that benefit us all. May I suggest this, instead of seeing healthcare coverage for more people as a punishment for you, see it as a collective investment to allow people to focus on things that matter. And, note that healthcare isn’t the point of service by a doctor. It means healthy city design. Healthy subsidies for food (instead of subsidies HFCS for example). It means better public transit.

You can always find articles with people complaining about service in countries with actual PHS, but in my experience the same thing applies to US hospitals, with the added fun that your insurance may simply not cover anything so there's no waitlist by virtue of no treatment options, and then even if it does cover it you can still have a huge copay. reply wesselbindt 16 hours agorootparentprevVery poor unsubstantiated viewpoint.

As for abortions in particular, if you are of the opinion that procedure would be murder, it would certainly be out of place for the government to force you to do it.

The arguments that defend an idea don't really matter in the long run, if we can later see that the outcomes they provide aren't good. I look at one of our local private universities: A non profit with a huge endowment. Their prices keep going up, and then discount enough to make sure the student's price is as heavy as they could possibly bear. They put that money into real estate investment, but they don't actually do anything with the land: It's just always worth more to them than it is to other parties, because they don't pay property taxes. So for them the cost of speculation is the lowest there is. Land speculation is far worse than redevelopment into useful things, but instead, we are rewarding it. So I look at the actual outcomes of the non-profit status, and I don't see how in the world they are good for the area around the university: We are lowering our tax base for the privilege of letting them keep blight around them, which then in return lowers prices, letting them buy even more land at a discount. So I look at the incentive, and I see that it's doing far more damage than what it makes. So it doesn't matter that it sounds good on paper: We shouldn't argue with the reality that is in front of our eyes. We should tax them regardless. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparent> Their prices keep going up, and then discount enough to make sure the student's price is as heavy as they could possibly bear. Isn't this consistent with their mission? If a student comes from millionaires, they can pay the full rate. Others get a discount according to need. > They put that money into real estate investment, but they don't actually do anything with the land This is caused by the opposite of what you're objecting to: What they should be doing is renting out the property and using the revenue to further their mission. But as soon as they do that the state would start collecting both property tax and income tax on the rent, even if 100% of the rental income is going to the non-profit's mission. Between that and the costs of maintaining a rental property, you've made productive use into a net loss and created the perverse incentive to do nothing with the property instead. In theory the \"problem\" with this is that a non-profit could operate a profit-making business as a funding source, but why is that a problem?

High deductible plans can be a great option for many consumers, especially those who are willing to take on more risk and actively shop around for non-emergency care. reply hibikir 15 hours agorootparentThe trick of the current plans, which wasn't the same back in the day, is that hospital and ER costs after the fact are nor covered 100% after deductible: Most plans say 90%. So yes, we might be better off with the plan that covers less, but ultimately the problem is that we are risking far more than the deductible, as a truly catastrophic problem will go way, way past the deductible... and out of pocket maximums can be far higher than deductibles. Most of us now have very few employer-based options, which happen to be almost always better because the employer subsidizes some. So it's not unlikely to see that the options you'd prefer are not available. High deductible, but OOP maximum very close to the deductible? Sorry, not available, go look at the secondary market for more insurance.

Hospitals and payers negotiate rates and contract at that rate before the service is provided. Assuming the service is not denied by the payer, the hospital knows that they'll only be reimbursed 18k from your insurance company (or at least has the data to know in advance, putting aside whether any one person could tell you what it will be). The 90k only served as a starting point for negotiation with payers and is usually obscenely high due to other regulatory and contractual reasons related to the negotiation process. Their \"list rate\" is shown on your bill, but was absolutely never expected to be received. As a result, it's not a \"loss\" of revenue at the time of service, and isn't recognized as one. Now, because GAAP requires revenue be recognized when realized and earned, that service became \"revenue\" to the hospital after service, even though they haven't been paid. They might later \"write that off\" (I.e. recognize a loss) if the payer ultimately denies that claim, or you refuse your responsibility (I.e. your copay). But in that case, the hospital did not, in fact, make the money. reply jdsully 16 hours agorootparent> usually obscenely high due to other regulatory and contractual reasons related to the negotiation process Lets be real its due to greed nothing else. reply colinmorelli 15 hours agorootparentThere are plenty of industries in which purely being greedy is much easier than it is in healthcare. Greed alone does not explain the depth of complexity involved in the US healthcare pricing system. To be clear, I’m not defending the system either. It’s fundamentally broken by design. But it’s certainly not solely the greed of hospitals that got us here. reply jdsully 13 hours agorootparentHealthcare has a cartel restricting supply of new doctors, and new hospitals. Only a small number of new doctors can intern each year ensuring the relative supply decreases vs population. The same for hospitals - even if you have the money and the doctors you can't open one unless the other hospitals in the area agree one is needed and allow you to get a “Certificate of Need”. But that wasn't enough to juice profits so pricing had to be made as opaque as possible to screw over anyone who isn't a giant insurance company ensuring the little guy without insurance who \"pays his bills\" pays more than 10x anyone else in the system.

    "originBody": "My Cat Alerted Me to a DDoS Attack April 14, 2024 · 509 words · ~3 minutes to read A few years ago, my cat gave me my most memorable middle of the night software engineering incident. I was working at a startup, and we didn’t have a formal on-call rotation yet. That was a deliberate decision, since being on-call is painful, and the team was good about just collectively keeping an eye out for urgent alerts. We eventually set up an on-call rotation, but before that happened, I had a fun night. Around 3 a.m., I woke up because my cat was grooming my hair. The grooming itself wasn’t unusual. She did it occasionally, and I optimistically took it as a sign that she actually liked me and didn’t just tolerate me. Here’s the cat tax: But in 9 years, that was the only time she did it while I was sleeping. I checked my phone to see what time it was, and I noticed that an AWS CloudWatch alert had gone off a couple minutes ago because of unhealthy targets for our load balancer. I tried to go to our website, but it didn’t load. I groaned and went to log onto my work laptop. Our monitoring dashboard showed a massive number of requests coming from many IP addresses that were associated with different countries. And international traffic wasn’t typical for us anyway since our products were only available to people in the United States. It was a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. My first and not great thought was to block IP addresses at the server level, which would have been tedious and possibly ineffective if the attacker had significantly more source IP addresses to use. But then I remembered that we had already set up AWS Web Application Firewall. To deal with the immediate outage, I set up a rule to block requests from other countries. It took effect and blocked hundreds of thousands of requests over the next hour or so. Our website started working again, and the flood of requests stopped. Later that morning, we noticed that we had received an email to our customer support inbox around when the attack started. With horrible grammar, the sender claimed to have found a vulnerability with our website that crashed Apache, which we didn’t even use. They said they stopped all traffic to our website and could keep it that way for months. They generously offered to give us a “solution file” if we sent them $5,000 in Bitcoin. We didn’t reply, though in retrospect, it could have been fun to try to troll them. I still find it hard to believe the perfect timing of my cat waking me up. You might guess that the AWS alert caused my phone to vibrate or make a sound, waking my cat up first. But I keep my phone in do not disturb mode during the night. So I just like to think that somehow, she sensed something was wrong that couldn’t wait until the morning. It was certainly a more pleasant way to be woken up than by a blaring PagerDuty alarm.",

Other carriers peering on London Internet Exchange had to blackhole traffic to our service provider and finally kept blackholing one of our IPs for a while. I had to scramble to find a DDoS mitigation service, new DC and servers. We did not respond to any of the emails. The attackers were also quite dumb, they attacked the web servers which were located in a well connected place. The money making service of the business was in the Caribbean with a 1,5Mbps T1 and a 0,5Mbps satellite backup.

One character suggests the crow was trying to warn the man. Another posits the bird was bringing the sleeper to the tiger's attention so it could enjoy the scraps after the meal. reply derefr 8 hours agorootparentOdd that the most obvious hypothesis wasn't given: the crow was probably using its alarm call to warn other crows. Crows are social animals, who care about the fates of their \"friends and acquaintances\" — so they would do that. But also, on a tangent, there is a bird that does this kind of non-conspecific alarm calling the time as part of its food-gathering strategy: the African fork-tailed drongo. The drongo gives true alarm calls to food-rival species nearby, to tell them when it has spotted a mutual predator. This leads to these food-rival species coming to rely on these signals. But then, every once in a while, it gives a false alarm, to get the food-rivals to run away for a bit, so it can nab the bugs/berries/etc that the rival would have been eating. reply hiddencost 4 hours agorootparentIt's called an allegory reply card_zero 4 hours agorootparentNo, a drongo. reply thaumasiotes 4 hours agorootparentprevThere's also an African bird whose foraging strategy includes alerting large mammals to the presence of food that they can harvest and the bird can scavenge.

The topic made me read that as CatGPT, and now I can't pull it out of my head. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 8 hours agoparentprevIt's not as simple as \"loading a script\" - IP addresses (or in the case of IPv6, subnets) are (for the average person) a limited resource, as is bandwidth, and most amplification attacks require IP spoofing which is not possible from most connections. If it's a volumetric attack, the side with more bandwidth wins (the attacker may be able to amplify here). If it's a load-based/application-level attack, blocking the attacker IPs at the firewall level solves it. This was application level, not (purely) volumetric, since they already had a WAF/Cloudfront. Identifying attacker IPs to block is a matter of correctly attributing cost to a source IP, correctly attributing benefit (i.e. legit user activity) to a source IP, then blocking the IPs or ranges where the cost significantly exceeds the benefit you see from that IP or range. That's easier said than done, since cost can come in many forms (e.g. open connections clogging up memory, TLS handshakes, requests that are expensive to parse for your web server, requests that trigger expensive database queries, in/out bandwidth, ...) which is why most just slap Cloudflare (or here, Cloudfront) in front of it and work around with manual rules like in this example. reply toast0 7 hours agoparentprevThere's application level DDoS, which you generally stop by not doing expensive work for clients that haven't done expensive work for you. Sometimes, easier said than done. And then there's volumetric DDoS. You can stop this by having more bandwidth than everyone else... but that's pretty hard and it makes you a potential attacker. Innovation here is in the form of using BGP to disseminate traffic filters. Null routing is the MVP here: this IP is being attacked, so drop traffic to it as soon as possible. But I've seen there's some systems with more precision, like drop udp, drop fragments, drop packets to/from udp/tcp port X. Most of these systems are designed so that these specialized routes don't propagate beyond immediate peers, but potentially, it might be desirable if they did. reply kijin 6 hours agorootparent> Null routing is the MVP here: this IP is being attacked, so drop traffic to it as soon as possible. Oh, this poor guy is being DDoS'd, so we're going to make sure that their service remains denied. Null-routing the target IP helps everybody except the customer who is being attacked: namely, the network operator and their other customers. From the victim's point of view, it's just as frustrating as the attack itself, and gets in the way of troubleshooting. With modern tooling and a bit of ML, it shouldn't be too hard for multiple ISPs to collectively determine which IPs are currently part of a large botnet. Drop packets from them, not to the victim. DoS the ones who are causing the DDoS. reply xorcist 2 hours agorootparentSo the suggestion here is to implement source routing on a whim, with a table of 100+k entries? At your peering point? An ISP has to do what it has to do to save their business when a large attack hurts their business. This may be what the attacker wants but that's not an excuse to do nothing. But what machine learning has to do with this is not clear. Null routing protects you against traffic volume. Machine learning sounds like it maybe can help diagnose more sophisticated low-volume attacks. Maybe. You don't want anything remotely compute intensive when mitigating attacks. reply toast0 5 hours agorootparentprev> Null-routing the target IP helps everybody except the customer who is being attacked: namely, the network operator and their other customers. From the victim's point of view, it's just as frustrating as the attack itself, and gets in the way of troubleshooting. If you're running on a single IP, yes. If you're running on multiple IPs, it's not that bad for the one that's being attacked to get its traffic dropped and everything else works. It's not great, but what are you going to do. If you've got enough traffic to overwhelm the inbound on the top of rack switch your box is on, you're not going to be able to really serve any of the good traffic anyway. > With modern tooling and a bit of ML, it shouldn't be too hard for multiple ISPs to collectively determine which IPs are currently part of a large botnet. Drop packets from them, not to the victim. DoS the ones who are causing the DDoS. There's usually way too many source addresses to do that, and anyway, routing infrastructure is geared towards looking at destination addresses, not source addresses. Also, each individual source doesn't look that bad --- if I've got 10,000 sources each sending me 1 Mbps of garbage, nobody is going to accept a block for only 1 mbps of sending, and yet, there's 10 Gbps of garbage arriving at my box; if I've got 10 Gbps or better connectivity, no big deal. But, if I'm only on 1 Gbps, I'm getting less than 1 in 10 of my inbound packets. I'd argue, if everything else has a big enough connection, it's probably still no big deal, it should be able to drop packets headed to me, as long as its upstream connection isn't filling up. But once abuse is causing contention that impacts others on my rack, it's probably time to null route. If it's one of the big botnets with 100,000+ compromised systems, the individual bandwidth is even less. And if the botnet has significant ability to deliver spoofed traffic, source based filtering is meaningless. If it's reflected DDoS, I dunno --- there's value in hunting down the chargen services and removing them from the internet, but that's usually a lot more work. OTOH, look on the bright side, if your outbound bandwidth is high and you get a lot of inbound DDoS, you may have roughly balanced your usage, and you may qualify for settlement free peering!

I've unfortunately had my share of dead friends and relatives. I wish I could say that it somehow has made me stronger, more mature, but I'm afraid that the opposite is more true. Each is a trauma that I never entirely recover from. They make the world more bleak, confusing, cold, scary.

Honestly speaking from someone who has 2 beautiful little girls and very squarely middle class life with all its ups and downs. I've recently, but slowly mentally shifted towards being a nihilist. There are so many things to live for, I agree, but at the same time there's like a 10:1 ratio of why living sucks. My privilege, I feel, brings that closer to 1:1 but I'm pretty far from the median/bulk of the world's population. Most of the world struggles - constantly. If life isn't enjoyable (very hedonist) why do we bother producing offspring who will be forced to endure \"life\"? Why does it matter that the human race survives? I'm not the first to ask this, definitely not. I'm just sort of here and am unsure where to go next. reply felipefar 9 hours agorootparentHuman beings are unique in the world because they are the only species that can understand it.

It seems like it eluded Nietzsche who I'm sure was a greater thinker than I, and so I don't hold out much hope. The question of children is one that I've long wondered about in this context as well; my take is that there's a lot of peer pressure that goes into perpetuating society (one of my grandmothers actually told me it was the basic reason she had children). This is another area where religion is quite important; we see fertility falling as religion recedes the world over. I could never really consider consigning more people into the existential dread that I've lived with for the majority of my time, and so the thought of having children never passed my mind. reply anal_reactor 2 hours agorootparentprev> If life isn't enjoyable It can. Whether you're happy or not boils down to hormones in your blood. Your goal is to maximize the amount of happy hormones and to minimize the negative hormones. Lots of things are biological reactions you can't do much about like \"hungry = angry\" but modern industrial life already covers most of that, so we're left with psychological reactions \"Monday = sad\" which can be trained and rewired, but you need to put all the work and basically fight your natural reactions until they change. I decided to care less and be happier, and it's a long journey, but I see huge changes. I used to be constantly depressed, now I have moments of happiness. reply clooless 9 hours agorootparentprevAsk yourself if you'd be willing to painlessly end your life, if given the option. Most people prefer to keep on living, which is strong evidence that on balance, despite all the bumps and grief of living, life is still pretty awesome. reply irjustin 6 hours agorootparentI'm not advocating suicide or anything of that form. I'm asking, why should the majority of the world have kids given that life is largely a struggle and in so many places of poverty an extremely difficult one? reply pintxo 4 hours agorootparentBecause in a poverty situation, where there is zero state support, the only ones who might eventually help you are your kids?

One would expect evolution to select for chemistry that make an organism want to continue living on.

Regardless of suffering levels. reply nsm 8 hours agorootparentprevEvery generation brings us closer to a day where we can actually eliminate suffering? reply baq 13 hours agoparentprevAfter getting philosophical one evening I came to the conclusion that 'bleak, scary and just plainly shit' is the default state of any particular person's mood and this is how the whole humanity evolved. Happiness and bliss are what you're chasing after, not what you're supposed to be - if you're permanently happy, you've diverged from the mean and either are an exception or overdue for a mean reversal. That is in itself a rather bleak and scary outlook but I least I feel honest with myself. The human species won by being full of sad people, some of who fought the environment to be slightly happier for a while. reply schrectacular 10 hours agorootparentI have a feeling you might enjoy this conversation: https://www.econtalk.org/a-users-guide-to-our-emotional-ther... You are not alone in that path of thought. I think that yes, happiness is fleeting, but I tend to think something like satisfaction or contentedness is within reach for many people. Because people aren't going around being actively sad I don't think either. It seems like most folks (and research backs it up) are \"getting by\" so to speak. Not elated but also not constantly mopey or whatever. Anyway I think it's a deep and interesting introspective path you've taken. reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentAnother thought - feelings/emotions are always relative; and will show up on a distribution naturally.

In their mind, they’re not taking advantage of you. They’re helping you, but would you mind if they move their things to your dead relative’s house? Be very cautious of everyone, greed corrupts and taints even noble men, and supposedly ironclad relationships. reply MichaelZuo 9 hours agorootparentBy definition the vast majority of relatives of the vast majority of people are just average in virtue, or not too far off.

It’s pretty much just a joke about the existential dread that I (and presumably the GP) have built up over a lifetime. I presume it’s why we craft happy stories for children who we’ve deemed too young to learn about harsh realities. Alternatively, people find a lot of comfort in religion, but it’s not something that’s ever worked for me. So I like to joke about it. reply drekipus 6 hours agorootparentThe stories are designed to teach children about harsh realities, not too gloss over them. Religion too, is just a collection of those stories into a larger moral framework. Try reading more reply em-bee 11 hours agorootparentprevincapable of believing is different from refusing or being unwilling to believe. even some of those who do believe in god sometimes have doubts, and here is someone who (i imagine) thinks that it would be nice if there was a god, but they just can't see how it could possibly be true, given many things they see in contradiction. so no, wanting something to be true, but not being able to believe it to be true are not at odds at all. in this context you may also consider pascal's wager. the key is to keep searching for the truth, and to investigate the claims that various religions make until you find one that does work for you. reply JKCalhoun 11 hours agorootparentprevI thought it made sense. Religion is the salve that I wish would work for me. reply dgfitz 11 hours agorootparentprevDid you feel a visceral reaction when you saw the word religion? Maybe you should do some introspection. reply sfjailbird 9 hours agoparentprevI have had several very close family members die, and had to clean out their stuff. That is always the weirdest part. Looking through things that they had hung on to, which have absolutely no meaning to anyone else, and are just thrown in the trash. Or the things that show that they were obviously not expecting to die, like the groceries, or some book they were writing. It has changed my perspective, and not in a bad way. It has inspired me to live more in, and appreciate, the here and now.

Everyone dies. reply HankB99 12 hours agoprevFB has been a little creepy about death. A FB \"friend\" (e.g. not a close friend) had died and about a year later FB started exhorting me to reconnect with him. I located his obituary and memorialized his account out of respect. Too many times I've been invited to wish a deceased friend \"happy birthday.\" I go to their page and find it memorialized. Nevertheless, there are many friends wishing them happy birthday, oblivious to the indication that the page has been memorialized. The worse was the time my wife discovered her brother had died via FB. He had estranged himself from the family decades earlier, but still... A shared friend posted the status to his page, otherwise we might never have found out. reply dylan604 11 hours agoparent> oblivious to the indication that the page has been memorialized. to come at this from a different direction, how is any different from the online version of visiting someone's grave? it could just be their way of remembering someone and letting others know they were thinking about them. granted, i'd assume most people are being obedient to the Zuck by click the button, or a bot doing it, or many other fake/insincere means because I too distrust anything from the socials. reply marssaxman 9 hours agorootparentWhen I am inviting people to an event on Facebook, and the list of suggestions includes someone who is dead, sometimes I'll invite them anyway. (This is fresh in my mind because we had a big house party last night, and three of the people I invited were dead. None made an appearance, to my knowledge.) It feels about the same as inviting someone (alive) who couldn't possibly come, who would feel good to know they were being remembered - it's a little way to say \"wish you were here\". reply HankB99 8 hours agorootparentprev> how is any different from the online version of visiting someone's grave? If they visited a grave and said \"let's do lunch\" it would be no different. It's often clear from the comments they leave whether they are honoring a friend who has passed or reaching out to someone they think is still alive. reply squigz 10 hours agorootparentprevThis sort of inherent distrust of humanity is probably one of the worst effects of social media. reply noah_buddy 10 hours agorootparentTo be fair, inherent distrust of humanity has probably existed since the beginning. reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentIt does have significant survival benefits in many situations. reply Aeolun 10 hours agorootparentprevBut not unreasonable when considering how most people act when on it? reply squigz 5 hours agorootparentMost people you know, perhaps. reply forgotusername6 13 hours agoprevThere's a really confusing gap between grief, or what I thought grief should look like, when losing someone close and the indifference or mere sympathy that comes with hearing about the loss of someone you don't know. A number of years ago I found out that someone I knew from university had died. He was young, and the whole thing was just so genuinely confusing that I didn't know how to feel about it. I'm in a similar position right now, learning about an old friend's terminal illness via their gofundme page. Do I reach out? Should I even be sad? All I seem to feel in this kind of situation is a derailing bewilderment. reply lwhi 11 hours agoparentSomeone I met moving into a new co-working space died last week at work. He was working the night shift at the front desk. We'd exchanged hellos and goodbyes a few times, and got to the stage where we recognised each other and would refine our greeting slightly at each repetition. I figured we'd ended up chatting more and would get to know each other. But then he had a heart attack. I feel grief, in the sense that I no longer inhabit the universe where we got to know each other. There's a loss involved. But I didn't actually know him. I'm also more aware of the grief I'll feel in the future and I'm reminded how death can literally come at any moment. It does feel like a strange liminal state, though. reply klodolph 12 hours agoparentprevYou’re not alone. I think it’s really common to question yourself and ask, “Is this how I should be feeling? How I’m supposed to be feeling? How I’m supposed to be acting?” reply jraph 12 hours agorootparentwrt feeling, fully agree, I think it happens to most of us, if not all. But I believe you don't really have a say in the matter. I'm not sure you should be supposed to feel one way or another. You can only accept your feelings as is and others should accept how you feel too. I think especially when someone close die, it is well known each of us has their own personal / specific way of reacting. (of course you can prepare yourself to face expected situations to some extent; also of course, if you don't feel well you should seek help, especially if it lasts) reply dgfitz 11 hours agoparentprevI’ve come to the conclusion that what you feel is what you feel. There is no right or wrong. reply genewitch 11 hours agorootparentokay, fine. what about introspection? What about what is considered mentally healthy or not? what about how it affects others around you? If you have past experiences or trauma or other orangic or inorganic neurological or mental issues having a \"flat affect\" can be \"wrong\". If what you're feeling isn't helping you, how would you know that there's another way unless you get help? This sounds defeatist and if you peek just a little behind the curtain this can lead to all kinds of \"bad\". IMO. Just imagine the worst thing you can that someone could think, and then they say \"it's okay, it's just how i feel, it's not right or wrong.\" I get that we shouldn't gatekeep or police thought, but obviously this isn't some \"universal truth\"... reply rickmode 11 hours agorootparentI’d say it’s like the mental health distinction of a trait versus a disorder: if this is negatively impacting your day to day life, consider therapy / counseling. (As an aside, I think of counseling as “optimizing my life”. Perhaps that framing may help those that find the idea off-putting.) reply dgfitz 8 hours agorootparentprevA feeling is only a feeling. How you react to that feeling is the important part. Until then, you and only you own those feelings. reply Aeolun 10 hours agorootparentprevJust because you don’t feel particularly sad that someone died doesn’t mean you have to be an asshole about it? reply Aeolun 10 hours agoprevTraffic in the US is so absurdly deadly. You have one of these posts and people come out of the woodworks everywhere saying they also have a friend that died in a traffic accident. I have zero. I cannot even think of a far off acquaintance ever killed in traffic. Why is traffic such a deadly thing in the US compared to the rest of the world? reply bobthepanda 10 hours agoparent* everything is far apart, intentionally. US cities used to be denser before the car, but in the postwar era not only were there significant amounts of new areas of car-oriented low density, but a lot of the existing dense areas were destroyed, and now in most of the country building traditional density is illegal. * because everything is far apart and designed for car usage, public transit, walking and cycling are inversely very bad. this simultaneously makes doing any of that dangerous; and it also puts a lot of people on the roads who probably shouldn't be (drunk drivers, distracted drivers, people with failing vision, etc.) * in some of the worst affected areas, the transport department has applied road standards meant for interstate highways to local roads with traffic lights and no center barriers, and so these roads in particular are quite dangerous and full of rampant speeding * Americans have tended towards larger cars, and unlike Europe there is no testing in the US for how safe automobiles are for pedestrian impact, so the cars themselves are actually more deadly to pedestrians reply tlunter 10 hours agoparentprevI am an American and also don’t have anyone I know, nor far off acquaintance killed, therefore I conclude the US is actually fine with it comes to traffic. Why are you using an anecdote to define your data here? reply bufordtwain 9 hours agorootparentYou've been lucky. My sister in law and my wife's best friend were both killed in car accidents (not as pedestrians) in the US. reply tzs 8 hours agoparentprevMost people use traffic deaths per 100k inhabitants when comparing, but that exaggerates the risks of US traffic because people in the US drive more. For example the US has around 12.9 traffic related deaths per year per 100k inhabitants, and France has around 5. That's a ratio of 2.58:1. But people in the US drive an average of around 23000 km/year. French people average around 13000 km/year. That's a ratio of 1.77:1. That means that per kilometer driving in the US has about 1.46x the chance of resulting in a traffic related death as driving in France, which is much lower than the 2.58x that most people here would use when comparing. In terms of absolute risk, which is probably what most people consider when deciding if their car is safe enough, the US has around 1 car related fatality per 130 million vehicle kilometers. For France it is around 1 car related fatality per 190 million vehicle kilometers. Both of those are low enough that most people probably consider them negligible. reply tylerflick 10 hours agoparentprevBecause we like to blame scary things like guns, rather than confronting the fact that giant SUVs and distracted driving habits are far more dangerous. reply stefan_ 10 hours agorootparentEven better, people die at elevated rates from both of these! It is not either or. reply lazide 8 hours agorootparentWell, approx. 45k people a year die from traffic crashes in the US a year. [https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D362F918] And 48k from firearms (including suicides and accidents) [https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/saved/D158/D362F919] COVID-19 is also estimated to have killed 48k in 2023.

It affects you but it can also feel like you don’t have a right to grieve compared to those who knew them closely. Some years ago a neighbor of mine was hit by a light rail train after darting across the street, biking during his lunch break at work. I’d talked to him for a couple minutes almost every day for two years in the parking lot while he worked on his car or arrived home from work. Just like that he was gone. I have a vivid memory of a neighbor sharing the news. We went to his funeral. His parents and young wife were devastated of course. It was so unexpected.

A long time ago I was working and living in SF. I had just finished work and was heading over to a nearby bar. I was waiting at a very busy intersection for the cross walk to signal to go. I had recently moved to SF and all my new friends warned me about cars, so I was being cautious. There was a guy standing in front of me with big headphones on looking at his phone. He just stepped into the street. Out of the corner of me eye I saw a car taking a turn coming right at him too fast. I reached out, grabbed him by his backpack and pulled him back on the sidewalk. His eyes were firmly fixed on me as the car zoomed by where he would have been, him totally oblivious. He gave the the WTF is your problem face then safely crossed the street. I think about that guy sometimes and wonder what his version of the story is. Further I sometimes question if he was ever in danger and I was just being overly cautious. reply kirubakaran 12 hours agorootparentDespite what he thinks, I'm glad you did what you did. Thanks! It reminded me of the movie Due Date: Peter Highman: How have you made it this far? How have you not run yourself over in a car? Ethan Tremblay: I've done that. Peter Highman: How have you survived? That's my question. Ethan Tremblay: Mostly luck. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1231583/quotes/ reply temp_praneshp 11 hours agorootparentprevIf it's any solace, I've had something very similar happen. An idiot was jogging near 4th and King, and a car jumped the light after the left turn was red and the walk lights came on. I had trained myself to wait and look, but he went on till I blocked him. He was annoyed at first (reasonable), saw the car go by, but never said sorry or thank you. I never put on headphones till I was inside the train, as a rule of thumb. reply saulrh 11 hours agoparentprevSF traffic fatalities have not been increasing year-over-year. You can't cast blame for an outcome that doesn't exist. Data: https://www.chp.ca.gov/programs-services/services-informatio.... SWITRS hasn't published a report since 2020 due to the pandemic, but that works perfectly fine for my purposes because I'd have probably had to discard those years for other reasons, and since we're talking about a ten- or fifteen-year trend I'm perfectly okay coming to a conclusion based on data from 2011 to 2020. Traffic fatalities per city are in section 8 chart E. Fatalities have also not been increasing per mile traveled. Data: https://vitalsigns.mtc.ca.gov/indicators/daily-miles-travele... I choose traffic fatalities as the metric because federal and state reporting laws mean that these numbers will be effectively complete - there is no sampling or selection effect, unlike numbers about traffic enforcement. reply KennyBlanken 10 hours agorootparentThe link you included is not to deaths per mile traveled, it's to miles traveled. Even if deaths are relatively flat, they should be going down as older, less safe cars age out of the fleet of vehicles on the road. As time goes on, a greater percentage of vehicles have better crash safety, ABS, traction control, better airbag systems, and 'driver assistance' aids. Make sure any stats you do cite include pedestrian and cyclist injuries, but note that exposure data for them is exceptionally poor, because they are typically not included in traffic survey data collected by contractors hired by the government to do traffic counts. Overall pedestrian and cyclist deaths have shot up, by the way, and are the highest ever. https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deat... reply jeffbee 9 hours agorootparentprev\"Preliminary\" SWITRS data through end of 2023 is queryable on TIMS. reply fwip 13 hours agoparentprevHang on now, you've begged the question. Your data shows that traffic citations are down. It doesn't show anything about whether that's due to lax enforcement or less occurrences. In fact, if you look at a lot of those graphs, they hit a low point in 2020 - right when covid WFH would have drastically reduced a lot of traffic, and in turn, traffic crimes. reply runeb 13 hours agorootparentWhile you’re correct that you would see the same graphs if drivers had become exemplary, observing traffic in SF anecdotally point towards the opposite. It’s frankly shocking. reply paulsutter 13 hours agorootparentprevGood point, now I realize that drivers all became 20x more conscientious. Gosh I should have thought of that /s reply fwip 13 hours agorootparentI could search my heart to try to interpret your sarcastic comments in good-faith. Like, maybe you mean, \"Surely, there should be a roughly linear relationship between the number of cars on the road and the number of unlawful traffic activities, and the decrease in driving in San Francisco was only X%, not 95%.\" To which I could say something like, \"Hmm, yeah, that's a good point. Maybe less people run red lights if they aren't feeling frustrated from traffic already - or maybe the opposite, maybe more people run them if there isn't any perceived cross traffic. Would it be okay, or even good, to loosen traffic enforcement if the actual risk of the illegal activity has decreased?\" But honestly? You sound like you've got some really strong guiding narratives that you're not willing to talk about like an adult. So I'm not gonna play. reply kirubakaran 12 hours agorootparentConsidering the chart starts in 2014, I can understand the parent commenter having difficulty taking your Covid-19 argument in good faith. What data would you need to see to change your mind? PS: I went looking for data, and the number of traffic fatalities per year haven't gone up significantly since 2014. So I stand corrected. It's a big relief, as an SF resident; parent commenter's chart was really worrying.

    "originBody": "Medical Sleep apnea: Mouthguards less invasive, just as effective as CPAP By Paul McClure April 12, 2024 Facebook Twitter Flipboard LinkedIn Sleep apnea: Mouthguards less invasive, just as effective as CPAP The SomnoDent Flex®, the mandibular advancement device (MAD) used in the study SomnoMed AU View 3 Images 1/3 The SomnoDent Flex®, the mandibular advancement device (MAD) used in the study SomnoMed AU 2/3 A nasal CPAP device Depositphotos 3/3 An oral device like this SomnoDent Flex® is just as effective as CPAP in reduced sleep apnea-related high blood pressure SomnoMed AU View gallery - 3 images Obstructive sleep apnea can cause or contribute to high blood pressure, so a new study examined which sleep apnea treatments – a CPAP machine or a mouthguard that keeps the airways open – was more effective at lowering blood pressure. Medications are the first-line treatment for high blood pressure, otherwise known as hypertension. However, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can cause and/or exacerbate hypertension, is being recognized as an underdiagnosed and modifiable risk factor. The most common sleep-rated breathing disorder, OSA is caused by the collapse of the upper airway during sleep, which leads to frequent sleep interruptions, up to 30 times an hour, all night long. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) delivered via a face or nasal mask is often used to treat OSA. An alternative treatment is a mandibular advancement device or MAD. Similar to a bite guard, a MAD holds the lower jaw (mandible) and tongue forward, keeping the airway open. There are pros and cons for both. CPAP, while effective, tends to be uncomfortable, so it’s poorly tolerated. MADs are less intrusive, but studies have shown they’re outperformed by CPAP when it comes to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number of times airflow fully (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) stops per hour during sleep. A nasal CPAP device Depositphotos Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the University of Sydney conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of MAD and CPAP in reducing hypertension in patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. “Looking at the totality of evidence available in all the literature, it is still reasonable to say that CPAP is the first-line treatment until we have more data on the MAD,” said Ronald Lee Chi-Hang, professor of medicine at NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and corresponding author of the study. “However, for patients who cannot truly tolerate or accept using a CPAP, we should be more open-minded in looking for an alternative therapy such as a MAD, which, based on our study, numerically had a better blood pressure reduction in patients compared with a CPAP.” Being a non-inferiority trial, the study tested whether a new treatment (MAD) is not worse than an established one (CPAP). The researchers recruited 220 participants with moderate-to-severe OSA and randomized them to either CPAP or MAD. Of the participants, 44.5% were overweight, and 49.5% were obese. The most prevalent high cardiovascular risk factors were coronary artery disease (60.9%) and diabetes (59.1%), with 44.1% of participants having had hypertension for more than 10 years. At baseline and six-month follow-up, both groups underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring, completed a questionnaire on sleepiness, and had blood tests for cardiovascular markers. Both devices tracked use. The primary outcome was the difference in 24-hour mean BP between baseline and follow-up. MADs significantly reduced 24-hour mean BP from baseline to six-month follow-up, which was not significant in the CPAP group. The decrease in the MAD group was, on average, 1.64 mmHg larger than the CPAP group. Compared to the CPAP group, the MAD group also showed a larger between-group reduction in all ambulatory BP measures, especially nighttime BP, and more participants achieved a systolic BP (the top number) below 120 mmHg. None of the participants experienced symptomatic low BP or hypotension. From these data, the researchers ascertained that a MAD was non-inferior to CPAP. An oral device like this SomnoDent Flex® is just as effective as CPAP in reduced sleep apnea-related high blood pressure SomnoMed AU The researchers also looked at differences in adherence between the two devices; that is, how long participants stuck with their allocated treatment. Over half (56.5%) assigned to the MAD used it for six or more hours each night on average over the study period, while 23.2% of CPAP users did the same. “The MAD patients simply used the device longer,” Chi-Hang said. “That also might explain why the blood pressure reduction at nighttime, when the patients are actually using it, had a better reduction in the MAD arm.” Adherence to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s (AASM) recommendation of four or more hours of use in at least 70% of nights overall was similar between groups, with 69.4% of the MAD group and 64.3% of the CPAP group meeting this recommendation. Both groups had reduced daytime sleepiness, and there were no between-group differences in cardiovascular biomarkers. “People should be aware that over 400 million people globally have moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea, and it is underdiagnosed and may be a contributing factor to their high blood pressure,” said Chi-Hang. “Especially for patients whose blood pressure is hard to control or who have a lot of excessive daytime sleepiness, go see a physician about sleep apnea and get treated if necessary.” The study participants were of East Asian descent, and 85.5% were male. Although ethnic Chinese make up about 17.3% of the world’s population, further research on more diverse populations is needed to determine whether the results are generalizable. Further, the researchers note that adherence may have been higher because the study was conducted during COVID-19 travel lockdowns. Further studies are planned to examine the impacts of the devices on cognition. The study, funded by the Singapore Ministry of Health, was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Source: NUS via Scimex View gallery - 3 images",

There was greater reduction in BP in the mouthguard group, and the hypothesis is just that participants simply wore them more when sleeping. But the article also explicitly stated \"MADs are less intrusive, but studies have shown they’re outperformed by CPAP when it comes to the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number of times airflow fully (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) stops per hour during sleep.\" reply thih9 3 hours agoparentAbout “the hypothesis is just that participants simply wore them more when sleeping” - we know that was the case: > Over half (56.5%) assigned to the MAD used it for six or more hours each night on average over the study period, while 23.2% of CPAP users did the same. > “The MAD patients simply used the device longer,” Chi-Hang said. reply jstanley 1 hour agoparentprevDoesn't airflow fully stop twice per breath? reply cnity 1 hour agorootparentOnly on Hacker News would someone picture an oscillating waveform with a derivative of 0 twice per cycle!

As Op stated, initially in the article the author clearly states that CPAP is preferred and most effective in totality. The actual point of the article is that Obstructive Sleep Apnea is under-diagnosed, causes hypertension, and the conventional treatment kinda sucks—and mouth guards should be the offered as an alternative treatment because it is effective at reducing blood pressure. The title isn’t misleading per-se, but you do have to have the article. FWIW I got a $2100 MAD to treat my OSA. reply janalsncm 4 hours agorootparentWhether or not the title on HN matches the article is a separate question from whether the article has a misleading title imo. I don’t see how a treatment could be “just as effective” if it has a lower AHI, unless we are saying there’s some other metric which really matters. But there’s a pretty clear contradiction between the body and title of the article. What to do about articles which are misleading in this way is another question. Removing articles whose title is contradicted by the article is a bit heavy handed I think. It should ideally count against the reputation of the website, but there are too many for me to keep track of. reply Madmallard 3 hours agorootparentprevDoes not have a lower AHI, means the hypertension endpoint is not the full picture.

He talked about trying something that effectively made him dislocate his jaw at night, then pop it back into place in the morning. I thought it sounded like a terrible idea, but he seemed excited for the possibility of traveling without his CPAP, so I didn’t say anything negative, having not done any research on it, while he had. Fast forward several months later, he ended up with TMJ issues and tinnitus. I didn’t find that all too surprising, but when talking to him it was like he didn’t see it coming and the risks of messing with the jaw every night were not made clear. He discontinued use. Last I heard, I think his jaw is feeling better, but the tinnitus remains, to some degree. reply CrumpetDiagonal 52 minutes agoparentThe literature is replete those kinds of issues. The most common side effect of prolonged use is a change in the bite alignment. I used one for over a year before I had surgical intervention to increase the size of my airway via jaw surgery (both jaws advanced). By the end of that year, I couldn’t get my lower jaw back into place during the day and bite no longer aligned. Thanks the braces and surgery corrected my bite and expanded my airway to the point that I no longer need anything to help me breathe at night or during the day reply rob74 49 minutes agoparentprevTMJ = Temporomandibular joint (probably clear for anyone who has issues with it, but not so much to the rest of us) reply d--b 3 hours agoprevThese are quite uncomfortable, actually.

The first one I stopped using after a few nights as the kibble felt like it was cutting the insides of my mouth. The next one, I've used for 2 years. Immediately felt the benefits of having a good sleep at night. Friends that I often travel and bunk with tell me my snoring is much more reduced. I could sleep on my back without choking! I stopped after 2 years because I noticed my front lower teeth no longer align with my upper teeth. I can't use my front teeth to 'saw' off food anymore. I always woke up with a really sore jaw and lots of pain around my teeth. The lower teeth always felt like it was bent forward when I woke up. Lately, I've been considering getting another pair, because I think the one I used was meant to be swapped out every 6 months, which I obviously didn't do. reply go_prodev 3 hours agoparentprevI was fitted for one, and was told that the lower jaw is held forward by using the upper teeth as an anchor. Over time they can cause upper and lower teeth to move. reply sethammons 1 hour agorootparentFor those who want to simulate the feeling, touch your tongue to the front of your top teeth and jut your jaw forward so you can close your jaw with your tongue staying in place, sandwiched between the front of your top teeth and back of your bottom teeth.

Also didn't notice better sleep. reply rob74 44 minutes agorootparentWow, I can (just barely) slide my bottom teeth in front of my top teeth, but not with the tongue in between, and it still feels extremely weird and uncomfortable... reply brnt 1 hour agorootparentprevI have one, and it works well. It's the default treatment here, where CPAP is reserved for the morbidly obese. But the effect of jaw displacement is real. Every morning it takes a few hours to move the lower jaw slowly back.

This was difficult at first. Idk why, but I’ve read the musculature responsible for breathing gets weakened if you breathe through your mouth, because there’s a lot less resistance. But now it’s fine, and I don’t even snore anymore. Obviously this is down to individual physiology, so I’m not saying this works for everyone, but it did work for me.

It was called (translation from French) \"breathing reeducation\", and it was roughly interval training: breathe fully in through your nose, then blow into a pipe (connected to a spirometer) at various speeds. Before that, I was mostly breathing through my mouth. It was challenging even to eat a sandwich while walking :). Since this reeducation, I only breathe through my nose with no effort. I'm willing to believe it indeed has to do with muscle. reply CannisterFlux 1 hour agorootparentA breathing specialist (on a podcast, so take that with a grain of salt) said that breathing through your nose uses less overall muscles than through your mouth. This was focused on athletics training. By nose-breathing, the athletes were getting enough oxygen without heaving their chests so much, which uses more energy. The idea was that when you suck in air through your mouth, it works your chest more than is required, so you are wasting effort doing that. I tried it, nose breathing while working out, and it is incredibly difficult. Another guy on the podcast, the presenter, is an ex-rugby player and said he had to tape his mouth shut to be able to try it, and his nose was pouring with snot while jogging because he was not used to it. I'm not saying it isn't to do with muscles, perhaps a sort of \"muscle memory\" due to years of breathing through your mouth, but my feeling is there's also a large psychological aspect to it. I nose breath when I remember, but it has to be a conscious effort to sort of clamp my mouth shut. Otherwise I'm :-O like that breathing. I feel like I'm going to suffocate if I nose breathe, but that's not the case of course when I actually force myself to do it. reply ein0p 1 hour agorootparentprevStart breathing exclusively through your nose during the day, and you will be able to do it at night too. reply TheCapeGreek 51 minutes agorootparentYeah, no.

The AHI and SI were reduced by nearly half after mouth-taping during sleep; the more severe the baseline AHI and SI, the greater the improvement after mouth-taping.

And then there are specific names for ranges of BMI, which include \"Normal range\" for 18.5 to 24.9, \"Overweight (Pre-obese)\" for 25-29.9, and then three classes of \"Obese\" above 30 as well as three \"Underweight\" types below 18.5. Generally this is simplified down to \"Underweight\", \"Normal\", \"Overweight\", and \"Obese\", with the following words after \"Normal\" and \"Overweight\" being implied, and with the multiple levels of underweight and obesity ignored unless discussing someone light or heavy enough that it's worth considering the differences between \"Obese (Class I)\" and \"Obese (Class III)\", or between \"Underweight (Mild thinness)\" and \"Underweight (Severe thinness)\" - all still based purely on the BMI number. Sorry for the long winded answer, but even more here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index Weirdly it seems like this study used the same logic but set non-standard boundaries (27.5 rather than 30 as the point between Overweight and Obese). reply zten 2 hours agorootparent> a very fit and very strong person can wrongly be classified (and in the opposite direction too) Unfortunately, it usually goes in the bad direction, by quite a bit.

I can’t name all the steps but it’s basically severely underweight, underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, severely obese. As far as the cohort, sleep apnea is often a side effect of obesity, though not always caused by it (see central apneas which is a nervous system disorder). Sleep apnea compounds obesity because it makes it difficult to get restful sleep, which is one of the necessary tools for losing weight. reply imadethis 4 hours agoparentprevYeah that's probably based on the BMI definition. Overweight is a BMI > 25, and obese is > 30. So yes, nearly the entire cohort was overweight by definition. BMI is a population measure and normal, healthy people can definitely fall into the overweight category.

Sleep apnea and heavy snoring more commonly is due to the tongue and jaw slacking during sleep, causing the tongue to kind of slide into the throat and obstruct your airway.

In time I became convinced it was basically just a placebo effect, and when I started developing some brain fog and waking up feeling light-headed I finally ditched the machine. And never felt the need for it again.

She does not snore, nor wake, nor generally have any trouble sleeping beyond initially getting to sleep - for which she is already on medication. The only reason she even got checked in the first place was she paralyzed one of her diaphragms after a very bad bout of pneumonia, and her pulmonologist made a suggestion based on nothing other than an abundance of caution that we might want to make an appointment to see. I remain largely unconvinced of the methodology by which she was diagnosed. It was an at-home single-night sleep study. She had to strap a box to her chest, place a handful of electrodes around and wear a breathing monitor. She only managed around three hours of sleep, largely because she could not sleep in her preferred position (stomach) and found the hoses in her nose anxiety inducing. It was, in my unprofessional opinion, completely unrepresentative of a normal restful night of sleep, and thus largely irrelevant data. On top of that, the day we returned the device the doctor opened the appointment by checking what CPAP machines our insurance would cover - BEFORE the results came back from the lab.

    "originLink": "https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2024/04/14/bubblebox.html",
    "originBody": "Apr 14, 2024 • Sysadmin • Edits • Permalink Sandboxing All The Things with Flatpak and BubbleBox A few years ago, I have blogged about my approach to sandboxing less-trusted applications that I have to or want to run on my main machine. The approach has changed since then, so it is time for an update. Over time I grew increasingly frustrated with Firejail: configurations would frequently break on updates, and debugging Firejail profiles is extremely hard. When considering all the included files, we are talking about many hundred lines of configuration with a subtle interplay of allowlists and blocklists. Even when I knew which folder I wanted to give access to, it was often non-trivial to ensure that this access would actually be possible. Now I am instead using a combination of two different approaches: Flatpak and BubbleBox. Flatpak The easiest sandbox to maintain is the sandbox maintained by someone else. So when a Flatpak exists for software I want to or have to use, such as Signal or Zoom, that is generally my preferred approach. Unfortunately, Flatpaks can come with extremely liberal default profiles that make the sandbox mostly pointless. The following global overrides help ensure that this does not happen: [Context] sockets=!gpg-agent;!pcsc;!ssh-auth;!system-bus;!session-bus filesystems=~/.XCompose:ro;xdg-config/fontconfig:ro;!~/.gnupg;!~/.ssh;!xdg-documents;!home;!host [Session Bus Policy] org.freedesktop.Flatpak=none org.freedesktop.secrets=none BubbleBox However, not all software exists as Flatpak. Also, sometimes I want software to run basically on my host system (i.e., to use the regular /usr), just without access to literally everything in my home directory. Examples of this are Factorio and VSCodium. The latter doesn’t work in Flatpak as I want to use it with LaTeX, and realistically this means it needs to run the LaTeX installed via apt. The official recommendation is to effectively disable the Flatpak sandbox, but that entirely defeats the point, so I went looking for alternatives. bubblewrap provides a very convenient solution: it can start an application in its own private filesystem namespace with full control over which part of the host file system is accessible from inside the sandbox. I wrote a small wrapper around bubblewrap to make this configuration a bit more convenient to write and manage; this project is called BubbleBox. This week-end I finally got around to adding support for xdg-dbus-proxy so that sandboxed applications can now access particular D-Bus functions without having access to the entire bus (which is in general not safe to expose to a sandboxed application). That means it’s finally time to blog about this project, so here we go – if you are interested, check out BubbleBox; the project page explains how you can use it to set up your own sandboxing.1 I should also note that this is not the only bubblewrap-based sandboxing solution. bubblejail is fairly similar but provides a configuration GUI and a good set of default provides; it was a very useful resource when figuring out the right bubblewrap flags to make complex GUI applications work properly. (Incidentally, “bubblejail” is also how I called my own script originally, but then I realized that the name is already taken.) Joachim Breitner also recently blogged about his own bubblewrap-based sandboxing script. There are many ways to do this, and it was fun to figure out my own solution. Using bubblewrap and xdg-dbus-proxy for this was an absolute joy. Both of these components came out of the Flatpak project, but the authors realized that they could be independently useful, so in best Unix tradition they turned them into tools that provide all the required mechanism without hard-coding any sort of policy. Despite doing highly non-trivial tasks, they are both pretty easy to use and compose and very well-documented. Thanks a lot to everyone involved! One day I should probably rewrite this in Rust… maybe this will be my test project for when cargo-script becomes available. ↩ Posted on Ralf's Ramblings on Apr 14, 2024. Comments? Drop me a mail!",

Unless someone has found a way to make GPUs pretend to be common consumer GPUs and not report any individualized fingerprints, then I would think that any online service that has GPU access can easily fingerprint you. Plus, in my experience VMs also tend to report a lot of system information that makes it apparent what hypervisor and virtual devices you are using. Sure, each VM may be isolated in the sense that they each have their own apps and isolated file systems... but that is exactly what sandboxing does, except without the overhead of complete virtualization at each layer. I'd guess that Windows Sandbox would provide the same security in a much more efficient manner.

IMHO, Flatpak is a regression in some of these aspects. reply timeflex 6 hours agorootparentI really love the theory of NixOS... an entire OS that is declaritively (or dynamically) defined. But the nix language itself does not seem like the right approach. A lot of packages just break out into command line scripting because of its limitations. As much as I've despised the JavaScript ecosystem in the past, it seems like TypeScript with Deno which has built-in JSON/TOML/INI/YAML and sandboxing would be a better language to handle automatic system configuration overall... plus, you'd have the advantage of a web app to manage your system config(s), sort of like what fish does. reply michaelmrose 1 hour agorootparentWhy not guile with guix? reply freeone3000 9 hours agorootparentprevThe administration should be taken care of by the distro, but, it isn’t.

If you're giving code away you don't owe your users much. reply timeflex 6 hours agorootparentThe idea of spoon feeding simple but incredible solutions for free can be very rewarding for maintainers, and can also generate a monetary reward as well. There are projects that I happily donate to because they create value for me. How many terms of service have you read of apps that you pay for? It seems that many apps you pay don't just take your money, but your privacy and rights away too. Developers creating something in the open can inspire and help make communities of people working on a shared goal, that attracts quality individuals from all over the world to help. It brings people that are excited about your goals and that came to your project because it was something they could find and appreciate. I'd say, you don't get the same from closed-source software. You also can't achieve the same by being an asshole to potential contributors just because you feel like it. Sure, it is an option, but if you want to actually build something... not just for you, but a dream, then it is a bad choice to not try to build a healthy community. reply danmur 6 hours agorootparentprevpissing matches and missing patches (sorry couldn't resist) reply goodpoint 2 hours agorootparentprevSecurity-oriented distributions solve the problem of managing vulnerabilities. reply curt15 10 hours agoparentprevTypical package managers also can't tell you if an app bundles its own library.

AIUI it's perfectly common for flatpaks to bundle things in, whereas ex. Debian has explicit policies against doing so (with caveats, yes, but generally). reply curt15 10 hours agorootparent>The package manager can't, but the distro can. The package manager is a technology, while the distro is a set of people and policies. It's fairer to compare distros with Flathub, the most popular repository for flatpaks (although not the only one; for example, Red Hat maintains its own flatpak remote for RHEL customers). And yes, Debian likely has stricter rules than Flathub. But those don't apply to any software you might require outside the distros' repos -- just take a look at Google Chrome, probably one of the most popular DEBs or RPMs; it's full of bundled libraries. reply timeflex 7 hours agoparentprevI dislike bwrap because it is built around a CLI-arg based approached for sandboxing. Even the wrappers that allow config-based sandboxes just end up transcribing a file to CLI args. I'd prefer it actually have an API of sorts.

AppArmor would. reply planede 1 hour agorootparentI would say that they are different tools for different purposes. Sure, with pledge/unveil/seccomp you trust the process to do the right thing, it's really about restricting against threats external to the process. But it allows the process to have different privileges at different parts of the program, while external restrictions are not that flexible. I think it makes sense to use both. Use external restrictions to only give capabilities that the process will ever need, and within the process drop capabilities when they are no longer needed. reply boustrophedon 10 hours agorootparentprevLinux has seccomp and landlock, which are basically harder-to-use versions of pledge/unveil. reply PlutoIsAPlanet 9 hours agorootparentSomeone has combined those things to port Pledge to Linux. https://github.com/jart/pledge reply chme 2 hours agoprevI would love to see a Linux distribution picking up on the concept of NixOS, with its content-addressed-package store and then use overlayfs and bubblewrap to create process local FHS compatible root file systems with only the dependencies of each process inside. reply sham1 1 hour agoparentWell, both Guix System and NixOS can do this, where they construct a containerised environment with FHS layout. IIRC neither uses overlayfs and they do the namespaces by themselves instead of relying on Bubblewrap, but inside the container you get exactly what you'd expect. At least in Guix it's `guix shell -CF`, where `-C` is of course the `--container` flag, and `-F` for `--emulate-fhs`. I'd imagine that `nix-shell` works the same way, but I'm more familiar with guix than nix, so I can only speak for that. reply chme 1 hour agorootparentI only ever tried NixOS, but the FHS stuff there seems to only be about getting Steam and other proprietary software to work. I would suggest to have this per default, so that the only application that actually sees the real file system would be PID1. reply sham1 1 hour agorootparentThat is an interesting idea, but I don't really see what the purpose would really be. As you said, having these kinds of FHS containers really is only actually useful for proprietary software, with free software being adaptable for a \"non-standard\" filesystem. Of course, it's sometimes helpful to do this even for free software, which is of course why this is an option, but I do struggle to see what would be the idea with making it the default for all non-PID1 apps in such a system. All I could really reckon is that it might be easier for user familiarity, but at least in my experience, one gets used to the new layout pretty quickly. You'd ideally be configuring the whole system in either Nix language or Scheme anyway, so things like `/etc` are a bit superfluous, and since you can get `/bin/sh` and `/usr/bin/env` symlinked for things that expect it, most things should work anyway. Well, unless done poorly, but nothing one couldn't patch. reply chme 1 hour agorootparentIn NixOS you have only one central package store `/nix/store`, so all packages need to be installed there. This is necessary, because the software is patched to use that path. IMO patching it this way is a bit hacky, when there a better options. If overlayfs is used, the software would not require patching, so you could have multiple package stores if you like. Maybe a package store in `~/.nix/store` as well. This would allow with a immutable rootfs (e.g. immutable `/nix/store`) to still install packages per user, or even per project a different package store. reply INTPenis 1 hour agoparentprevI understood some of those words. But I've been using Atomic Fedora for the last 2 years and my whole work flow has shifted to using containers for everything CLI, I can have specific container images for work on qemu images, or terraform for example. And everything else like Steam games, VLC, Firefox all run in Flatpaks. So the end goal is to not make any modifications to the host image. reply chme 1 hour agorootparent> So the end goal is to not make any modifications to the host image. IMO the goal should not be to have a immutable host image, but to have a immutable rootfs of each process. Immutable host base images might contain libraries or software that is not required by the application, they are more difficult to update, because they need to be updated as a unit, and probably require a reboot. To make this stable, you need to hack around with A/B partitions for a fallback. IMO this would not be necessary if we had every package just installed under its checksum under `/pkgs` or what ever, an then use overlayfs to create a file system customized for every process. All that is required here to revert back is the old 'profile' and then start the old packages from the `/pkgs`. Like NixOS does it. However NixOS doesn't use overlayfs, they use symlinks and patching of the paths in the sources to archive it. Using overlayfs would also allow changing the package path (`/pkgs` here, or nixos package store `/nix/store`) at runtime, because the software would not require patches, so people could install an additional store in their home directory for instance. reply bjackman 2 hours agoparentprevThey don't do the special package manager thing but aside from that I think the \"immutable distros\" like Fedora Silverblue are in this vein no? reply chme 1 hour agorootparentI would consider Fedora Silverblue/CoreOS, NixOS and even flatpak as a sort of hacky way to implement that. I don't know of any PoC for this. I would guess that there might be some research budget available for that approach. reply Intralexical 11 hours agoprevI kinda think having a tool to invoke `bwrap` is overkill for most cases. Applications I want to launch more than once just get a launcher script with `--bind \"$(dirname \"$(realpath \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")\")/FakeHome\" ~` or other flags as appropriate. Same for tools that I don't want to install account-wide. Opening a terminal emulator in a `bwrap` sandbox and then using it to launch other applications and create new windows feels like using a VM, except it's all running natively. It's also quite useful to have aliases/functions in `.bashrc` for `--tmpfs ~` or `--bind \"$(mktemp -d)\" ~`, `--bind \"$PWD\" \"$PWD\"`, `--ro-bind \"$PWD\" \"$PWD\"`, etc., with varying levels of access to X11/DBus etc. You can quickly test how a code change behaves on a clean install, instantly see what configuration files something uses by running it in a clean sandbox and then running `tree`, and check on your first time using a new program that it isn't going to do anything crazy. I usually use some variant of `sandboxed-dir bash` or `sandboxed-rodir bash`, which I've `alias`ed to `bwrap` with flags as the names describe, whenever I'm about to either run `rm -rf` [1] or otherwise touch files which I'd rather not accidentally destroy. The BubbleWrap sandbox isn't useful just for security, but also for keeping configurations isolated/clean, and protecting against all manner of errors both in software and between the keyboard and chair. --- [1]: `echo rm -rvfi`, actually. See what you're doing before you run it for real, especially if there's a glob in there. And then the `bwrap --dev-bind / / --tmpfs ~ --bind \"$PWD\" \"$PWD\" bash` makes absolutely sure you're not going to do anything other than what you said you'd do. reply akdev1l 10 hours agoparent> I kinda think having a tool to invoke `bwrap` is overkill for most cases.

It doesn't obviously turn up in web search reply timeflex 7 hours agoprevI'm really frustrated with Flatpak. I thought it was going to be an exciting secure sandboxing solution, but found out the people running it just make terrible choices overall. Apps don't use their conventional names, so chromium ends up become org.chromium.Chromium & Visual Studio Code is com.visualstudio.code. They use fuse for mounts, which isn't necessary in modern Linux kernels that support nonroot overlays (think Podman). The whole point of sandboxing is to allow it to \"hide\" your real file system, and only mount what you need or permit access through D-Bus.. however, you'll find several apps that default to host access and access to all your /dev. They only provide a few device options as well... so, if you just want to give access to a webcam, well you have to provide all of /dev in most cases. Flatpak leaks all kinds of info about its sandbox too, so any app can easily determine its sandbox. If you want to setup custom mounts, for example to mount a specific host directory into a different sandbox directory, well you can't. It has to be a direct mapping from your host except it prevents you from mapping /etc/ directories. To work around this for sandboxed home directories, you can use a persistent directory mapping.. but now, you'll be trying to access your files in `~/.var/apps/org.chromium.Chromium/Downloads`. They also use a file forwarding concept, which doesn't work well when mixing arguments and files. For example, try using org.vim.Vim to pass arguments and open a file from the command line. Or, try editing system files with Flatpak where you need sudo or some privilege elevation. Why doesn't org.vim.Vim get aliased and work like regular vim? The typical solution suggested to fix anything is to add `org.freedesktop.Flatpak=talk` to the session bus, and use flatpak-spawn from within the sandbox. Many users do this not knowing the consequences. This is generally terrible advice as it will give any app in the sandbox complete host access. But what happens when you need access to host tools or native messaging apps from inside the Sandbox? Again, the top answers are to use flatpak-spawn. They have \"SDK Extensions\" for a few apps which are like binary dependencies, but many tools needed for things like Visual Studio Code just don't exist. Try using the Ansible extension in VS Code for example. Packaging them is a nightmare because they use a hodgepodge of tools/scripts inside a random GitHub repo to manually get all the Rust crates, node modules, python packages, etc. and add them to a nonstandard file inside your build manifest. It makes no sense why they never added this functionality to the builder itself. Development seems to be stalling. If you do build an app, good luck getting it on Flathub without some authoritarian mod telling you they don't like your app (see the Popcorn Time decision). Now, there are some good things. The build manifest is pretty neat. I like the idea of having a simple manifest to build apps that integrates with build tools, but the externals scripts it relies on makes it suck. Sandboxing isn't a unique concept. I can see an enthusiastic Rust/C/C++/Go/Typescript developer or developers doing the same thing 100x better. IMO sandboxed apps shouldn't even know they are sandboxed. Each app should have a clean environment and ideally you'd pick and choose what files/folders you want to give the app access to while it is running, and not let the app builder decide for you. Also, the user should pick and choose where to mount directories if they choose to do so.. not make ~/Documents mount to ~/Documents... what if I want to mount /mnt/dev/docs to ~/Documents. If you care about this stuff, then you may end up frustrated like me. reply slooonz 1 hour agoparent> Each app should have a clean environment and ideally you'd pick and choose what files/folders you want to give the app access to while it is running, and not let the app builder decide for you.

Right now for power-consumers the most secure OSes for access control are GrapheneOS (AOSP) and Qubes OS. Windows (with privsep) and desktop Linux are (were) good at stopping drive-by printer driver installs but terrible at keeping your browser running rogue glowware exfiltrating blackmail to use against you (or planting felony charges to leverage).

Qubes isn't really about access control so much as it is about having disposable vms for doing sensitive things. reply Borealid 6 hours agorootparentprevI wish I could use Graphene without needing to buy into their anti-OSS stance and ideology, though. The core idea is sound, but I frequently see: - MicroG is \"insecure\" because it requires \"signature spoofing\" (reality: LineageOS allows only MicroG to replace only Google Play Services - I wouldn't consider that \"insecure\" and the Graphene devs never explain further) - Open source software is less secure than closed source software (reality: mixed bag) - F-Droid is \"insecure\" (I can't address this one because I don't understand the point of view and I've never seen it clarified) - GrapheneOS executes Google Play Services in a \"sandbox without any special permissions\" (reality: there is a repository full of code that allows sandboxed Google Play to behave in a way other apps can't within the sandbox) - Automatically installing updates is necessary to \"be secure\" (reality: updates might add or remove vulnerabilities. Failing to update when a vulnerability exists is insecure, but updating automatically is not a clear win for a savvy, aware user) - System backups are not a part of a security policy (reality: having the ability to restore a backup is necessary to mitigate damage caused by an exploit) - Pixel devices are the only \"sufficiently secure\" phones (reality: it might be convenient targeting a single platform, but there are plenty of phones now that provide the technical capabilities Graphene requires) - Privacy is not part of security (reality: security is classic CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. If you can't keep confidentiality you're missing one of the pillars) - Complying with Google's Compatibility Test Suite is \"more secure\" than deviating from it (reality: the CTS is designed to favor app developers over end users. The app developers might or might not be better at looking out for users' interests than the users themselves) Everything I'm representing as a GrapheneOS dev position I've heard straight from the horse's mouth on their forum and/or in their documentation. I think sometimes they hold opinions which aren't 100% aligned with what I'd consider a maximally secure system. That said, they have delivered a pretty solid OS if you can live with its various compromises. The one that really grates on me is the last one: I don't want an OS that chooses an app developer's \"don't copy this file\" flag over my desire to copy it! EDIT: formatting reply timeflex 5 hours agorootparentI tried GrapheneOS recently and switched back just because I lost my automatic backups. The backup solution and syncing should have been solved before some of the other design choices IMO. I was also disappointed to see that there is no way to prevent the warning message on each boot, which seems to delay the startup (or at least none that I could find). Other than that, I could be content with it.. it may not be perfect, but it felt good to know that I wasn't tied into the Google eco system. I liked their contacts and location sandboxing. I've heard some complaints about GrapheneOS's choices and wish that there was more communication from the lead developers about their design choices, just to understand them a bit better. However, I do think some users are just reactionary overall to some things. They hear Chromium and just assume it is worse, but honestly have no clue from a development perspective. All your complaints sound legit though and I too would like to know the answers, because you bring up very valid points. There has been some drama in the F-Droid community, and I too tried alternatives, but in the end... my favorite apps all recommend F-Droid, and I find using F-Droid 10x easier than the alternative of managing apps from random locations. I believe the biggest complaint with F-Droid is that it is a single-point of failure or compromise since they sign the packages and updates can get delayed, however, in reality adding random Git repos to Obtanium or whatever is just as insecure. I believe Fdroid even does some security scanning too, but I could be wrong... which is an added bonus. reply yjftsjthsd-h 10 hours agoparentprevLinux has lots of sandboxing features.

The issue is often not the individual features, but delivering them as a consistent, usable package.

Some have web apps, but the generally work less well. a tiny number of backdoored open source packages Backdoored applications are not the only issue. Also non-backdoored applications with vulnerabilities, basically any client, etc. The saving grace of the Linux desktop is that it's not much of an interesting target due to relatively low popularity. Otherwise actors would be hunting for vulnerabilities in RSS readers, chat clients, etc. (remember that the surface is not only the application itself, but also any image/video decoding libraries, etc.). OTOH, sandboxing tends to break the kind of complex workflows that users are fond of. That's an issue, especially for Linux power users. For most users, sandboxing can be done without too many issues (see e.g. sandboxed Mac apps). reply cherryteastain 11 hours agoparentprevLinux is a kernel.

    "originLink": "https://httpscolonforwardslashforwardslashwwwdotzoltanbalazsdotcom.com/2024/03/01/VPN-Snakeoil.html",
    "originBody": "Because Google started to delete hacking related blog posts without using a single brain cell, I had to learn just another framework. Thx Google Personal VPN services are snake-oil Published on 01 Mar 2024 Intro Personal VPN services are a multi-million dollar business. But is it worth your money? If they can afford to sponsor Pewdiepie, they should do something right, right? Fifty million flies can’t be wrong! This is going to be a complex topic, so bear with me. The statement I would like to prove: There are only a few problems for a few people worldwide where the answer is using a personal VPN service. You don’t need a personal VPN service if you are an average Internet user. If you are a tech-savvy user, you can do much better than using a VPN. Personal VPNs are the homeopathic medicines of the tech industry. Also known as a scam. Glossary By personal/commercial VPN service, I mean NordVPN, Tunnelbear, Mullvad VPN, etc. Company VPNs, or a VPN to phone into your home network, are out of the scope of this article. By public Wi-Fi, I mean Wi-Fi services where it is either open or the WPA key is shared with everyone. From a security point of view, there is not much difference between the two. Let’s break down the problem of privacy and security. Let’s start with … Security Fifteen years ago, it was common malpractice that even though websites used HTTPS for the login page, the rest of the communication was over HTTP. One could steal the authentication cookie from the unencrypted Wi-Fi stream and use that to log in to that service. Tools like Surfjack and Firesheep were popular tools for wannabe hackers. Back then, using a personal VPN service at public Wi-Fi made sense. Also, many email clients checked their email using unencrypted POP3 or IMAP protocols. But nowadays, there is practically no vital service on the Internet, which does not run on HTTPS. OK, but what about tools like SSLStrip? SSLStrip works like this: User types www.mybanklogin.com The browser connects to clear-text, unprotected http://www.mybanklogin.com Attacker having active man-in-the-middle (MiTM) capability sees this traffic The web server notifies the user’s browser that it should use the secure https://www.mybanklogin.com site The attacker removes this notification The user continues the login process over the insecure, unencrypted http://www.mybanklogin.com So, can hackers steal my username and password? First, for accounts that matter, you should use 2FA (short for multi-factor authentication). It would be best to use unphisable 2FA like FIDO2/webauthn (e.g. Yubikey) for accounts that matter. Nowadays, most browsers implement “HTTPS only mode”. Next time, instead of turning on your VPN, you should check if your browser already uses HTTPS only mode, and if not, turn that on. For example, Safari does that by default. Ask your service provider to implement HSTS. It is excellent about HSTS that the user cannot bypass certificate errors. And the browser will auto-connect to HTTPS by default. The good news is that if you use mobile apps, almost all are secure already. Just keep your mobile OS and apps up-to-date. No one will spoil a precious 0-day to attack you. If you are worried about DNS MiTM, use DNS over HTTP in your browser. OK, but what about tools like Metasploit browser autopwn? Well, the good news is that it is much easier to keep your browser up-to-date compared to ~ ten years ago. Nowadays, however, it is rare that recent browser exploits are openly available for any hacker to use. If you are a target of a government, spy agency, or hacker-for-hire services, yes, they may have the resources to hack your browser, but chances are you are not that important. Sorry. And if you are that important, VPNs will not decrease your risks. One massive problem with personal VPN services is that they are working to fail open. If the connection fails, your connection is not “protected” anymore. Some premium VPN providers sell “kill switch” functionality, but I am sure less than 1% of the users use this properly. Looking at the practical side, how many legit stories do you know where someone lost money that could have been avoided just by using a VPN? I have never heard such a story. The “ Darkhotel “ attacker group could have been such an example, except that a VPN would not protect you against their attack, as they used fake Wi-Fi captive portals to deliver the exploit/malware. And before logging into a hotel Wi-Fi portal, you can’t start your VPN … And before I forget, let’s quickly discuss free VPNs. Never, ever install a free VPN solution. They will abuse your network connectivity, and other malicious or non-malicious users will use it to do whatever they want. It is like inviting one thousand unknown people to your house to have a party and leave them unattended. You can find many stories where free VPNs are actually malware. Privacy concerns OK, but what about my DNS and TLS records being exposed to everyone so they can follow what I am doing? In a public place, anyone can look at your display already. Or, if you are worried about your ISP selling your traffic data, there are better options for you. Use DNS over HTTPS, for example. You have to use a VPN provider you trust better than your ISP/Wi-Fi provider. Also, as Encrypted Client Hello is about to start soon, it will be exponentially harder for eavesdroppers to figure out which sites you are trying to visit. But if you care about privacy, the answer is always ToR, ToR browser or Tails, and never VPN. Except in cases where you first have to hide your ToR usage using a VPN, which is a rare exception among users. If you don’t understand why you would need that, you probably don’t need that complexity. Tor Browser uses uncountable techniques that prevent tracking your browser. And if your privacy is essential against local Wi-Fi attackers, your ISP, why is the ad industry not in scope? Adblockers are only half the solution against tracking. When to use a personal VPN? Geofence bypass for region-locked content. Piracy. Not that you should not support your artists/musicians/content creators, filmmakers, actors, … but I agree that there are situations in life when piracy is the only ethical option. Soft network block/censorship. Do your own research. Don’t end up in jail. Conclusion Claims made by VPN companies: VPNs reduce the risk of “getting hacked,” whatever that means. This is not true. Additional services provided by VPNs, like URL filtering, can reduce your risk. However, it is more effective to use URL filtering on the endpoint level, not the network level, as most VPN companies do. VPNs protect your privacy Even though they increase your privacy, it is still far from what ToR can do for you. Suppose you want to increase your privacy and security. Instead of watching VPN reviews on YouTube, I recommend that you patch your operating system and your browser and configure always HTTPS and DoH in your browser. Use an ad blocker or, even better, a browser built with privacy in mind. If you frequently install new applications, use antivirus/endpoint protection on your non-mobile OS. For Windows, the built-in default Microsoft Defender is a good option. Congratulations, you are in a better position compared to using a VPN, and you don’t have to pay for it, and you don’t have to enable it all the time. What to read? I found these articles also useful. As this is a complex topic, with different aspects, if you want to read more, this is where I recommend to start: overengineer.dev krebsonsecurity.com gist.github.com/joepie91 www.spacebar.news www.forbes.com it.slashdot.org PS Yes, some of these VPN products provide extra services/functions/protections. And some of these extras make sense. But that does not mean that VPN is the answer to your problems overall. PS 2 WPA3 can support encryption and privacy on open, non-password-protected networks. I have not seen it anywhere in the wild, but the future is bright. If you operate open Wi-Fi networks, please, please, upgrade to WPA3. related posts \"Just\" migrate to Jekyll ...

(Longer answer: This boils down to the weighted probabilities; if the ISP was meaningfully regulated such that it was legally restricted from doing certain things with my data, that might matter, and one should also play in the exact likelihood that either party is selling my data. In my case the weighted probability is wildly in favor of a VPN, but I suppose I can imagine situations where that wouldn't hold.) reply blackeyeblitzar 12 hours agorootparentprevIt’s their business (value proposition) to not do the same and most explicitly commit to that.

And no. The ISP has little to no competition or incentive to not sell my information, while the VPN provider has loads of competition and often has user privacy as a core part of their value proposition. Besides - even if both of the did have the same incentives, one openly says they're selling my data and one says they're not. At worst it's a gamble between the VPN lying and the ISP telling the truth. reply chuckadams 13 hours agorootparentprevSir I would have you know that I participate in no such illicit tomfoolery.

VPN companies are more trustworthy than my ISP. Many get third party audits and publish results. And if the VPN company and server are in a privacy friendly country, they are hard to subpoena.

Tortious interference with a business relationship is no doubt what you're referring to here, but it's a long bow with multiple layers of indirection. It is \"intentionally acting to prevent someone from successfully establishing or maintaining business relationships with others\". Miramax, as a content distributor, might license their content to Netflix. You are a customer of Netflix. Now say you are a customer of NordVPN. For one, NordVPN isn't trying to prevent you maintaining a business relationship with Netflix. Nor is it trying to prevent Netflix having a business relationship with Miramax. NordVPN may provide you means by which you can choose to be in violation of your TOS with Netflix. It's not acting to ensure you are. Netflix doesn't have to -allow- this, hence VPN/proxy detection. But they have recourse, drop you as a customer, for you, the customer's, actions, not for NordVPN's actions. Miramax can't argue that NordVPN acted to interfere with their licensing scheme with Netflix. reply JumpCrisscross 10 hours agorootparent> Miramax can't argue that NordVPN acted to interfere with their licensing scheme with Netflix No, but they could argue that the VPN user interfered with their licensing scheme.

And that's not a result of regulation (anyone can buy as much as they want), but is rather a result of stock shrink. It tends to disappear in some less-than-savory neighborhoods.

ISPs often have captive markets and have enough political sway to grant them said captive markets. VPN companies have none of that, and live or die based on their reputation, so they arguably have more of an incentive to behave well. Meanwhile some ISPs have even admitted to selling your traffic for marketing purposes or are forced by the government to keep records. There's plenty of shady VPN companies out there, and not all ISPs are scummy and sell your info, but there's quite a bit of range between the scummiest ISP and the best VPN, and for a subset of people using VPNs definitely makes sense. reply eipi10_hn 10 hours agoparentprevMy ISP is from communist country and my VPN is Mullvad.

Can we see the data on that. Perhaps this word as used here is just a figure of speech. \"Tor Browser uses uncountable techniques that prevent tracking your browser.\" Tor Browser has a number of popular browser \"features\" removed/disabled by default. As such the browser user does not need to do anything, no fiddling with poorly-documented options via about:config, user.js or whatever. IMHO, modifications like these would be useful even when not submitting requests through the Tor network. The question I have is why is there not a Firefox version that is like Tor Browser but without the Tor integration. Perhaps the answer is because Mozilla is trying to perpetuate online ads, i.e., surveillance, data collection and tracking, as a \"business model\", such as the model adopted by Google. Mozilla is wholly dependant on financial support from Google. If Google's online ads business fails, Mozilla is out of options. NB. I would never use Tor Browser. I am a text-only browser user and I prefer netcat and other TCP clients through one or more localhost-bound proxies for making HTTP requests. When I experiment with Tor, I use tor binary I compiled myself without relay module. In front of the tor SOCKS proxy, I use socat for requests to .onion sites that use HTTPS and tinyproxy for requests to .onion sites that use HTTP.^1 1. If anyone can explain why some .onion sites use HTTPS instead of HTTP, I would be interested to know the anwser. AFAICT, most .onion sites use HTTP. Tor reminds me of the early public internet. Submitting a request like an Archie search and having to wait seconds for a response. Also the number of .onion sites is relatively small. I like the uniformity of .onion addresses and the general absence of \"vanity\" names. And the search engine for it reminds me of the web pre-Google: like AltaVista, thousands of results are accessible. That's the way I like it. None of this collecting data from searches and trying to \"guess\" what someone is searching for (as Google does). reply ImpostorKeanu 27 minutes agoprevAnother interesting point is that VPN providers have access to server-side keys and, obviously, the processes. This just makes the VPN provider the new ISP.

Even outside of the \"well known\" VPN uses like piracy, privacy (in a 'I trust it more then my ISP' fashion), and getting around geo-fences there's still uses for them. A couple of quick examples: Getting around blocks or monitoring on networks like work WiFi. No need to tell my work I'm on Indeed, and for a little while they seemed to block my email provider (Proton) and reading my email is handy to be able to do. For use as a network tool. For example, I was recently helping my brother set up a website, and with port forwarding he was able to really easily VNC into my VM I was working on it with. VPNs can also be handy for the 'slightly suspicious stuff' that's not illegal. You know, things like an internet search about something you saw on TV or were just curious about that's not illegal to research, but you're worried it could be a suspicious search. Or maybe I want to use wget to grab an offline archive of a website, but don't want to raise alarms and get my IP banned. reply iambateman 13 hours agoprevIt’s true that their privacy promises are dubious…but they’re great for IP switching.

However, bandwidth and latency on TOR suck, and in many cases the endpoint IPs are blacklisted to hell due to abuse. A VPN is a nice middle ground where your can put another entity between yourself and your traffic, which is valuable against most opportunist adversaries. If a TLA wants me and can get a warrant, not even TOR will save me, but a VPN keeps the ISP from selling my traffic and the media trolls from sending me grumpy letters because the neighbors keep using my wifi to watch free content. reply bsza 13 hours agoparent> assuming the network is not majority compromised There is no such guarantee AFAIK, as long as a bad actor controls all the nodes in YOUR route, they can deanonymize you. reply tomxor 10 hours agoprevIn terms of privacy, there is one aspect you can gain: Privacy from your ISP and government.

It's bad enough trying to put up with big tech. reply shoaki 13 hours agoprevAlthough i agree with the overall message, there are privacy concerns with OCSP[1] which are mitigated by using a VPN. When trying to use the web privacy conscious, it might actually be beneficial to your privacy. This is a very edge case though. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Prot... reply aborsy 12 hours agoprevWouldn’t a VPN help protect against a targeted attack? Like an attacker could push bad JavaScript or app update to the user of a particular IP address. On DNS, it’s plaintext by default, and almost always not signed via DNSSEC. Such user could slightly benefit from a VPN from a security perspective. VPNs also usually do ad blocking, and some limited malware scanning. On privacy, there are many situations where a private IP address may be desirable, some of which mentioned in this post. VPN hides the traffic from the ISP, but also the user from the destination. On the latter, for instance, the websites could log IPs and that information could be sold or leak in the future. reply yegor 11 hours agoprevI run a commercial VPN service (Windscribe). Here are my thoughts on this. At its core, a basic VPN is a trust shift service, nothing more. Do you trust your ISP less than an some anonymous shell company owned by Siberian forest dwellers? In many cases, the answer is no. That being said, depending on where you are and if you choose the \"right\" VPN, the answer could be yes. Here are some reasons why you may want to use a good commercial VPN, which goes beyond just the ability to tunnel your traffic through a remote endpoint: - You are in Russia, China, Iran or other countries with heavily censored Internet. Over 3 billion people live in such places, or nearly 50% of the world's population. - If you don't live in such places, laws in certain US states criminalize certain behaviors. This will only get worse, even in \"western democracies\". Using a quality VPN service is much better than barebacking the Internet. - You want your traffic to be \"lost in the crowd\", something you cannot achieve with your Digital Ocean droplet, no matter how well you configure it. Changing your IP does absolutely nothing, safe a few exceptions (piracy, or keeping an alter ego if your opsec is good) - Additional features: server side DNS filtering / blocking. Yes you can use uBlock origin, but not on mobile, and not outside the browser. Yes you can run Pi-Hole, and setup WG tunnels to your homelab. 99% of people won't. - Advanced features: Companion browser extensions that block ads, trackers, malicious domains, mess with your browser settings to reduce chances of fingerprinting. Yes you can install 5+ different extensions to do that. Most people won't. TLDR; If you're an elite haxor, you can do everything yourself. You will spend time, and money doing so. Most people will not bother or not be able to do these things, and a quality commercial VPN service can check a lot of the boxes I mentioned above. Just avoid the ones that advertise heavily, those are marketing / snakeoil sales companies, as the author suggested. reply nieve 9 hours agoprevThe thing I never hear mentioned is when your home ISP (or say your favorite cafe's) is known to use your traffic data for marketing purposes or sell it outright.

Many hotels block not just porn sites but also legitimate news pages (e.g. Torrentfreak), and most drastically throttle YouTube, Netflix and other streaming-heavy sites. A fifth use case is related: evading bad peering. Deutsche Telekom was infamous for years to \"double dip\", i.e. requiring that other (backbone/regional) ISPs pay them for peering, and so DTAG customers that tried to access Hetzner servers were throttled as the Hetzner-Telekom link got saturated in the peak traffic times.

[1] This manifested as pretty severe connection issues for AT&T customers playing FFXIV. Except, it was a chronic issue that would only flare up when that particular connection point was stressed. One of the easiest workarounds? Hop on a VPN. That's one example. Anecdotally, I have a few friends that toggle VPNs on and off when they encounter \"network weather\" in games. Personally, I'm a bit skeptical they're truly so often mitigating problems by toggling a VPN (instead of, say, just waiting a couple minutes), but hey, they swear by it.

In a public place, anyone can look at your display already. Or, if you are worried about your ISP selling your traffic data, there are better options for you. Use DNS over HTTPS, for example. You have to use a VPN provider you trust better than your ISP/Wi-Fi provider. Also, as Encrypted Client Hello is about to start soon, it will be exponentially harder for eavesdroppers to figure out which sites you are trying to visit. Encrypting DNS is a nice start, but the ISP can still see the IPs you're connecting to, which is enough for a lot of sites, and Encrypted Client Hello is about to start soon is a lot of words to say \"today, your ISP can see the domain on every HTTPS connection you make\". So no, distrusting my ISP is absolutely a compelling reason to use a VPN. (And lest you say \"but do they actually spy on you?\", I literally got a letter from AT&T informing me that they were going to start monetizing information mined from my connections.) > But if you care about privacy, the answer is always ToR, ToR browser or Tails, and never VPN. Except in cases where you first have to hide your ToR usage using a VPN, which is a rare exception among users. If you don’t understand why you would need that, you probably don’t need that complexity. Tor Browser uses uncountable techniques that prevent tracking your browser. And if your privacy is essential against local Wi-Fi attackers, your ISP, why is the ad industry not in scope? Adblockers are only half the solution against tracking. I mean, yeah I also use uBlock, but TOR makes harsher tradeoffs than are necessarily needed (multiple hops is really safe but also really slow). I'm just hiding from my ISP's prying eyes; I explicitly don't include the NSA in my threat models and lesser methods are Good Enough™ for websites tracking me. reply woofcat 13 hours agoparentECH is not starting soon.

    "originBody": "~/ me art writing Spectral Ray Tracing Ray Tracing Seeing the Spectrum When Wavelength Matters Spectral Ray Tracing and Computer Art 2024-04-13 I’m sharing this to give some background on my recent artworks exploring light, color, and perception through spectral ray tracing. This ray tracer that I’ve written has shown up in a few of my series, and I wanted to explain what “spectral ray tracing” even is. I have shared some outputs at the end of this writeup. In computer art, the artist builds both a scene and a camera to capture it out of code. The system being visualized, and process to render it into an array of RGB values are both made of the same 1s and 0s, pure abstraction turned into light. In much the same way, our eyes and brains are made of the same stuff as the universe they exist within and observe. This self-referential perspective on our awareness is both eerie and profound, obvious yet unsettling. For this reason, this idea of building cameras out of code has stuck with me. Now there are countless ways to do so, but one very literal and well-known process is “ray tracing”. In its essence, ray tracing models the path light travels between a simulated camera and light source, bouncing rays between virtual objects in to “illuminate” the scene. Ray Tracing Ray tracing takes many shortcuts in the process to render an image in the name of performance. For example: ray tracing traverses the path from the light source to the camera in reverse (though there are exceptions), with the idea being that the vast majority of rays emitted from the light source never make it to the camera. By instead starting the ray at the camera’s perspective and traveling backwards, we know that the ray already “made it” to the camera. This is physically sound under our current model of the universe, as we assume the laws governing light transport are symmetric with respect to the direction of time (a.k.a. T-symmetry). A simple scene being rendered via ray tracing. Each \"pixel\" on the left-hand grid has its color determined by the object it intersects in the scene, and how much light that object receives from the light source. Source: wikimedia Another major shortcut that’s typically taken, but is far less physically sound, involves treating each light ray as a particle carrying the RGB vector corresponding to its “color”, ignoring any wave-like properties light has. Rather remarkably, this shortcut produces physically-realistic scenes in a wide range of scenarios. The reason why this works so well has quite a long explanation, but is in large part due to how our eyes work: simply put, we have three types of color-sensitive cells in our eyes, sensitive to short (blue), medium (green), and long (red) wavelengths of light. This diagram shows the sensitivity of the SML (short, medium, long) cone cells as a function of light's wavelength. The color we see is a result of how much the incoming light stimulates each of those cone cells. Source: wikimedia However, our eyes don’t just receive red, green, and blue light (unless they’re very close to a computer screen or wearing a VR headset); our eyes are receiving a continuous spectrum of light, and converting that into the perception of color. Seeing the Spectrum The full visible spectrum of single-wavelength colors. Source: wikimedia Color that we see in the physical world is rarely made of just a single wavelength, instead, it’s a collection of many wavelengths forming what we call an SPD (spectral power distribution). For every color we can see, there are countless spectral power distributions that could correspond to that color. The fact that a single color can have many different SPDs is known as metamerism, and is a fascinating concept in its own right. For example: yellow has a corresponding wavelength as seen in the above visible spectrum at around 580nm, but it can also be reproduced with a mix of red and green light (as it must be, given that the diagram itself is being rendered using only RGB values on a computer monitor). The SPD for daylight, extending past the visible spectrum into ultraviolet and infrared. It's no coincidence that the intensity peaks around the part of the spectrum visible to us, as this is clearly an evolutionary adaptation to our environment. Source: wikimedia Another consequence of how our eyes see color from a distribution of wavelengths is the existence of non-spectral colors, like magenta. These colors can’t be reproduced by any single wavelength, and require multiple wavelengths of light to reproduce. Notice there is no magenta in that spectrum above, as it requires a mix of high and low-wavelength light (blue and red) to be seen. What’s most remarkable about this conversion from SPD to color is that it is possible to do so purely mathematically. The fact that such a link exists, bridging physics, physiology, and our subjective experience is honestly surreal. What’s even more remarkable is that this quantitative link was made back in 1931 with the creation of the CIE 1931 color spaces, at a time before the Turing machine (let alone a computer) was even invented, and access to electricity hadn’t even made it across America. If you want to implement this conversion yourself, I recommend reading this chapter of Physically Based Rendering, which gives a very thorough treatment of the subject. When Wavelength Matters As mentioned above, when ray tracing it’s often unnecessary to account for the full spectrum of light, let alone each ray’s “wavelength”. However, there are cases where a ray’s wave-like properties directly influence its path through a scene, and as a result effects the colors we see. The classic example is dispersion, when the path light takes is “bent” according to its wavelength. An optical prism showing white light being split into its component frequencies via dispersion. Source: wikimedia Another fascinating example you’ve probably seen in person is called “thin film interference”, and it explains the rainbow-like patterns visible on soap bubbles. These patterns are formed by the constructive and destructive interference patterns generated by the reflections off of the upper and lower layers of the soap boundary. Since this doesn’t involve splitting the spectrum into single wavelengths, but rather increasing or decreasing the contribution of parts of the spectrum the colors generated are often non-spectral colors, like turquoises, teals, magentas, browns… Destructive interference happening at a thin film boundary (in blue). The two incoming rays (labeled A and B) have the same wavelength, yet opposite phase after reflection due to traveling different distances before overlapping. The resulting ray (labeled C) is attenuated as a result. Source: wikimedia Spectral Ray Tracing and Computer Art To summarize, spectral ray tracing is just ray tracing that takes into account the wave-like properties of light. Instead of viewing the world through the lens of RGB color, spectral ray tracing generates spectral power distributions for every pixel in the scene, leveraging the wavelength and phase of rays to better estimate color in scenarios where this extra information matters. I’ve been curious what happens when some of the laws dictating how light moves are deliberately broken, building cameras out of code in a universe just a little unlike our own. Working with the richness of the full spectrum of light, spectral ray tracing has allowed me to break the rules governing light transport in otherworldly ways. Here are a few selected outputs from the past year. All of these were generated using my hand-written, no-dependency JavaScript and GLSL spectral ray tracer. Light Doesn't Bend That Way #1, 2023 This was generated by making the angle of reflection a function of wavelength. Note this process only seems to generate spectral colors.

Occasionally I see sentiment that with real-time ray tracing rendering is a solved problem, but imho it's far from truth. Afaik most spectral rendering systems do not do (thin-film) interference or other wave-based effects, so that is another frontier. Reality has surprising amount of detail. reply Klaster_1 3 hours agoparentThe closer rendering comes closer to underlying physical principles, the more game engines will become world simulation engines. Various engine parts commonly seen today will converge towards a common point, where, for example, we'll observe less distinction between physics and rendering layers. I wonder if this trend can be traced to some degree even today. Several orders of compute growth later, we'll look upon current abstractions in the same manner as on the 30 years old state of the art, shaped by technical limitations of the yesteryear, obvious in hindsight. Love the perspective this puts the things into. reply magicalhippo 1 hour agoparentprev> Reality has surprising amount of detail. Another one that few implement, and which can have a quite noticeable effect in certain scenes, is polarization of light[1]. [1]: https://www.giangrandi.ch/optics/polarizer/polarizer.shtml reply 6mian 2 hours agoprevIf you want to play with ray tracing implementation, it's surprisingly easy to write one by yourself. There's a great free book (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.ht...) or, if you know a bit of Unity a very nice GPU-based tutorial (https://medium.com/@jcowles/gpu-ray-tracing-in-one-weekend-3...). The Unity version is easier to tinker with, because you have scene preview and other GUI that makes moving camera around so much easier. There are many implementations based of these sources if you don't want to write one from scratch, although doing so is definitely worth it. I spent some great time playing with the base implementation. Making the rays act as particles* that bend their path to/away from objects, making them \"remember\" the last angle of bounce and use it in the next material hit etc. Most of them looked bad, but I still got some intuition what I was looking at. Moving the camera by a notch was also very helpful. A lot of fun, great for a small recreational programming project. * Unless there's an intersection with an object, then set the maximum length of the ray to some small amount, then shoot many rays from that point around and for each hit apply something similar to the gravity equation. Of course this is slow and just an approximation, but it's easy and you can implement a \"black hole\" type of object that will bend light in the scene. reply NBJack 5 hours agoprevThe beauty of mathematics and physics in action. I wonder if some of the tweaks made for the sake of beauty could be useful in other means of visualizations. It also reminds me of a time that I was copying code from a book to make polyphonic music on an Apple II. I got something wrong for sure when I ran it, but instead of harsh noise, I ended up with an eerily beautiful pattern of tones. Whatever happy accident I made fascinated me. reply raytopia 4 hours agoprevDoes anyone know if someone has attempted real time spectral rendering? I've tried finding information before but have never had any luck. reply dagmx 2 hours agoparentReal-time is unfortunately a sort of vague term. If you mean raster rendering pipelines then I don’t believe it’s possible because the nature of the GPU pipelines precludes it. You’d likely need to make use of compute shaders to create it at which point you’ve just written a patthtracer anyway. If you mean a pathtracer , then real-time becomes wholly dependent on what your parameters are. With a small enough resolution, Mitsuba with Dr.JIT could theoretically start rendering frames after the first one in a reasonable time to be considered realtime. However the reality is just that even in film, with offline rendering, very few studios find the gains of spectral rendering to be worth the effort. Outside of Wētā with Manuka , nobody else really uses spectral rendering. Animal Logic did for LEGO movie but solely for lens flares. The workflow change to make things work with a spectral renderer and the very subtle differences are just not worth the high increase in render time reply Hammershaft 1 hour agoprevThat animated artwork at the end is incredible.

The situations in which these properties actually matter for human perception are rare (e.g., thin films and diffraction gratings), but they exist. reply sudosysgen 6 hours agoprevA great spectral ray tracing engine is LuxRender : https://luxcorerender.org/ (the older one, that is - the newer LuxCore renderer does not have full spectral support) Beyond the effects shown here, there are other benefits to spectral rendering - if done using light tracing, it allows you to change color, spectrum and intensity of light sources after the fact. It also makes indirect lighting much more accurate in many scenes. reply uoaei 4 hours agoprev [–] Are there any good resources for spectral ray tracing for other frequencies of light, e.g. radio frequencies? reply magicalhippo 1 hour agoparent [–] What are the applications you have in mind?
