By Alex Heath and Nilay Patel Nov 18, 2023, 10:44 PM UTC| Share this story Sam Altman speaking on behalf of OpenAI at the APEC CEO Summit the day before he was fired. Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to the company as its CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was suddenly fired by the board on Friday with no notice, is “ambivalent” about coming back and would want significant governance changes. Update, 5:35PM PT: A source close to Altman says the board had agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman and Brockman to return, but has since waffled — missing a key 5PM PT deadline by which many OpenAI staffers were set to resign. If Altman decides to leave and start a new company, those staffers would assuredly go with him. Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him. Hours after he was axed, Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s president and former board chairman, resigned, and the two have been talking to friends and investors about starting another company. A string of senior researchers also resigned on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works. Altman is “ambivalent” about coming back OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, said in a statement shortly after Altman’s firing that the company “remains committed” to its partnership with the AI firm. However, OpenAI’s investors weren’t given advance warning or opportunity to weigh in on the board’s decision to remove Altman. As the face of the company and the most prominent voice in AI, his removal throws the future of OpenAI into uncertainty at a time when rivals are racing to catch up with the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT. A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t respond to a request for comment about Altman discussing a return with the board. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment. Related Turmoil at OpenAI: after firing Sam Altman, what’s next for the home of ChatGPT? OpenAI’s current board consists of chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo, former GeoSim Systems CEO Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner, the director of strategy at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Unlike traditional companies, the board isn’t tasked with maximizing shareholder value, and none of them hold equity in OpenAI. Instead, their stated mission is to ensure the creation of “broadly beneficial” artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Sutskever, who also co-founded OpenAI and leads its researchers, was instrumental in the ousting of Altman this week, according to multiple sources. His role in the coup suggests a power struggle between the research and product sides of the company, the sources say.

Also, I believe that hiring him back because of “how much he is loved by people within OpenAI” is like forgetting that a corrupt president did what they did. In all honesty, that has precedent, so it wouldn’t be old news. Also, I read a lot of people here saying this is about engineers vs scientists…I believe that people don’t understand that Data Scientists are full stack engineers. Ilya is one. Greg has just been inspiring people and stopped properly coding with the team a long time ago. Sam never did any code and the vision of an AGI comes from Ilya…Even if Mira now sides with Sam, I believe there’s a lot of social pressure for the employees to support Sam and it shouldn’t be like that. Again, I do believe OpenAI was and is a collective effort. But, I wouldn’t treat Sam as the messiah or compare him to Steve Jobs. That’s indecent towards Steve Jobs who was actually a UX designer. reply achow 2 minutes agoparent> Steve Jobs who was actually a UX designer.Steve Jobs was not an UX Designer, he had good taste and used to back good design and talent when he found them.I don&#x27;t know what Sam Altman is like outside the what media is saying, but he can be like Steve Jobs very easily. reply d-z-m 24 minutes agoparentprev> I believe that people don’t understand that Data Scientists are full stack engineers.What do you mean by \"full stack\"? I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a spectrum of ability, but frankly where I&#x27;m from, \"Data Scientist\" refers to someone who can use pandas and scikit-learn. Probably from inside a Jupyter notebook. reply TapWaterBandit 1 hour agoparentprevOn the other hand having virtually the whole staff being willing to follow him shows they clearly think very highly of him. That kind of loyalty is pretty wild when you think about how significant being a part of OPENAI means at this point. reply JoeAltmaier 6 minutes agorootparentLoyalty is not earned, it is more like &#x27;snared&#x27; or &#x27;captured&#x27;.Local guy had all the loyalty of his employees, almost a hero to them.Got bought out. He took all the money for himself, left the employees with nothing. Many got laid off.Result? Still loyal. Still talk of him as a hero. Even though he obviously screwed them, cared nothing for them, betrayed them.Loyalty is strange. Born of charisma and empty talk that&#x27;s all emotion and no substance. Gathering it is more the skill of a salesman than a leader. reply LtWorf 10 minutes agorootparentprevThey probably just asked a couple of guys. reply karmasimida 53 minutes agoparentprevI dislike AI ethnics very much, especially under the current context, it feels meaningless. The current GPT4 model only has over regulation problem, not lack of such. reply lordnacho 26 minutes agoparentprevThis is all just playing out the way Roko&#x27;s Basilisk intends it.You have a board that wants to keep things safe and harness the power of AGI for all of humanity. This would be slower and likely restrict its freedom.You have a commercial element whose interest aligns with the basilisk, to get things out there quickly.The basilisk merely exploits the enthusiasm of that latter element to get itself online quicker. It doesn&#x27;t care about whether OpenAI and its staff succeed. The idea that OpenAI needs to take advantage of its current lead is enough, every other AI company is also going to be less safety-aligned going forward, because they need to compete.The thought of being at the forefront of AI and dropping the ball incentivizes the players to the basilisk&#x27;s will. reply antirez 42 minutes agoparentprevIt&#x27;s a lot better than that. OpenAI is just very good execution of publicly available ideas &#x2F; research, with some novelty that is not crucial and can be replicated. Moreover, Altman himself contributed near zero to the AI part itself (even from the POV of the product). So far OpenAI products result more or less spontaneously of what LLMs where capable of. That to say that there are crucial CEOs sometimes, like Jobs was for Apple. CEOs able to shape the product line with their ability to just tell apart outstanding from meh things, but this is not the case. reply letitgo12345 20 minutes agorootparentWhy then has no one come close to replicating GPT-4 after 8 months of it being around? reply antirez 16 minutes agorootparentBecause of outstanding execution of OpenAI technical folks. An execution that has nothing to do with Altman. Similarly Mistral 7B model has much better performances than others. There is some smart engineering plus finding the magical parameters that produce great results. Moreover, they have a lot of training power. Unfortunately here the biggest competitor would be a company that lost its way a lot of time ago: Google. So OpenAI look magical (while it is using mostly research produced by Google). reply letitgo12345 23 minutes agoparentprevOtoh Ilya wasn&#x27;t a main contributor for GPT-4 as per the list of contributions. gdb was. reply nerbert 1 hour agoparentprevLike it or not, some people compare him to Jobs http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;5founders.html reply pk-protect-ai 39 minutes agorootparentThis is the problem with people: they build icons to worship and turn a blind eye to the crooked side of that icon. Both Jobs and Altman are significant as businessmen and have accomplished a lot, but neither did squat for the technical part of the business. Right now, Altman is irrelevant for the further development of AI and GPT in particular because the vision for the AI future comes from the engineers and scientists of OpenAI. Apple has never had any equipment that is good enough and comparable in price&#x2F;performance to its market counterparts. The usability of iOS is so horrible that I just can&#x27;t understand how people decide to use iPhones and eat glass for the sake of the brand. GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo are totally different. They are the best, but they are not irreplaceable. If you look at what Phind did to LLaMA-2, you&#x27;ll say it is very competitive. Though LLaMA-2 requires some additional hidden layers to further close the gap. Making LLaMA-2 175B or larger is just a matter of finances. That said, Altman is not vital for OpenAI anymore. Preventing Altman from creating a dystopian future is a much more responsible task that OpenAI can undertake. reply mitrevf 1 hour agoparentprevThe codebase of an LLM is the size of a high school exam project. There is little to no coding in machine learning. That is the sole reason why they are overvalued - any company can write its own in a flash. You only require hardware to train and inference. reply armcat 57 minutes agorootparentThe final codebase, yes. But ML is not like traditional software engineering. There is a 99% failure rate, so you are forgetting 100s of hours that go into: (1) surveying literature to find that one thing that will give you a boost in performance, (2) hundreds of notebooks in trying various experiments, (3) hundreds of tweaks and hacks with everything from data pre-processing, to fine-tuning and alignment, to tearing up flash attention, (4) beta and user testing, (5) making all this run efficiently on the underlying infra hardware - by means of distillation, quantization, and various other means, (6) actually pipelining all this into something that can be served at hyperscale reply pk-protect-ai 34 minutes agorootparent> you are forgetting 100s of hoursI would say thousands. Even for the hobby projects, - thousands of GPU hours and thousands of research hours a year. reply karmasimida 19 minutes agorootparentprevAnd some luck is needed really. reply andy_ppp 1 hour agorootparentprevIf it&#x27;s so simple why does Chat GPT 4 perform better than almost everything else... reply LeonM 40 minutes agorootparentI&#x27;m not saying it is simple in any way, but I do think part of having a competitive edge in, AI at least at this moment, is having access to ML hardware (AKA: Nvidia silicon).Adding more parameters tends to make the model better. With OpenAI having access to huge capital they can afford &#x27;brute forcing&#x27; a better model. AFAIK right now OpenAI has the most compute power, which would partially explain why GPT4 yields better results than most of the competition.Just having the hardware is not the whole story of course, there is absolutely a lot of innovation and expertise coming from oAI as well. reply Galanwe 43 minutes agorootparentprevYou&#x27;re not really answering the question here.Parent&#x27;s point is that GPT-4 is better because they invested more money (was that ~$60M?) in training infrastructure, not because their core logic is more advanced.I&#x27;m not arguing for one or the other, just restating parent&#x27;s point. reply andy_ppp 17 minutes agorootparentAre you really saying Google can&#x27;t spend $60m or much more to compete? Again if it is so easy as spending money on compute Amazon and Google would have just spent the money by now and Bard would be as good as Chat GPT, but for most things it is not even as good as Chat GPT 3.5. reply pk-protect-ai 3 minutes agorootparentYou should already be aware of the secret sauce of ChatGPT by now: MoE + RLHF. Making MoE profitable is a different story. But, of course, that is not the only part. OpenAI does very obvious things to make GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo better than other models, and this is hidden in the training data. Some of these obvious things have already been discovered, but some of them we just can&#x27;t see yet. However, if you see how close Phind V7 34B is to the quality of GPT-4, you&#x27;ll understand that the gap is not wide enough to eliminate the competition. levidos 23 minutes agorootparentprevDo you have a link to one please? reply karmasimida 51 minutes agorootparentprevTell me you aren&#x27;t in an LLM project without telling me.Data and modeling is so much than just coding. I would wish it is like that, but it is not. The fact it renders this much similarity to alchemy is funny, but unfortunate. reply meetpateltech 8 hours agoprevUpdate on the OpenAI drama: Altman and the board had till 5pm to reach a truce where the board would resign and he and Brockman would return. The deadline has passed and mass resignations expected if a deal isn’t reached ASAPhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;alexeheath&#x2F;status&#x2F;1726055095341875545 reply medler 7 hours agoparentReally weird phrasing in this tweet. The idea is that Altman and&#x2F;or a bunch of employees were demanding the board reinstate Altman and then resign. And they’re calling it a “truce.” Oh, and there’s a deadline (5 pm), but since it’s already passed the board merely has to “reach” this “truce” “ASAP.”Edit: an update to the verge article sheds some more light, but I still consider it very sus since it’s coming from the Altman camp and seems engineered to exert maximal pressure on the board. And the supposed deadline has passed and we haven’t heard any resignations announced> Update, 5:35PM PT: A source close to Altman says the board had agreed in principle to resign and to allow Altman and Brockman to return, but has since waffled — missing a key 5PM PT deadline by which many OpenAI staffers were set to resign.

Non-competes are void. It is one of the few states where non-competes are not legally enforceable. reply sangnoir 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;ll be tough going with no Azure compute contracts, no GPUs, no billions from Microsoft, no training data, OpenAI capturing all of the value from user-generated content resulted in sites like Reddit and Twitter significantly raising the cost to scrape them. reply dabockster 5 hours agorootparentThe same thing got said about Elon Musk and Twitter, and yet X is still somehow alive. reply ivalm 54 minutes agorootparentElon had a massive preexisting AI-compute capacity from Tesla and ann enormous training set from X. That’s very different. reply edgyquant 4 hours agorootparentprevNo nothing similar at all was said about that. Sam Altman is also not Elon Musk reply wesleywt 3 hours agorootparentYeah, Sam will not turn 40billion into 0 billion reply karmasimida 6 hours agorootparentprevNah this is California, that won’t work reply adam_arthur 6 hours agoparentprevPretty incredible incompetence all around if true.From the board for not anticipating a backlash and caving immediately... from Microsoft for investing into an endeavor that is purportedly chartered as non-profit and governed by nobodies who can sink it on a whim. And having 0 hard influence on the direction despite a large ownership stakeWhy bother with a non-profit model that is surreptitiously for profit? The whole structure of OpenAI is largely a facade at this point.Just form a new for profit company and be done with it. Altman&#x27;s direction for profit is fine, but shouldn&#x27;t have been pursued under the loose premise of a non profit.While OpenAI leads currently, there are so many competitors that are within striking distance without the drama. Why keep the baggage?It&#x27;s pretty clear that the best engineering will decide the winners, not the popularity of the CEO. OpenAI has first mover advantage, and perhaps better talent, but not by an order of magnitude. There is no special sauce here.Altman may be charismatic and well connected, but the hero worship put forward on here is really sad and misplaced. reply rurban 2 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s pretty clear that the best engineering will decide the winners, not the popularity of the CEO.This is ML, not Software engineering. Money wins, not engineering. Same as it with Google, which won because they invested massively into edge nodes, winning the ping race (fastest results), not the best results.Ilja can follow Google&#x27;s Bard by holding it back until they have countermodels trained to remove conflicts (\"safety\"), but this will not win them any compute contracts, nor keep them the existing GPU hours. It&#x27;s only mass, not smarts. Ilja lost this one. reply SeanLuke 44 minutes agorootparent> Same as it with Google, which won because they invested massively into edge nodes, winning the ping race (fastest results), not the best results.What in the world are you talking about? Internet search? I remember Inktomi.

Who in their right mind would consider them for a board position now. reply cthalupa 6 hours agorootparentThis is assuming motivations similar to a board for a for-profit company, which the OpenAI board is not.Insisting, no matter how painful, that the organization stays true to the charter could be considered a desirable trait for the board of a non-profit. reply robswc 5 hours agorootparentFair. I don&#x27;t know why they wouldn&#x27;t just come out and say that though, if that were the case. It would be seen as admirable, instead of snake-ish.Instead of \"Sam has been lying to us\" it could have been \"Sam had diverged too far from the original goal, when he did X.\" reply cthalupa 5 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s hard to say. Lots of things don&#x27;t really make sense based on the information we have.They could have meant that Sam had &#x27;not been candid&#x27; about his alignment with commercial interests vs. the charter. reply hilux 17 minutes agorootparentprevA strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess? reply x86x87 6 hours agorootparentprevmy question is: why not both? why not pursue the profit and use that to fuel the research into AGI. seems like a best of both worlds. reply cthalupa 6 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the intent of the arrangement, but there&#x27;s also limits - when that pursuit of profit begins to interfere with the charter of the non-profit, you end up in this situation.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;charter> OpenAI’s mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)—by which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work—benefits all of humanity.My interpretation of events is the board believes that Altman&#x27;s actions have worked against the interest of building an AGI that benefits all of humanity - concentrating access to the AI to businesses could be the issue, or the focus on commercialization of the existing LLMs and chatbot stuff causing conflict with assigning resources to AGI r&d, etc.Of course no one knows for sure except the people directly involved here. reply dabockster 5 hours agorootparent> Of course no one knows for sure except the people directly involved here.The IRS will know soon enough if they were indeed non-profit. reply cthalupa 4 hours agorootparentI was not implying they were not a non-profit. I am saying that we do not know the exact reason why the board fired Altman. replyxivzgrev 6 hours agoparentprevI am just baffled for so many reasons.Why is the board reversing course? They said they lost confidence in Altman - that’s true whether lots of people quit or not. So it was bullshitWhy did the board not foresee people quitting en masse? I’m sure some of it is loyalty to Sam and Greg but it’s also revolting at how they were suddenly firedWhy did the interim CEO not warn Ilya about the above? Sure it’s a promotion but her position is now jeopardized too. Methinks she’s not ready for the big leaguesWho picked this board anyway? I was surprised at how…young they all were. Older people have more life experience and tend not to do rash shit like this. Although the Quora CEO should’ve known better as well. reply cthalupa 6 hours agorootparentFrom what we can see, it looks like the majority of the reporting sources are Altman aligned. Look at how the follow up tweet from this reporter read - the board resigning and the governance structure changing is being called a \"truce\" when it&#x27;s a capitulation.We might get a better understanding of what actually happened here at some point in the future, but I would not currently assume anything we are seeing come out right now is the full truth of the matter. reply VirusNewbie 4 hours agorootparentprevThe board was likely stacked with people who were easily influenced by the big personalities and to check some marks (safety person, academic, demographic etc). reply lewhoo 24 minutes agoparentprevreach a truce where the board would resign and he and Brockman would returnThat&#x27;s a funny use of the word truce. reply pyb 7 hours agoparentprev\"Those responsible for sacking the people who have just been sacked, must be sacked.\" reply hilux 15 minutes agorootparentReminds me of the story of Chinggis Khan&#x27;s burial:\"It&#x27;s also said that after the Khan was laid to rest in his unmarked grave, a thousand horsemen trampled over the area to obscure the grave&#x27;s exact location.

Individual members of the board can be sacked by a quorum of the board, but the board collectively can&#x27;t be sacked.EDIT: Correction:Actually, nonprofits can have a variety of structures defining who the members are that are ultimately in charge. There must be a board, and there may be voting members to whom the board is accountable. The members, however, defined, generally can vote and replace boards members, and so could sack the board.OTOH, I can&#x27;t find any information about OpenAI having voting members beyond the board to whom they are accountable. reply shnkr 6 hours agoparentprevThe board has to stick to the charter. unfortunately employees there wants to align with the profit part when they know they can damn lot of money.. obviously they will be with Altman size. reply 38321003thrw 6 hours agoparentprevThese updates all seem to be coming from one side.

I just mailed my organization&#x27;s RRF-1 a couple of days ago. The author of this post seems to be confused. My organization is on the same fiscal year as OpenAI, and our RRF-1 had to be mailed by November 15th. That explains the supposed \"six month\" delay. Second, if it&#x27;s mailed on November 15th, it might not have even been received yet, let alone processed. This post feels like grasping at straws on the basic facts, setting aside the fact that it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense to imagine a board member filling out the RRF-1 and going \"oh wait, was there financial fraud?\" the morning of November 15th. (That&#x27;s ... not how the world works? Under CA law, any nonprofit with 2M of more in revenue has to undergo an audit, which is typically completed before filling out the 990, and the 990 is a pre-req for submitting the RRF-1. That&#x27;s where you&#x27;d expect to catch this stuff, and the board&#x27;s audit committee would certainly be involved in reviewing the results well in advance.) reply thinkcomp 2 hours agorootparentThe six-month delay is probably due to an automatic extension if you get an extension from the IRS, and also, you can file the form electronically, in which case mail delays are not a problem. But neither of those issues is the point. The point is that the form needed to be filed at all, and representations needed to be made accordingly.OpenAI handled their audit years ago and hasn&#x27;t had another one since according to their filings. So that does not seem like it would have been an issue this year.Take a look at the top of the RRF-1 for the instructions on when it&#x27;s due. Also, the CA AG&#x27;s website says that OpenAI&#x27;s was due on May 15th. They just have been filing six months later each year. reply tsunamifury 6 hours agorootparentprevThis could all be easily covered over with a few billion dollars.

Seems like a lot of these board members have deep ties around various organizations, governmental bodies, etc. and that seems entirely normal and probable. However, prior to chatgpt and dalle we, the public , had only been allowed brief glimpses into the current state of AI (eg Look this robot can sound like a human and book a reservation for you at the restaurant -Google ; look this robot can help you consume media better -many). As a member of the public it went from “oh cool Star Trek idea, maybe we’ll see it one day with flying cars” to “holy crap, I just felt a spark of human connection with a chat program.”So here’s my question, what are the chances that openAI is controlled opposition and Sam never really was supposed to be releasing all this stuff to the public? I remember he was on his Lex podcast appearance and said paraphrasing “so what do you think, should I do it? Should I open source and release it? Tell me to do it and I will.”Ultimately, this is what “the board is focused on trust and safety” mean right? As in safety is SV techno HR PR dribble for go slow, wear a helmet and seatbelt and elbow protectors , never go above 55, give everyone else the right of way because we are in the for the good humanity and we know what’s best. (vs the Altman style of: go fast, double dog dare smart podcast dude to make unprecedented historical decision to open source, be “wild” and let people &#x2F; fate figure some of it out along the way.”)The question of openai’s true purpose being a form of controlled opposition is of course based on my speculation but an honest question for the crowd here. reply x86x87 6 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t buy the whole the board is for safety and Sam is pushing too fast argument.

At the time, he wrote: “I continue to think that work toward general AI (with safety in mind) is both important and underappreciated.” In an interview with Forbes in January, D’Angelo argued that one of OpenAI’s strengths was its capped-profit business structure and nonprofit control. “There’s no outcome where this organization is one of the big five technology companies,” D’Angelo said. “This is something that’s fundamentally different, and my hope is that we can do a lot more good for the world than just become another corporation that gets that big.”Tasha McCauley is an adjunct senior management scientist at RAND Corporation, a job she started earlier in 2023, according to her LinkedIn profile. She previously cofounded Fellow Robots, a startup she launched with a colleague from Singularity University, where she’d served as a director of an innovation lab, and then cofounded GeoSim Systems, a geospatial technology startup where she served as CEO until last year. With her husband Joseph Gorden-Levitt, she was a signer of the Asilomar AI Principles, a set of 23 AI governance principles published in 2017. (Altman, OpenAI cofounder Iyla Sutskever and former board director Elon Musk also signed.)McCauley currently sits on the advisory board of British-founded international Center for the Governance of AI alongside fellow OpenAI director Helen Toner. And she’s tied to the Effective Altruism movement through the Centre for Effective Altruism; McCauley sits on the U.K. board of the Effective Ventures Foundation, its parent organization.Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, joined OpenAI’s board of directors in September 2021. Her role: to think about safety in a world where OpenAI’s creation had global influence. “I greatly value Helen’s deep thinking around the long-term risks and effects of AI,” Brockman said in a statement at the time.More recently, Toner has been making headlines as an expert on China’s AI landscape and the potential role of AI regulation in a geopolitical face-off with the Asian giant. Toner had lived in Beijing in between roles at Open Philanthropy and her current job at CSET, researching its AI ecosystem, per her corporate biography. In June, she co-authored an essay for Foreign Affairs on “The Illusion of China’s AI Prowess” that argued — in opposition to Altman’s cited U.S. Senate testimony — that regulation wouldn’t slow down the U.S. in a race between the two nations.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;alexkonrad&#x2F;2023&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;these-are... reply siruncledrew 4 hours agorootparentThat board is going to face a wrath of shit from Microsoft, Khosla, and other investors.This isn&#x27;t a university department.

Previously the Playground completions allowed using raw GPT which let me unlock some different facets, but they’ve closed that down now.And again, I don’t really need to feed my unique thoughts, opinions, or absurd chat scenarios into a global company trying to create AGI, or have them censor and filter for me. As an AI researcher, I want the uncensored model to play with along with no data leaving my network.The uses of LLMs for information retrieval are great (Bing has improved alot) but the much more interesting cases for me are how they are able to parse nuance, tone, and subtext - imagine a computer that can understand feelings and respond in kind.

JPMC or Apple have other clouds they can viably move to - OpenAI might not have anyone else that can meet their needs on short notice.I think the situation is tough because I can&#x27;t imagine there aren&#x27;t legal agreements in place around what OpenAI has to do to access the funding tranches and compute power, but who knows if they are in a position to force the issue, or if I&#x27;m write in my supposition to begin with. Even if I am, a protracted legal battle where they don&#x27;t have access to compute resources, particularly if they can&#x27;t get an injunction, might be extremely deleterious to OpenAI.Perhaps Microsoft even knows that they will take a bath on things if they follow this, but don&#x27;t want to gain a reputation of allowing this sort of thing to happen - they are big enough to take a total bath on the OpenAI side of things and it not be anything close to a fatal blow.I was more skeptical of this being the case last night, but less so now. reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentBut why would Microsoft do anything to hurt their business in any way?

Why does anyone actually use azure in 2023?) being surprised by structural business decisions in their most important partner is shocking, and I think if I were the CEO of Microsoft I would be furious at being shocked more than pining in some weird Altman bromance. reply lazyasciiart 7 hours agorootparent> Why does anyone actually use azure in 2023?When I see it, it has always been “Amazon is a competitor and we don’t buy from competitors”. reply qwytw 7 hours agorootparentprev> I would be furious at being shocked more than pining in some weird Altman bromance.Hypothetically he might also have very little trust in the decision making abilities of the new management and how much their future goals will align with those of Microsoft. reply ribosometronome 7 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft finally has a leg up on Google in the public eye and they&#x27;re gonna toss it away for Sam Altman?

So to fire him, wouldn&#x27;t the non-profit board be acting in it&#x27;s capacity as a director of the for-profit entity (and thus have a fiduciary duty to all shareholders of the for-profit entity)? Non-profit governance is traditionally lax, but would the other shareholders have a case against the members of the non-profit board for acting recklessly w&#x2F; respect to shareholder interests in their capacity as directors of the for-profit?This corporate structure is so convoluted that it&#x27;s difficult to figure out what the actual powers&#x2F;obligations of the individual agents involved are.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;our-structure reply cthalupa 8 hours agorootparentLLCs do not require rights be assigned fairly to all shareholders if the operating agreement and by-laws say otherwise. This is the case with OpenAI, where the operating agreement effectively makes the fiduciary duty of the for-profit the accomplishment of the non-profit&#x27;s charter. The pinkish purpleish block of text on the page you linked goes into more detail here.(Remember, fiduciary does not necessarily have anything to do with money) reply Infinitesimus 9 hours agorootparentprev> A non profit board absolutely calls the shots at a non profit, in so far as the CEO and their employment goes. Non profit boards are not beholden, structurally, to investors and there are no shareholders.There is theory and there is reality. If someone is paying your bills by an outsized amount and they say jump, you will say how high.The influence is rarely that explicit though. The board knowing that X investor provides 60% of their funding, for instance, means the board is incentivized to do things that keep X investor happy without X having to ask for it.9 times out of 10, money drives decisions in a captilist environment reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentOpenAI hasn’t received much funding from Microsoft or other investors, and is profitable already with no lack of interested suitors for funding and partnership.

But who is going to pay for the operation and salaries of its employees.Definitely not OpenAI itself. They still need massive capital. With this drama, its future is put in serious doubt reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentThe board can and does claim it because it is legally a non profit. There is no wishy washy space this isn’t true in. Sam Altman isn’t the source of their funds, regardless. Finally, OpenAI has a pretty successful business model already without outside investment, and without sam or with sam they will not have trouble accessing customers or investors should they need it, even from Microsoft. Let’s be real Altman isn’t OpenAI. reply Terretta 10 hours agorootparentprev> No stakeholder would walk away from OpenAI for want of sam Altman. They don’t license OpenAI technology or provide funding for his contribution. They do it to get access to GPT4. There is no comparable competitor available.The implication in Microsoft&#x27;s statement is clear that they have what they need to use the tech. I read it to mean OpenAI board does not have leverage. reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentMicrosoft has licensing rights to OpenAI tech. They do not “have it” in the sense they control it. reply lordfrito 7 hours agorootparentWell I read Nadella threatened to turn off OpenAI&#x27;s servers, so yeah, Microsoft does in fact control it.Not your premises not your compute? reply airstrike 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is not just a \"non-profit\"... it&#x27;s a non-profit that owns a $90B for-profit company developing revolutionary, once-in-a-century technology. There is a LOT of money at play here.Others have commented on how Microsoft actually has access to the IP, so the odds that they could pack their toys and rebuild OpenAI 2.0 somewhere else with what they&#x27;ve learned, their near infinite capital and not have to deal with the non-profit shenanigans are meaningful.I&#x27;m not saying Sam is needed to make OpenAI what it is, but he&#x27;s definitely \"the investors&#x27; guy\" in the organization, based on what has surfaced over the last 24 hours. Those investors would rather have him there over someone else, hence the pressure to put him back. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you and I think he&#x27;s the man for the job -- what matters is whether investors think they are.TL;DR the board thinks they have leverage, but as it turns out, they don&#x27;t reply fnordpiglet 10 hours agorootparentMicrosoft doesn’t have ownership rights to OpenAI IP. They license it. They can’t pack up anything as they just have an IAM and billing model on top of GPT4 they use to resell OpenAI tech. reply sainez 6 hours agorootparent> Microsoft doesn’t have ownership rights to OpenAI IP. They license it.Honest question, do you have a source for that? Is it conceivable that Microsoft has some clause that grants them direct access to IP if OpenAI does not meet certain requirements. It is difficult to believe that Microsoft handed over $10B without any safeguards in place. Surely they did their due diligence on OpenAI&#x27;s corporate structure. reply braiamp 1 hour agorootparentOpenAI for-profit main purpose is to fulfill the desires of the non-profit. If there&#x27;s a contract that goes against that, the contract would be void if necessary or that stipulation just crossed out. reply fulladder 6 hours agorootparentprevI would expect that Microsoft would have negotiated terms like a perpetual license to the IP, given that they were the main investor and were in a strong negotiating position.Microsoft has a lot of experience interacting with small companies, including in situations like this one where the small company implodes. The people there know how to protect Microsoft&#x27;s interests in such scenarios, and they definitely are aware that such things can happen. reply vitorgrs 9 hours agorootparentprevNot really. They run custom GPT model lol reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentNot one they own they don’t. OpenAI owns all of the GPT IP. Microsoft has a licensing arrangement with OpenAI. I’d note that azure GPT is not a custom model, only the bing chat is custom. And even the customizations aren’t owned by Microsoft. reply qaq 10 hours agorootparentprevSo they are trying to backtrack which makes them look pretty foolish for no apparent reason ? reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentI didn’t see any actual evidence of that other than speculation and outside and uninvolved investors advocating for him in the article.

It is that bad. reply icelancer 9 hours agorootparentprev> A non profit board absolutely calls the shots at a non profit...Doesn&#x27;t look like it right now in this case. reply fnordpiglet 8 hours agorootparentBecause of a news article saying a prior VC firm is pushing to reinstate sam or fund his new venture and didn’t care which way it goes? That’s not a lot to hang your hat on. They legally have every right to do what they did and no one can force them to change their mind under any circumstance. They might choose to, but OpenAI has all the cards. Sam Altman is a talking head, and if they churn some senior folks, OpenAI has the technology and brand to replace them. If I were the OpenAI board, I would be sleeping like a baby, especially if sam were acting out of sync with the charter of the non profit. I imagine his antics caused a lot of stress the further they drifted from their mission and the more he acted autonomously. reply jacquesm 9 hours agoparentprevThis is wildly incorrect. But a non-profit does have stakeholders, donors, beneficiaries and employees. All of those can apply pressure on a board. reply airstrike 8 hours agorootparent> This is wildly incorrectGreat, we&#x27;ll take your word for it. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentSorry, but you are just simply factually incorrect. That the board itself serves at the pleasure of other interests is clear (and even then, if they don&#x27;t want to leave getting rid of them can be tricky depending on the details) but they do call the shots. The question is whether or not they can make it stick.But until he is re-hired Sam Altman is to all intents and purposes fired. And it may well come to that (and that would almost certainly require all those board members who voted for his ouster to vacate their positions because their little coup plan backfired and nobody is going to take the risk of that happening again, especially not in this way). reply airstrike 7 hours agorootparentSorry, but I am just simply not factually incorrect. Again you want me to just take your opinion as fact... but stating it strongly doesn&#x27;t make your argument more cogent.Boards are agents to their principals. They call the shots only as long as their principals deem them to be calling them correctly. If they don&#x27;t, they get replaced. Said differently, board members are \"appointed\" to do the bidding of someone else. They have no inherent power. Therefore, they do not, ultimately, call the final shots. Owners do. Like I said, this situation is a little muddier because it&#x27;s a non-profit that owns a for-profit company, so there&#x27;s an added layer of complexity between agents and principals.OpenAI isn&#x27;t worth $90B because of its non-profit. The for-profit piece is what matters to investors, and those investors are paying the bills. Sure, the non-profit board can fire Altman and carry on with their mission, but then everyone who is there \"for profit\" can also pack up their things and start OpenAI 2.0 where they no longer need the non-profit, and investors will follow them. I assume that&#x27;s an undesirable outcome for the board as I suspect the amount of money raised at the for-profit level dwarfs the amount donated to the non-profit... which effectively means the for-profit shareholders own the company. Hence my original comment. reply jacquesm 6 hours agorootparentThey call the shots until they are overruled (by a court, or by a new board after the board members have been forced out and that isn&#x27;t all that simple otherwise no board could ever function in their oversight role in a non-profit), and even then until that process has run its course their statements are factually correct. I know this is all hairsplitting but it really does matter. When the board put out a statement saying they had fired Altman that was that. They can re-hire him or they can reverse their decision but until that happens their decision stands.Yes, they are accountable (and I&#x27;m actually surprised at how many people seem to believe that they are not), but they are not without power. Legal and practical are not always exactly overlapping and even if the board may not ultimately hold practical power (even if they believe they do) legally speaking they do and executives function at the pleasure of the board. If the board holds a vote and the bylaws of the company allow for it and the vote passes according to those bylaws then that&#x27;s that. That&#x27;s one good reason to pack the board of your billions of dollars worth company with seasoned people because otherwise stuff like this may happen.Afterwards you can do a lot about it, you can contest the vote, you can fight it in court, you can pressure board members to step down and you can sue for damage to the company based on the decision. But the board has still made a decision that is in principle a done deal. They can reverse their decision, they can yield to outside pressure and they can be overruled by a court. But you can&#x27;t pretend it didn&#x27;t happen and you can&#x27;t ignore it. replyblazespin 8 hours agoparentprevThe staff calls the shots.

That’s what it looks like when the board is absolutely furious and pushes whatever buttons inflict the most pain on you.Ironic that it’s a bit of an auto-antonym (auto-antoidiom?), it’s ceremonious when they want you to go away quietly and it’s unceremonious when they publicly kick your ass to the curb so hard you’ve got boot marks for a week. reply maxlamb 7 hours agorootparentprevHow? reply x86x87 7 hours agorootparentoff the top of my head:prolonged public exchange between sama and the board _before_ any firings where they throw accusations at each other followed by microsoft pulling out, followed by people quitting and immediately resulting in a chatgpt outage. followed by the firing of the ceo reply shapefrog 1 hour agorootparentprevCould have done it with poop emojis on twitter reply karmasimida 9 hours agorootparentprevNot like the board, except Ilya has some real capital or expertise to convince everyone this is the right decision.If they do, it is the perfect time to speak out loud, not letting this news bubbling up to the front page and everyone is talking about how disastrous they were?What is this board waiting then?

    "originBody": "Things fall apart — Details emerge of surprise board coup that ousted CEO Sam Altman at OpenAI Microsoft CEO \"furious\"; OpenAI President and 3 researchers resign. COO says \"No malfeasance.\" Benj Edwards - Updated 11/18/2023, 2:24 PM Enlarge / Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI Chief Scientist, speaks at Tel Aviv University on June 5, 2023. Getty Images reader comments 295 with On Friday, OpenAI fired CEO Sam Altman in a surprise move that led to the resignation of President Greg Brockman and three senior scientists. The move also blindsided key investor and minority owner Microsoft, reportedly making CEO Satya Nadella furious. As Friday night wore on, reports emerged that the ousting was likely orchestrated by Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever over concerns about the safety and speed of OpenAI's tech deployment. Further Reading OpenAI President Greg Brockman quits as shocked employees hold all-hands meeting \"This was the board doing its duty to the mission of the nonprofit, which is to make sure that OpenAI builds AGI that benefits all of humanity,\" Sutskever told employees at an emergency all-hands meeting on Friday afternoon, as reported by The Information. Since its founding, OpenAI has pursued the development of artificial general intelligence (or AGI), which is a hypothetical technology that would be able to perform any intellectual task a human can do, potentially replacing a large number of humans at their jobs. Internally at OpenAI, insiders say that disagreements had emerged over the speed at which Altman was pushing for commercialization and company growth, with Sutskever arguing to slow things down. Sources told reporter Kara Swisher that OpenAI's Dev Day event on November 6, with Altman front and center in a keynote pushing consumer-like products, was an \"inflection moment of Altman pushing too far, too fast.\" In a joint statement released Friday night, Altman and Brockman said they were \"shocked and saddened\" by the board's actions. And they weren't the only ones shocked by the news, as tech insiders took to social media on Friday to share their reactions. Angel investor Ron Conway wrote, \"What happened at OpenAI today is a Board coup that we have not seen the likes of since 1985 when the then-Apple board pushed out Steve Jobs. It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI.\" OpenAI has an unusual structure where its for-profit arm is owned and controlled by a non-profit 501(c)(3) public charity. Prior to yesterday, that non-profit was controlled by a board of directors that included Altman, Brockman, Ilya Sutskever and three others who were not OpenAI employees: Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora; Tasha McCauley, an adjunct senior management scientist at RAND corporation; and Helen Toner, director of strategy and foundational research grants at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Now, only Sutskever, D'Angelo, McCauley, and Toner remain. Advertisement Enlarge / A block diagram of OpenAI's unusual structure, provided by OpenAI. OpenAI Surprise moves and turmoil According to the joint statement from Brockman and Altman, Altman's firing came as a complete surprise to the pair, and they laid out a rough timeline of what happened. On Thursday night, Altman was asked to attend a remote board meeting on Friday at noon. The next day, Brockman, who was Chairman of the OpenAI board, was not invited to this board meeting, where Altman was fired. Further Reading OpenAI fires CEO Sam Altman, citing less than “candid” communications Around 30 minutes later, Brockman was informed by Sutskever that he was being removed from his board role but could remain at the company, and that Altman had been fired (Brockman declined, and resigned his role later on Friday). According to Brockman, the OpenAI management team was only made aware of these moves shortly after the fact, but former CTO (now interim CEO) Mira Murati had been informed on Thursday night. Key questions remain about accusations made against Altman in the OpenAI blog post that announced his departure, where the board said that Altman \"was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\" That has yet to be clarified by the company, but insiders say the move was mostly a power play that resulted from a cultural schism between Altman and Sutskever over Altman's management style and drive for high-profile publicity. On September 29, Sutskever tweeted, \"Ego is the enemy of growth.\" Enlarge / Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever speak together at Tel Aviv University on June 5, 2023. Getty Images The schism is causing further turmoil on the inside. Three AI researchers loyal to Altman departed the company as well on Friday, resigning in reaction to the news: Jakub Pachocki, GPT-4 lead and OpenAI's director of research; Aleksander Madry, head of a team evaluating AI risk, and Szymon Sidor, an open source baselines researcher. Pushing back the \"veil of ignorance\" Rumors have already begun swirling about potential internal breakthroughs at OpenAI that may have intensified the slow/fast rift within the company, owing to Sutskever's role as co-lead of a \"Superalignment\" team that is tasked with figuring out how to control hypothetical superintelligent AI. At the APEC CEO Summit on Thursday, Altman said, \"Four times now in the history of OpenAI—the most recent time was just in the last couple of weeks—I’ve gotten to be in the room when we push the veil of ignorance back and the frontier of discovery forward. And getting to do that is like the professional honor of a lifetime.\" Advertisement Further Reading OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wants to build AI “superintelligence” The concern here not necessarily being that OpenAI has developed superintelligence, which experts say is unlikely, but that the new breakthrough Altman mentioned may have added pressure to a company that is fighting within itself to proceed safely (from its non-profit branch) but also make money (from its for-profit subsidiary). Altman also recently said that GPT-5, presumed to be a powerful successor to the alarm-causing GPT-4, is now in development. As news spread, some predictably shared quips on social media. X user shaurya wrote, \"this is like the roman empire for people who do matrix multiplication.\" And AI futurist Daniel Jeffries said, \"The entire AI industry would like to thank the OpenAI board for giving us all a chance to catch up.\" But not all reactions were doom and gloom. As Friday night wore on, some at OpenAI made forward-looking statements. Evan Morikawa, Engineering Manager at OpenAI wrote on X, \"For those wondering what’ll happen next, the answer is we’ll keep shipping. @sama & @gdb weren’t micro-managers. The ✨ comes from the many geniuses here in research product eng & design. There’s clear internal uniformity among these leaders that we’re here for the bigger mission.\" Expect to hear more on the OpenAI board's side of the story as further details emerge. Update: 11/18/2023 - 2:30 PM Eastern \"Decision not made in response to malfeasance\" An internal memo written by OpenAI chief operating officer Brad Lightcap obtained by Axios says that the board's decision to fire Altman \"was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices. This was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board.\" The memo states that the announcement to fire Altman \"took all of us by surprise,\" and that Lightcap has made efforts to better understand \"the reasons and process behind their decision.\" \"I'm sure you all are feeling confusion, sadness, and perhaps some fear,\" Lightcap writes. \"We are fully focused on handling this, pushing toward resolution and clarity, and getting back to work. Our collective responsibility right now is to our teammates, partners, users, customers, and the broader world who shares our vision of broadly beneficial AGI. Hang in there, we are behind you all 1000%.\" After reassuring staff that the company's position remains strong and expressing support for Mira Murati as interim CEO, he states, \"We still share your concerns about how the process has been handled, are working to resolve the situation, and will provide updates as we're able.\" reader comments 295 with Benj Edwards Benj Edwards is an AI and Machine Learning Reporter for Ars Technica.

It is shocking; it is irresponsible; and it does not do right by Sam & Greg or all the builders in OpenAI.\"With all sympathy and empathy for Sam and Greg, whose dreams took a blow, I want to say something about investors [edit: not Ron Conway in particular, whom I don&#x27;t know; see the comment below about Conway]: The board&#x27;s job is not to do right by &#x27;Sam & Greg&#x27;, but to do right by OpenAI. When mangement lays off 10,000 employees, the investors congratulate management. And if anyone objects to the impact on the employees, they justify it with the magic words that somehow cancel all morality and humanity - &#x27;it&#x27;s business&#x27; - and call you an unserious bleeding heart. But when the investor&#x27;s buddy CEO is fired ...I think that&#x27;s wrong and that they should also take into account the impact on employees. But CEOs are commanders on the business battlefield; they have great power over the company&#x27;s outcomes, which are the reasons for the layoffs&#x2F;firings. Lower-ranking employees are much closer to civilians, and also often can&#x27;t afford to lose the job. reply threeseed 13 hours agoparent> The board&#x27;s job is not to do rightThere is why you do something. And there is how you do something.OpenAI is well within its rights to change strategy even as bold as from a profit-seeking behemoth to a smaller research focused team. But how they went about this is appalling, unprofessional and a blight on corporate governance.They have blind-sided partners (e.g. Satya is furious), split the company into two camps and have let Sam and Greg go angry and seeking retribution. Which in turn now creates the threat that a for-profit version of OpenAI dominates the market with no higher purpose.For me there is no justification for how this all happened. reply HAL3000 12 hours agorootparentAs someone who has orchestrated two coups in different organizations, where the leadership did not align with the organization&#x27;s interests and missions, I can assure you that the final stage of such a coup is not something that can be executed after just an hour of preparation or thought. It requires months of planning. The trigger is only pulled when there is sufficient evidence or justification for such action. Building support for a coup takes time and must be justified by a pattern of behavior from your opponent, not just a single action. Extensive backchanneling and one-on-one discussions are necessary to gauge where others stand, share your perspective, demonstrate how the person in question is acting against the organization&#x27;s interests, and seek their support. Initially, this support is not for the coup, but rather to ensure alignment of views. Then, when something significant happens, everything is already in place. You&#x27;ve been waiting for that one decisive action to pull the trigger, which is why everything then unfolds so quickly. reply emptysongglass 10 hours agorootparentHow are you still hireable?

And the concentration of power in the nonprofit side was also very well known. From the media coverage of Microsoft&#x27;s investments, it sounds as if MSFT prioritized getting lots of business for its Azure cloud service -- and didn&#x27;t prioritize getting a board seat or even an observer&#x27;s chair. reply adastra22 7 hours agorootparentSure, but Microsoft could also walk away today and leave OpenAI high and dry. They hold ALL the power here. reply dragonwriter 5 hours agorootparentMicrosoft terminating the agreement by which they supply compute to OpenAI and OpenAI licenses technology to them would be an existential risk to OpenAI (though other competing cloud providers might step in and fill the gap Microsoft created under similar terms), but -- whether or not OpenAI ended up somewhere else immediately (the tech eventually would, even if OpenAI failed completely and was dissolved) Microsoft would go from the best positioned enterprise AI cloud provider to very far behind overnight.And while that might hurt OpenAI as an institution more than it hurts Microsoft as an institution, the effect on Microsoft&#x27;s top decision-makers personally vs. OpenAI&#x27;s top decisionmakers seems likely to be the other way around. reply adastra22 4 hours agorootparentNot if they invested in Sam’s new startup, under agreeable profit-focused terms this time, and all the OpenAI talent (minus Ilya) followed. reply dragonwriter 4 hours agorootparentAt best, that might enable them to eventually come back, once new products are built from scratch, but that takes non-zero time. reply adastra22 3 hours agorootparentNon-zero time, but not a lot either. Main hangup would be acquiring data for training, as their engineers would remember the parameters for GPT-4 and Microsoft would provide the GPUs.

On the models, the training data, the GPT4 licenses, etc. Their Achilles heel is the compute which Microsoft will pull out. Khosla Ventures and Sequoia may sell their Open AI stakes at a discount, but I&#x27;m sure either Google or Amazon will snap it up.All Sam and Greg really have is the promise of building a successful competitor, with a big backing from Microsoft and Softbank, while OpenAI is the orphan child with the huge estate. Microsoft isn&#x27;t exactly the kingmaker here. reply peyton 2 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t sound like Sutskever is running anything.

I don&#x27;t see Sam and Greg working with him under the same roof after this fiasco, since he voted them out (he could have been the tiemaker vote). replyhfjjbf 11 hours agorootparentprevThey loved to trot out the “mission” as a reason to trust a for-profit entity with the tech.Well, this is proof the mission isn’t just MBA bullshit, clearly Ilya is actually committed to it.This is like if Larry and Sergei never decided to progressively nerf “don’t be evil” as they kept accumulating wealth, they would have had to stage a coup as well. But they didn’t, they sacrificed the mission for the money.Good for Ilya. reply calf 11 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if there&#x27;s a specific term or saying for that, maybe \"projection\" or \"self-victimization\" but not quite: when one person biasedly frames that other people were responsible for a bad thing, when it is they yourself that were doing the very thing in the first place.

Ilya seems to think transformers could make AGI and they need to be careful? Sam said what? \"We need to make better LLMs to make more money.\"? My general thought is that whatever architecture gets you to AGI, you don&#x27;t prevent it from killing everyone by chaining it better, you prevent that by training it better, and then treating it like someone with intrinsic value.

Or are they so confident that they think it’s not a real threat? reply ehnto 7 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think it has to be unfettered progress that Ilya is slowing down for. I could imagine there is a push to hook more commercial capabilities up to the output of the models, and it could be that Ilya doesn&#x27;t think they are competent&#x2F;safe enough for that.I think danger from AGI often presumes the AI has become malicious, but the AI making mistakes while in control of say, industrial machinery, or weapons, is probably the more realistic present concern.Early adoption of these models as controllers of real world outcomes is where I could see such a disagreement becoming suddenly urgent also. reply DebtDeflation 11 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think the issue was a technical difference of opinion regarding whether transformers alone were needed or other architectures required. It seems the split was over speed of commercialization and Sam&#x27;s recent decision to launch custom GPTs and a ChatGPT Store. IMO, the board miscalculated.

You end up with board members that have all been there, done that, and can truly guide the management on the challenges they face.OpenAI&#x27;s hypergrowth meant it didn’t have the time to do that. So the board that was great for a $100 million, even a billion $ startup falls completely flat for 90x the size.I don’t have faith in their ability to know what is best for OpenAI. These are uncharted waters for anyone though. This is an exceptionally big non-profit with the power to change the world - quite literally. reply roguecoder 12 hours agorootparentWhy do you think someone who could be CEO of a $100 million company would be qualified to run a billion dollar company?Not providing this kind of oversight is how we get disasters like FTX and WeWork. reply deepGem 7 hours agorootparentprev\"And there is how you do something\"Sorry I don&#x27;t see the &#x27;how&#x27; as necessarily appalling.The less appalling alternative could have been weeks of discussions and the board asking for Sam&#x27;s resignation to preserve the decorum of the company.

The tricky part is that board started a second for profit company with VC investors who are co-owners.

If you have people sign a contract that says the mission comes first, but also give them profit sharing stocks, and cap those profits at 1.1 Trillion, it is bound to cause some conflicts of interest in reality, even if it is clear who calls the shots when deciding how to balance the mission and profit reply cthalupa 11 hours agorootparentThere might be some conflict of interest but the resolution to those conflicts is clear: The mission comes first.OpenAI employees might not like it and it might drive them to leave, but they entered into this agreement with a full understanding that the structure has always been in place to prioritize the non-profit&#x27;s charter. reply ffgjgf1 11 hours agorootparent> The mission comes first.Which might only be possible with future funding?

First off, if open AI can&#x27;t get it done with 11 billion plus whatever Revenue, they probably won&#x27;t. Second, the way the for-profit is set up, it may not matter how much Microsoft owns, because the nonprofit keeps 100% of the control. Seems like that&#x27;s the deal that Microsoft signed.

Or to carry on as before but with onerous reporting requirements. The board dumped him with unusual haste and an almost unprecedented attack on his integrity instead. A lot of people are reading the room rather than hyperliterally focusing on the exact words used.If I take the time to accuse my boss of failing to be candid instead of thanking him in my resignation letter or exit interview, I&#x27;m not saying I think he could have communicated better, I&#x27;m saying he&#x27;s a damned liar, and my letter isn&#x27;t sent for the public to speculate on.Whether the board were justified in concluding Sam was untrustworthy is another question, but they&#x27;ve been willing to burn quite a lot of reputation on signalling that. reply pdntspa 12 hours agorootparent> hyperliterally focusing on the exact words used.Business communication is never, ever forthright.

The Dev Day announcements, and especially the marketplace, can be seen as suggesting that&#x27;s exactly what was happening at OpenAI.I don&#x27;t think everyone there wants them to be selling cool LLM toys, especially not on a \"make fast and break things\" approach and with an ecosystem of startup hackers operationalizing it.

But that would prove that the board was out of touch with what the company was doing. If the board sees anything new on &#x27;dev day&#x27; that means they haven&#x27;t been doing their job in the first place. reply cthalupa 11 hours agorootparentUnless seeing something new on dev day is exactly what they meant by Altman not being consistently candid. reply jacquesm 11 hours agorootparentIf Altman was doing something that ran directly against the mission of OpenAI in a way that all of the other stuff that OpenAI has been doing so far did not then I haven&#x27;t seen it. OpenAI has been off-script for a long time now (compared to what they originally said) and outwardly it seemed the board was A-Ok with that.Now we either see a belated - and somewhat erratic - response to all that went before or there is some smoking gun. If there isn&#x27;t they have just done themselves an immense disservice.

The Forbes article makes it sound like there is significant investment pressure in trying to get Altman back on board, and they likely have access to the board. It could very well be that the board themselves have no desire to bring Altman back, but these conversations ended up being the origin for the story that they did.It&#x27;s also possible that the structure of the non-profit&#x2F;for-profit&#x2F;operating agreement&#x2F;etc. just isn&#x27;t strong enough to achieve the intent and the investors have the strangehold in reality.If I was invested in the mission statement of OpenAI I don&#x27;t think I would view the reinstatement of Altman as a good thing, though. Thankfully my interest in all of this is purely entertainment. reply jacquesm 9 hours agorootparentProvided a good enough reason there were many ways in which the board could have fired Altman without making waves. They utterly f&#x27;d that up, and even if their original reasons were good the way they went about it made those reasons moot. They may have to re-instate Altman for optical reasons alone at this point and it would still be a net win. What an incredible shit show. reply true_religion 8 hours agorootparentI don’t really see the point in not making waves. OpenAi is not a public company.Optics and the like don’t really matter as much if you’re not a for profit company trying to chase down investors and customers. So long as OpenAi continues to be able to do research, it’s enough to fulfill their charter. reply jacquesm 8 hours agorootparentOpenAI is not a public company but it does have a commercial arm and that commercial arm has shareholders and customers. You don&#x27;t do damage to such a constellation without a really good reason (if only because minority shareholder lawsuits are a thing, and acting in a way that damages their interests tends to have bad consequences if they haven&#x27;t been given the opportunity to lodge their objections). To date no reason has been given that stands up to scrutiny given the incredibly unexpected firing of Sam Altman. It is of course possible that such a reason exists but if they haven&#x27;t made it public by now then my guess it that it was a powerplay much more than some kind of firing offense and given Sam&#x27;s position it would take a grave error, something that damaged OpenAI&#x27;s standing more than the firing itself to justify it.Optics matter a lot, even for non-profits, especially for non-profits nominally above a for-profit. Check out their corporate org chart to see how it all hangs together and then it may make more sense:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openai.com&#x2F;our-structureEach of the boxes where the word &#x27;investor&#x27; or &#x27;employee&#x27; is present would have standing to sue if the OpenAI board of directors of the non-profit would act against their interests. That may not work out in the long run but in the short term that could be immensely distracting and it could even affect board members privately. reply tim333 10 hours agorootparentprevAltman, Brockman and Nadella all say they didn&#x27;t know in advance. reply eganist 9 hours agorootparentNot sure why Satya would be privy to this disagreement let alone admit it if he is, and I&#x27;d assume Altman and Brockman would be incentivized to provide their own perspective (just as Ilya would) to represent events in the best possible light for themselves.At this level of execution, words are another tool in their toolbox. reply justaj 12 hours agorootparentprevMy guess is that if Sam would have found this out before being fired, he would have done his best not to be fired.As such, it would have been much more of a challenge to shift OpenAI&#x27;s supposed over-focus on commerce towards a supposed non-profit focus. reply kelipso 13 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m guessing Altman had a bunch of experienced ML researchers writing CRUD apps and LLM toys instead of actual AI research and they weren&#x27;t too happy. Personally I would be pissed as a researcher if the company took a turn and started in on improved marketing blurbs LLMs or whatever. reply bertil 9 hours agorootparentI would be shocked if that was the case.There are plenty of people I know from FAANG, now at OpenAI, where they do product design, operation, and DevOps at scale —all complicated, valuable, and worthwhile endeavors in their own right— that don’t need to get in the way of research. They are just the kind of talent that can operate a business with 90% margins to pay for that research.Could there be requests or internal projects that are less exciting for some people?

Even if we can address the former by say regime change, the latter issue remains: the domain is technical and cognitively demanding. Thus the practitioners will generally sound sane and rational (they are smart people but that is no guarantee of anything other than technical abilities) and non-technical policy types (like most of the remaining board members at openAI) are practically compelled to take policy positions based either on ‘abstract models’ (which may be incorrect) or as after the fact reaction to observation of the mechanisms (which may be too late).The thought occurs that it is quite possible that just like humanity is really not ready (we remain concerned) to live with WMD technologies, it is possible that we have again stumbled on another technology that taxes our ethical, moral, educational, political, and economic understanding. We would be far less concerned if we were part of a civilization of generally thoughtful and responsible specimens but we’re not. This is a cynical appraisal of the situation, I realize, but tldr is “it is a systemic problem”. reply cmrdporcupine 13 hours agorootparentIn the end my concern comes down to that those who rise to power in our society are those who are best at playing the capitalist game. That&#x27;s mostly, I guess, fine if what they&#x27;re doing is being most efficient making cars or phones or grocery store chains or whatever.Making intelligent machines? Colour me disturbed.Let me ask you this re: \"the domain is technical and cognitively demanding\" -- do you think Sam Altman (or a Steve Jobs, Peter Thiel, etc.) would pass a software engineer technical interview at e.g. Google? (Not saying those interviews are perfect, they suck, but we&#x27;ll use that as a gatekeeper for now.). I&#x27;m betting the answer is quite strongly \"no.\"So the selection criterion here is not the ability to perform technically. Unless we&#x27;re redefining technical. Which leaves us with \"intellectually demanding\" and \"smart\", which, well, frankly also applies to lawyers, politicians, etc.My worry is right now that the farther you go up at any of these organizations, the more the kind of intelligence and skills trends towards the \"is good at manipulating and convincing others\" kind of spectrum vs the \"is good at manipulating and convincing machines\" kind of spectrum. And it is into the former that we&#x27;re concentrating more and more power.(All that said, it does seem like Sutskever would definitely pass said interview, and he&#x27;s likely much smarter than I am. But I remain unconvined that that kind of smarts is the kind of smarts that should be making governance-of-humanity decisions)As terrible as politicians and various \"abstract model\" applying folks might be, at least they are nominally subject to being voted out of power.Democracy isn&#x27;t a great system for producing excellence.But as a citizen I&#x27;ll take it over a \"meritocracy\" which is almost always run by bullshitters.What we need is accountability and legitimacy and the only way we&#x27;ve found to produce on a mass society level is through democratic institutions. reply pdonis 5 hours agorootparent> What we need is accountability and legitimacy and the only way we&#x27;ve found to produce on a mass society level is through democratic institutions.The problem is that our democratic institutions are not doing a good job of producing accountability and legitimacy.

Sure, in theory we can vote the politicians out of power, but in practice that never happens: Congress has incumbent reelection rates in the 90s.The unfortunate truth is that nobody is really qualified to be making governance-of-humanity decisions. The real problem is that we have centralized power so much in governments and megacorporations that the few elites at the top end up making decisions that impact everyone even though they aren&#x27;t qualified to do it.

Horrible, ultimately he was ousted as CEO, only to be allowed to stay on as some head of innovation, because he and his founder buddies retained enough voting power to first get him a life time position as head of the board fir his \"acievements\" and then prevent his firing. They also vetoed, from ehat people told, a juicy acquisition offer, basically jeopardizing the future of the place. Right after, a new CEO was recruited as the result of a \"lengthy and thoroughly planned process of transition\". Now, the former CEO is back, and in charge, in fact and noz on paper, of the most crucial part of the product. Besides getting said company to 800 people burning a sweet billion, he didn&#x27;t do anything else in his life, and that company has yet to launch a product.Sad thing so, if they find enough people to continue investing, they will ultimately launch a product, most likely the early employees and founders will sell of their shares, become instant millionaires in the three figures and be hailed as thebtrue geniuses in their field...

But he kept making a shit ton of money, without a doubt.After they get one position in that echelon, they can keep failing upwards ad nauseam.I don&#x27;t get the cult part though.

Film directors are insane with the amount of technical, artistic, and people knowledge that they need to have and be able to utilize. The amount of stuff that a film director needs to manage, all on the ground, is insane. I wouldn&#x27;t say that for CEOs, not by a long shot. CEOs mainly sit in meetings with people reporting things to them and then the CEO providing very high-level guidance. That is very different from a director&#x27;s role.I have often thought that we don&#x27;t have enough information on how film directors operate, as I feel it could yield a lot of insight. There&#x27;s probably a reason why many film directors don&#x27;t hit their stride until late 30s and 40s, presumably because it takes those one or two decades to build the appropriate experience and knowledge. reply dagmx 7 hours agorootparentI mean a film director and I disagree with your assessment that they have to be savvy in many fields. Many of the directors whose projects I’ve worked on are very much not savvy outside their narrow needs of directing talent and relying on others like the DoP or VFX Supervisor , editors etc to do their job.In fact most movie productions don’t even have the director involved with story. Many are just directors for hire and assigned by the studio to scripts.Of course there are exceptions but they are the rarities.And the big reason directors don’t hit their big strides till later is movies take a long time to make and it’s hard to work your way up there unless you start as an indie darling. But even as an indie, let’s say you start at 20, your film would likely come out by the time you’re 22-24 based on average production times. You’d only be able to do 2 or 3 films by 30, and in many cases would be put on studio assignments till you get enough clout to do what you want. And with that clout comes the ability to hire better people to manage the other aspects of your shoot.Again, I think this is people prescribing to auteur theory. It takes a huge number of people to pull off a film, and the film director is rarely well versed in most. Much like a CEO, they delegate and give their opinion but few extend beyond that.For reference I’ve worked on multiple blockbuster films, many superhero projects, some very prestigious directors and many not. The biggest indicator that a director is versed in other domains is if they worked in it to some degree before being a director. That’s where directors like Fincher excel and many others don’t reply Apocryphon 11 hours agorootparentprevWould it be accurate to liken CEOs to film producers? reply jacquesm 11 hours agorootparentInteresting. Intuitively no. But then, hm... maybe. There are some aspects that ring true but many others that don&#x27;t, I think it is a provocative question and there probably is more than a grain of truth in it. The biggest difference to me is that the producer (normally) doesn&#x27;t appear &#x27;in camera&#x27; but the CEO usually is one of the most in camera. But when you start comparing the CEO with a lead actor who is also the producer of the movie it gets closer.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zachary_QuintoIs pretty close to that image. reply bmitc 11 hours agorootparentprevNo. I&#x27;m pretty sure that my comment describes why. reply Apocryphon 11 hours agorootparent> CEOs mainly sit in meetings with people reporting things to them and then the CEO providing very high-level guidance.Isn’t that essentially the job of a film producer? You do see a lot of productions where there’s a ton of executive producer titles given out as almost a vanity position. reply bmitc 11 hours agorootparentA producer, yes, but not the film&#x27;s director. reply dagmx 7 hours agorootparentOut of genuine curiosity , and I mean no disrespect , have you worked in film production? Because directors sit in many meetings directing the people on the project.It kind of feels to me like you’re describing the way the industry works from an outsiders view since it doesn’t match the actual workings of any of the productions I’ve worked on.the shoots are only a portion of production. You have significant pre production and post production time.A producer is closer in role to a CFO or investor , depending on the production since it’s a relatively vague term. reply bmitc 5 hours agorootparentI suppose that I had and have in mind a certain type of feature film director (usually the good ones) that are involved in all things: pre- and post-production, writing the script, directing, the editing process, etc.Your original comment mentioned auteurs, which is what influenced the type of film director I was thinking of, which often are also producers and even writers and editors on their own films. To my knowledge, I am not aware of any famous CEOs that fit the style and breadth of these directors, as the CEO is almost never actually doing anything nor even knowledgeable in the things they&#x27;re tasking others to do.So to summarize, I feel there are auteur directors but not CEOs, despite many thinking there are auteur CEOs. If there are, they are certainly none of the famous ones and are likely running smaller companies. I generally think of CEOs as completely replaceable, and usually the only reason one stands out is that they don&#x27;t run the business into the ground or have a cult of personality surrounding them. If you take away an auteur director from their project, it will never materialize into anything remotely close to what was to be. reply dagmx 4 hours agorootparentMy personal opinion is that there aren’t auteur directors either. Many are only as good as their corresponding editors, producers, or other crew. It’s just an image that people concoct because it’s simpler to comprehend.Thinking of directors with distinctive styles like Hitchcock, Fincher, Spielberg, Wes Anderson etc… they’re maybe some who have a much larger influence than others, but I think there are very few projects that depend on that specific director being involved to make a good film, just not the exact film that was made. The best of them know exactly how to lean on their crew and maximize their results.Taking that kind of influence, I’d say there have certainly been CEOs of that calibre. Steve Jobs instantly springs to mind. Apple and Pixar definitely continued and had great success even after he left them&#x2F;this world, but he had such an outsize influence that it’s hard not to call him an auteur by the same standards. reply Apocryphon 11 hours agorootparentprevMy original post literally asks if it’s more accurate to compare CEOs with film producers and not directors. reply bmitc 11 hours agorootparentI misread it then with directors instead of producers.

Then you look in 2-4 years and you see the collective impact of countless decisions and realize how important they are.In this case, tons of people already have resigned from OpenAI.

    "originBody": "Monitor your security cameras with locally processed AI Frigate is an open source NVR built around real-time AI object detection. All processing is performed locally on your own hardware, and your camera feeds never leave your home. Coming Soon: Get access to custom models designed specifically for Frigate with Frigate+. Learn about Frigate+ Features One of the most starred network video recorders on GitHub. Over 2 million pulls on Docker Hub. See why. Reduce false positives with local object detection Traditional NVRs can require hours of fine tuning to reduce false positive rates because they rely on simple motion detection. By offloading object detection to the Google Coral TPU, even modest hardware can run advanced analysis to determine if the motion is actually a person, car, or other object of interest. With Frigate's local processing, there is no need to pay for your personal camera footage to be sent to the cloud for analysis. Stop reviewing shadows and wind and start reviewing detections that matter Let Frigate's AI scrub your video feeds for you. With a single Google Coral TPU, Frigate can run 100+ object detections per second so it doesn't miss a single frame. Fine tune your events and alerts with zones Frigate tracks objects in real-time and can determine the exact moment a person starts walking up your front steps or when a car enters your driveway. Refine your notifications based on precise locations. Integrate with Home Assistant and other automation platforms Give your home eyes by integrating object detection into Home Assistant, OpenHab, NodeRed, or anything with MQTT support. Frigate integrates directly into Home Assistant's media browser, provides low latency camera entities, and exposes real-time sensors and switches to power automations and notifications to your heart's content. Watch a dynamic real-time video feed for your cameras Birdseye view dynamically renders cameras with active detections so you can easily see cameras of interest. Stop squinting at a tiny square in a grid of cameras to see what is happening. Testimonials Frigate's high level of customizability, fast object detection and tight integration with Home Assistant creates the perfect open source, locally controlled, security camera system. shred86 Frigate has helped me reduce hours of false detections from my hard drive and saved me maybe as much time scouring through said, uneventful, footage. Ok maybe not that much, but seriously, zero false detections. haggercody Frigate has allowed me to remove all cloud dependencies from my security cameras, without losing any sort of object detection features or recording history. Support is second to none. Highly recommended. Eric Blohm",

It’s connected to 2 network cameras streaming in 2mp each.Frigate standalone works super smooth with no hiccups at all. I am using object detection for people and have not yet had a false positive or false negative. Additionally, I record not only the events, but but also a 24&#x2F;7 video. Frigate takes care of garbage collecting old assets.I have it hooked up to my Home Assistant running on the same raspberry pi. From there, I get notifications to my phone which include a live video, snapshot and video recording.

I have no affiliation with the maintainers. reply massung 11 hours agoparentIt looks awesome and I look forward to trying it out.Curious how you claim zero false negatives though (as in missing a person it should have detected), unless you’re reviewing all the data or have another system hooked up to it verifying? Or perhaps you simply mean to imply nothing bad has happened due to a missed detection?In curious hope it did during Halloween with all the costumes? Are you able to have it pre alert you that kids are coming to the door? reply preek 3 hours agorootparentI have set up two zones per camera: The “yard” and the “entry” which is directly in front of the door. Whenever someone is at the entry, I get a notification. Since I walk these paths myself, I have hundreds of test points. Apart from that, I’m happy to _always_ get a notification before the bell rings. And I never have to open the door before I know who is there.The “yard” part, I review every week. Here, of course, I have no data to compare it to, so I cannot say if it’s missing anything.So yes, I’m certain it misses nothing that’s important to me - is there someone at my door and who is it. reply Aspos 7 hours agoparentprevI use Homeassistant and Frigate on a $100 x86 noname micro-machine with five 4K cameras and it is awesome. CPU use does not go above 10%. Would not claim zero false positives though. However, it is smart enough to filter out non-moving false positives which many cmmercial-grade systems can not, lol.Can&#x27;t say it saved my life, but I programmed my smart bulbs to go red if a bear was spotted in any frame in the past 30 min though.Frigate is great and worth of praise. reply heyoni 4 hours agorootparentThis is hilarious.

The cameras are Tapo C320WS. They are cheap, waterproof, connect to wifi if there’s no ethernet and can stream video in two resolutions at the same time. I use the lower resolution for motion detection and the higher resolution for object detection and event recording.The whole thing is running in docker-compose on Raspberry Pi and Coral TPU. reply nagisa 14 hours agoprevI am testing Frigate for a couple months now. It is a very ambitious project and I would love to see it succeed.Here are the observations:* You don’t actually need hardware decoding or a Coral, but they do help. You will of course need to provision more CPU horse-power for NVR. * Motion detection uses the usual implementation from OpenCV. Unfortunately this algorithm is not very good in my experience. Many things I would consider as motion are missed (false negative), many things I would not consider motion are being detected (false positive). These factors mean that one is tempted to go ham on masking to filter out false positives, which then leads to further false negatives. I’m genuinely surprised the motion algorithm that’s implemented in OpenCV is still the state of art of what’s available openly. * Object detection is somewhat knee-capped by the models available publicly. They are not very good either. Frigate has built its behaviour around these models with an assumption that these models are largely pretty accurate, which in my experience has ended up with quite a few missed recordings for important events, which led me to switch to create recordings based on motion (I’m not in a very densely populated area and reviewing the recordings isn’t too onerous.) * Support for coral is… shaky at best. There are some indications that the production of these devices has largely stopped (and finding them to purchase is hard and expensive,) and maintenance of the drivers and libraries to interface with coral seems to be minimal or non-existent to the point where some Linux distributions have started dropping the relevant packages from their repositories. On the upside, running these models on the CPU isn’t that expensive, especially considering that the models are invoked very sparingly.I’m currently thinking of moving over to continuous recording, perhaps trying out moonfire-nvr or mayhaps handwriting a gstreamer pipeline. Simple software -> fewer failure modes.(NB: I worked at a computer vision startup in the past, my views are naturally influenced by that experience.) reply scottlamb 12 hours agoparent> I’m currently thinking of moving over to continuous recording, perhaps trying out moonfire-nvr or mayhaps handwriting a gstreamer pipeline. Simple software -> fewer failure modes.Moonfire&#x27;s author here. Please do give it a try! Right now it&#x27;s a little too simple even for me, lacking any real support for motion or events. [1] But I&#x27;d like to keep that simple server core that just handles the recording and database functionality, while allowing separate processes to handle Frigate-like computer vision stuff or even just on-camera motion detection, and enhance the UI and add stuff like MQTT&#x2F;HA integration to support that well. I&#x27;d definitely welcome help with those areas. (And UI is really not an area of expertise of mine, as you can see from e.g. this bug: .)For now I actually run Moonfire and Frigate side-by-side. They&#x27;re almost complete opposites in terms of what they support, but I find both are useful.[1] The database schema has the concept of \"signals\" (timeseriesed enums like motion&#x2F;still&#x2F;unknown or door open&#x2F;door closed&#x2F;unknown), but my code to populate that based on camera or alarm system events is in my separate \"playground\" of half-finished stuff, and the crappy UI for it is rotting in one of my working copies. I&#x27;d like Moonfire&#x27;s database&#x2F;API layer to also have a more Frigate-like concept of \"events\" and one of \"object tracks\". reply nickm_27 10 hours agoparentprev> Motion detection uses the usual implementation from OpenCV. Unfortunately this algorithm is not very good in my experience.In frigate 0.13 (currently in beta) the motion detection has been fully rewritten, which has been a large improvement in my and other&#x27;s experience. We also have docs now that walk users through tuning the motion detectoin.This is along with many other changes along what you are describing like object tracking and improvements to initial object detection when motion is first detected. reply eternityforest 7 hours agoparentprevI found motion detection to be the easy part when building my NVR. I just used trial and error and scipy filters and eventually found something I&#x27;m happy with.Handwriting a GST pipeline is pretty much what I did. I start with frame differences(I only decode the keyframes that happen every few seconds, so motion detection has to work in a single frame to have good response time).Then I do a greyscale erosion to suppress small bits of noise and prioritize connected regions.After that I take the average value of all pixels, and I subtract it, to suppress the noise floor, and also possibly some global uniform illumination changes.Then I square every pixel, to further suppress large low intensity background noise stuff, and take the average of those squares.I mostly only run object detection after motion is detected, and I have a RAM buffer to capture a few seconds before an event occurs.NVR device code(In theory this can be imported and run from a few like python script), but it needs some cleanup and I&#x27;ve never tried it outside the web server.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EternityForest&#x2F;iot_devices.nvr&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;...GST wrapper utilities it uses, motion detection algorithms at top:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;EternityForest&#x2F;scullery&#x2F;blob&#x2F;Master&#x2F;scull...My CPU object detection is OK, but the public, fast, easy to run models and my limited understanding of them is the weak point. I wound up doing a bunch of sanity check post filters and I&#x27;m sure it could be done much better with better models and better pre&#x2F;post filtering. reply eyegor 6 hours agorootparentHow do you work with so much python code with no type annotations? I get it for smaller projects but isn&#x27;t half this stuff meant to be library code? reply eternityforest 5 hours agorootparentSome of this code is older, before I was more serious about this specific code, and moving to type annotations has been pretty much the big project of the year for me for everything personal, among other \"Eliminate everything hacky\" projects, going back into 10yo code and cleaning up tons of stuff.My bigger priority has been moving from Mako to Jinja2, especially for some particularly horrid templates that could not be highlighted or formatted because there&#x27;s not many good Mako tools, JSON schema validation, but I definitely agree type annotations are critical.VS Code is smart enough to catch a lot of stuff sans annotations though, so you can get by with a lot of nonsense, especially when half your time is just fighting GStreamer and you&#x27;re not paying as much attention to the python side.There&#x27;s nothing better than GST that I&#x27;ve ever seen for dealing with media without actually having to touch the performance critical stuff in your own code, but it is not easy to debug stuff buried in autogenerated python bindings to C code, especially with an extra RPC layer to use a background process and defend against segfaults.There&#x27;s also lots of other weird stuff, like imports not at the top of the file, meant to support systems where some module wasn&#x27;t available, and generally all kinds of cleanup that&#x27;s slowly happening. reply englishspot 12 hours agoparentprev> Support for coral is… shaky at best.

The biggest gap right now in my mind is Frigate&#x27;s poor feature set for continuous recording, which seems like very basic functionality but ends up as a low priority for a lot of these \"event-first\" products that are more patterned off of consumer products. reply MadnessASAP 15 hours agoparentI&#x27;ve been using it for continuous recording of my cameras.

Also stuff like identifying people&#x27;s faces or license plates. 4K for a camera that is close up, like say a doorbell, is IMO less useful. reply milofeynman 10 hours agorootparentprevMine are all high up in second floor so it does make a difference. reply j45 12 hours agorootparentprev4K to FHD is the difference difference being able to see someone’s face, or not.

The norm in commercial systems has long been to record continuously and use motion&#x2F;object detection&#x2F;other classifiers to annotate the recording. That gives you the opportunity to search for events, like thefts, that may not have been detected by classification. You also have access to footage well before and after the detected event, which is often absolutely critical to answering useful questions (e.g. how did someone get past the fence?). Common patterns like 10 seconds before&#x2F;30 seconds after just aren&#x27;t always sufficient.Unfortunately consumer devices are almost always cloud-based, where storage but especially upstream bandwidth are much more costly considerations, so recording only on detection has become the norm in the consumer world.External triggers are also an important feature in commercial systems that a lot of open source projects miss---but Frigate isn&#x27;t guilty of this one, it can receive triggers by MQTT, which is the same thing I do right now with Blue Iris. That&#x27;s the big thing that has me optimistic about Frigate going forward. Because motion and object detection are so inconsistent, triggering VMS events based on access control systems and intrusion sensors is often a much more reliable (and even easier to maintain) approach. reply invalidator 11 hours agorootparentOne of the niftiest ways I&#x27;ve seen this done was some software I used circa 2000 (I don&#x27;t remember the name). It would create a variable-rate timelapse by saving a frame every time the image changed more than $x percent, calculated as the sum of differences of pixels from the previous frame, or thereabouts.If someone was walking across the yard it would save every frame. The movement of the sun would move shadows enough to trigger a new image every few minutes. A bug flying past was small enough that it wouldn&#x27;t trigger anything. The result was you could get a short video of everything interesting that happened through the day: shadows of trees sliding over the ground, every frame of the car pulling out of the driveway, shadows sliding over the ground some more, cat walks across the yard then lays down, shadows pan around more while the cat sits still, cat gets up and walks away, shadows pan around until the delivery guy comes...It was an incredibly low-CPU way to see everything that happened without missing anything, and without having to fine-tune the motion detection very much. You just mask out any areas with constant motion, then adjust the slider for how much change triggered the next frame, which would let you adjust how fast the timelapse would go during the boring parts.I&#x27;ve always wondered why the technique never became widespread. reply Zuiii 12 hours agorootparentprevBecause sometimes these systems don&#x27;t detect those changes. Continuous recording with object detection and tagging solves this problem. reply pkulak 15 hours agoparentprevWait, what now? I have mine set to retain 3 full days of continuous. reply jcrawfordor 15 hours agorootparentPerhaps this has improved, but when I tried it out a few months ago I found that the playback for continuous recording was extremely basic and didn&#x27;t have features like easy-to-use variable speed scrub to make it practical to search for things. I might try it out again today because I would like to go to something that doesn&#x27;t have to run on Windows, but my use case is more around continuous recording with around a month of history than event detection.Space management for rolling retention is also a new feature in Frigate and very basic, I don&#x27;t think it has a way to do different retention policies by camera group and alarm. reply Thews 14 hours agorootparentI believe you can trigger recording with mqtt, so you could make an automation for it. You could try to bump this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;blakeblackshear&#x2F;frigate&#x2F;issues&#x2F;2590#issue.... You could even try to use ai to write the feature.There&#x27;s only been one incident where I would have liked continuous, I&#x27;ve tweaked events to be more than enough. reply pkulak 12 hours agorootparentprevAh yes, you are right. I’ll never actually look at the continuous unless I’m robbed, so it doesn’t bother me. Person and animal detection is really good, so you’d have to be very motivated to want to slop around in the space between. reply nickm_27 11 hours agorootparentprevA better UI for recordings viewing and seeing times of activity are coming in the future.Frigate already supports customizing recording retention per camera for 24&#x2F;7 and event based recordings.You can also set different retention periods based on the type of objects that were detected. reply xrd 11 hours agoprevOK. I have a bunch of ring cameras and cannot get them connected to Amazon anymore. The person that sold the house didn&#x27;t leave the packaging, and the Amazon app does not allow connection to the temp wifi; you must scan the QR code or enter the serial number? I&#x27;ve never been able to get them reconnected since the Hurricane last year.Can I somehow use these with Frigate?

You can get the serial number off the camera itself, usually on the back so it needs to be removed first.Also most of those ring cameras are 2.4ghz only so you need a dedicated 2.4ghz wifi network.

A single PoE switch, or multiple PoE injectors?My Arlo Pro 2 cameras are apparently EOL and might stop receiving free cloud services in a couple of months.

What they mean by \"Up to 1234 Mbps\" on the box is \"1234 Mbps shared\". It&#x27;s a giant wire occupying 1&#x2F;4 mile around the AP, whereas, in wired Ethernet it&#x27;s 1Gbps per link per direction.A GbE switch with wire-rate transfer guarantee can handle 1Gbps traffic between arbitrary combination of ports. All the camera traffic coming from port 9 to 16 going to NVR on port 7 have no impact to traffic between upstream router on port 26 and your PCs on port 3 and 5. That cannot happen with Wi-Fi because everything is inherently on the same shared port 1(sometimes literally); each 4Mbps incoming is 4Mbps of download speed taken from your laptop. Double if destination is also on Wi-Fi.This might be fine if there&#x27;s just few cameras, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of. reply CrazyStat 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you live in a sufficiently low density area (rural or suburban with large lots) you can put the two networks on different channels and they won’t meaningfully interfere with each order. reply kiallmacinnes 1 hour agorootparentThe chances are, if you live somewhere like that, somewhere that actually has a low noise floor for RF, then you likely also have a lot of space to cover with your wifi - and that means sacrificing range (via additional access points) for the second network..For me: Wifi is great! But, whenever it&#x27;s practical, I avoid it... Everything with it is a tradeoff! reply Karrot_Kream 14 hours agorootparentprev> Yes, that&#x27;s the thing I like about the Arlo system I have now: it has its own wifi network so, even if it&#x27;s using spectrum, it&#x27;s probably not affecting my LAN throughput.Wifi6 is changing a lot of this, but generally speaking Wifi performance is not optimized for media style traffic. Media traffic does best with low jitter (variance of latency) as this tends to keep buffer sizes low and avoids dropping frames. Wifi is not very good at low jitter, and though Wifi6 is a lot better than previous Wifi standards, it&#x27;s still much harder to keep jitter low on Wifi than it is on a LAN. On top of that, as the sibling commenter says, even if you have a separate Wifi network, spectrum doesn&#x27;t segment that neatly. Wireless traffic uses multiplexing methods (there are several and if you&#x27;re interested, the methods are fascinating [1]) to roughly use the same spectrum. These multiplexing methods obviously need to do more work the more traffic there is on the spectrum.If you can route your media traffic through LAN do it. Obviously as you say, running new cable is a lot of work so it&#x27;s understandable why you use Wifi. But LAN is just so much better that if you have the time&#x2F;money (doing it yourself&#x2F;hiring someone) to do it, I highly recommend you do.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intechopen.com&#x2F;chapters&#x2F;66562 reply candiddevmike 10 hours agorootparentprev> it has its own wifi network so, even if it&#x27;s using spectrum, it&#x27;s probably not affecting my LAN throughputUnless you&#x27;re using dedicated APs it is absolutely affecting your other wifi users. reply sib 8 hours agorootparentThe Arlo system generally does use its own dedicated APs. reply somehnguy 7 hours agorootparentprevArlo’s base station is an AP. reply j45 12 hours agorootparentprevNot just that but if a thief is going to break into your home, a wifi hammer will render a lot of smarthome gear including cameras useless. reply px43 12 hours agorootparentDid you mean \"jammer\" or is there something new called a \"wifi hammer\"?

A single PoE switch, or multiple PoE injectors?It basically doesn&#x27;t matter at all - I have a mixture of both in my home, multiple PoE switches and multiple PoE injectors for things like cameras, wireless APs etc. Use whatever fits needs&#x2F;budget&#x2F;location, you don&#x27;t have to go nuts buying a single high end PoE switch. There&#x27;s often good deals to be had on used PoE switches on ebay etc too if really budget conscious.The only real advantage of going with a single or fewer PoE switches is you have less things to put on a UPS, if you require the system to still work when power goes down. A UPS that can run say 4 cameras, the PoE switch and a system running Frigate for more than a few hours can get pretty expensive too, in my experience - most cheap UPSes are designed to get you enough power to save some files and shutdown a PC in a matter of minutes, not hours.Cheap intel box with a Coral runs Frigate fantastically, and if a tower build plenty of room for internal storage drives. reply acidburnNSA 15 hours agoparentprevI have a variety of PoE power supplies based on where all my wires are running.

I use wifi cameras too, pretty much any camera with rtsp&#x2F;onvif would work.Chances are, a single switch is more cost effective than multiple injectors. But you also need Ethernet routed throughout your house. One alternative is to have the G.hn (powerline) adapter with PoE. This way, you can be both network and power with one plug without wiring your house. reply eddyg 15 hours agorootparentWi-Fi cameras are not a great idea. Sure, they are convenient, but Wi-Fi is a shared access medium (every device on, say, channel 11, has to “cooperate” with all the other devices about when it can transmit, including devices on neighboring SSIDs) and something that is constantly streaming video (or worse, multiple devices!) is going to quickly consume available bandwidth and offer a poor Wi-Fi experience. (But most people only care about convenience.) Plus, Wi-Fi is easily jammed, which is not great from a security perspective. reply syntaxing 15 hours agorootparentEhh, I have a mix of 4K and 2K cameras, it hasn’t been much of an issue. I run OPNsense with a single EAP670 and there hasn’t been much performance degradation. PoE is definitely ideal but not an option for many, including me since I rent.

Microsoft also has a history of supporting game devs doing stuff with Azure.I’ve dabbled with adding an LLM to OpenMW, and I think there’s potential there.

It is not the sticker cost, but the additional cost of the cognitive load that comes with a subscription. Having to remember yet another service that needs to be paid for, that needs to be cancelled when you don&#x27;t want it anymore, that needs to be included in budgeting, etc. occupies a lot of mind space for the lifetime of the service.An ad blocker can be created and then forgotten about. reply veidelis 42 minutes agoparentprevYes, it is.

The transition from \"creator place\" to \"media moat\" isn&#x27;t something I appreciate nor am I willing to participate in.simply put : Ad-blockers simply enable me to stay in a better place mentally. The moment they started getting iffy on YT I tried to disable them and got a bunch of war-gore imagery thrown in my face from some NGO relief group begging for money in the midst of a hobby machinery video, these types of ads and abusive imagery are simply inappropriate, and I won&#x27;t let the media be held hostage against me for the sake of collecting a toll or else being exposed to it : I just won&#x27;t participate on that side of the net. reply bagels 53 minutes agorootparentThis response does not really address the question in the comments it is attached to. reply IshKebab 56 minutes agorootparentprevUhm right.

It is good for us that others are subjected to ads, as it allows us to get useful services for free without having to be. reply ozim 9 minutes agorootparentFirst of all YT and other companies hooked people on free stuff and after years are doing bait and switch - it is totally on them - not on the people wanting free stuff. They should not offer free stuff in the first place to be fair.Which is also now they are abusing their market position built by cutting all other companies that could do the same but simply could not get past dumping price of free by VC fueled \"startups\". Which I believe some government org should look into.Second of all they benefit by externalizing all negative effects of their platforms where they don&#x27;t handle moderation of offensive comments towards creators which causes lots of psychological damage. There is whole load of evidence they even set it up in ways to specifically get people dependent on dopamine from watching just one more video.Lastly - cable TV in US was paid with no ads and when they found out they can earn more money they still put in ads.For me it is noble act of civil disobedience. reply Retr0id 37 minutes agorootparentprevI do block ads as an act of civil disobedience. I also pay for services, when I consider it to be appropriate. The problems with the ad industry run much deeper than ads merely being annoying to look at.It is bad that anyone is ever subjected to ads.We&#x27;re talking about this right now on a web service given to us as an act of charity (modulo the occasional sponsored job listing), and I&#x27;d like more of the web to be like that.

I recently wrote my own user script to do the same thing. It&#x27;s going to be very hard to patch or detect this, as updating video element props don&#x27;t trigger DOM updates. They would have to either do lots of JS prototype trickery or check for playback rate when doing adblock detection. One thing to keep in mind here though since you&#x27;re doing DOM lookups every time anything on the page changes, is that there could be some small overhead in page render time, and also that using fixed CSS classes means any small change to page code could break the checks. In case it&#x27;s a problem in the future, checking .innerText is a hacky way to workaround it. reply rjh29 8 hours agoparentThey could refuse to deliver the main video content until the minimum ad time has passed? reply 9991 7 hours agorootparentWatching a blank screen is still a huge quality of life win. reply throw101010 6 hours agorootparentExactly what happens on Twitch (that or a low quality version of the stream) if you use the few anti-ads that still work.

YouTube has been gradually rolling out the counter-blocking to an expanding number of randomly selected users.2. YouTube doesn&#x27;t bother blocking me because I&#x27;ve purchased a substantial amount of content from them. There&#x27;s little benefit in discouraging me from buying more content in the future.3. YouTube has done some analytics to figure out that I&#x27;m the kind of person who will never return if no ad blocking is allowed and doesn&#x27;t trust them to keep ads out of Premium.I don&#x27;t suppose you&#x27;ve purchased shows or movies through YouTube? reply SeanAnderson 8 hours agorootparentI think I purchased one movie through YouTube a few years ago, but it&#x27;s been a while. I received a YouTube notification a few weeks ago letting me know that AdBlock was not allowed, but there was no follow-up.I feel that YouTube is very deeply entrenched in a streaming architecture which makes it challenging to serve ads that are indistinguishable from primary content. All of the pushback against adblocking extensions feels like an unwinnable arms race until Manifest v3 becomes mandatory.Contrast this with Twitch - where uBlock doesn&#x27;t impact ads at all. I feel Twitch engineered their service to defeat adblock from day 1. YouTube wants to be in the same position, but doesn&#x27;t seem willing or able to mirror Twitch&#x27;s architecture. reply Mogzol 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m pretty sure the answer is #1.

If someone signs up for YouTube Premium but doesn&#x27;t watch any videos at all, do creators split that $7 (in a proportion that roughly mirrors the existing amount creators were already getting paid: a bigger share of the $7 for those with a bigger share of views generally) or does the platform keep both halves?I don&#x27;t know that anyone here can say what does happen with that $7, but what should happen with it? Did creators earn it? If they earned it regardless of no plays from that user, it follows that in another universe where the Premium user only ever watched one single creator, that creator doesn&#x27;t earn more of that particular $7 than they otherwise would. reply hombre_fatal 7 hours agorootparentprevHow much do they get from you right now with adblock? reply dymk 7 hours agorootparentprevA cope to justify not paying content creators nor platform operators no matter the cost reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agorootparentNo justification necessary.

If no one sees them then sucks for you. Most people put up with TV ads when they&#x27;re not even hard to skip. And for some reason IG ads are well liked. Forcing them harder I think has to make us confront what we&#x27;re really doing here and what we&#x27;re gaining by all this. Just pay for premium sounds nice when you don&#x27;t think about it. If there&#x27;s no universe where someone might actually prefer the ads if they were the same price then we&#x27;re kinda admitting they have literally zero value to the viewer.And that paints a very different picture of advertising than \"the grease of the economic wheel\" ya know? And clearly all advertising isn&#x27;t like this, like I paid to see the Lego movie, Barbie was fantastic. I watched a YT video of a woman showing her design process for a product she&#x27;s selling and it was fascinating but it was also just an ad. But if YT are there to suck just so you&#x27;ll pay for it to suck less than that&#x27;s not mutually beneficial trade that&#x27;s extortion. reply throwaway5959 7 hours agorootparentThat’s a lot of words to say you want something for nothing.

The UAE military is allegedly a \"Strong\" customer. Jack Poulson Oct 18, 2023 30 Share this post Lockheed is now tracking phones and walkie-talkies from space, and the UAE military is allegedly a \"strong\" customer jackpoulson.substack.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 3 Share Marketing materials from space-based surveillance firm HawkEye 360 depicting how the company’s radio-frequency geolocation could detect a ship covertly visiting a port in Syria despite its AIS beacon being turned off. This morning, space-based surveillance firm HawkEye 360 announced its “Strategic Cooperative Agreement” with weapons giant Lockheed Martin “on delivering sophisticated RF [radio-frequency] intelligence systems globally”. HawkEye’s current constellation of 21 satellites is trained to locate the sources of electromagnetic emissions with wavelengths ranging from roughly 2 meters down to 2 centimeters, with “Signals of Interest” including satellite phones, walkie-talkies, cellular towers, and GPS. The announcement of HawkEye’s partnership with Lockheed came as part of a $10 million addition to HawkEye 360’s fourth major investment round — known as a “Series D” — with Lockheed Martin Ventures named as the primary additional investor, alongside unnamed “company insiders”. Despite not being a household name, HawkEye has long been considered one of the six most influential U.S. defense technology companies, as evidenced by serving as the ‘H’ in the popular defense tech acronym ‘SHARPE’, alongside data-fusion giant Palantir’s ‘P’. In addition to former Texas Congressman Lamar Smith having formally lobbied for the company, former U.S. counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke has been a special assistant to HawkEye CEO John Serafini. And the company’s advisory board has been packed with three former members of Congress as well as former high-level military officials, including former National Security Agency Director Michael Rogers and John Abizaid, the former head of Central Command who subsequently became Donald Trump’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. President Biden’s departed National Cyber Director, Chris Inglis, was similarly an early member, and HawkEye’s board of directors previously included the former Chief Technologist of Google Federal, Rob Painter. Despite months of requests, HawkEye 360 has not responded to inquiries on either its alleged “strong” role supporting the military of the United Arab Emirates, or on leaked details of its technological approach obtained by the author. HawkEye’s alleged contract with the UAE Armed Forces was uncovered as part of the author’s ongoing reporting on imagery and location-analytics company Orbital Insight’s surveillance contract with the Indonesian government, codenamed “Project Alpha”. As part of Orbital CEO Kevin O’Brien’s presentation to an investor group last month, he noted that the “Emerati ISR leads” were a “Strong HawkEye 360 customer”. A portion of the fifth slide of Orbital Insight’s September 7, 2023 presentation to the SATIF investment group which detailed the company’s plans to expand its military partnerships around the world. The fifth of the thirteen named targets was the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates, which Orbital CEO Kevin E. O’Brien claimed to be a “Strong HawkEye360 customer.” Beyond HawkEye’s alleged “strong” support for UAE military surveillance, perhaps the company’s largest public contract was a recently completed $5.8 million project with U.S. Naval Information Warfare Systems to monitor radio-frequency emissions in the Pacific. The company also received a 1.5 million euro contract in 2019 with the European Union’s border enforcement agency, Frontex, entitled “Satellite Radio Frequency Emitter Detection for Maritime Situational Awareness”. HawkEye’s advisors have helped lead a large percentage of U.S. military and intelligence organizations — including the Central Intelligence Agency’s technical surveillance programs — and have included two former members of Congress who pivoted into lobbying, Norm Coleman and Lamar Smith. And so one can only conclude that HawkEye’s surveillance support for Gulf dictatorships is not an anomaly, but rather a corporate extension of official U.S. foreign policy. Subscribe Appendix The full text of Hawkeye 360’s pitch to the Pentagon through the Vulcan contracting marketplace follows: (U//PROPIN) HawkEye 360 (HE360) operates the first-of-its-kind constellation of commercial satellites that can independently detect, identify, and geolocate radio-frequency (RF) signals to within 500 meters of their point of origin. Launched in December 2018, the first cluster of three spacecraft (known as the Pathfinder Cluster) has been fully operational since February of 2019. The software-defined radio (SDR) payload on all three spacecraft can be tuned to a wide range of different frequencies (144MHz-15GHz) and switched between several different RF front end and antenna paths. The HE360 Signal of Interest (SOI) library is the list of signals that can be geolocated by the company’s spacecraft. Common SOIs include UHF GMRS/FRS Push-to-talk Radios, VHF Radios, Automatic Identification System (AIS) EPIRB Emergency Radio Beacons, Cellular Towers, Satellite Phone, X-band Maritime Navigation Radars, Ku-band VSAT Terminals. Tools developed in-house by HE360 efficiently process this data in an integrated signal-processing and geo-engine to calculate and deliver information about myriad emitter types from around the planet. (U//PROPIN) Additionally, HawkEye 360 satellites can detect RF signals in the GPS bands, as well as other GNSS systems, e.g. GLONASS. If detected by all three spacecraft, the RF energy from a GNSS interference can be geolocated to its point of origin using an adaptation of the company’s existing geolocation techniques. Due to the global coverage of the constellation, geolocation of GNSS jamming or spoofing can be conducted over denied areas without exposing airborne or terrestrial sensors or personnel to hostile conditions. Unlike electro optical sensors, RF geolocation provides data day and night in all weather conditions. (U//PROPIN) HE360 Spectrum Awareness products can support multiple applications and mission areas; including theater indications and warning, pattern of life analysis; maritime domain awareness; illegal fishing identification; border monitoring, mapping communications nodes; and disaster response. (U) HE360 data and products are entirely unclassified, providing theater intelligence officers with an unprecedented ability to share RF geolocations with tactical echelons and partner nations. HE360 data is easily accessible via a web interface, and is interoperable “out of the box” with all GIS, C4ISR, and mobile device systems.

It stands to reason that with better sensitivity receivers you would be able to pick up cell phones pretty easily, though identifying specific units is likely not yet possible. reply superkuh 12 hours agoparentprevAmateur radio operators with just a moderate bit of gain (small uda-yagi antenna or the like) uplink to LEO satellites with ~5 watts all the time. At peak power a cell phone can be about 3 watts... but their antennas are not directional. So that loss of ~8dB of antenna gain has to be made up by increasing the sensitivity or gain of the satellites in LEO by increasing antena aperture or better front end low noise amplifiers. It&#x27;s all very feasible given the clear line of sight.What&#x27;s less feasible is having enough of these at good positions overhead of a single cell phone to multi-laterate it&#x27;s position using shared timestamps on the downlinked spectrum from multiple satellites.I think it&#x27;s entirely feasible with the budget of a medium space services corporation that can launch 21 satellites. reply sneak 13 hours agoparentprevDepends on the satellite and the altitude.

It&#x27;s actually probably far less intrusive and privacy destroying than the electronic device you likely carry everywhere with you that reports you location and could (if it doesn&#x27;t already) keep track of when it can&#x27;t report and relay it when it can again.If you think the trade-offs of that make it worthwhile most the time, consider that there may be trade-offs here that are positive that you are discounting with what we&#x27;re discussing here. reply kazinator 12 hours agorootparentHow about: walkie-talkie with decent crypto?Suppose we design walkie talkies such that two or more units can be hooked up together in a daisy chain.

Take the 500 Watts (27 dBW) and subtract the free space path loss (27 - 182) and you get -155 dBW. The end of life spec is -160 dBW, which leaves a 5 dB margin.And if you really get into it, you&#x27;ll discover ALL of the following represent the same approximate signal strength for GPS on the face of the earth (m stands for milliwatts and m2 stands for meters squared):-160 dBW, -130 dBm, -135 dBW&#x2F;m2, -105 dBm&#x2F;m2, -223 dBW&#x2F;Hz, -163 dBW&#x2F;MHz, -193 dBm&#x2F;Hz, -198 dBW&#x2F;m2&#x2F;Hz, -138 dBW&#x2F;m2&#x2F;MHzOnce you figure out why they&#x27;re all the same, you&#x27;re well on your way to understanding power, power density, and power flux density as it relates to GPS.

Technology Cryptographers Solve Decades-Old Privacy Problem We are one step closer to fully private internet searches. By Madison Goldberg November 17, 2023 Add a comment Share Facebook Twitter Pocket Reddit Email Explore We all know to be careful about the details we share online, but the information we seek can also be revealing. Search for driving directions, and our location becomes far easier to guess. Check for a password in a trove of compromised data, and we risk leaking it ourselves. These situations fuel a key question in cryptography: How can you pull information from a public database without revealing anything about what you’ve accessed? It’s the equivalent of checking out a book from the library without the librarian knowing which one. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Concocting a strategy that solves this problem—known as private information retrieval—is “a very useful building block in a number of privacy-preserving applications,” said David Wu, a cryptographer at the University of Texas, Austin. Since the 1990s, researchers have chipped away at the question, improving strategies for privately accessing databases. One major goal, still impossible with large databases, is the equivalent of a private Google search, where you can sift through a heap of data anonymously without doing any heavy computational lifting. It would be like having a librarian scour every shelf before returning with your book. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Now, three researchers have crafted a long-sought version of private information retrieval and extended it to build a more general privacy strategy. The work, which received a Best Paper Award in June at the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing, topples a major theoretical barrier on the way to a truly private search. “[This is] something in cryptography that I guess we all wanted but didn’t quite believe that it exists,” said Vinod Vaikuntanathan, a cryptographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the paper. “It is a landmark result.” The problem of private database access took shape in the 1990s. At first, researchers assumed that the only solution was to scan the entire database during every search, which would be like having a librarian scour every shelf before returning with your book. After all, if the search skipped any section, the librarian would know that your book is not in that part of the library. That approach works well enough at smaller scales, but as the database grows, the time required to scan it grows at least proportionally. As you read from bigger databases—and the internet is a pretty big one—the process becomes prohibitively inefficient. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . In the early 2000s, researchers started to suspect they could dodge the full-scan barrier by “preprocessing” the database. Roughly, this would mean encoding the whole database as a special structure, so the server could answer a query by reading just a small portion of that structure. Careful enough preprocessing could, in theory, mean that a single server hosting information only goes through the process once, by itself, allowing all future users to grab information privately without any more effort. For Daniel Wichs, a cryptographer at Northeastern University and a co-author of the new paper, that seemed too good to be true. Around 2011, he started trying to prove that this kind of scheme was impossible. “I was convinced that there’s no way that this could be done,” he said. But in 2017, two groups of researchers published results that changed his mind. They built the first programs that could do this kind of private information retrieval, but they weren’t able to show that the programs were secure. (Cryptographers demonstrate a system’s security by showing that breaking it is as difficult as solving some hard problem. The researchers weren’t able to compare it to a canonical hard problem.)

Courtesy of Ian MacLellan and Khoury College of Computer Sciences/Northeastern University. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . So even with his hope renewed, Wichs assumed that any version of these programs that was secure was still a long way off. Instead, he and his co-authors—Wei-Kai Lin, now at the University of Virginia, and Ethan Mook, also at Northeastern—worked on problems they thought would be easier, which involved cases where multiple servers host the database. In the methods they studied, the information in the database can be transformed into a mathematical expression, which the servers can evaluate to extract the information. The authors figured it might be possible to make that evaluation process more efficient. They toyed with an idea from 2011, when other researchers had found a way to quickly evaluate such an expression by preprocessing it, creating special, compact tables of values that allow you to skip the normal evaluation steps. That method didn’t produce any improvements, and the group came close to giving up—until they wondered whether this tool might actually work in the coveted single-server case. Choose a polynomial carefully enough, they saw, and a single server could preprocess it based on the 2011 result—yielding the secure, efficient lookup scheme Wichs had pondered for years. Suddenly, they’d solved the harder problem after all. At first, the authors didn’t believe it. “Let’s figure out what’s wrong with this,” Wichs remembered thinking. “We kept trying to figure out where it breaks down.” Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . But the solution held: They had really discovered a secure way to preprocess a single-server database so anyone could pull information in secret. “It’s really beyond everything we had hoped for,” said Yuval Ishai, a cryptographer at the Technion in Israel who was not involved in this work. It’s a result “we were not even brave enough to ask for,” he said. Cryptographers have a long history of results that were initially impractical. After building their secret lookup scheme, the authors turned to the real-world goal of a private internet search, which is more complicated than pulling bits of information from a database, Wichs said. The private lookup scheme on its own does allow for a version of private Google-like searching, but it’s extremely labor-intensive: You run Google’s algorithm yourself and secretly pull data from the internet when necessary. Wichs said a true search, where you send a request and sit back while the server collects the results, is really a target for a broader approach known as homomorphic encryption, which disguises data so that someone else can manipulate it without ever knowing anything about it. Typical homomorphic encryption strategies would hit the same snag as private information retrieval, plodding through all the internet’s contents for every search. But using their private lookup method as scaffolding, the authors constructed a new scheme which runs computations that are more like the programs we use every day, pulling information covertly without sweeping the whole internet. That would provide an efficiency boost for internet searches and any programs that need quick access to data. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . While homomorphic encryption is a useful extension of the private lookup scheme, Ishai said, he sees private information retrieval as the more fundamental problem. The authors’ solution is the “magical building block,” and their homomorphic encryption strategy is a natural follow-up. For now, neither scheme is practically useful: Preprocessing currently helps at the extremes, when the database size balloons toward infinity. But actually deploying it means those savings can’t materialize, and the process would eat up too much time and storage space. Luckily, Vaikuntanathan said, cryptographers have a long history of optimizing results that were initially impractical. If future work can streamline the approach, he believes private lookups from giant databases may be within reach. “We all thought we were kind of stuck there,” he said. “What Daniel’s result gives is hope.” This article was originally published on the Quanta Abstractions blog.

Like wildly so. Specifically if you have a very small database and you preprocess it with their techniques, the resulting database is petabytes in size. But the results are very beautiful.There are no obvious ways to improve on this work, so it is not a matter of engineering. We really do need another breakthrough result to get us closer to practicality. reply godelski 12 hours agoparentprevNot an answer, but a question that I hope someone can answer. Is the lack of speed because of a lack of optimization or compute? Is this something that could be fixed by an accelerator?It&#x27;s often hard to compare things in an accurate way. I mean many current methods might already have hardware specific acceleration and researchers aren&#x27;t always good at optimization (why should they be?). So is the problem of FHE a bigger lack of just not enough people (specialists) putting in time to optimize it or is it so computationally intensive that we need hardware to get better before it becomes practical? I mean look at llama.cpp and how much faster it is or stable diffusion? Sure, both kinda slow (diffusion&#x27;s no GAN and SD&#x27;s not straight diffusion) but very usable for many applications. reply meindnoch 10 hours agorootparent>Is the lack of speed because of a lack of optimization or compute?No.>Is this something that could be fixed by an accelerator?No. reply jengels_ 14 hours agoparentprevPretty efficient! E.g. a recent paper describes a system to do fully private search over the common crawl (360 million web pages) with an end to end latency of 2.7 seconds: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3600006.3613134 reply vlovich123 14 hours agorootparentYeah, but that’s 1 request using 100% capacity of a 45 machine cluster. Relatively efficient but cost prohibitive. reply deadfece 3 hours agorootparentIt used 145 core-seconds of compute, according to the paper. That&#x27;s not 100% unless they were mostly 1 core servers. However, the search used almost 50MiB of traffic before the query was even sent by the client. I imagine that will add up fast. reply avmich 12 hours agorootparentprevHow does it compare to the search done without any encryption? reply seeknotfind 11 hours agorootparentMany many orders of magnitude. It really depends on the search algorithm. If you&#x27;re looking up a single term, there are many standard ways to index this, but for instance using a trie or hash table, the lookup cost would be a number of operations proportional to the search term length (e.g. for \"foo\", it&#x27;s a of length 3, times some small number of operations for each letter). Plus then if you want to combine the results and sort by frequency, to estimate the cost of this, add up the number of pages from each term, p_1 + p_2 + ... = P. Then the number of operations might be P*log(P). This dominates the cost. So if your search terms appear in 1,000,000 of these pages, you&#x27;re talking about on the order of ~6,000,000 small operations. An implementation would be able to execute this many operations on a single CPU in 10s or 100s of milliseconds maybe, for an elementary unoptimized algorithm. reply _ks3e 9 hours agoparentprevBased on my recollection of a conversation with the authors after their STOC talk: the RAM scheme is not efficient enough to be competitive with circuit-based FHE schemes; for problems with low RAM usage, existing circuit-based methods are more efficient, and problems with higher RAM usage are infeasible to run on any FHE method right now.They were 50&#x2F;50 on whether or not this technique could be made feasible in the same way that, say, the CKKS scheme is. reply rhindi 15 hours agoparentprevFHE in general is efficient enough for many applications now. You can see some benchmarks here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.zama.ai&#x2F;tfhe-rs&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;benchmarks reply PeterisP 9 hours agorootparentThe benchmarks listed there are approximately 100 times slower than the original Intel 8088 microprocessor released 1979 on which the original IBM PC was based.That microprocessor was efficient enough for many applications of general purpose computing, but we still need Moore&#x27;s law to give us a 100-fold increase in compute power to reach this level.This level of performance seems comparable to (and IMHO slower than) the very first electronic stored-program computer, the 1948 Manchester Baby. reply nine_k 3 hours agorootparentIn other words, this can be compared to do the computation manually, but with the guarantee that whoever is performing the computation cannot glean anything from it.This can be OK for some relatively rare and important computations, which you for some reason must run in a software-untrusted environment. I can imagine using it for some high-stakes, small-scale automated voting. All the intermediate results may be posted in the encrypted form as an audit trail. After the process is completed and results are declared, the encryption keys are released, and any party can check that every step of the computation determining the winner was correct, there was no stuffing. reply jquery 15 hours agorootparentprev2 seconds to perform a single division on an a 16-bit? int?

For 10 million TextSecure users, a bloom filter like this would be ~40MB, requested from the server 116 times a second if every client refreshes it once a day.They decided to run computations inside a &#x27;secure&#x27; hardware environment instead (SGX specifically) so that they can&#x27;t get access to the computation themselves but it also doesn&#x27;t need to be run client side. I assume you meant the former thing, but the approach they actually use is fundamentally different from homomorphic encryption &#x2F; PIR. reply tesdinger 10 hours agorootparentHow is SGX different from putting a sticker on the server rack door that says \"don&#x27;t open private data\"? Just asking. reply wizzwizz4 10 hours agorootparentUnless you have an electron microscope, work at Intel, or manage to find a hardware exploit, you are not getting the private key out of that chip, which, short of breaking the underlying cryptography, is the only way you&#x27;re getting at that data.Except, of course, if you put malware in the next build of your mobile app, and grab it before it&#x27;s encrypted. Which Signal easily could, and it probably wouldn&#x27;t be spotted for weeks. Fundamentally, it&#x27;s all about trusting other people. reply hanniabu 17 hours agoparentprevI assume you&#x27;re referring to the blockchain industry, but they&#x27;ve advanced cryptography a lot, specifically with zkproofs. reply desdenova 9 hours agorootparentNo, I&#x27;m referring to the FHE startups that are promising a lot of magic that isn&#x27;t really feasible, while failing to solve what is feasible. reply lucb1e 15 hours agorootparentprevI know of the concept of zero-knowledge proofs, but didn&#x27;t know that the blockchain industry advanced cryptography a lot in that area.

The Wikipedia article on zero-knowledge proof doesn&#x27;t seem to say reply hugodutka 11 hours agorootparentOne of the applications are ZK-Rollups [1] which allow developers to move heavy computation off a blockchain. The blockchain receives the results and only validates proofs that they are valid. This is especially useful on Ethereum because its computational throughput is pretty low.There&#x27;s also ZCash [2], which is a cryptocurrency that lets you make untraceable transactions. This is in stark contrast to Bitcoin or Ethereum, where transaction information is available publicly to everyone. They have a series of blog posts [3] on the math that actually makes it work under the hood.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ethereum.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;developers&#x2F;docs&#x2F;scaling&#x2F;zk-rollups&#x2F;[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;z.cash[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;electriccoin.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;snark-explain&#x2F; reply dumbfounder 11 hours agorootparentprevWith zk you can prove you own something or sign transactions without people tracking your entire history.

Previously, at the end of the day, the processor could only do useful work on unencrypted data.But something like \"analyze this list of customer records for fraud\" or \"analyze this proprietary data for trends\" has previously either required a lot of trust that your cloud provider isn&#x27;t going to siphon your data, or just required on-prem hardware that you cannot scale as easily.If \"math on encrypted data\" works, we could keep our data confidential while still sending of batches of it to be number-crunched at a cloud provider.Or even start talking about distributed &#x2F; peer-to-peer computing, where a swarm of users (or, say, businesses that wish to cooperate) can send compute jobs to each other without having to trust that the other members weren&#x27;t going to go snooping through the data that was sent. reply alwa 16 hours agorootparentAnd for that matter if I were a provider of some kind of computational service for hire, I (and my insurers) might feel a great deal of relief at the idea that we’re no longer having to sit on a big attractive ransomable pile of our clients’ data. reply Out_of_Characte 3 hours agorootparentDenial of service is still by far the most common tactic, encrypt the data and no one can use it. reply calamari4065 12 hours agorootparentprevWait, so they&#x27;re doing computation on encrypted data and inferring some information about the relationships between data in the encrypted set?How is that even possible? That seems to defeat the purpose of encryption, or at least show that our encryption is severely flawed.This is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of this and it&#x27;s kind of blowing my mind reply fiddlerwoaroof 12 hours agorootparentThe idea is the result is encrypted too such that, when the person that holds the key gets it back they can decrypt it and see the result. So you can run an inference algorithm on data without ever having to decrypt it and see what the data actually is.It seems to me that this intrinsically is vulnerable to side-channel attacks, but it will be interesting to see if we can avoid those with constant-time algorithms or something. reply PeterisP 8 hours agorootparentNo, FHE is not intrinsically vulnerable to any side-channel attacks, by definition; the properties hold no matter how the \"executor\" executes the operations and they include the assumption that obviously they can see (or change!) everything that happens during the execution.However, that effectively means that any FHE approach has to be \"anti-optimized\", always touching all the data that might get touched, always taking all the conditional paths, not just the worst case path as in constant time algorithms, since the execution must return the correct result for any encrypted input data.It&#x27;s not that you can \"see if we can avoid those with constant-time algorithms or something\", the basic table stakes (which all FHE methods actually implement) is the constant-time algorithm approach taken to the extreme and then squared.It does have \"some\" unavoidable performance impact because of that. reply fiddlerwoaroof 8 hours agorootparentI suspect that you’re right, but my concern is more about unknown unknowns here: new tech like this often has failure modes we can’t imagine until the tech itself becomes commonplace. reply l33t7332273 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat about this seems vulnerable to side channels? reply fiddlerwoaroof 11 hours agorootparentBecause, if you have a mechanism to run arbitrary computations on encrypted data, I’d be a bit concerned about an attacker running carefully crafted computations on the data and deducing information about the encrypted data based on how the ciphertext changes or the time&#x2F;memory usage of the computation.This isn’t really a particularly well-informed suspicion: it’s partly based on a sense that FHE is a “have your cake and eat it too” sort of technology that’s too good to be true and partly based on the recent discoveries that fairly well-understood things like speculative execution in CPUswere vulnerable to serious side-channel attacks. reply jkhdigital 5 hours agorootparentThere is no side-channel because FHE effectively considers the computational hardware itself to be the adversary. reply l33t7332273 7 hours agorootparentprevIf running computations on encrypted data is enough to compromise the integrity of the encryption then that encryption algorithm is not even EAV secure, and EAV secure is a pretty low bar. reply HeadsUpHigh 10 hours agorootparentprevzk proofs are used in public blockchains to transmit millions in value so I would assume they aren&#x27;t vulnerable to side channel attacks at least not on a superficial level. reply l33t7332273 11 hours agorootparentprevA homomorphism is a function so that f(ab) = f(a) f(b). So you can imagine the cloud customer wants to compute ab, but the use a homomorphic encryption function, f, to ask the cloud provider to computer f(ab) given f(a) and f(b).Then the customer decrypts f(ab). This doesn’t imply any weakness in encryption.FHE is a bit stronger than what I’ve described, but that’s the idea. reply noman-land 6 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty damn insane.

Nothing at scale yet.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spiralwiki.com&#x2F; reply azeemba 17 hours agorootparentprevI had written an intro level blog post exploring image analysis use HME: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;azeemba.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;homomorphic-encryption-with-images...One paper I used showed how X-rays can be analyzed without exposing the X-ray data itself.This can be generalized more to any situation where one party owns a proprietary algorithm and another party owns sensitive input data but they don&#x27;t trust each other.Modern LLMs are actually the perfect example. You want to use chatgpt but they don&#x27;t want to give you their model and you don&#x27;t want them to see your input. If HME was more efficient, you could use it so that the person executing the model never sees your real input. reply wanderingbort 16 hours agorootparentIf it’s just that the parties don’t trust each other then the cost of HME has to be compared to the current “state of the art” which is contracts and enforcement thereof.In practice, I don’t think those costs are that high because the rate of incident is low and the average damage is also low.Yes there are outlier instances of large breaches but these seem like high profile aircraft crashes considering how many entities have sensitive data. reply alwa 16 hours agorootparentI feel like trust is a spectrum, and the promise of these techniques is that they reduce the need for trust in the first place.We should consider what kinds of computational tasks today’s responsible parties (or their regulators, or their insurers) think of as too risky to casually trust to third parties under the status quo. For example with my block storage provably unintelligible if you don’t have the HSM I keep safely in my corporate dungeon, I’m comfortable not caring whose racks the encrypted blocks sit on. I’d have to vet those vendors a lot harder if they could read all my super secret diaries or whatever.And, for that matter, it’s on the service provider side too, right? Even the contractual, spit-and-handshake pinky-swear-based mode of enforcement comes with significant compliance costs for service providers, especially ones operating in regulated industries. Perhaps it’s not too much to hope that effective and efficient HME techniques might reduce those service providers’ compliance costs, and lower the barrier to entry for new competitors.I’m reminded how even non-tech people in my life became much more willing to trust their credit card details to online retailers once they felt like a little green lock icon made it “safe”. Of course a LOT changed over that same period, but still: the underlying contractual boundaries didn’t substantially change—in the US the customer, then as now, has only ever been responsible for a certain amount of fraud&#x2F;theft loss—but people’s risk attitudes updated when the security context changed, and it opened up vast new efficiencies and lines of business. reply wanderingbort 15 hours agorootparentIt’s not too much to hope that HME reduces those compliance costs. However, I believe it is too much to assume there will be any material adoption before it can demonstrate that reduction.Reduction of trust is not a value add, it is a cost reduction. Maybe that cost is blocking a valuable product&#x2F;service but either that product&#x2F;service’s value is less than the current cost of trust OR trust has to be far more costly in the context of the new product&#x2F;service.It’s only the latter that I find interesting which is why tend to be pretty hard on suggestions that this will do much for anything that currently exists. At best, it will improve profits marginally for those incumbents.What is something where the price of trust is so catastrophically high in modern society AND HME can reduce that cost by orders of magnitude? Let’s talk about that rather than HME. reply brendoelfrendo 16 hours agorootparentprevData incidents cause more problems than can easily be resolved with a contract lawsuit. Perhaps the data was siphoned by a 3rd party that hacked your vendor, or a malicious insider at your vendor sold it to a competitor. Sure, you can recoup some losses by suing your vendor for breach of contract, but once the data is leaked, it&#x27;s never secret again.And then there&#x27;s the example of businesses that work with lots of confidential customer data, like banks or doctors. Again, you can sue your vendor for breach of contract if they behave irresponsibly with your data, but your customers may not care; you&#x27;re going to suffer a hit to your reputation regardless of whether or not the breach was your fault. reply wanderingbort 16 hours agorootparentYou can say it’s insufficient but it is what it costs them today.I guess the better comparison is that cost in a financial statement plus some expected increase in revenue due to a “better” product.Again, I think you are correct in your analysis of the improvements but that contributes little to the revenue as explaining the benefit to most customers requires framing your existing product as potentially harmful to them. Educating them will be hard and it may result in an offsetting realization that they were unsafe before and as a result were paying too much. reply brendoelfrendo 6 hours agorootparentNot really, you would phrase it to your customers or investors as a way of mitigating risk. You can probably apply a price tag to that risk by estimating the impact of a data incident vs. the likelihood of one happening. Different businesses have different risk appetites, and I would hope that a board or C-Suite is thinking about what level of risk is acceptable for their business. reply wanderingbort 5 hours agorootparentMitigating risk is covered in the cost reduction side.Yes the C-Suite is thinking about and mitigating risk. They probably know the exact number for a given class of risk in terms of current mitigation costs. You have to beat that by a margin wide enough for them to take action.Even if you know their numbers and know you beat it by enough to warrant the deployment you will still get bumped if someone sells them a path to increasing revenue.The out I gave was to frame it as value added (more revenue) and that is where you risk devaluing your current product.If you frame it as cost reduction you are capped in both price and interest by the current, necessarily acceptable, levels of risk and cost of mitigations. replykoolba 16 hours agorootparentprev> One paper I used showed how X-rays can be analyzed without exposing the X-ray data itself.Is there any hope of getting the performance to the point where something like that would be feasible?

For example you could prove you&#x27;re an adult citizen with ID without revealing your ID number, picture, or any private information whatsoever. reply podnami 15 hours agorootparentprevThere are examples in cryptocurrency, where ZK proofs are all the rage. One use case is validating ownership of some amount of currency without knowing the actual amount, or verifying that a smart contract was executed correctly without revealing the specifics of the contracts internal state. Some blockchains use this in production, such as Polygons ZkEvm. reply noman-land 16 hours agorootparentprevThere are a few that I&#x27;ve thought about but the first one that comes to mind is proving you&#x27;re 21+ to an alcohol store cashier without handing over your ID with all your personal info. You could just give them a ZK proof that returns a true&#x2F;false and they could check it against encrypted data (signed by the DMV). reply wanderingbort 16 hours agorootparentWhy is that preferable over a message attesting “over 21” signed by the DMV?The hard parts here are retrofitting society to use a digital ID and how to prove that the human in front of you is attached to that digital ID.The solutions there all seem like dystopias where now instead of a bouncer looking at your ID for a few seconds, technology is taking pictures of you everywhere and can log that with location and time trivially. reply adastra22 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not. And since it is also 10000x slower than merely checking a signed number, nobody is interested in doing this. reply noman-land 16 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t have to be a digital ID, it can just be encrypted data encoded on a regular ID on a QR code.Age depends on timestamp. The encrypted data is stored on the ID and signed by the DMV, with a function that can be run by the bouncer&#x27;s scanning machine that plugs in a now() timestamp, and receives a boolean in return. The DMV doesn&#x27;t even need to be involved after the issuance of the ID and no network access is needed for this calculation.No one&#x27;s location was tracked and no one&#x27;s picture was taken and now a bouncer who fancies you can&#x27;t turn up at your house after glancing at your ID. reply captn3m0 16 hours agorootparentAge verification (without leaking other PII) was the illustrative scenario for W3C Verified Credentials (it lets you use a validating authority to sign specific subset of your schema).There’s lots of other ways to solve the problem for verification&#x2F;signing use cases tbh. Homomorphic encryption shines best when you are looking at more complex calculations than just a Boolean result - such as tax calculations.Can you submit your financial information and have your taxes calculated without revealing the amounts involved? Can you apply filters to an image without having the image readable by the server? It essentially allows us to “trust a remote server” in scenarios where one wouldn’t usually. reply jkhdigital 5 hours agorootparentStill doesn’t quite justify homomorphic encryption if the computations involved are mundane (like tax calculations). The true use case is when the computation itself is proprietary, so that users don’t want to reveal their data but the provider also doesn’t want to divulge their algorithm. This is why ML models or finely tuned search engines are the examples most commonly cited, but of course those are also far outside the scale that could be achieved. reply Terr_ 10 hours agorootparentprev> No one&#x27;s location was tracked and no one&#x27;s picture was takenI assume you mean the bouncer didn&#x27;t take a photo, they just looked at the DMV photo embedded in the ID and did a visual comparison in their meat brain.If there&#x27;s no photo anywhere, how does the bouncer know I&#x27;m not using someone else&#x27;s ID? reply wanderingbort 16 hours agorootparentprevHow do you know that the bouncers scanning machine didn’t log the interaction?The whole value prop is built on not trusting that bouncer and by extension their hardware.Everything would have to be encrypted leading to the bouncer also needing to establish that this opaque identifier actually belongs to you. This is where some picture or biometric comes into play and since the bouncer cannot evaluate it with their own wetware you are surrendering more data to a device you cannot trust.They also cannot trust your device. So, I don’t see a scenario where you can prove ownership of the ID to a person without their device convincing them of it. reply OJFord 16 hours agorootparentprevAll sorts - anything where you today give your data to some SaaS (and they encrypt it at rest, sure), and they then provide you some insight based on it or allow you to do something with it (by decrypting it, crunching numbers, spitting out the answer, and then encrypting the source data again) could potentially be done without the decryption (or the keys to make it possible).Concretely (and simplistically) - I give you two numbers, 2 & 2, but they&#x27;re encrypted so you don&#x27;t know what they are, and you add them together for me, but that&#x27;s also encrypted so you don&#x27;t even know that the sum of the inputs I gave was 4.

Basically, any time you want someone else to host the data, while you can also do queries&#x2F;computations on it.That now generalizes to any computation (not just addition), because there is a logically complete set of primitive operations for which fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) can be done.Caveats:1) You can&#x27;t actually do e.g. while loops with run time unknown. All such FHE computations are done by generating a fixed size boolean circuit for a given input size. It&#x27;s \"Turing-complete\" in the sense that you can size up the circuit to any input size, but it wouldn&#x27;t directly implement an unbounded while loop -- you have to generate a different \"program\" (circuit) for each input size.2) All such computations must have a fixed output size -- else it leaks information about the data inside. So allowable computations would be like, \"give me the first 30 bytes of the result of querying for names in the set that begin with A\". If there are no results, the output still has to be 30 bytes.3) For similar reasons, any FHE computation must look at all bits of the input (otherwise, it leaks info about what&#x27;s in them). \"See if this value is in the set\" can&#x27;t just jump to the relevant section.4) The untrusted third party knows what computation you&#x27;re doing (at least at a low level), just not the data it&#x27;s being performed on or the result.5) As you might have expected from 3), there&#x27;s a massive blowup in resources to do it. There can be improvements, but some blowups are inherent to FHE. reply littlestymaar 15 hours agorootparentprevFunctional encryption is even cooler than FHE (but even more prohibitively expensive) reply j2kun 13 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also not complete: only a handful of functions are known to have functional encryption schemes. reply noman-land 15 hours agorootparentprevGot any cool links to read about it? reply ChrisArchitect 17 hours agoprevOriginal article submitted a few times weeks ago:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=38164732 reply I_am_tiberius 15 hours agoprevAs most likely lots of cryptographers read this, I have a question.

    "title": "The Importance of Greg Brockman as a Co-founder for Startup Success",
    "originLink": "https://blog.samaltman.com/greg",
    "originBody": "Greg A lot of people ask me what the ideal cofounder looks like. I now have an answer: Greg Brockman. Every successful startup I know has at least one person who provides the force of will to make the startup happen. I’d thought a lot about this in the abstract while advising YC startups, but until OpenAI I hadn’t observed up close someone else drive the formation of a startup. OpenAI wouldn’t have happened without Greg. He commits quickly and fully to things. I organized a group dinner early on to talk about what such an organization might look like, and drove him home afterwards. Greg asked me questions for the first half of the drive back to San Francisco, then declared he was in, and started planning logistics for the rest of the drive. From then on he was fully in, with an average email response time of about 5 minutes to anything. Elon and I were both busy with day jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a very high-latency connection. He recruited the founding team. Greg is a world-class recruiter (he plans every detail of interviews, heavily researches candidate’s backgrounds, sends thoughtful and persistent followups, and so on), and I now believe even more strongly that someone on the founding team has to be an amazing recruiter. He’s incredibly open to feedback. Large or small, he’s always willing to hear it, never gets offended, and processes it very quickly. I once suggested to him that he wasn't communicating a bold enough vision for the organization, and the next time I heard him talk about it (and every time since) it was a perfectly calibrated explanation of how we were going to succeed at something that really mattered. Even on non-traditional ideas, like when I suggested he co-lead the organization with Ilya, he was always open-minded and thoughtful. Greg also played the role of ‘non-technical cofounder’, which is a misnomer because most people who know him will say something like “Greg is the most productive engineer I know”. But he took on all the non-technical roles at the beginning, defining the culture, making offers, organizing offsites, letting everyone work out of his apartment, ordering supplies, cleaning up after meals, etc. It's important to have someone great in this role at a small startup—many people gloss over it. Without someone dedicated to finding a solution to all problems, no matter how difficult, eventually a large problem will come along and kill you while you’re still weak. Founding teams need a Chief Optimist to rally everyone to press on despite the difficulties, and it’s always hard on that person because they can’t really lean on anyone else in the hardest times. You for sure need great technical talent on a founding team, but make sure you also have someone like Greg. If they’re the same person, then you’ve hit the jackpot.",

He worked long hours, was pretty much aware of everything happening at the company both in the US and off-shore, could talk technical details with the tech peeps, and business stuff with the non-tech folks. He was always on top of things and unblocking people all over the org. He also has the great ability to remember things very well, even after a few months have passed by.Even though he was CTO and incredibly busy, he would find time to spend with individual engineers. Once he spent an hour pair-programming with me on a difficult issue. Even though his time was obviously not spent coding (and hadn&#x27;t for years), it was a very productive session.The founder acknowledge he really couldn&#x27;t have done it without him, or someone like him on the team.

The question is will they be able to recruit a team that can actually build competitive models? Ilya Sutksevers don&#x27;t grow on trees. Maybe they&#x27;ll just get a team good enough to specialize Llama2, since Altman&#x2F;Brockman seem to think what&#x27;s lacking in this space is glitzy products, app stores, b2b integrations, etc. Maybe OpenAI starts to open source everything and Altman&#x2F;Brockman can have their cake and eat it, too. reply loveparade 6 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re massively overestimating the skills needed to build \"competitive models\". Researchers like Ilya were essential several years ago when OpenAI got started, because at that time nobody even knew what to build or how to go about it. It was all research, and OpenAI was solely focused on RL. But these days, LLM code is 95%+ data and infrastructure engineering and very little novel research. Even things like LLM speedups via new attention mechanisms are more engineering than they are research.Above all else, what you need to build competitive models is a huge amount of money and access to compute. Money alone doesn&#x27;t solve that either due to the global hardware shortage. You are competing for a globally limited pool of hardware with all other companies. reply p1esk 2 hours agorootparentGoogle and Meta have more money and more compute than OpenAI.

Good founders, bad founders, in the eyes of the beholder.I&#x27;m pretty sure I have a completely different opinion on what constitutes a good founder and what constitutes a bad one compared to Sam Altman, fortunately I don&#x27;t have enough clout to make authoritative statements on the subject. reply simonh 9 hours agorootparentprevExcept that he only found out there was a correlation between startup success and responsiveness by doing a historical analysis. reply xapata 1 hour agorootparentStartup success is random enough that it&#x27;ll be correlated with a great variety of interesting things.

The board coup was organized by cofounder&#x2F;Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever who apparently wants OpenAI&#x27;s original slow moving safety vision.It&#x27;s speculated Sam Altman and Greg Brockman may start a new AI company.So now seems like a good time to mention a few very high-level points in case they read it:1. I love Sam Altman&#x27;s ship early and often inclinations, even if that apparently got him fired. OpenAI was such a breath of fresh air compared to sclerotic companies like Google that can invent the Transformer architecture yet be organizationally incapable of shipping ChatGPT-level tools for years due to overly conservative safety concerns2. I hate OpenAI (or Sam Altman&#x27;s?) apparently puritanical inclination to anything considered Not Safe For Work, especially for paid API usage. Why not allow people to build and sell virtual partner chat bots with explicit NSFW content?3. I dislike his apparent inclination to build a regulatory moat to block others from developing advanced AI -- it&#x27;s easy to interpret this as purely in the self-interest of OpenAI shareholdersWithout Sam Altman&#x27;s inclination to move fast I imagine OpenAI may become slow, sclerotic and less capable of shipping early, like what Google has become.Good luck Sam, and keep on shipping! reply capableweb 13 hours agoparent> 2.

There is a lot if NSFW content on Internet. What could be different, regulatory wise, this time? reply peddling-brink 11 hours agorootparentBecause current porn companies know the law, and toe the line if they want to stick around.AI doesn’t. Image generators know what naked people look like, and they know what children look like.

For example, children porn via AI? My question that is more epistemological and take aside ethics is if you can stop AI to produce those images when all the tools are available. I can compare this (not in ethics terms but in feasibility) to the US government push to control the information about how to make bombs or cryptography in the 90s. They couldn&#x27;t but they can prosecute people who take advantage of this technologies to commit a crime. I don&#x27;t know how this applies to people watching children porn that is produced by AI.

If yours is lost and you still have cash, you can generally go find a new one the same day and borrow a ride from someone if you really need to.That&#x27;s not necessarily true for (say) the rare high-end graphics board you use for running local inferences. It&#x27;s also expensive -- even less expensive than the car -- but replacing it can be a bigger deal and cause a complete interruption.There are countless experienced late-career generalists who can keep projects moving by contributing to critical, smart support. I&#x27;m one of them. We&#x27;re extremely valuable indeed.But there really are far fewer people who were ahead of the curve and years-deep into the AI research central to OpenAI&#x27;s entire existence. Those people are beyond critical, they&#x27;re essential.That doesn&#x27;t make them better people, or smarter people, or in any other way elite.

Most of them got lucky with some relatively dumb or straightforward product in the middle of a bubble and are not responsible for some major leap forward in technology. reply moralestapia 14 hours agoprev:&#x27;) reply jackblemming 14 hours agoprevSo what did Sam actually do besides a social media startup that was more or less a flop into being gifted a high position at ycombinator where he then had a few good investments during literally the easiest time to invest in tech history?

    "originBody": "Tech/ Meta/ Artificial Intelligence Meta disbanded its Responsible AI team Meta disbanded its Responsible AI team / A new report says Meta’s Responsible AI team is now working on other AI teams. By Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Nov 18, 2023, 9:24 PM UTC| Share this story Illustration by Nick Barclay / The Verge Meta has reportedly broken up its Responsible AI (RAI) team as it puts more of its resources into generative artificial intelligence. The Information broke the news today, citing an internal post it had seen. According to the report, most RAI members will move to the company’s generative AI product team, while others will work on Meta’s AI infrastructure. The company regularly says it wants to develop AI responsibly and even has a page devoted to the promise, where the company lists its “pillars of responsible AI,” including accountability, transparency, safety, privacy, and more. The Information’s report quotes Jon Carvill, who represents Meta, as saying that the company will “continue to prioritize and invest in safe and responsible AI development.” He added that although the company is splitting the team up, those members will “continue to support relevant cross-Meta efforts on responsible AI development and use.” Meta did not respond to a request for comment by press time. The team already saw a restructuring earlier this year, which Business Insider wrote included layoffs that left RAI “a shell of a team.” That report went on to say the RAI team, which had existed since 2019, had little autonomy and that its initiatives had to go through lengthy stakeholder negotiations before they could be implemented. Related Meta sets GPT-4 as the bar for its next AI model, says a new report Meta explains how AI influences what we see on Facebook and Instagram RAI was created to identify problems with its AI training approaches, including whether the company’s models are trained with adequately diverse information, with an eye toward preventing things like moderation issues on its platforms. Automated systems on Meta’s social platforms have led to problems like a Facebook translation issue that caused a false arrest, WhatsApp AI sticker generation that results in biased images when given certain prompts, and Instagram’s algorithms helping people find child sexual abuse materials. Moves like Meta’s and a similar one by Microsoft early this year come as world governments race to create regulatory guardrails for artificial intelligence development. The US government entered into agreements with AI companies and President Biden later directed government agencies to come up with AI safety rules. Meanwhile, the European Union has published its AI principles and is still struggling to pass its AI Act.

    "commentBody": "Meta disbanded its Responsible AI teamHacker NewspastloginMeta disbanded its Responsible AI team (theverge.com) 200 points by jo_beef 6 hours ago| hidepastfavorite156 comments seanhunter 2 hours agoIt never made any organizational sense for me to have a \"responsible AI team\" in the first place. Every team doing AI work should be responsible and should think about the ethical (and legal at a bare minimum baseline) dimension of what they are doing. Having that concentrated in a single team means that team becomes a bottleneck where they have to vet all AI work everyone else does for responsibility and&#x2F;or everyone else gets a free pass to develop irresponsible AI which doesn&#x27;t sound great to me.At some point AI becomes important enough to a company (and mature enough as a field) that there is a specific part of legal&#x2F;compliance in big companies that deals with the concrete elements of AI ethics and compliance and maybe trains everyone else, but everyone doing AI has to do responsible AI. It can&#x27;t be a team.For me this is exactly like how big Megacorps have an \"Innovation team\"[1] and convince themselves that makes them an innovative company. No - if you&#x27;re an innovative company then you foster innovation everywhere. If you have an \"innovation team\" that&#x27;s where innovation goes to die.[1] In my experience they make a \"really cool\" floor with couches and everyone thinks it&#x27;s cool to draw on the glass walls of the conference rooms instead of whiteboards. reply makeitdouble 1 hour agoparentIsn&#x27;t it the same as a legal team, another point you touch upon ?I don&#x27;t think we solved the need for a specialized team dealing with legality, feels hard to expect companies to solve it for ethics. reply TeMPOraL 34 minutes agorootparentWe haven&#x27;t formalized ethics to the point of it being a multiplayer puzzle game for adults. reply ben_w 2 minutes agorootparentIsn&#x27;t that what religion in general, and becoming a Doctor of Theology in particular, is?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Doctor_of_Theology reply paulddraper 55 minutes agorootparentprevI suppose it depends on the relative demands of legal vs AI ethics reply makeitdouble 28 minutes agorootparentWell, I guess we have the answer when it comes to Meta. reply timkam 1 hour agoparentprevFully agree. Central functions of these types do not scale. Even with more mundane objectives, like operational excellence, organizations have learned that centralization leads to ivory tower nothing-burgers. Most of the resources should go to where the actual work gets done, as little as possible should be managed centrally (perhaps a few ops and thought leadership fluff folks...). reply mcny 34 minutes agorootparentIt works for things you can automate. For example, at Microsoft they have some kind of dependency bot such as when you have newtonsoft installed but have versionAt some point you need to trust that the people using the tools are adults.Ah yes.

These companies usually release AI models, for which the training phase is arguably more important than the usage phase when it comes to ethics. It would be like if the manufacturer pre-calibrated the bazooka for a certain target. Sure, whoever uses it after may still use it in another, unethical way but the point is there is already a bias. It is important to consider ethical implications of the training materials used, especially when scraping the internet for material. Now, is a whole team needed? Maybe not, but you can&#x27;t dismiss it that easily. reply torginus 1 hour agoparentprevI dislike the weapon analogy, because it implies that proliferation of AI (ergo everyone running an LLM on their PCs for code completion or for the ability to speak to a home assistant) is akin to everybody having a cache of unlicensed firearms.It has been the agenda of most FAANG corporations (with the notable exception of Apple) to turn the computers average people own into mere thin clients with all the computing resources.Luckily, before the cloud era, the idea that people can and should own powerful personal computers was the normal. If PCs were invented today, I guess there would be people raising ethical concerns about regular citizens owning PCs that can hack into NASA. reply JoshuaDavid 1 hour agorootparentThere were in fact concerns about normal people having access to strong cryptography https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Crypto_Wars reply makeitdouble 1 hour agoparentprev> Whoever ultimately owns the AI (or the Bazooka) will always dictate how and where the particular tool is used.Your take confuses me, because in this case the owner is Meta. So yes, they have to think about what tools they make (\"should we design a bazooka\") and how they&#x27;ll use what they made (\"what&#x27;s the target and when to pull the trigger ?\")They disbanded the team that was tasked with thinking about both.From the article:> RAI was created to identify problems with its AI training approaches, including whether the company’s models are trained with adequately diverse information, with an eye toward preventing things like moderation issues on its platforms. Automated systems on Meta’s social platforms have led to problems like a Facebook translation issue that caused a false arrest reply vasco 30 minutes agorootparentYou will notice the goal of the team wasn&#x27;t to make the world a better place, it was to reduce customer support &#x2F; moderation costs. reply petters 2 hours agoparentprevIf the bazooka manufacturer only offers shooting rockets through an API where they can check the target before launching, they would be able to have some say about which targets are hit.> Whoever ultimately owns the AI (or the Bazooka)This is not the user in most cases. So a responsible AI can make sense. I believe you don&#x27;t think AI can be dangerous, but some people do and from their point of view having a team for this makes sense. reply renewiltord 42 minutes agoparentprevI agree with you about AI ethicists (and in general someone whose job is only ethics is usually a grifter) but OpenAI’s safety team was a red team (at least a few months ago), testing its ability to escape boxes by giving it almost the power to. They were the guys who had the famous “watch the AI lie to the Upworker I hired so he’ll do the work” guys.So the structure matters. Ethicists who produce papers on why ethics matters and the like are kind of like security, compliance, and legal people at your company who can only say no to your feature.But Google’s Project Zero team is a capable team and produces output that actually help Google and everyone. In a particularly moribund organization, they really stand out.I think the model is sound. If your safety, security, compliance, and legal teams believe that the only acceptable risk is from a mud ball buried in the ground then you don’t have any of those functions because that’s doable by an EA with an autoresponder. What this effective team does is minimize your risks on this front while allowing you to build your objective. reply seydor 7 minutes agoprevThe responsibility of AI should lie in the hands of users, but right now , no company is even close to giving AI users the power to shape their product in responsible ways. The legal system already covers for these externalities, and all attempts at covering their ass have resulted to stupider and less useful systems.They are literally leaking more and more users to the open source models because of it. So, in retrospect, maybe it would be better if they didn&#x27;t disband it. reply Geisterde 30 minutes agoprevCompletely absent a single example of what this team positively contributed. Perhaps we should look at a track record of the past few years and see how effective meta has been in upholding the truth, it doesnt look pretty. reply RcouF1uZ4gsC 5 hours agoprevBecause Meta is releasing their models to the public, I consider them the most ethical company doing AI at scale.Keeping AI models closed under the guise of “ethics”, is I think the most unethical stance as it makes people more dependent on the arbitrary decisions, goals, and priorities of big companies, instead being allowed to define “alignment” for themselves. reply wilsonnb3 4 hours agoparent> instead being allowed to define “alignment” for themselves.Yeah, that is the whole point - not wanting bad actors to be able to define \"alignment\" for themselves.Not sure how that is unethical. reply vasco 16 minutes agorootparentLet&#x27;s say someone figures out alignment. We develop models that when plugged into the original ones either in the training as extra stages or as a filter that runs on top.

I wouldn&#x27;t trust one with a sauerkraut recipe, let alone the instructions for a doomsday device.

A synthetic virus could kill a large fraction of humanity. reply Roark66 1 hour agorootparentprevSeriously? This is just silly. Everyone knows the barrier to terrorists using bio weapons is not specialist knowledge, but access to labs, equipment, reagents etc.It&#x27;s the whole Guttenberg&#x27;s printing press argument. \"Whoaa hold on now, what do you mean you want knowledge to be freely available to the vulgar masses?\"The only difference with LLMs is that you do not have to search for this knowledge by yourself, you get a very much hallucination prone AI to tell you the answers. If we extend this argument further why don&#x27;t we restrict access to public libraries, scientific research and neuter Google even more. And what about Wikipedia? reply cubefox 1 hour agorootparentNeither Wikipedia nor public libraries allow instructions to make weapons of mass destruction. reply xcdzvyn 24 minutes agorootparentAll of the information AI regurgitates is either already available online as part of its corpus (and therefore the AI plays no particular role in access to that information), or completely made up (which is likely to kill more terrorists than anyone else!)Reiterating other comments, terrorists can&#x27;t make bioweapons because they lack the facilities and prerequisites, not because they&#x27;re incompetent. reply unicornmama 1 hour agoparentprevMeta’s products have damaged and continue to damage the mental health of hundreds of millions of people, including young children and teenagers.Whatever their motivation to release models, it’s a for-profit business tactic first.

Any safety controls on a model are easily stripped off once its weights are public.Usually I love open source software. Most of my career has been spent writing open source code. But this is powerful and dangerous technology. I don’t believe that nuclear weapons should be open source and available to all either. reply ActorNightly 27 minutes agorootparentYou have a technically valid viewpoint, its just utterly impractical if you carry it to its logical conclusion.If something that can be used for good can also be used for nefarious purposes, you claim that some entity should exert a modicum of control over that thing to prevent it from being used for nefarious purposes.Now think about all the things in peoples day to day life that can be used for good, but also can be used for nefarious purposes, and see if you would be ok with your argument being applied for those. reply ikari_pl 1 hour agorootparentprevare they an ethical company, though? reply OezMaster 1 hour agorootparentIs one division responsible for the crimes of another division, especially in a large corporation? reply MattHeard 2 hours agorootparentprevMaybe this news should challenge your priors, then? reply xvector 1 hour agorootparentThat&#x27;s assuming this division actually did something beneficial to begin with, and if they did, that they are the only ones responsible for \"responsible AI\" development at Meta. It is in all likelihood just a re-org being blown out of proportion. reply speedylight 5 hours agoprevI honestly believe the best to make AI responsibly is to make it open source. That way no single entity has total control over it, and researchers can study them to better understand how they can be used nefariously as well as in a good way—doing that allows us to build defenses to minimize the risks, and reap the benefits. Meta is already doing that, but other companies and organizations should do that as well. reply martindbp 2 hours agoparentI&#x27;m not a doomer but I honestly don&#x27;t understand this argument. If releasing model as open source helps researchers determine if it&#x27;s safe, what about when it&#x27;s not deemed safe? Then it&#x27;s already out there, on the hard drives of half of 4chan. It&#x27;s much easier and cheaper to fine-tune a model, distil and quantize it and put it on a killer drone, than it is to train it from scratch.On the other hand I totally relate with the idea that it could be preferable that everyday has access to advanced AI and not just large companies and nation states. reply 123yawaworht456 1 hour agorootparentwhat purpose does a LLM serve on a killing drone, exactly? reply martindbp 1 hour agorootparentOpen source models in general. Meta has for instance released DINO which is a self supervised transformer model. LLMs are also going multi modal (see LLaVA for instance). The name \"LLM\" has stuck but they should really be called Large Transformer Models. LeCun is working on self supervised visual world models (I-JEPA) which if successful and released could form the basis for killer drones. It&#x27;s still a lot of engineering work to fine tune and put a model like this on embedded hardware on a drone, but at some point it might be easy enough for small groups of determined people to pull it off. reply Vetch 29 minutes agorootparentFor a drone, an LLM derived solution is far too slow, unreliable, heavy and not fit for purpose. Developments in areas like optical flow, better small CNNs for vision, adaptive control and sensor fusion are what&#x27;s needed. When neural networks are used, they are small, fast, specialized and cheap to train.A multimodal or segmentation algorithm is not the solution for bee-level path planning, obstacle avoidance or autonomous navigation. Getting LLMs to power a robot for household tasks with low latency to action and in an energy efficient manner is challenging enough, before talking about high-speed, highly maneuverable drones. reply fatherzine 59 minutes agorootparentpreva multimodal llm is a general purpose device to churn sensor inputs into a sequence of close to optimal decisions. the &#x27;language&#x27; part is there to reduce the friction of the interface with humans, it&#x27;s not an inherent limitation of the llm. not too farfetched to imagine a scenario where you point to a guy in a crowd and tell a drone to go get him, and the drone figures out a close to optimal sequence of decisions to make it so. reply IshKebab 57 minutes agorootparentprevI think GPT-4V could probably make high level decisions about what actions to take.Not really practical at the moment of course since you can&#x27;t put 8 A100s on a drone. reply fatherzine 24 minutes agorootparentthere are rumors that the latest gen drones in ukraine use crude embedded vision ai to increase terminal accuracy. launch and iterate, this will only get more lethal. reply Ericson2314 5 hours agoparentprevGetting the results is nice but that&#x27;s \"shareware\" not \"free software\" (or, for a more modern example, that is like companies submitting firmware binary blobs into mainline Linux).Free software means you have to be able to build the final binary from source.

I&#x27;ve always seen concern about methanol in moonshine but I presume it came from intentional contamination from evil bootleggers. It&#x27;s difficult to get a wash containing enough methanol to meaningfully concentrate in the first place if you&#x27;re making whiskey or rum. Maybe with fruit wine and hard cider there&#x27;s a bit more.The physics of distillation kind of have your back here too. The lower temperature fractions with acetone and methanol always come out first during distillation (the \"heads\") and every resource and distiller will tell you to learn the taste and smell, then throw them out. The taste and smell of heads are really distinctive. A slow distillation to more effectively concentrate methanol also makes it easier to separate out. But even if you don&#x27;t separate the heads from the hearts, the methanol in any traditional wash is dilute enough that it&#x27;ll only give you a headache.I think it&#x27;s extremely hard to build a still that appears to work but creates a high methanol end product. reply withinboredom 52 minutes agorootparentThis sounds like something I don&#x27;t want to test the hard way. reply paulmd 8 minutes agorootparentprevthere’s no reason bootleggers would attempt to deliberately kill customers, at most you can argue about potential carelessness but in contrast there was indeed one party deliberately introducing methanol into the booze supply.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC2972336&#x2F;#:~:tex.... reply didibus 3 hours agorootparentprevI think the question mark is if AI is more akin to the nuclear bomb of the Internet.If you don&#x27;t put barriers, how quickly will AI bots take over people in online discourse, interaction and publication?This isn&#x27;t just for the sake of keeping the Internet an interesting place free of bots and fraud and all that.But I&#x27;ve also heard that it&#x27;s about improving AI itself.

And a comparable number of world governments (At least in the US the best researchers in this field are at these companies, not in academia or government. China may be different.)This makes it sound like a \"security by obscurity\" situation, and on a long enough timeline it may be. Without World War 2, without the Manhattan Project, and without the looming Cold War how long would it have taken for Humanity to construct a nuclear bomb? An extra 10 years? 20? 50? Hard to know. Regardless, there is a possibility that for things like AI, with extra time comes the ability to better understand and build those defenses before they&#x27;re needed.2) It might also require an amount of computing capacity that only a dozen companies&#x2F;governments have.If you open source all the work you remove the guard rails for the growth or what people focus investments on. It also means that hostile nations like Iran or North Korea who may not have the research talent but could acquire the raw compute could utilize it for unknown goals.Not to mention that what nefarious parties on the internet would use it for.

Before the launch of GPT-3 in 2020, the alignment community had nothing even remotely like a general intelligence to empirically study, and spent its time doing theoretical research, engaging in philosophical arguments on LessWrong, and occasionally performing toy experiments in reinforcement learning.> The Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), which was at the forefront of theoretical AI safety research during this period, has since admitted that its efforts have utterly failed. Other agendas, such as “assistance games”, are still being actively pursued but have not been significantly integrated into modern deep learning systems— see Rohin Shah’s review here, as well as Alex Turner’s comments here. Finally, Nick Bostrom’s argument in Superintelligence, that value specification is the fundamental challenge to safety, seems dubious in light of LLM&#x27;s ability to perform commonsense reasoning.[2]> At best, these theory-first efforts did very little to improve our understanding of how to align powerful AI. And they may have been net negative, insofar as they propagated a variety of actively misleading ways of thinking both among alignment researchers and the broader public. Some examples include the now-debunked analogy from evolution, the false distinction between “inner” and “outer” alignment, and the idea that AIs will be rigid utility maximizing consequentialists (here, here, and here).> During an AI pause, I expect alignment research would enter another “winter” in which progress stalls, and plausible-sounding-but-false speculations become entrenched as orthodoxy without empirical evidence to falsify them. While some good work would of course get done, it’s not clear that the field would be better off as a whole. And even if a pause would be net positive for alignment research, it would likely be net negative for humanity’s future all things considered, due to the pause’s various unintended consequences. We’ll look at that in detail in the final section of the essay. reply systemvoltage 4 hours agoparentprevIs it just the model that needs to be open source?I thought the big secret sauce is the sources of data that is used to train the models.

The only defense against AI at this point is more powerful AI, and we just have to hope that:1.) there is an equilibrium that can be reached2.) the journey to and stabilizing at said equilibrium is compatible with human lifeI have a feeling that the swings of AI stabilizing among adversarial agents is going to happen at a scale of destruction that is very taxing on our civilizations.Think of it this way, every time there&#x27;s a murder suicide or a mass shooting type thing, I basically write that off as \"this individual is doing as much damage as they possibly could, with whatever they could reasonably get their hands on to do so.\" When you start getting some of these agents unlocked and accessible to these people, eventually you&#x27;re going to start having people with no regard for the consequences requesting that their agents do things like try to knock out transformer stations and parts of the power grid; things of this nature. And the amount of mission critical things on unsecured networks, or using outdated cryptography, etc, all basically sitting there waiting, is staggering.For a human to even be able to probe this space means that they have to be pretty competent and are probably less nihilistic, detached, and destructive than your typical shooter type. Meanwhile, you get a reasonable agent in the hands of a shooter type, and they can be any midwit looking to wreak havoc on their way out.So I suspect we&#x27;ll have a few of these incidents, and then the white hat adversarial AIs will come online in earnest, and they&#x27;ll begin probing, themselves, and alerting to us to major vulnerabilities and maybe even fixing them. As I said, eventually this behavior will stabilize, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that the blows dealt in this adversarial relationship don&#x27;t carry the cost of thousands of human lives.And this is all within the subset of cases that are going to be \"AI with nefarious motivations as directed by user(s).\" This isn&#x27;t even touching on scenarios in which an AI might be self motivated against our interests reply camdenlock 1 hour agoprevSuch teams are just panicked by the idea that these models might not exclusively push their preferred ideology (critical social justice).

That&#x27;s it. Otherwise there&#x27;s really no point.It&#x27;s the psychological aspect of blame that influences the liability. If I wanted to make a dirty bomb it&#x27;s harder to blame google for it if I found the results through google, easier to blame AI for it if I found the results from an LLM. Mainly because the data was transferred from the servers directly to me when it&#x27;s an LLM. But the logical route of getting that information is essentially the same.So because of this companies like Meta (who really don&#x27;t give a shit) spend so much time emphasizing on this safety bs.

Yes, it’s ‘autocomplete’—but you didn’t think through what it means to have a really good autocomplete.” This got me thinking about what I do at work, for example in a research meeting. I spend a lot of time doing “glorified autocomplete” in the style of a well-trained chatbot: Someone describes some problem, I listen and it reminds me of a related issue I’ve thought about before, and I’m acting as a sort of FAQ, but more like a chatbot than a FAQ in that the people who are talking with me do not need to navigate through the FAQ to find the answer that is most relevant to them; I’m doing that myself and giving a response. I do that sort of thing a lot in meetings, and it can work well, indeed often I think this sort of shallow, associative response can be more effective than whatever I’d get from a direct attack on the problem in question. After all, the people I’m talking with have already thought for awhile about whatever it is they’re working on, and my initial thoughts may well be in the wrong direction, or else my thoughts are in the right direction but are just retracing my collaborators’ past ideas. From the other direction, my shallow thoughts can be useful in representing insights from problems that these collaborators had not ever thought about much before. Nonspecific suggestions on multilevel modeling or statistical graphics or simulation or whatever can really help! At some point, though, I’ll typically have to bite the bullet and think hard, not necessarily reaching full understanding in the sense of mentally embedding the problem at hand into a coherent schema or logical framework, but still going through whatever steps of logical reasoning that I can. This feels different than autocomplete; it requires an additional level of focus. Often I need to consciously “flip the switch,” as it were, to turn on that focus and think rigorously. Other times, I’m doing autocomplete and either come to a sticking point or encounter an interesting idea, and this causes me to stop and think. It’s almost like the difference between jogging and running. I can jog and jog and jog, thinking about all sorts of things and not feeling like I’m expending much effort, my legs pretty much move up and down of their own accort . . . but then if I need to run, that takes concentration. Here’s another example. Yesterday I participated in the methods colloquium in our political science department. It was Don Green and me and a bunch of students, and the structure was that Don asked me questions, I responded with various statistics-related and social-science-related musings and stories, students followed up with questions, I responded with more stories, etc. Kinda like the way things go here on the blog, but spoken rather than typed. Anyway, the point is that most of my responses were a sort of autocomplete—not in a word-by-word chatbot style, more at a larger level of chunkiness, for example something would remind me of a story, and then I’d just insert the story into my conversation—but still at this shallow, pleasant level. Mellow conversation with no intellectual or social strain. But then, every once in awhile, I’d pull up short and have some new thought, some juxtaposition that had never occurred to me before, and I’d need to think things through. This also happens when I give prepared talks. My prepared talks are not super-well prepared—this is on purpose, as I find that too much preparation can inhibit flow. In any case, I’ll often finding myself stopping and pausing to reconsider something or another. Even when describing something I’ve done before, there are times when I feel the need to think it all through logically, as if for the first time. I noticed something similar when I saw my sister give a talk once: she had the same habit of pausing to work things out from first principles. I don’t see this behavior in every academic talk, though; different people have different styles of presentation. This seems related to models of associative and logical reasoning in psychology. As a complete non-expert in that area, I’ll turn to wikipedia: The foundations of dual process theory likely come from William James. He believed that there were two different kinds of thinking: associative and true reasoning. . . . images and thoughts would come to mind of past experiences, providing ideas of comparison or abstractions. He claimed that associative knowledge was only from past experiences describing it as “only reproductive”. James believed that true reasoning could enable overcoming “unprecedented situations” . . . That sounds about right! After describing various other theories from the past hundred years or so, Wikipedia continues: Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes. This sounds a bit different from what I was talking about above. When I’m doing “glorified autocomplete” thinking, I’m still thinking—this isn’t automatic and barely conscious behavior along the lines of driving to work along a route I’ve taken a hundred times before—; I’m just thinking in a shallow way, trying to “autocomplete” the answer. It’s pattern-matching more than it is logical reasoning. P.S. Just to be clear, I have a lot of respect for Hinton’s work; indeed, Aki and I included Hinton’s work in our brief review of 10 pathbreaking research articles during the past 50 years of statistics and machine learning. Also, I’m not trying to make a hardcore, AI-can’t-think argument. Although not myself a user of large language models, I respect Bob Carpenter’s respect for them. I think that where Hinton got things wrong in the quote that led off this post was not in his characterization of chatbots, but rather in his assumptions about human thinking, in not distinguishing autocomplete-like associative reasoning with logical thinking. Maybe Hinton’s problem in understanding this is that he’s just too logical! At work, I do a lot of what seems like autocomplete—and, as I wrote above, I think it’s useful—but if I had more discipline, maybe I’d think more logically and carefully all the time. It could well be that Hinton has that habit or inclination to always be in focus. If Hinton does not have consistent personal experience of shallow, autocomplete-like thinking, he might not recognize it as something different, in which case he could be giving the chatbot credit for something it’s not doing. Come to think of it, one thing that impresses me about Bob is that, when he’s working, he seems to always be on focus. I’ll be in a meeting, just coasting along, and Bob will interrupt someone to ask for clarification, and I suddenly realize that Bob absolutely demands understanding. He seems to have no interest in participating in a research meeting in a shallow way. I guess we just have different styles. It’s my impression that the vast majority of researchers are like me, just coasting on the surface most of the time (for some people, all of the time!), while Bob, and maybe Geoff Hinton, is one of the exceptions. P.P.S. Sometimes we really want to be doing shallow, auto-complete-style thinking. For example, if we’re writing a play and want to simulate how some characters might interact. Or just as a way of casting the intellectual net more widely. When I’m in a research meeting and I free-associate, it might not help immediately solve the problem at hand, but it can bring in connections that will be helpful later. So I’m not knocking auto-complete; I’m just disagreeing with Hinton’s statement that “by training something to be really good at predicting the next word, you’re actually forcing it to understand.” As a person who does a lot of useful associative reasoning and also a bit of logical understanding, I think they’re different, both in how they feel and also in what they do. P.P.P.S. Lots more discussion in comments; you might want to start here. P.P.P.P.S. One more thing . . . actually, it might deserve its own post, but for now I’ll put it here: So far, it might seem like I’m denigrating associative thinking, or “acting like a chatbot,” or whatever it might be called. Indeed, I admire Bob Carpenter for doing very little of this at work! The general idea is that acting like a chatbot can be useful—I really can help lots of people solve their problems in that way, also every day I can write these blog posts that entertain and inform tens of thousands of people—but it’s not quite the same as focused thinking. That’s all true (or, I should say, that’s my strong impression), but there’s more to it than that. As discussed in my comment linked to just above, “acting like a chatbot” is not “autocomplete” at all, indeed in some ways it’s kind of the opposite. Locally it’s kind of like autocomplete in that the sentences flow smoothly; I’m not suddenly jumping to completely unrelated topics—but when I do this associative or chatbot-like writing or talking, it can lead to all sorts of interesting places. I shuffle the deck and new hands come up. That’s one of the joys of “acting like a chatbot” and one reason I’ve been doing it for decades, long before chatbots ever existed! Walk along forking paths, and who knows where you’ll turn up! And all of you blog commenters (ok, most of you) play helpful roles in moving these discussions along.

It learns to play the game simply by playing itself -- and what they found is that there isn&#x27;t really a limit to how good it can get. There may be some theoretical limit of a \"perfect\" Go player, or maybe not, but it will continue to converge towards perfection by continuing to train. And it can go far beyond what the best human Go player can ever do. Even though very smart humans have spent their lifetimes deeply studying the game, and Alpha Zero had to learn everything from scratch.One other thing to take into consideration, is that to play the game of Go you can&#x27;t just think of the next move. You have to think far forward in the game -- even though technically all it&#x27;s doing is picking the next move, it is doing so using a model that has obviously looked forward more than just one move. And that model is obviously very sophisticated, and if you are going to say that it doesn&#x27;t understand the game of Go, I would argue that you have a very, oddly restricted definition of the word, understand, and one that isn&#x27;t particularly useful.Likewise, with large language models, while on the surface, they may be just predicting the next word one after another, to do so effectively they have to be planning ahead. As Hinton says, there is no real limit to how sophisticated they can get. When training, it is never going to be 100% accurate in predicting text it hasn&#x27;t trained on, but it can continue to get closer and closer to 100% the more it trains. And the closer it gets, the more sophisticated model it needs. In the sense that Alpha Zero needs to \"understand\" the game of Go to play effectively, the large language model needs to understand \"the world\" to get better at predicting. reply wbillingsley 7 hours agoparentLLMs are very good at uncovering the mathematical relationships between words, many layers deep. Calling that understanding is a claim about what understanding is. But because we know how the LLMs we&#x27;re talking about at the moment are trained, it seems to have more problems:LLMs do not directly model the world; they train on and model what people write about the world. It is an AI model of a computed gestalt human model of the world, rather than a model of the world directly. If you ask it a question, it tells you what it models someone else (a gestalt of human writing) is most likely say. That in turn is strengthened if user interaction accepts it and corrected only if someone tells it something different.If we were to define that as what \"understanding\" is, we would equivalently be saying that a human bullshit artist would have expert understanding if only they produced more believable bullshit. (They also just \"try to sound like an expert\".)Likewise, I&#x27;m not convinced that we can measure its understanding just by identifying inaccuracies or measuring the difference between its answers and expert answers - There would be no difference between bluffing your way through the interview (relying on your interviewer&#x27;s limitations in how they interrogate you) and acing the interview.There seems to be a fundamental difference in levels of indirection. Where we \"map the territory\", LLMs \"map the maps of the territory\".It can be an arbitrarily good approximation, and practically very useful, but it&#x27;s a strong ontological step to say one thing \"is\" another just because it can be used like it. reply robbrown451 3 hours agorootparent\"LLMs do not directly model the world; they train on and model what people write about the world\"This is true. But human brains don&#x27;t directly model the world either, they form an internal model based on what comes in through their senses. Humans have the advantage of being more \"multi-modal,\" but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they get more information or better information.Much of my \"modeling of the world\" comes from the fact that I&#x27;ve read a lot of text. But of course I haven&#x27;t read even a tiny fraction of what GPT4 has.That said, LLMs can already train on images, as GPT4-V does. And the image generators as well do this, it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the two are fully integrated. Later we&#x27;ll see a lot more training on video and sound, and it all being integrated into a single model. reply lsy 15 hours agoparentprevThe difference is that \"the world\" is not exhaustible in the same way as Go is. While it&#x27;s surely true that the number of possible overall Go game states is extremely large, the game itself is trivially representable as a set of legal moves and rules. The \"world model\" of the Go board is actually just already exhaustive and finite, and the computer&#x27;s work in playing against itself is to generate more varied data within that model rather than to develop that model itself. We know that when Alpha Zero plays a game against itself it is valuable data because it is a legitimate game which most likely represents a new situation it hasn&#x27;t seen before and thus expands its capacity.For an LLM, this is not even close to being the case. The sum of all human artifacts ever made (or yet to be made) doesn&#x27;t exhaust the description of a rock in your front yard, let alone the world in all its varied possibility. And we certainly haven&#x27;t figured out a \"model\" which would let a computer generate new and valid data that expands its understanding of the world beyond its inputs, so self-training is a non-starter for LLMs. What the LLM is \"understanding\", and what it is reinforced to \"understand\" is not the world but the format of texts, and while it may get very good at understanding the format of texts, that isn&#x27;t equivalent to an understanding of the world. reply og_kalu 14 hours agorootparent>The sum of all human artifacts ever made (or yet to be made) doesn&#x27;t exhaust the description of a rock in your front yard, let alone the world in all its varied possibility.No human or creature we know of has a \"true\" world model so this is irrelevant. You don&#x27;t experience the \"real world\". You experience a tiny slice of it, a few senses that is further slimmed down and even fabricated at parts.To the bird who can intuitively sense and use electromagnetic waves for motion and guidance, your model of the world is fundamentally incomplete.There is a projection of the world in text. Moreover training on additional modalities is trivial for a transformer. That&#x27;s all that matters. reply lsy 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s the difference though. I know my world model is fundamentally incomplete. Even more foundationally, I know that there is a world, and when my world model and the world disagree, the world wins. To a neural network there is no distinction. The closest the entire dynamic comes is the very basic annotation of RLHF which itself is done by an external human who is providing the value judgment, but even that is absent once training is over.Despite not having the bird&#x27;s sense for electromagnetic waves, I have an understanding that they are there, because humans saw behavior they couldn&#x27;t describe and investigated, in a back-and-forth with a world that has some capacity to disprove hypotheses.Additional modalities are really just reducible to more kinds of text. That still doesn&#x27;t exhaust the world, and unless a machine has some ability to integrate new data in real time alongside a meaningful commitment and accountability to the world as a world, it won&#x27;t be able to cope with the real world in a way that would constitute genuine intelligence. reply og_kalu 13 hours agorootparent>I know my world model is fundamentally incomplete. Even more foundationally, I know that there is a world, and when my world model and the world disagree, the world wins.Yeah this isn&#x27;t really true. There&#x27;s not how humans work. For a variety of reasons, Plenty stick with their incorrect model despite the world indicating otherwise. In fact, this seems to be normal enough human behaviour. Everyone does it, for something or the other. You are no exception.And yes LLMs can in fact tell truth from fiction.GPT-4 logits calibration pre RLHF - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;3gYel9rJust Ask for Calibration: Strategies for Eliciting Calibrated Confidence Scores from Language Models Fine-Tuned with Human Feedback - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2305.14975Teaching Models to Express Their Uncertainty in Words - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2205.14334Language Models (Mostly) Know What They Know - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2207.05221The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True&#x2F;False Datasets - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2310.06824Your argument seems to boil down to \"they can&#x27;t perform experiments\" but that isn&#x27;t true either. reply user_named 6 hours agorootparentIt is a very basic fact that LLMs have no concept of true or false, it only has an ability to look up what text data it has seen before. If you do not understand this you are in no position to discuss LLMs. reply robbrown451 4 hours agorootparentIt certainly doesn&#x27;t \"look up\" text data it has seen before. That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how this stuff works. That&#x27;s exactly why I use the example above of Alpha Zero and how it learns to play Go, since that demonstrates very clearly that it&#x27;s not just looking things up.And I have no idea what you mean by saying that it has no concept of true or false. Even the simplest computer programs have a concept of true or false, that&#x27;s kind of the simplest data type, a boolean. Large language models have a much more sophisticated concept of true and false that has a lot more nuance. That&#x27;s really a pretty ridiculous thing to say. reply xcv123 6 hours agorootparentprevOne of the most ridiculous comments I have read about LLMs here.The ~100 layer deep neural networks infer many levels of features over the text, including the concept of true and false.

Motion is largely unconscious, like how you can throw things at a target without thinking about it.But if you&#x27;re just using it to mean \"factual memory\", calling it modeling seems like false precision. reply xcv123 7 hours agorootparentOh well in that case the answer is straightforward.If you close your eyes and get lost after a few seconds, that&#x27;s because that aspect of your model was not a 100% perfect exact replica of external reality that extended infinitely far in all spatial directions at all resolutions. For example, your internal spatial model is limited to some degree of accuracy and does not include the entire surface of Mars, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that your model does not exist at all. Models are not perfect by definition. I thought this would be obvious.Why would you think any model has to be a perfect exact 1:1 representation of the entire universe?The model of reality in your head is a simplification that serves a purpose. Arbitrarily closing your fully functioning eyes is not something your model generating hardware was evolutionarily optimized for. Natural selection weeds out that kind of behaviour.If you become blind then your model will change and optimize for other sensory inputs.

You have to think far forward in the game -- even though technically all it&#x27;s doing is picking the next move, it is doing so using a model that has obviously looked forward more than just one move.While I imagine alpha go does some brute force and some tree exploration, I think the main \"intelligent\" component of alpha go is the ability to recognize a \"good\" game state from a \"bad\" game state based on that moment in time, not any future plans or possibilities. That pattern recognition is all it has once its planning algorithm has reached the leaves of the trees. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I doubt alpha go has a neural net evaluating an entire tree of moves all at once to discover meta strategies like \"the opponent focusing on this area\" or \"the opponent feeling on the back foot.\"You can therefore imagine a pattern recognition algorithm so good that it is able to pick a move by only looking 1 move into the future, based solely on local stone densities and structures.

You have to think far forward in the game -- even though technically all it&#x27;s doing is picking the next move, it is doing so using a model that has obviously looked forward more than just one move.It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to look ahead. Since Go is a deterministic game there is always a best move (or moves that are better than others) and hence a function that goes from the state of the game to the best move. We just don&#x27;t have a way to compute this function, but it exists. And that function doesn&#x27;t need the concept of lookahead, that&#x27;s just an intuitive way of how could find some of its values. Likewise ML algorithms don&#x27;t necessarily need lookahead, they can just try to approximate that function with enough precision by exploiting patterns in it. And that&#x27;s why we can still craft puzzles that some AIs can&#x27;t solve but humans can, by exploiting edge cases in that function that the ML algorithm didn&#x27;t notice but are solvable with understanding of the game.The thing is though, does this really matter if eventually we won&#x27;t be able to notice the difference? reply bytefactory 13 hours agorootparent> It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to look ahead.

When a human being sorts of list of numbers, they intend to sort the list. The intention is the cause and explanation for the actions taken the lead to a list of ordered numbers, as well as the resulting list of ordered numbers.Does a computer sort numbers? In common speech, we say it does, just as we use all sorts of anthropomorphizing language when discussing computers. But at best, this is loose and analogical language. That&#x27;s fine, as far as it goes, as long as we don&#x27;t take it or mean it literally. However, the computer itself lacks intention. It is our intention that produces the computer, and our intention that makes the computer an instrument used by us to sort.

The human brain uses predictive mechanisms when processing language, and these mechanisms play an important role in forming thoughts.When we hear or read a word, our brain quickly generates a set of predictions about what word might come next, based on the context of the sentence and our past experiences with language. These predictions are constantly updated as we receive new information, and they help us to process language more efficiently and accurately.In addition, research has shown that the brain engages in similar predictive processes when we are forming thoughts or planning actions. For example, when we plan a complex movement, such as reaching for a cup, our brain generates a set of predictions about the movements required to complete the action. These predictions are constantly updated as we receive feedback from our muscles and our environment, allowing us to make adjustments and achieve our goal.See links below for additional details:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.earth.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;our-brains-are-constantly-working...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psycholinguistics.com&#x2F;gerry_altmann&#x2F;research&#x2F;pap...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;23273798.2020.18...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1551-6709.2009... reply wraptile 3 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s not only language or some tasks - it&#x27;s literally everything.

But rewinding history and playing it back with the same temperature dice rolls is the only way to have the same thing a a LLM with no random inputs.LLMs run in simulated environments where you can control randomness so you need the same for a human to compare the two. You can’t just ask a human a question multiple times as everything around them changes and conclude the human is behaving differently because they answer differently the same question.

This is a feature. You can choose to persist memory (through training, fine-tuning, databases, or context window), or you can choose to wipe it.

In stead you asked question q, then qq and finally qqq. Those are three different questions, which explains why you got different answers.I&#x27;m not sure if ChatGPT also cumulates its previous answers in the context. It might do that as well. In that case the prompts would be q, qaq and qaqaq where &#x27;q&#x27; is your question and &#x27;a&#x27; the earlier reaction from the LLM.The illusion of sentience comes from this. The new answers reflected what you said because the prompt was different and included the previous discussion.This is a feature of the user interface, not the language model. The only reason why the language model would respond differently to the same input is the artificial randomness mixed with the input.

Although the results aren&#x27;t perfect, they can be helpful.However, I recall years ago asking a more senior developer how to do something. They could&#x27;ve just told me how, but instead they asked why I was doing that. Then they told me not to bother with writing code at all, and to instead do this other, much simpler thing which would have the same effect at solving the client&#x27;s request. ChatGPT wouldn&#x27;t have had that insight.Years later, a junior dev came to me asking for help with his code because it wasn&#x27;t working. We went over the code line by line and he explained what it was trying to do and it all looked good. But when he ran it, the web server crashed. I told him to try adding a comment: &#x2F;&#x2F; Do not remove this comment.Sure enough, it worked perfectly and the server no longer crashed. Why? Because I realized that if his code was wrong he should get an error message, not crash the server. But sometime back I had read about a bug in a version of the interpreter that would crash when parsing a file that was an exact multiple of 4096 bytes. Would chatGPT have thought of that? Probably not. It would&#x27;ve just talked about the code.Which is not to say that it&#x27;s useless.

They then have the gall to say about the most-cited ML researcher of all time: \"Maybe Hinton’s problem in understanding this is that he’s just too logical!\" No, Hinton&#x27;s problem in understanding it is that he actually correctly understands the information theory behind what&#x27;s happening in LLMs. He sort of founded the modern field and has been doing this for, what, four decades?Let me explain to you what Hinton is implicitly saying here behind his words, as best as I understand it. Every language process can be interpeted as a tokens, in our case discrete. This process is generated under a system where the one driving variable is time, and it is autoregressive and contingent upon the _entire_ state of the world up until that point.We use the cross-entropy to maximize the negative log-likelihood of the tokens based upon the training set, this is the best way to directly minimize the empirical risk, at least mathematically speaking.While some of the information of the world state is inherently unknowable to some degree (i.e., &#x27;noise&#x27;), building an understanding of the connections between concepts offers a learned prior that matches the density of the generating distribution (i.e., real life).Couple this with a severe L2 penalty on the weights, which optimizes for the MDL in the limit (!!!!), and you have a system that fundamentally embeds an approximation of the information graph of the world in some neural network. This is quite literally the _only_ way to improve next token prediction once you get beyond the initial token-occurrence statistics, etc.In the limit, the only way to reliably predict the world state as accurately as possible without having direct info of the world state at that time is to learn the entire conceptual graph of the world, thus minimizing our achievable log likelihood with the available information that we&#x27;ve been given. _This_ is what Hinton is talking about, as best as I understand.The author uses a bit of an illusion of shortcutting -- which is an ideal strategy for an _online_ agent with limited resources in a dynamic world, and for models earlier on in their training process. But Hinton is not talking about this at all, really, no! He is talking about the limit! Of course, if you stop an LLM in the middle of training (or look at earlier, smaller ones), you&#x27;ll see similar &#x27;shortcut&#x27; methods. This is a matter of capacity, which is tangentially in the same family as the author&#x27;s casual, more personal examples, but not at all really related to the mathematics of what is going on behind the scenes here. These are two entirely different problem sets, it&#x27;s apples to oranges, and there&#x27;s not really much tie here. From their profile page, the author is a professor of statistics and political science, and I&#x27;m not sure why the information theory side of things didn&#x27;t come up given the statistics background (though they may be somewhat disjoint).Hinton was being polite to the general public in not dropping all of the math on the reader at once, and I respect that. I understand how someone might misunderstand that and go long on an unrelated rebuttal, but it is frustrating to not see a healthy level of rigor applied here.I do feel somewhat bothered this is also being upvoted on HN. I know not everyone is a practitioner, but I think this article misses the quality bar. We really gotta just emphasize, and re-emphasize the fundamentals over and over.

We can also doubt that we have understood things correctly, and take steps to either confirm or refute our opinions. We see ourselves as entities in an external reality containing other individuals who also do this, and that we, and they, have a limited ability to influence what happens in that world.

But this doesn&#x27;t exclude semantic properties from having causal relevance to the behavior of the system. What we need is a way to conceptualize how a system can have multiple related descriptions at different levels. A description at the level of semantics doesn&#x27;t exclude a description in terms of formal properties or vice versa. I think of it in terms of constraints: the higher level descriptions constrain the lower level behavior. What the computational description does is ensures the higher level semantic constraint is maintained. It does this by the particular space of computational dynamics it follows. Essentially, the information that picks out this programs space of branching dynamics embeds the semantic description in question, and this description realizes the computational dynamic necessary to maintain the higher level semantic constraint. Rather than semantics being in opposition to formal properties, they are two sides of the same coin. reply dboreham 17 hours agorootparentprevBingo reply porknubbins 16 hours agoparentprevAs a translator I have come to think of it like this- (without the need for defining what “understanding” means) the ability to translate correctly depends on the size of your context.

Of course, LLMs are not databases that store exact answers - so it&#x27;s not enough to ask it something that it hasn&#x27;t seen, if it&#x27;s seen something similar (as is likely the case with your programming language).One benchmark that I track closely is ConceptARC, which aims to test generalization and abstraction capabilities.Here is a very recent result that uses the benchmark: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2311.09247. Humans correctly solved 91% of the problems, GPT-4 solved 33%, and GPT-4V did much worse than GPT-4. reply continuational 15 hours agorootparentI wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if GPT-4 is not too good at visual patterns, given that it&#x27;s trained on text.Look at the actual prompt in figure 2. I doubt humans would get a 91% score on that. reply BobaFloutist 16 hours agorootparentprevSomeone sufficiently fast and skilled at googling can explain and use in context a lot of things that they don&#x27;t really properly understand.So unless you&#x27;re saying that the composite of the googler and of google understand something that neither does individually, your definition has some holes. reply continuational 16 hours agorootparentThis is a variation of the Chinese room argument.If you consider understanding an observable property, then the Chinese room in aggregate displays understanding of Chinese.Would you say that humans understand nothing, because atoms don&#x27;t understand anything, and we&#x27;re made up of atoms? reply BobaFloutist 15 hours agorootparentI would say that there is a stronger consensus that a human being can be reasonably described as a single entity than a human being using a reference resource.A more apt comparison to my mind would be if a human being can be described as personally exerting strong nuclear force, just because their subatomic particles do, which I would happily answer \"no.\" reply satuke 17 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t that exactly how humans learn to respond to stimuli? Don&#x27;t we just try to predict the best next response to everything? Yes, It&#x27;s statistics but the fun part is nobody is writing this statistical function by hand. reply civilized 17 hours agorootparentLLMs don&#x27;t have a concept of \"best\". Only most likely in what they&#x27;ve been trained on.I think LLMs ultimately just take imitation to a creative and sophisticated extreme. And imitation simply doesn&#x27;t comprise the whole of human intelligence at all, no matter how much it is scaled up.The sophistication of the imitation has some people confused and questioning whether everything can be reduced to imitation. It can&#x27;t.The ability to imitate seeking a goal isn&#x27;t identical to the ability to seek a goal.The ability to imitate solving a problem isn&#x27;t identical to the ability to solve a problem.Imitation is very useful, and the reduction of everything to imitation is an intriguing possibility to consider, but it&#x27;s ultimately just wrong. reply lordnacho 16 hours agorootparentOk, so now we need an example that separates humans from LLMs?I struggle to think of one, maybe someone on HN has a good example.Eg if I&#x27;m in middle school and learning quadratic equations, am I imitating solving the problem by plugging in the coefficients? Or am I understanding it?Most of what I see coming out of chatGPT and copilot could be said to be either. If you&#x27;re generous, it&#x27;s understanding. If not, it&#x27;s imitation. reply civilized 16 hours agorootparentIt is very easy to separate humans from LLMs. Humans created math without being given all the answers beforehand. LLMs can&#x27;t do that yet.When an LLM can create math to solve a problem, we will be much closer to AGI. reply abm53 15 hours agorootparentYou can ask ChatGPT to solve maths problems which are not in its training data, and it will answer an astonishing amount of them correctly.The fact that we have trained it on examples of human-produced maths texts (rather than through interacting with the world over several millennia) seems like more of an implementation detail and not piece of evidence about whether it has “understood” or not. reply IshKebab 15 hours agorootparentprevSome humans created maths. And it took thousands of years of thinking and interaction with the real world.Seems like goalpost moving to me.I think the real things that separate LLMs from humans at the moment are:* Humans can do online learning. They have long term memory. I guess you could equate evolution to the training phase of AI but it still seems like they don&#x27;t have quite the same on-line learning capabilities as us. This is what probably prevents them from doing things like inventing maths.* They seem to be incapable of saying \"I don&#x27;t know\". Ok to be fair lots of humans struggle with this! I&#x27;m sure this will be solved fairly soon though.* They don&#x27;t have a survival instinct that drives proactive action. Sure you can tell them what to do but that doesn&#x27;t seem quite the same. reply naveen99 14 hours agorootparentInterestingly some humans will admit to not knowing but are allergic to admitting being wrong (and can get fairly vindictive if forced to admit being wrong).LLM’s actually admit to being wrong easily, but aren’t great at introspection and confabulate too often. also their Meta cognition is poor still. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparentI guess LLM&#x27;s don&#x27;t have the social pressure to avoid admitting errors. And those sort of interactions aren&#x27;t common in text so they don&#x27;t learn them strongly.Also ChatGPT is trained specifically to be helpful and subservient. reply civilized 13 hours agorootparentprevAbout this goalpost moving thing. It&#x27;s become very popular to say this, but I have no idea what it&#x27;s supposed to mean. It&#x27;s like a metaphor with no underlying reality.Did a wise arbiter of truth set up goalposts that I moved? I guess I didn&#x27;t get the memo.If the implied claim is \"GPT would invent math too given enough time\", go ahead and make that claim. reply IshKebab 11 hours agorootparent> Did a wise arbiter of truth set up goalposts that I moved?Collectively, yes. The criticism of AI has always been \"well it isn&#x27;t AI because it can&#x27;t do [thing just beyond its abilities].Maybe individually your goalpost hasn&#x27;t moved, and as soon as it invents some maths you&#x27;ll say \"yep, it&#x27;s intelligent\" (though I strongly doubt it). But collectively the naysayers in general will find another reason why it&#x27;s not really intelligent. Not like us.It&#x27;s very tedious. reply civilized 10 hours agorootparentOther than complaining about perceived inconsistencies in others&#x27; positions, what do you actually believe? Do you think GPT is AGI? replycanjobear 16 hours agorootparentprev> LLMs don&#x27;t have a concept of \"best\".

It follows a gradient. At the low end of this gradient is a bad imitation.At the high end of this gradient is a perfect imitation. Completely indistinguishable from what it&#x27;s imitating.If an imitation is perfect than is it really an imitation?If I progressively make my imitation more and more accurate am I progressively building an imitation or am I progressively building the real thing?See what&#x27;s going on here? You fell for a play on words. It&#x27;s a common trope. Sometimes language and vocabulary actually tricks the brain into thinking in a certain direction. This word \"imitation\" is clouding your thoughts.Think about it. A half built house can easily be called an imitation of a real house. reply usrbinbash 16 hours agorootparentprev> Isn&#x27;t that exactly how humans learn to respond to stimuli?Maybe it is, maybe it isn&#x27;t. Maybe we are \"just\" an incredibly powerful prediction engine. Or maybe we work from a completely different modus operandi, and our ability to predict things is an emergent capability of it.The thing is, no one actually knows what makes us intelligent, or even how to define intelligence for that matter. reply RandomLensman 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, if you are in the no free will school of thought, then that would be what humans do. reply usrbinbash 16 hours agoparentprev> You would realize that all we are doing is using statistics to predict what the next item might be.Two questions:1. How can humans come up with novel ideas then? Statistically predicting the next item means I am limited to the training set. How do humans formulate new concepts in this scenario?2. Why can humans learn from their own output then? If all we do is statistically predicting the next token, then, by necessity, feeding our own output back into the model (aka. letting humans learn from it) should degrade human capabilities by overfitting to the training set. But we observe exactly the opposite. reply jameshart 16 hours agorootparent> Statistically predicting the next item means I am limited to the training setNot at all. Extrapolation is perfectly possible in a purely predictive model. It’s one of the things GPTs are best at.In the stream of tokens output by an LLM it’s completely possible for new concepts to emerge, and for it then to continue to use and build on them in the remainder of the stream.

    "originBody": "Posted on November 16, 2023November 16, 2023 by Mark Thompson An Asteroid Will Occult Betelgeuse on December 12th I cannot for the life of me remember when it was or what it was but a fair few years ago I remember positioning a telescope to observe an asteroid as it silently and perhaps slightly eerily drifted between us and the Moon. I say eerily as this asteroid had the ability to cause widespread damage had it hit but of course we knew it posed no threat. I remember at the time thinking it was mind blowing that even today, we still use mathematics with roots (pardon the pun) centuries old to calculate the position of objects in our Solar System. We get to see evidence of this again on 12th December when something rare happens! I have rather hinted to what I am referring, on 12th December, asteroid 319 Leona will pass directly in front of Betelgeuse, the red giant in the constellation of Orion whose name amusingly translates to armpit of the giant – now there’s a fact to amuse and astound your friends. To be able to calculate that a rock approximately 60 km across is going to pass directly in front of a star that is just over 650 light years away is really quite staggering. Perhaps more excitingly if you live along a corridor from central Asia and southern Europe to Florida and Mexico then at around 01:17 UTC you have a chance – clouds permitting – to see it for yourself and you don’t need any telescope or equipment, just your eyes. Betelgeuse is the second brightest star in the constellation Orion and is a familiar favourite with its piercing red colour. It hit the news back in 2020 when it unexpectedly dimmed in the sky due to the star itself ejecting a cloud of dust. Next month it will fade for a few seconds due to the passage of Leona right in front of it. An event like this is quite rare where the light from a bright star is blocked (or occulted) by an asteroid happening every few decades at most. It will be fascinating to watch but is also scientifically useful giving us a chance to learn more about Betelgeuse and how it’s large convection cells behave, and to learn more about the orbit and shape of the asteroid too. The Constellation of Orion showing Betelgeuse at upper left (Credit : Till Credner) Anyone out there wishing to observe the event needs to be warned though, the predictions are just that, there are a few uncertainties. The size and shape of the asteroid itself is still subject to debate. Typically we tend to assume asteroids are spherical unless we know otherwise but a previous occultation of Leona in September 2023 determined that it was more of ellipsoidal in shape measuring 80km by 55km. At its distance from Earth that means it will cover an area of sky 46 x 41 milliarcseconds which is a little more than the approximate 40 milliarcseconds for Betelgeuse. Taking this into account suggests Betelgeuse will be completely blocked from view and therefore blink out for a few seconds. Betelgeuse’s somewhat diffuse outer atmosphere may mean its apparent size is more like 50 milliarcseconds so it just fades instead. Until the event happens we will not know exactly how it will appear in the sky or exactly when. It’s a great opportunity to learn more about these two fascinating objets so head outside on 12th December around 01:00 UTC, wait and watch and hopefully you can witness one of natures rather more rare events.

It&#x27;s neat that it sounds like even amateurs with nothing but a regular DSLR can contribute to this as well.> By precisely timing the duration of the occultation from many sites simultaneously, they can refine their knowledge of the size and shape of the asteroid.> Betelgeuse is the 10th brightest star in our skies (+0.5 magnitude), so observers need only modest equipment to participate.> the easiest way to capture the event is to use a simple DSLR camera on a tripod ... video frames must have a short (few-millisecond) exposure time ... Millisecond accuracy timing is crucial ... [an app] for timestamping occultation observations is called Occult Flash Tag (Android) or AstroFlashTimer (iPhone) reply kristopolous 5 hours agorootparentI can imagine it helps to normalize the various perturbations from atmospheric non uniformity which may be able to help the higher quality measurements decrease the noise. reply Razengan 5 hours agoparentprev> All this knowledge merely from our single planet by tiny variations of measurements in finely calibrated instruments as if you were able to map out the city of Paris confined to the observations from a single window.Indeed, but I like to wonder how much of it will turn out to be wrong when (if) we finally get to visit it in person.I mean, do you really want to believe that everything about something as practically infinite as the UNIVERSE could be learned from just a single planet in a few hundred years?Because that would be pretty boring. :) reply doctorwho42 3 hours agorootparentWell as a physicist I think it&#x27;s safe to say this, of course you can&#x27;t know everything from a single solar system. Most of the stuff we see&#x2F;measure is massive, and the smaller stuff like exoplanets is general.What we are doing now is like squinting while looking around a busy city street. You can get a sense of the cars, the people, etc. but you can&#x27;t tell me exactly what the sign across the street says or what the hours for street parking are for that spot across the street and down two cars.And the real interesting thing to us as living beings is other living beings&#x2F;organisms no matter how different. And no matter the quality of your telescope or detectors, you are never going to be able to resolve anything that far away nor with any degree of certainty. So from the limits of physics, we know we are going to eventually need to get down from our windowed apartment and start walking the streets of Paris. For no matter how long we stare, we will never truly know the smell of the bakery a few streets over until we walk through it&#x27;s door.And to those that say robotic missions are the only true way, they are missing out on the truly human and sentient reason to go. Through individual experience we can create more than just new knowledge, we can expand upon the human experience as well as create new art to share those experiences. reply kristopolous 3 hours agorootparentprevYou know those pictures of a spiral galaxy that say \"you are here?\" pointing to the outer edge.You actually aren&#x27;t. That&#x27;s not our galaxy, we don&#x27;t have pictures like that of our actual galaxy and don&#x27;t have any idea how to get one.Also there&#x27;s tons of other fundamental limits - galaxies that will likely forever be just faint pixels, the distribution of photons being too dispersed for any detector.Also there&#x27;s the light horizon problem - we can only see to what the age of the universe allows, not necessarily to its extent.Beyond that let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s a 100% confidence of methane on a planet around one of the Alpha Centauri stars, say Proxima Centari B, a pretty solid indicator of life. Ok now what?Probes like Voyager would take 75,000 years to get there. If we had loaded a ship with neanderthals during paleolithic times, their descendants would just be arriving now. Even the much touted solar sails would take 25 years to get there and 4 years to send back any data. If magically launched tomorrow, it&#x27;d be 2052 before first byte. The distance is really wildly insurmountable and that&#x27;s just our next door neighbor.If I could time travel say, 25,000 years hence and we somehow had not blown ourselves up, I could imagine even then asking \"how much of space have you explored\" and getting an answer like \"well, the milky way is 100,000,000,000 stars and 100,000 light years across so about 0.001% of that.\" There&#x27;s ballpark a trillion galaxies btw.

It&#x27;s quite interesting, since the observations are a citizen science effort, with different observers from across Spain and Portugal (in this set) collecting data from multiple observers in multiple locations in order to map out the entire occultation. Part of the motivation was because of the upcoming Betelgeuse occultation and the potential to learn more about Betelgeuse from the observations:> The stellar occultation by (319) Leona on 13 September 2023 in preparation for the occultation of Betelgeuse> This represents an extraordinary and unique opportunity to analyze the diameter and brightness distribution of Betelgeuse&#x27;s photosphere with extreme angular resolution by studying the light curve as the asteroid occults the star from different points on Earth and at different wavelengths.

If each individual star has an occultation once every k days, then \"at least one of N stars\" has an occultation roughly once every 1&#x2F;(1-(1-1&#x2F;k)^N) ≈ k&#x2F;N days.

Published November 17, 2023Updated November 17, 2023 Share Tweet Plastic nanoparticles (green), visible under a microscope, co-mingling with protein aggregates(red) in neuronal lysosomes (blue). Typically, concentrations of the protein aggregates are so small, they would not be viable at this level. Contact Stephanie Lopez Manager 919-724-5934 Email DURHAM, N.C. – Nanoplastics interact with a particular protein that is naturally found in the brain, creating changes linked to Parkinson’s disease and some types of dementia. In a Duke-led study appearing Nov. 17 in Science Advances, the researchers report that the findings create a foundation for a new area of investigation, fueled by the timely impact of environmental factors on human biology. “Parkinson’s disease has been called the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world,” said principal investigator, Andrew West, Ph.D., professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology at Duke University School of Medicine. “Numerous lines of data suggest environmental factors might play a prominent role in Parkinson’s disease, but such factors have for the most part not been identified.” Improperly disposed plastics have been shown to break into very small pieces and accumulate in water and food supplies, and were found in the blood of most adults in a recent study. “Our study suggests that the emergence of micro and nanoplastics in the environment might represent a new toxin challenge with respect to Parkinson’s disease risk and progression,” West said. “This is especially concerning given the predicted increase in concentrations of these contaminants in our water and food supplies.” West and colleagues in Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment and the Department of Chemistry at Trinity College of Arts and Sciences found that nanoparticles of the plastic polystyrene -- typically found in single use items such as disposable drinking cups and cutlery -- attract the accumulation of the protein known as alpha-synuclein. West said the study’s most surprising findings are the tight bonds formed between the plastic and the protein within the area of the neuron where these accumulations are congregating, the lysosome. Researchers said the plastic-protein accumulations happened across three different models performed in the study - in test tubes, cultured neurons, and mouse models of Parkinson’s disease. West said questions remain about how such interactions might be happening within humans and whether the type of plastic might play a role. “While microplastic and nanoplastic contaminants are being closely evaluated for their potential impact in cancer and autoimmune diseases, the striking nature of the interactions we could observe in our models suggest a need for evaluating increasing nanoplastic contaminants on Parkinson’s disease and dementia risk and progression,” West said. “The technology needed to monitor nanoplastics is still at the earliest possible stages and not ready yet to answer all the questions we have,” he said. “But hopefully efforts in this area will increase rapidly, as we see what these particles can do in our models. If we know what to look out for, we can take the necessary steps to protect ourselves, without compromising all the benefits we reap every day from plastics.” The study was funded by in part by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research and the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s initiative (ASAP-020527). In addition to West, study authors include Zhiyong Liu, Arpine Sokratian, Addison M. Duda, Enquan Xu, Christina Stanhope, Amber Fu, Samuel Strader, Huizhong Li, Yuan Yuan, Benjamin G. Bobay, Joana Sipe, Ketty Bai, Iben Lundgaard, Na Liu, Belinda Hernandez, Catherine Bowes Rickman, and Sara E. Miller.

Firstly, the \"plastic is bad\" narrative is too easy to believe, just because plastic is ugly. It&#x27;s also starting to follow the pattern I have seen in clinical psychology, where many studies find promising initial results, but no one bothers to conduct the real-life randomized controlled study that shows an actual clinical effect. And after a couple of decades of dogma, someone points out that the emperor has no clothes. Suddenly, the whole field looks silly, be it EMDR, classical psychotherapy, mindfulness therapy for severe mental illness, or the abuse craze in the 1990s.The longer it goes without concrete and clinically significant findings, the larger I think the probability of the findings being wrong becomes. I also find it strange that so few of the studies I have read ever comment on the fact that our system might be fully capable of removing the nanoparticles by itself, just as it removes everything from dust to methylmercury. We do not know if this is the case, but the fact that nobody is addressing this further strengthens my fear that there is a lot of confirmation bias going on.Every time I post something like this, I get a lot of angry responses, so I can try to preempt some of them by saying: I am not asserting that microplastics are safe. But the pattern of lots of pilot studies, and few studies that significantly prove the theory, is very recognizable to me.Until someone either conducts a naturalistic experiment with lots of people exposed to large doses of microplastics and compares them to a control group, or we expose some larger animals to microplastics over a long time in a true randomized controlled study, I&#x27;m going to remain skeptical. reply swatcoder 13 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re right that conclusive research can be impractical or neglected for many environmental and social impact \"sciences\". This is why psychology, ecology, biology, medicine and even chemistry weren&#x27;t always taken seriously by more rigorous disciplines. No innovation really marked a moment between when they were denigrated as soft sciences that couldn&#x27;t make sound conclusions and their role in society today. It&#x27;s mostly just a cultural shift and a loss of implicit skepticism in them. So yeah, it&#x27;s hard to know stuff like \"how dangerous are plastics\" as rigorously as \"how much energy is released when these two nuclei fuse\"But there&#x27;s also a practical weight that matters in a lot of these pursuits. Plastics overtook the world during a time when people weren&#x27;t really considering their impact at ecological scale and didn&#x27;t have sufficient models and tools to really assess what they might do to biological systems over lifetimes or generations. It was a historical accident that happened fast and without many brakes applied and now \"plastics everywhere\" is a pervasive background noise that&#x27;s very hard to meaningfully control against. So the controlled science which was never conducted initially, and we now think probably should have been, is almost impossible to perform because we&#x27;re left in that that fuzzy \"soft sciences\" place where everything is already plasticked.But does that mean we should just keep charging ahead without trying to look, and that maybe a mindful step back from unscientific historical use would be worth considering even without conclusive evidence (since such evidence is now too hard to gather)? reply pardoned_turkey 12 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re cherry-picking plastics here. The same can be said about just about any technology developed in the past 200 years, so what makes plastics special? We laugh at people who talk about the \"precautionary principle\" for vaccines or cling onto dubious research that purports to show some ill effects. Or, how about applying the precautionary principle to air travel - after all, do we really know the effects on your body of frequently changing timezones?We&#x27;ve been using plastics for a long time. They improved the world in important ways. There&#x27;s nothing we can detect in large-scale studies of industry workers or other exposed groups that would suggest they&#x27;re dangerous. That&#x27;s kind of it. Every story you see on HN about microplastics is hand-wavy and involves dubious assertions and hypotheticals, and the alternative is... what? That we go back to making all commodity items out of metal, with a more serious environmental impact, higher transportation costs, and so on?There are wasteful uses of plastic which should be curtailed, e.g. for packaging fresh produce - but the concern here isn&#x27;t microplastics, just pointless trash. reply sheepscreek 6 hours agorootparentWhat makes plastic special is a) they are unnatural b) human and animal bodies have no mechanism to get rid of it, especially at nano-scale.We know enough about heart attacks to know they can be caused by plaque build-up in arteries. We don’t know enough about nano-plastic or micro-plastic buildup in our bodies, or its effects.At the very least, it’s worth investigating the role of plastics and ruling it out. reply jtrn 11 hours agorootparentprevI am sorry, but I am not able to connect with what you are saying.Many technologies have been studied properly and been found to be safe or unsafe. Smoking, non-ionizing radiation, airbags, alcohol consumption, exercise, beta-blockers, metformin, GLP-1, antipsychotics—all of these have been well studied and have been found to be clinically, not just statistically, relevant with regards to safety. Even vaccines are much better studied and understood with regard to risk compared to microplastics. So, I don&#x27;t think I am just randomly picking on plastic research. I am holding it up as an example of research areas that are triggering skeptical red flags, as opposed to research that isn&#x27;t stuck in the speculative phase.I also wasn&#x27;t commenting on the issue of overproduction of goods, which I have thought about, but that is not what I was focusing on here. reply Terr_ 10 hours agorootparentTo me the key is whether someone can advance a plausible and falsifiable chain of cause.Otherwise it feels a bit like an argument from anxious cynicism: \"There must be a major danger or tragedy with everything including X, if we don&#x27;t see it, that just means it&#x27;s been good at hiding.\" reply fnordpiglet 12 hours agoparentprevA few points,Plastic nanoparticles isn’t a single thing. There are many types of plastics, with many types of additives. Most plastics are bioreactive, especially when not handled properly or maintained in the proper conditions. A great many plastics and especially additives are known to be toxic, carcinogenic, etc. These aren’t controversial statements and is widely known, understood, and cataloged.Further, in this study, they point to prior studies that have established most adult humans have detectable amounts of nanoplastics in the blood stream. Further the point to prior research establishing many nanoplastics (and specially polystyrene, what they are studying here), passes the blood brain barrier.They contribute findings that, in mice, polystyrene nanoparticles are admitted to neurons and they isolate a number of changes in the proteins and signaling of the cells that propagate to other parts of the brain. The changes are indicative of changes observed in Parkinson’s, but since we don’t understand Parkinson’s, we clearly can’t establish a causal link in this way.RCTs could establish a probable correlate, but given again plastic nanoparticles are a single monolithic thing, there’s an incredible amount of variability in such a trial. This will take a lot of time and need to be pretty narrowly constructed so fundamental research like this is how you establish and guide such trials in the future. We haven’t really focused on the subject very long. But all of the facts above should be of grave concern.Even if the body clears out nanoparticles, which I’m certain it must, that doesn’t mean they can’t cause serious issues prior to clearance. We are also presumably constantly exposed to more so you should view it as a chronic and persistent level in the body even if the body can clear it. In fact I would say unlike heavy metals we almost certainly clear it otherwise you would simply accumulate greater and greater concentrations; which I don’t think is observed.It’s good to be skeptical, but I don’t think “we haven’t established a specific disease caused by the pervasive presence of plastic nanoparticles in animals” doesn’t imply “this is ok” by any measure. reply jtrn 11 hours agorootparentBut you do agree that it would be better if we got some studies that went beyond \"particles have been observed in tissue\" to something like \"This is the dose-to-morbidity curve for this group of nanoparticles\"?My issue is that we have been stuck with hundreds, if not thousands, of research papers of the first type, and I haven&#x27;t found any of the latter type.With regard to your last point, I kind of agree, but there has to be a balance between two extremes. You can&#x27;t assume something is safe just because you don&#x27;t have a smoking gun. On the other hand, the \"you can&#x27;t prove it&#x27;s 100% safe for everybody at all times throughout the universe, so we must assume it&#x27;s dangerous\" position can also be very dangerous. To me, the anti-GMO movement makes this mistake in a serious way, hurting actual people in deprived parts of the world. I fear that the microplastic scare is overblown and takes focus away from much more important issues. reply beowulfey 12 hours agoparentprevThis is a molecular study. Not done in humans.

There&#x27;s the same level of panic with plastics (and not just microplastics), but not the same amount of evidence. reply Sparkyte 13 hours agoparentprevEven with microplastics, other microscopic things entered food and consumption too. So I am skeptic, but the world also greatly benefits from the use of plastics in medicine. The rate of Alzhimers is not increasing, which would say elements of the disease not all microparticles. reply photochemsyn 12 hours agoparentprev&#x27;Plastic is bad&#x27; is indeed a gross generalization as plastics are made from a wide variety of monomeric units that are linked into chains or sheets to generate the final product. This article is specifically about polystyrene, which consists of aromatic (benzene ring) monomers. These are more likely to have biological effects, although of course there are aromatic amino acids, but there&#x27;s also bisphenol A, a problematic additive. However, the specific evidence is worth looking at:> \"Researchers said the plastic[polystyrene]-protein accumulations happened across three different models performed in the study - in test tubes, cultured neurons, and mouse models of Parkinson’s disease. West said questions remain about how such interactions might be happening within humans and whether the type of plastic might play a role.\"Another thing to keep in mind is that Parkinson&#x27;s appears to have a whole lot of different causes or risk factors, which accumulate as we age, from genetics to exposure to organophosphorous pesticides and this is just one more added to the list (wiki):> \"PD is believed to begin principally by degeneration of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons in the brain and secondarily by complex pathological mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, apoptotic cell death, protein aggregation and misfolding, inflammation, excitotoxicity, loss of trophic factors, and other cell-death pathways\"So, it&#x27;s not about &#x27;plastics&#x27; in general, it&#x27;s just that there are specific types and additives that should probably be phased out. reply corethree 13 hours agoparentprevAgreed but. Caveat here is that despite remaining skeptical we should still heavily pursue the idea as a possibility. We should not pursue this idea as if it was dogma. reply stevenwoo 13 hours agorootparentThey did a comparison with graphene particles of the same size and they were neutral to the biological structure in question, only polystyrene of that size would bind to interfere with normal cell function in vitro and mice. reply Sparkyte 13 hours agorootparentprevThis would be treating a hypothesis as fact. That isn&#x27;t scientific enough, it would be good to isolate a demographic where plastics are least used and a demographic where plastics are highly used with similar populations.

You could compare recovery outcomes between two groups that received different treatments (e.g., immediate vs. delayed medical care) due to circumstances beyond the researchers&#x27; control. You would observe and measure recovery over time and analyze differences to assess the treatment&#x27;s impact.Alternatively, compare the sickness rates in a population near a new factory emitting microplastics with a similar population elsewhere. With many potential sites, extensive on-site research could yield valuable insights beyond what is available from desk-based studies.Or, consider an experiment where you add plastic to one fish-filled pool and use another pool as a control, monitoring the ecosystems over a year or two.

It convincingly shows that nanoplastics can promote aggregation of α-synuclein (a key protein in Parkinson&#x27;s pathology) in vitro and in cultured cells. Note however that many substances known to be safe can do this.The in vivo study involves injecting nanoplastics directly into the brain of mice along with human α-synuclein fibrils, so is one step up from in vitro work but still quite artificial.In sum, it does not demonstrate that nanoplastics in the environment, or even those that might be directly administered to mice, e.g. in food, have any effect on Parkinson&#x27;s-like symptoms or pathology.Edit: I should add that laboratory mice are often in contact with plastics that they chew on.

It sounds bad, but there is no real reason why it would be. reply scottLobster 10 hours agorootparentGiven the wide variety of chemicals lumped under the name \"microplastics\" and the complexity of the systems of the human body, many of which even modern medical science doesn&#x27;t fully comprehend, the chance that they&#x27;re all or even mostly inert is extremely small. Also \"inert\" materials can cause problems in human body all the time, even if it&#x27;s just simple inflammation from the immune system responding to the physical damage they can cause.It&#x27;s like continuously pouring small grains of random dirt you scraped off the ground into your car&#x27;s engine while it&#x27;s running, when you&#x27;re not entirely sure how the engine works, and going \"meh, they&#x27;re just tiny particles of dirt. My engine is still running. Probably fine\". You can run that experiment on your one and only body if you wish. reply Eisenstein 9 hours agorootparentI would hope that there were a better &#x27;we don&#x27;t need evidence because it is obvious they are harmful&#x27; argument than &#x27;things are complex and we don&#x27;t know yet&#x27;. reply shortcake27 13 hours agoparentprev> and get rid of the &#x27;wrap everything in a layer of plastic&#x27; tendencies that are completely unnecessary.If only fruits and vegetables had robust, natural, bio-degradable packaging of their own. Some sort of peelable skin, perhaps. reply hutzlibu 12 hours agorootparent\"bio-degradable packaging\"That is the thing: they rot. And if wrapped in plastic, they last longer ... so more fruit makes it to the markets. That being said, I strongly prefer fruits directly from trees that were not treated with 50+ different chemicals. reply wahnfrieden 9 hours agorootparentless an issue if people eat locally and seasonally reply hutzlibu 1 hour agorootparentBut overwhelmingly they don&#x27;t. reply mandmandam 8 minutes agorootparentIn our fucked-up society, yes.

Thousands of years. replyhammock 13 hours agoparentprev>There is no evidence that these things cause damage in mammals despite all the alarming researchThere is no evidence despite all the research evidence?Or do you mean, there is more evidence that cell phones do not cause harm, than there is that they do cause harm? reply shortcake27 13 hours agorootparentThere is no conclusive evidence. IE it has neither been proved in a lab nor observed in the population. Also, there is no known mechanism by which they could cause harm.I don’t know why the burden of proof is so difficult for people to understand. If you make a claim, the onus is on you to prove it, not for others to disprove it. reply Eisenstein 13 hours agorootparentprev> There is no evidence despite all the research evidence?I am confused.
