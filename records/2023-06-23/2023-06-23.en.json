    "content": "June 22, 2023I've had a busy week, so I didn't have time until today to read this news about Red Hat locking down RHEL sources behind a Red Hat subscription.I repeat the title: Red Hat, are you dumb?When Red Hat decided to turn the community CentOS distribution into a leading-edge distro instead of basically \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but free\", users like me were justifiably angered.I don't contribute to CentOS or Red Hat development much, if at all. But I have, for over a decade, provided software and tools that were compatible with RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and sometimes other more exotic distros.I could test my stuff against CentOS Stream... or UBI... or Fedora. Those are mostly like RHEL. Or I could try linking a Red Hat Developer subscription to my test runners and build tools so I could use a licensed copy of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, because that would be required for... actually ensuring compatibility.But that's dumb.So at this point, I have to say: fool me once, Red Hat\u2014shame on you. Fool me twice?At this point I'm determining whether I want to continue supporting just Fedora, or just dropping all support for RHEL and RHEL-like distributions on my open source projects. It's not worth the hassle if I'm not even sure projects like Rocky or Alma Linux can fill in the gap left by CentOS's demise for users like me.And no, please don't post \"but you can use your Red Hat Developer Subscription!\" I don't have to with Debian. Or Ubuntu. Or Arch. Or... you get the point.Update: Just wanted to point out two official statements, one from Alma Linux, another from Rocky Linux.Further readingCracks are showing in Enterprise Open Source's foundationsInstalling the Asahi Linux Alpha on my M1 Mac miniI'm thankful for GitHub, Patreon, and my sponsors this yearlinux red hat open sourceAdd new commentCommentsJeff Geerling \u2013 11 hours agoIt pains me to write this, because there are many people within Red Hat who are amazing folks who I respect greatly.

RH was early to the game and made good moves to become a PROFITABLE Linux company through authority over time. But this is also why I don't USE Red Hat, the management makes weird decisions sometimes that are very much user-hostile, like this, the CentOS purchase, etc. I have no doubt they'll be around for a long time, and they'll continue to do good work on OSS and make money, but as a USER I can't trust them.replyAnnatar \u2013 9 hours agoRed Hat was always a company of B and C players. It's a company staffed by idiots, for idiots.replyBig Purple sho\u2026 \u2013 9 hours agoThey still publish the tags on the CentOS stream git repo. This is a non-story.replyHakan Bayindir \u2013 7 hours agoIn reply to byCentOS stream is beta software. It's not deemed stable, and is not bug to bug compatible with RHEL. What Alma and Rocky are bug-for-bug, drop-in replacements for RHEL, and they are being used by pretty serious infrastructures maintained by people who know what they are doing and need no support.This move dynamites a lot of production systems compromised of hundreds, if not thousands of instances which run 24/7/365 without any support from RedHat.replyNeil Hanlon \u2013 1 hour agoIn reply to byThey don't, though. There are no tags in CentOS Stream, nor are the commits 1:1 in a manner which they can be backported trivially.https://gitlab.com/redhat/centos-stream/rpms/bash/-/tagsreplyJonEffinZoidberg \u2013 8 hours agoI've been a huge supporter & user of CentOS for nearly 2 decades. I've also been a supporter of Rocky linux since they were announced.. But I no longer use Fedora/CentOS in my home labs. I've switched over to Ubuntu.I don't even provide software to others, but as someone who depends on reliability for the companies I work for we've started using far less Red Hat software.My new parent company has even switched to Oracle linux over RHEL because of their crazy behavior. So even people who used to use direct RHEL have switched over to Oracle which I dislike. But there's nothing I can do.replyjemisa \u2013 8 hours agoYou should change your title to 'Dear IBM: Are you dump?\"replyCristian Paul \u2013 8 hours agoA reminder that free software is not \"gratis\" but \"libre\" and you can always charge for it.How bad is this from a marketing point of view, that's not for me to understand since I don't work at RedHat... That's a reminder that corporation behind free/open source projects its always dangerous compared with community driven projects like Debian\"Many people believe that the spirit of the GNU Project is that you should not charge money for distributing copies of software, or that you should charge as little as possible\u2014just enough to cover the cost. This is a misunderstanding.\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.htmlreplyBryan J Smith \u2013 8 hours agoI agree on most everything you stated. However ...I wouldn't use LTS as an argument against Stream. They are a lot more alike than not. E.g., there is this catch-22 now ...LTS fanboy (then): \"I cannot believe Red Hat hasn't patched this customer bugfix or security hole that is already upstream! Even Fedora has it!\"LTS fanboy (now): \"I cannot believe Stream is backporting and patching all bugs and security holes immediately! That's unstable!\"RHEL is for when you only want high/important/critical security fixes, and nothing else. You wait for the next update X.Y+1 for the roll-up of all customer bugfixes and security patches.Stream is for when you want all customer bugfixes and all security fixes as they exit the Red Hat build & unit-integration-regression test system.that feed all RHEL packages as well, but are not held back.Can't have it both ways. But I agree it's wrong for Red Hat to cut off the SRPMS. But I wouldn't use LTS as an example against Stream. Stream stands on its own very, very well, right down to the backporting and kABI of the RHEL release. It just doesn't wait for the next update to release bugfixes and lower risk security patches.replySpikeWatchdog \u2013 7 hours agoYou better write \"IBM are you dumb?\" . IBM ... when Idiots Become Managers is between my favorite ones (ex IBMer here).replyMike Butash \u2013 7 hours agoI'd more than lost faith along the way with RH (Linux user since 2000) once the hard sell began for RHEL vs. CentOS began long before Stream, and Fedora was just always some bastard cousin of theirs to me. The IBM acquisition just signaled doom, where anyone that's been around this industry any amount of time knows no good will come from that. IBM will never innovate, they'll simply squeeze the rock harder to bleed it for pension payments.Full time Ubuntu user since 2006, later Arch since 2018. I only do Cent/RH when a vendor product requires only it.replyDavid Mohring \u2013 6 hours agoGiven the effect the decision by IBM to cut access to the source has on the market, which effectively considers RH clones as public infrastructure, why hasn't the USA Federal Trade Commission stepped in, especially given the lock in through the OEM agreements with Microsoft & RH?replyDavid Mohring \u2013 3 hours agoIn reply to byFor example as with the Telecom industry attempt to move away from the Network Neutrality model in 2006.https://itheresies.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.htmlhttps://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2006/08/ftc-chairma\u2026When you consider how many business, organisations, governmental services & just people use services hosted on CENTOS clones.The main problem is that OEMs test & even validate server/workstation/desktop/laptop hardware for both Microsoft & RedHat OSs on the OEM provided hardware, under agreements which MAY have caveats that effect competition.Currently you can get around this by when you purchase, lease or collocate OEM hardware originally purchased with the NO-Operating-System option or more likely second hand, but if the hardware has been tested with Red Hat Enterprise Linux it should work as expected under CENTOS clones.It opens the market to other providers as does Telecom Network Neutrality.IBM's decision to limit source access under any licence limiting redistribution significantly changes the market and should be investigated by the FTC and other competition monitoring agencies in the EU & worldwide.reply",

    "content": "One Thing BetterSubscribeHow to Do the Thing You've Been AvoidingWhat if there's no good reason to avoid it?Jason FeiferMay 30, 2023Welcome to One Thing Better. Each week, the editor in chief of Entrepreneur magazine (that's me) shares one way to level up \u2014 and build a career or company you love.Today\u2019s one thing: The thing you think is a bad idea.That one thing, better: Maybe try it?DALL-E 2. Prompt: \u201cone-line drawing of someone hiding behind a wall\u201dThere\u2019s something you\u2019re not doing right now.You\u2019re not exploring something. Asking for something. Acting on something. Why? Because it\u2019s a bad idea.But let\u2019s interrogate that for a moment. Do you actually know it\u2019s a bad idea? Like, is it verifiably bad? Road-tested? Experienced? Did you try it before, to horrific results?My guess: You just think it\u2019s a bad idea, so you ruled it out.Today I\u2019m going to show you why, sometimes, the thing we think is a liability is really our greatest asset. And I\u2019ll start with how I learned this for myself \u2014 with one of America\u2019s favorite comedians.It all started at 30 Rock\u2026My LinkedIn followers may recognize this next part, because I recently shared it there. But I\u2019m about to go much deeper\u2026About a year ago, I interviewed Jimmy Fallon for a cover profile in Entrepreneur. We met in his office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and he is exactly like you\u2019d expect \u2014 warm, genuine, thoughtful. We had a great conversation that went long beyond our scheduled time.As we wrapped up, Jimmy invited me to reach out if I had follow-up questions. I said thanks, but that I\u2019d already taken up a lot of his time and I wanted to respect that.And yet, as I wrote the story, I realized that I\u2019d missed a big question. I really did need to follow up! I debated the wisdom of this. Did he actually want to talk again? Was I being a burden? I tried finishing the story on my own, but it just wasn\u2019t working \u2014 I needed a little more from Jimmy. So with some hesitancy, I requested a follow-up call.It took a week. Jimmy\u2019s busy.\u201cI really appreciate you squeezing this in,\u201d I said to Jimmy when we reconnected by phone.\u201cNo one ever takes me up on it!\u201d Jimmy replied. \u201cSo I was like, yeah! He\u2019s thorough, he\u2019s smart. Let\u2019s do it \u2014 I can\u2019t wait.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so funny,\u201d I replied, \u201cbecause I think, oh, following up is a burden.\u201d\u201cNever,\u201d Jimmy said.Let\u2019s recap: Jimmy has been interviewed many times, and often offers to answer follow-up questions. Nobody takes him up on it, but I did. And to Jimmy, that wasn\u2019t a burden \u2014 it was a sign of thoroughness.And he appreciates thoroughness.This moment altered how I think. I started to wonder:What else do I think is bad, that other people think is good?You should be wondering the same thing.Here\u2019s how to figure it out.Beware the \u201cfalse consensus effect\u201dI love this term from psychology. It\u2019s the common belief that other people think exactly like you do \u2014 or, in research-speak, that people \u201csee their own behavioral choices and judgments as relatively common and appropriate to existing circumstances.\u201dAs a result, we may do or avoid things because we assume other people think the same.But we don\u2019t actually know if they think the same.So, isn\u2019t it worth a closer look?Like I said at the start of this newsletter: There\u2019s something you\u2019re not doing right now, because you think it\u2019s a bad idea. Maybe it\u2019s an interaction with someone \u2014 a thing you want to ask or tell or do with them. Or maybe it\u2019s bigger than that. Maybe it\u2019s a project, a change, a new direction.It\u2019s time to see if this is really a bad idea. Start with some simple questions, like:1. Why do I think this is a bad idea?For example, I thought following up with Jimmy was a bad idea. Why? Because he and I agreed to a certain amount of interview time, and he already gave me more than that.But in retrospect, that was just why I thought it was a bad idea. I had no idea what anyone else thought, including Jimmy.So, next question\u20262. How do I actually know it\u2019s a bad idea?There could be a good answer to this. Maybe the thing you\u2019re considering is mean. Or reckless. Or against the law. Those are bad ideas!But, maybe you\u2019re just considering something\u2026 new? Bold? Uncomfortable? Unorthodox?Do you know it\u2019s a bad idea? Or is this just the false consensus effect at play? Maybe you just assume other people think the way you do?Well, there\u2019s only one way to find out. Time for the next question:3. Am I the only one who thinks this?Can\u2019t hurt to ask! Ask multiple people. Poll your trusted friends and colleagues.I first learned about the false consensus effect from Katy Milkman, a Wharton professor who studies how people make decisions. I spoke to her for my book, and she told me this:\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about how do I make a change, or what\u2019s the right change, try to think, \u2018Is there social information I can gather from other people who\u2019ve pursued a similar path or faced a similar dilemma or actually made these changes? And what can I copy and paste that worked for them?\u2019 \u201dOther people\u2019s experiences! It is a bountiful resource we don\u2019t take enough advantage of.And if you\u2019re still not sure after that?There\u2019s only one question left:4. What\u2019s the worst that can happen if I\u2019m wrong?Game it out. What truly is the worst-case scenario? That someone says no? That a project fails? That you have to try something else?My worst-case scenario would have been this: Jimmy Fallon got back on the phone with me, but he was a little annoyed about it.New to this newsletter? Subscribe!OK! It\u2019s good to know the potential consequences of our actions. Now you can compare the worst-case scenario against another imagined future, which goes like this:What happens if I never try it? Truly, what happens? Are you unfulfilled by the project you never tried? Sad you never opened up to that person? Wasting away at a job you never left?Now you can compare which is worse \u2014 the small risk of a worse-case scenario, or the absolute certainty of not taking action.Sometimes, the only way to know is to have the experience\u2026And the experience might surprise you.Here\u2019s a similar lesson I learned.I love doing favors for people. And yet, I hate asking for favors. It makes me uncomfortable. Like I\u2019m being an imposition.But when my book came out last year, I needed help from everyone I knew. That meant calling in every favor I could \u2014 from friends, acquaintances, celebrities, and even strangers. So after a lot of hesitation, I started doing it.Know what happened?DALL-E 2. Prompt: \u201cone-line drawing of someone jumping out from behind a wall, lots of color\u201dFirst of all, people responded with overwhelming enthusiasm. They said yes to almost everything I asked. I\u2019ve never felt more supported.Then came the real shock. Many of my good friends, who I\u2019d already done many favors for, told me some version of this:\u275dFINALLY. You\u2019ve done so much for me, and I\u2019ve always felt bad that I couldn\u2019t repay you. Now I\u2019m so happy I can.\u201dThat\u2019s when I realized my error. I always thought that asking for favors was a burden to others. But in truth, the burden was NOT asking for favors! I was STIFLING relationships because of it!The thing I thought was a liability was actually an asset.Now I act differently. I ask for favors. I\u2019m still not comfortable doing it; you can\u2019t easily change who you are. But at least I know how other people think. And I know that they don\u2019t think like me. And I know that\u2019s a good thing. A liberating thing! It means I live in a world of possibilities, where I can be wrong in the best possible way.Sometimes we turn over a rock and find a diamond underneath.But we\u2019d never know, unless we\u2019re willing to turn over the rock.So, let\u2019s get back to that thing you think is a bad idea.Why do you think it\u2019s bad? How do you really know? Do others think the same? And honestly, what is the worst that can happen? Maybe it\u2019s worth the risk; maybe it is not. That\u2019s for you to decide. There are no guarantees. But I will say this, just to help you engage with a world of limitless potential: Maybe you should just do it, so that you know what\u2019s on the other side of that decision. So that your life is larger. More informed. So that you have the experience. So that you know. And so that other people \u2014 the people you like, the people you love, or just the people you want to attract or know better \u2014 can benefit from the thing you were afraid to give them.That\u2019s not such a bad idea, is it?And that\u2019s how to do one thing better.You Don\u2019t Have to Do EverythingDALL-E 2.

Some are almost impossible to grow when you're a business of one. But how can you find a business that you can easily grow as a solo-founder or small team?Understanding the types of business that are most suited to being a solo-founder can save years of frustration. Understanding the markets that are suited to small self-funded businesses, will shorten your road to success from years to months.Unfortunately I spent a decade learning this the hard way. Every day I see people making the same mistakes, mainly because we naturally copy what big companies do.Don't think big. Think smallWe're unconsciously influenced by companies that we use ourselves. Think Netflix, Notion, Twitter, Gmail. These companies all have a few things in common:They require scale (lots of customers)They target consumers for a major part of their businessThey charge a low price (or are free)They exist in large marketsThey have a lot of money to spendBut don't worry. As a small business, we can craft an offering that avoids all these points and is much more likely to succeed.Here's how to do it, step by step:1. Avoid businesses that require scaleAs a solo-founder or small bootstrapped business, any type of product/service that requires a massive number of users is best to avoid.I discovered this the hard way with one of my early startup attempts. The idea was a wedding directory that I was positioning as \"TripAdvisor for weddings\" (this was in TripAdvisor's heyday). It was a 2-sided marketplace and targeted the entire UK wedding market. The market I chose was too big. The business required network effects on a massive scale to work, and trying to attract engaged couples and wedding vendors on this scale, with no budget, was basically impossible. As a result, I was forced to keep changing the focus of the business, making it constantly more niche, in an attempt to have a small enough market where the network effects could take over. Ultimately I couldn't build those effects quick enough, in such a transient market as weddings. I shut it down. It failed. It's very hard to create network effects when you're the only one working on it. You don't have the time or money to make it work.Have a think about other businesses that require network effects. For example, social networks. All the major social networks were funded early and were typically unprofitable for a long time before they reached scale that allowed them to monetize effectively. As a small-business, you can't compete against the spending, or sustain losses for a prolonged period.2. Don't charge low pricesThe other thing to avoid is charging low prices. Why? Because getting customers is hard! Sales and marketing are both major time drains and you can't spend all your time doing them. Again, if you have low prices, you need to reach hundreds or thousands of customers (that scale problem again).I see a lot of people starting a subscription business and charging \"Netflix style\" prices. e.g $10/month. We are so conditioned to these types of pricing, that we naturally want to replicate them. But converting consumers to a $10 month subscription is much more difficult than you might imagine. If you work really hard and get up to 100 users, you're still only at $1k per month and that doesn't take into account running costs and users cancelling. You need to constantly bring on more users to replace those who leave.On the flip-side, you could just have 1 single B2B client paying $10k per month for a service and make 10x the amount, with lower running costs and no churn. 1 sale vs 100. 10x revenue vs 1x.3. Target businesses. Not consumersThe easiest way to avoid the challenges of scale and low prices is to target businesses, rather than consumers. Not only does it allow you to sell at higher prices (so you don't need scale), it 's also a much easier sell. Here are a few reasons why:Businesses are happy to spend money on things that help them grow. It increases revenue.Business expenses reduce profits and therefore taxes on those profits. The expense is offset against future taxes.Businesses allocate money for training, marketing etc. They are literally looking to spend the money.It's often part of somebody's job description to spend that money, so you can find out what role within the company spends the money and sell to them directly.This is not true in the consumer world. Consumers are very cautious with spending. A $49 subscription to a consumer is a lot, whereas a business wouldn't bat an eyelid.Here are a couple of examples of the difference between consumer and business mentality with spending:Twitter Blue caused outrage in the Twitter community when they started charging \u00a36 per month. They charge organizations \u00a31,140 a month, for that same tick in a different color and Organizations are happy to pay.Gmail is one of the most popular email tools ever created. If they started charging $1 a month, they would lose 90+% of their users to a free alternative. Meanwhile, Superhuman email launched a couple of years ago and targeted business users exclusively. They shook the market by charging $30 per month for an email client. This is a service we are conditioned to expect to be free. But the product was great and helped business users save time on emails, and therefore allocate their time elsewhere and make more money. It grew like wildfire.If you're a solo-founder, you need to minimize your time spent on attracting customers (because it's just you) and maximize your product price. Selling B2B solves both of these problems.4. Don\u2019t choose a large marketThe larger the market, the bigger the competition. If you were a goldfish, would you rather live in an ocean, or a garden pond? Probably the pond. In the ocean, you are competing with millions of other fish, most of whom are much bigger than you, and will ultimately eat you. In a pond, you might be the biggest fish. This is exactly how you want to think about your business. Choose a market where you can be the biggest fish. If you decide to start a sports shoe brand, you'll be competing with Nike, Adidas and countless others. Niche that down and make it a Pickleball shoe brand and suddenly you're the only player in the market. You're the biggest fish. You can hone in specifically on that customer's needs and take the entire pickle ball shoe market.In SummarySwap scale for small and charge higher prices to businesses.Instead of a social network, build a niche professional communityInstead of an AI blog, write an AI image-generation newsletter for social media managersInstead of a general web-design agency, start a web agency targeting Logistics companies in the UKThink smaller markets with bigger budgets. The opportunities are endless.I hope this guide was helpful.

    "content": "Announcing Svelte 4Updated performance, developer experience, and siteTHE SVELTE TEAM JUN 22 2023After months in the making, we're excited to announce the stable release of Svelte 4.Time flies - Svelte 3 was released more than four years ago! In JavaScript-framework-time, that's eons. Svelte\u2019s freshness has persisted throughout, but Node.js and browser APIs have evolved during that time and today we\u2019re updating Svelte to take advantage of some of these improvements. Svelte 4 is mainly a maintenance release, bumping minimum version requirements and tightening up the design in specific areas. It sets the stage for the next generation of Svelte to be released as Svelte 5 - we think you\u2019ll love it.If you haven't tried Svelte yet, take it for a spin in our interactive tutorial, on StackBlitz, or locally withnpm create svelte@latest. Svelte lets you easily put together web UIs leveraging the power of HTML, CSS, JS, and the Svelte compiler. Watch Svelte Radio Live to learn more about this release.What's newPerformanceThis release results in smaller and faster hydration code. To see the impact, SvelteKit users can see their compiled output shrink in size by examining the.svelte-kit/output/client/_app/immutable/nodesfolder. For example, on kit.svelte.dev the JS generated across the whole site was reduced in size by 12.7% (126.3 kB to 110.2 kB).Svelte 4 reduces the Svelte package size by nearly 75% (10.6 MB down to 2.8 MB), which means less waiting onnpm install. This improvement will be especially noticeable for users who are loading our interactive learning experience on learn.svelte.dev for the first time, users of the Svelte REPL, and users with limited connectivity. The majority of the remaining package size is eslint support, which necessitates distributing a CJS build, and once the eslint rewrite is completed the Svelte package size can drop by over another 50%.The number of dependencies in Svelte has been greatly reduced from 61 down to 16. This means faster downloads for our users as well as less susceptibility to supply chain attacks. We also slightly reduced the number of dependencies in the latest versions of SvelteKit as well.Developer experienceSvelte 4 makes the Svelte authoring experience more intuitive and consistent:|localis now the default for transitions to avoid animations blocking page transitions, preprocessors are now easier to write, and multiple fixes make CSP easier to set up and use.For users of web components, the largest change is an overhaul of the way you use Svelte to author custom elements. By changing the way they are generated, a whole class of bugs and inconsistencies was eliminated.Finally, we\u2019ve also made several improvements to the IDE authoring experience: cmd+click in svelte modules now takes you to the implementation rather than a.d.tsfile imports fromsvelte/internalare now hidden and will not clutter autocomplete suggestions auto-imports now work more reliablyUpdated site, docs, and tutorialThe official svelte.dev site has gotten an overhaul. It\u2019s now split into multiple pages with improved mobile nav, overhauled typescript docs, dark mode, and an enhanced REPL. The SvelteKit site is also being updated to match. And we\u2019ve updated all the tutorial links to point to our new learn.svelte.dev experience. The old tutorial remains available for users of Safari 16.3 and earlier.Stay tuned for a more in-depth blog post about all the site changes in the coming days!MigratingMost apps and libraries that are compatible with Svelte 3 should be compatible with Svelte 4. Library authors will need to update the version range to include Svelte 4 ifsvelteis specified in thepeerDependencies. For application authors, the most common change required will be updating tooling to meet the new minimum version requirements such as Node.js 16. Many other migration steps can be handled withnpx svelte-migrate@latest svelte-4.Read the migration guide for full details.Svelte 5: the next generation of SvelteSvelte 5 will be a rewrite of the Svelte compiler and runtime. Svelte 4 was mainly about setting the ground for these future improvements by adopting modern tooling and dropping support for some legacy versions of various technologies such as older bundlers. These changes will help us in a number of ways such as being able to more easily compare the Svelte 5 and Svelte 4 codebases and being able to run the existing tests against the new implementation. Svelte 5 will bring major new features and performance improvements to Svelte. The changes are still baking and not quite ready to share yet, but stay tuned!ChangelogSee the full list of changes in the changelog.AcknowledgementsFirst and foremost, thank you to all of the many Svelte maintainers and contributors who made this release possible.

Just needs one click joining for voice channels. This is an under-appreciated killer feature of discord that slack missed when implementing huddles. The ability to instantly hop in and out of voice channels is what keeps discord from feeling like any other teleconferencing app. Any friction to this makes it so I am less likely to just casually jump into a call.replyTheBrokenRail 13 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Please no.As someone who doesn't use voice channels, I can't even count how many times I've accidentally joined them because I mis-clicked. And then I have to find the \"end call\" button because, of course, it's small and located away from the channel itself. It is so unbelievably annoying.The best feature Discord added recently was the ability to hide channels, so I can finally, once and for all, forget about voice channels.replyfalsenapkin 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I've been using Discord since 2017 and in that time I think I've literally never accidentally joined a voice channel? The app even prompts you if you're sure about joining under some circumstances.GP is right, frictionless voice channels is a killer feature. Maybe a toggleable prompt or some other feature to prevent accidentally joining can be an opt-in.replyTheBrokenRail 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]> I've been using Discord since 2017 and in that time I think I've literally never accidentally joined a voice channel?I've also been on Discord since 2017, and I've done it many times. Especially on servers which put voice channels right next to text channels. And I'm not the only one either, judging by another comment[0].[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36439417> The app even prompts you if you're sure about joining under some circumstances.The app is even worse! It brings a full-screen pop-up and if you haven't granted Discord microphone permissions, it will bug you, every, single, time.replyfalsenapkin 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Maybe ask the server admins to make a voice channel category and then not only are text/voice separated/grouped but you can collapse the voice category when not using a voice channel. I really just don't see this problem, it's not even that I haven't done it but also I don't see other people doing it. To be fair though, like half the servers I'm active in organize their channels in this separated way.Anyway, I think opt-in for some kind of friction makes sense.replysteveklabnik 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Part of the issue here is that historically, audio channels didn't have any association with text channels, and so you'd find setups where people would pair them up and interleave them.Nowadays each audio channel has an associated text channel, making it a lot easier.replyamatecha 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Yeah, it's obvious - just have a user setting: \"Join voice channels without confirmation\". Requiring confirmation should be the default, to prevent users from accidentally joining.replytinus_hn 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]At least on all the commercial platforms you can now say that specific apps don\u2019t have access to the microphone so this is a fixed problem.replyWingy 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]When someone clicks a voice channel, prompt the user to confirm that they want to join along with a \u201cdon\u2019t ask again\u201d option. Have this option be reconfigurable in user settings if you decide that you do want the prompt later.replywetbaby 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Any design which removes friction in an application gets my blessing. Having to long press and confirm or approve some benign action is super frustrating. Is accidentally joining a call really that bad? \"Whoops\" *Drop call*replyjrflowers 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Exposing your microphone to countless strangers could in theory have worse outcomes than \u201cwoops\u201d based off numerous factors, such as what you\u2019re doing/talking about/listening to and how long it takes you to notice that you are broadcasting the audio of the room that you\u2019re in.replywetbaby 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I use push to talk because I'm considerate.Keep your mic muted if this is a concern.Discord makes it clear when you're in a call.I simply do not believe in adding friction because of bad users.replyjrflowers 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Push-to-talk is literally adding friction because of \u201cbad users\u201d.If everybody were \u201cconsiderate\u201d then a simple toggle wouldn\u2019t cause any issues.replynumpad0 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Also once the session is up, it's too late for your purposes.

I should try introducing mumble into our company, come to think of it. I remember not understanding the client-side TLS certificate thing, so like, it had strong encryption way ahead of its time and the UI was basically as smooth as it could be because we all made it onto the server, even if we didn't understand what it was and the server just accepted any cert.It's a good reminder indeed, I hadn't considered the old gaming toolkit we used as teenagers and I work with 100% technical people that can figure out an apt install mumblereplyGrimburger 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Mumble's latency is unbeatable imo, it's basically their main focus and shows.The sticking point for me is the lack of persistent messages, something the devs strangely think is a privacy plus. Issue open since 2016: https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/2560If you drop out for a minute you won't have access to anything that was posted in chat, which makes it useless for anything other than voice only comms, that might suit some business purposes but I've always needed to post links or screenshots in chat during meetings.replyastrobe_ 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think in the case of Mumble, the chat feature is intended to be used to let people fix sound issues, nothing more.This sort of is yet another data point related to a conundrum: on one hand, applications that integrate multiple functionalities are convenient but there's always one or more functionality that doesn't fit your needs; on the other hand, applications that focus on one functionality do it well, but you have to hand pick one-by-one to fit all your needs, perhaps add some glue scripts/plugins to make them work nicely together, and this is inconvenient (in particular if you are not alone and not in an organization that \"dictates\" those choices) and a slow process.Basically it is Office365/LibreOffice/Emacs or Browsers (with plugins to add chat, email clients, etc.), issue trackers (sometimes feature Wikis and more), Git online front ends (sometimes offer Wikis and issue trackers), versus e.g. raw Git, Vim/Notepad/Nano, bare-bones browsers (Surf, Midori browsers), ...I favor the dedicate apps for things I do a lot - usually I eventually know them pretty well and I have the know-how to make them interoperate. For more casual stuff, I'm like the random user - the convenience just wins.But for communication applications, as long as people jump the bandwagon of the latest private service provided \"for free\", you have to go with the flow or only be the nerd that talks with nerds on obscure networks.replynannal 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Be it bad ears or a pretty rudimentary testing method, but the experience we had at a lan was that we could hear each other through mumble before hearing a shout from across a room.replysolarkraft 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's crazy how collaboration solutions keep missing this. I passionately hate \"calls\". You don't catch people with a lasso to talk to them in real life.replylucb1e 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Not sure I understand. They're called \"meetings\" IRL right? Just that they're now online, a lot of the time. We use the word call and meeting interchangeably, I'm not really seeing the difference.(The only difference between before covid and after is that we are more people and have more calls that take longer. Text chatting is a lot more structured and efficient and inclusive because nobody has to wait for a turn while the topic evolves past five persons before it gets to you, but whenever a topic gets more than a handful of messages, invariably $boss will propose to stop wasting time and \"plan a meeting\" .... but I also have that experience with IRL meetings when there are more than, say, five people involved)replyvel0city 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Seeing who is in the channel is the big difference. It's one thing to just phone someone up, potentially disturbing them from whatever they were doing and suddenly demanding their attention through a ring. It's another thing to see they're in an open communication space and hop in to join impromptu. There's significantly less social friction involved.replyjacoblambda 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]The problem is that in the real world you can have more than one conversation in a space. With a group call/channel you get exactly one conversation or a bunch of people yelling over each other.You could probably make that work in VC but the UX is going to be awkward and un-intuitive no matter how you slice it.So the best option (online/available status and 1:1 calls which is what we have now) is probably the best alternative.replysteveklabnik 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Discords usually have multiple audio channels, solve the \"exactly one\" issue. If you really want to have two conversations, one group drops down to another one.replydoctor_eval 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It\u2019s about the ceremony involved to initiate an informal meeting.IRL you might just grab an empty office or room and hit the whiteboard for ten minutes.In other tools you need to invite specific people to a chat, and they have to find and respond to that specific event.In discord you say \u201clet\u2019s meet in the engineering channel\u201d and anyone who also wants to join can do so.It\u2019s a seemingly simple difference but I found discord so great for remote work relative to slack. It\u2019s just much more casual, like real life.replyandrewmutz 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I think he's referring to just walking up to someone and talking to them in the office.replyheyoni 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Lol! This is such a great analogy I might lasso some folks just to tell them about it.replysteanne 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]the very first time i went looking for a discord plugin, i was looking for a way to block that after having entered too many chat channels accidentally. it might be a killer OPTION.replyuoaei 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]It's like talking over cubicle walls vs scheduling conference rooms.replyburnished 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You can do this in slack by starting a huddle in a common channel. Its not as good but helps somewhat.replycannonpalms 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I think they mean that you cannot hop between different huddles in a single click.replyburnished 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, I believe you are correct, discord makes it easier to see what you are potentially getting into much easier.replyloctal 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Why is slack preferred over teams, discord or revolt?replyburnished 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I'm not sure, it seems like a corporate thing? I prefer discord personally, unfamiliar with revolt, will say that teams in an academic setting was immensely frustrating.But I use slack for work and some org's community space is also on slack so I make the best of it that I can.replypohuing 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]But you can do thatreplymoojd 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Nice! I tried but I must be missing something. Is it a setting? Only way I can see to join voice is to click on the channel and then click the voice button?replypohuing 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You can create an invite link to a voice channel instead.

Too bad the metadata isn't surfaced somewhere so you could kinda discern \"last substantial change\" vs. \"last actual time anyone made an edit of any sort to this file\".replykstrauser 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]How's this better than Matrix?(Not a leading question. I haven't used Discord/Matrix/etc. more than a handful of times and don't know what I don't know.)replylogicprog 14 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]What made me choose Revolt over Matrix is the user interface and structure. I vastly prefer the server-with-multiple-chatrooms paradigm that Discord (and by extension Revolt) use, it's a much nicer way to host a hangout with your friends if you have more than a few, so conversations about different things can happen in different places and people can avoid stuff they're not interested in. Matrix kinda has this in that you can group groupchats, but the UI is a lot more awkward. Additionally, Revolt has custom emoji, and you would not believe how reliant you can get on custom emoji if you and your friend group have gotten used to using the samw set for years.reply3np 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Matrix is a protocol. It doesn't have a UI as such. I guess a more useful question could be \"why isn't Revolt using Matrix?\"replyneltnerb 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Yes, that was what came to mind for me. My Element UI has organizations (servers) and rooms and people in them, surely Matrix would support all the features this has as well? Perhaps you used it before this was supported.Or maybe Matrix has some issue I don't know about, which is a more interesting question. Element seems to have both video and audio chat, but leaves a lot to be desired on the UI side sometimes. I can definitely imagine the more the merrier when it comes to open source UIs for open protocols.replyjustaj 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You're trying to compare a web app to a protocol. Better question would be: Why is this not powered by Matrix?replymuzzio 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Does Matrix have the equivalent of voice chat rooms that Discord has? I find as a user of Discord that being able to see who's just hanging out is the killer feature there.

Without competition, open source or otherwise, there is very little reason for a popular project to keep improvingThis is a very common worldview nowadays, in fact it's probably the core tenet of the contemporary credo, but that's also an extremely narrow view of human psychogy: humans routinely seek to achieve the best they can do without any kind of competition.Worse, with competition people tend to optimize for the specific metric the competition is about, and everything end up looking the same (from movies to retail product, that's the \u201dice cream vendor paradox\u201d), if you want to explore the entire problem espace you need to remove competition and let people set their own goals.In fact, since there's almost never a reward, the vast majority of open-source products exist solely because their creator wanted it to exist, and they are maintained because their creator just want their creation to be perfect.Oh, and by the way, biological evolution isn't about competition either, that was just Victorian England elite projecting their worldviews on a biological phenomenon: species don't want to win anything[1], some \u201cpacks of genes\u201d just happen to be more suited to persist over time than others.[1] \u201cspecies\u201d don't even exist in the real world, it's just a simplifying (and useful) model of the world (if you're interested in learning more about that, look for \u201cBeefalo\u201d and \u201cpan-genome\u201d.replyAnimats 19 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]The next big worry is Github.

It takes an incredible amount of data to train AI systems to perform specific tasks accurately and reliably. Many companies pay gig workers on platforms like Mechanical Turk to complete tasks that are typically hard to automate, such as solving CAPTCHAs, labeling data and annotating text. This data is then fed into AI models to train them. The workers are poorly paid and are often expected to complete lots of tasks very quickly. Related StoryWe are hurtling toward a glitchy, spammy, scammy, AI-powered internetLarge language models are full of security vulnerabilities, yet they\u2019re being embedded into tech products on a vast scale.No wonder some of them may be turning to tools like ChatGPT to maximize their earning potential. But how many? To find out, a team of researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) hired 44 people on the gig work platform Amazon Mechanical Turk to summarize 16 extracts from medical research papers. Then they analyzed their responses using an AI model they\u2019d trained themselves that looks for telltale signals of ChatGPT output, such as lack of variety in choice of words. They also extracted the workers\u2019 keystrokes in a bid to work out whether they\u2019d copied and pasted their answers, an indicator that they\u2019d generated their responses elsewhere.They estimated that somewhere between 33% and 46% of the workers had used AI models like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. It\u2019s a percentage that\u2019s likely to grow even higher as ChatGPT and other AI systems become more powerful and easily accessible, according to the authors of the study, which has been shared on arXiv and is yet to be peer-reviewed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the end of crowdsourcing platforms. It just changes the dynamics,\u201d says Robert West, an assistant professor at EPFL, who coauthored the study. Using AI-generated data to train AI could introduce further errors into already error-prone models. Large language models regularly present false information as fact. If they generate incorrect output that is itself used to train other AI models, the errors can be absorbed by those models and amplified over time, making it more and more difficult to work out their origins, says Ilia Shumailov, a junior research fellow in computer science at Oxford University, who was not involved in the project.Even worse, there\u2019s no simple fix. \u201cThe problem is, when you\u2019re using artificial data, you acquire the errors from the misunderstandings of the models and statistical errors,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to make sure that your errors are not biasing the output of other models, and there\u2019s no simple way to do that.\u201dThe study highlights the need for new ways to check whether data has been produced by humans or AI. It also highlights one of the problems with tech companies\u2019 tendency to rely on gig workers to do the vital work of tidying up the data fed to AI systems. \u201cI don\u2019t think everything will collapse,\u201d says West. \u201cBut I think the AI community will have to investigate closely which tasks are most prone to being automated and to work on ways to prevent this.\u201dby Rhiannon Williamslinkedinlink opens in a new windowtwitterlink opens in a new windowfacebooklink opens in a new windowemaillink opens in a new windowPOPULARGeoffrey Hinton tells us why he\u2019s now scared of the tech he helped buildWill Douglas HeavenMeet the people who use Notion to plan their whole livesRhiannon WilliamsDeep learning pioneer Geoffrey Hinton has quit GoogleWill Douglas HeavenThe future of generative AI is niche, not generalizedKen MugrageDEEP DIVEARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEGeoffrey Hinton tells us why he\u2019s now scared of the tech he helped build\u201cI have suddenly switched my views on whether these things are going to be more intelligent than us.\u201dBy Will Douglas Heavenarchive pageDeep learning pioneer Geoffrey Hinton has quit GoogleHinton will be speaking at EmTech Digital on Wednesday.By Will Douglas Heavenarchive pageThe future of generative AI is niche, not generalizedChatGPT has sparked speculation about artificial general intelligence.

Thus, to claim SotA performance, researchers tried to optimize for the best performance, given a certain training budget.The best performance within a certain training budget is achieved by training HUGE models on VAST datasets, for a relatively short amount of time. Almost all models could profit from simply training for longer, but the cost/benefit isn\u2018t there, if your goal is to achieve the best performance.This is also why distillation and quantization work so well.

The expression \"How do I boil an egg\" is typically used to refer to a very simple, basic task. In its literal sense, it means to cook an egg by boiling it in water. However, when used metaphorically, it can imply that someone is so lacking in basic knowledge or skills that they don\u2019t even know how to perform such a simple task. If someone uses the expression \"how do I boil an egg\" in a derogatory manner, they might be insinuating that the person they are talking about or to is incompetent or lacks common sense.

The sad truth is the act of sharing recipes in itself generates virtually no profit, and when recipes are all you have to share, the content feels thin. So they have to pad it with lifestyle blogs and ads.Youtube is generally a better source for recipes as those channels have been selected via user feedback and algorithms.

In my experience, the vast majority of recipes (especially those available for free on the internet) will produce something edible, maybe even decent, but are almost never great. If you cook long enough you can eyeball a new recipe and tell whether it's shit, but it's far much harder to tell the difference between mediocre and great without actually making the food.The superfluous \"my grandma used to make this before the war in the old country for my mom growing up\" crap adds nothing to a mediocre recipe, but learning that the author is a chef in an actual restaurant, went to culinary school, is part of a collective that rigorously test multiple versions of a recipe before publishing, or even learning that the grandma in the old country was a professional chef, really helps weed out mediocre recipes from actually great ones.There are a select few places online that I trust and have been getting more of the well reviewed actual cookbooks. New recipes from new places I usually try to find something similar from somewhere trusted or just go in with the expectation it won't actually be good.

The quality of the data can't go up without it.replysenectus1 23 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]what exactly is involved in training an AI?replyGartzenDeHaes 23 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]You could try the qualification test here: https://www.dataannotation.tech/Some examples:- writing creative stories in response to queries- writing corrective responses to \"unsafe\" queries- comparing the responses from different versions of the AI- identifying incorrect responsesreplyLegitShady 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I\u2019d guess most people aren\u2019t qualified to write creative stories.replyGartzenDeHaes 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They have \"qualifications\" for different tasks, so only a subset of their 100,000 workers write creative stories.replysenectus1 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]it seems like if someone gamified this, it would get done for \"free\"...replytehsauce 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Usually labeling text/images, answering simple questions, ranking or scoring.replypcurve 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]How does one find this as side job? sounds like a therapeutic work once in a while :)replyneaden 23 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You probably won't find it relaxing in practice but here you go: https://www.mturk.com/workerreplyBoxFour 23 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Spoiler: You get paid roughly a penny per task.replyuser432678 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Tagging the data for training, and also doing data clean up so the network is not trained on some complete garbage.replydroopyEyelids 23 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I'm also curious about this.
