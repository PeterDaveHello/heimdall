I don&#x27;t remember what they were specifically, but I do remember a few threads here about forks of the project. I don&#x27;t remember the name wavvy, so maybe this is another fork. I was thinking the fork discussed here previously also was a play on the \"*city\" name as well. reply conradludgate 4 hours agorootparentIIRC They 1. Changed the license 2. Added a CLA 3. Added telemetry to the prebuilt binary reply d-k-bo 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the largest of those forks is tenacity [1].

I was not expecting it to work on mobile Safari of all things, but it does! The UI is even usable.Audacity is an indispensable utility. It’s great to see it and other “real” software on the web. I’m reminded of Photopea[1] which is a web clone of Photoshop.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photopea.com&#x2F; reply autoexec 6 hours agoparent> Audacity is an indispensable utility. It’s great to see it and other “real” software on the web.It&#x27;s been a very long time since I used it, but didn&#x27;t Audacity turn evil, add a bunch of networking code it never needed before, and start spying on people? (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fosspost.org&#x2F;audacity-is-now-a-spyware&#x2F;). I remember people reverting to older \"safe\" versions.I guess that doesn&#x27;t much matter for this web app since it&#x27;s collecting your IP and data by design (their privacy policy seems very vague and handwavy), but for the desktop app it seemed like kind of a big deal at the time. reply asddubs 4 hours agorootparentIMHO the spyware angle was overblown. they added telemetry to the dev builds. the real thing I took issue with was adding a CLA after the fact reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 5 hours agoparentprevYeah I didn&#x27;t expect Photopea to be any good but now I use it all the time. Perfect Photoshop replacement for light editing. reply russellbeattie 11 hours agoparentprevIf all the browsers, including mobile ones, would implement all of the the FileSystem Access APIs, these types of apps would be even more usable.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Web&#x2F;API&#x2F;File_System... reply meepmorp 10 hours agorootparentAccording to that link, all the browsers do implement the non-experimental parts of that API. The other features seem to be ones that Chrome has shipped unilaterally - the links to the standards docs seem to only have Google authors for those bits. reply russellbeattie 9 hours agorootparentOK. Let me rephrase. If all browsers would support the very useful set of experimental FSA APIs implemented in Chrome&#x2F;Edge&#x27;s desktop browsers, then these types of web apps would be even more usable.There was nothing biased in my comment - even Chrome for Android doesn&#x27;t support these APIs. reply tambourine_man 7 hours agorootparentWhat useful features aren’t implemented in other browsers? reply mock-possum 7 hours agoparentprevI agree that it running on mobile safari is incredible - I wouldn’t call the UI ‘usable’ though, it’s a straight duplicate of the desktop UI, which isn’t geared for mobile by any stretch of the imagination, and is actually unusable on my iPhone due to (I assume) far too small a clickable area for most controls.A UI rework to incorporate mobile-friendly design would be a ton of effort, but it would really take this project to the next level! reply StevePerkins 7 hours agorootparentDoes EVERY desktop application really need to run on mobile? Some apps are just... call me crazy... desktop apps! (NOTE: \"native vs. browser-based\" is separate distinction from \"desktop vs. mobile\".)That&#x27;s not to say that there can&#x27;t be mobile audio apps, or mobile whatever. I just think that&#x27;s a separate app, and should be designed and written as a mobile app from conception.I realize that a large cohort finds desktop applications uncool today, but I&#x27;m just so frustrated with the idea that serious and powerful desktop interfaces need to crippled in order to fit into a \"mobile-first\" (a.k.a. \"lowest-common denominator\") paradigm. For audio listening, that&#x27;s fine. But for serious audio creation and editing? FUCK an iPhone, sheesh. reply autoexec 6 hours agorootparent> I realize that a large cohort finds desktop applications uncool today, but I&#x27;m just so frustrated with the idea that serious and powerful desktop interfaces need to crippled in order to fit into a \"mobile-first\" (a.k.a. \"lowest-common denominator\") paradigm.Yeah, my primary issue with this sort of thing is that there is very little personal A&#x2F;V content I&#x27;d feel comfortable uploading to some random server in the first place, but I agree that there are some tools better suited for the desktop and more specifically a keyboard and mouse.The problem is that a very sizable part of the population doesn&#x27;t have a desktop. It&#x27;s not that they think it&#x27;s uncool exactly but for a lot of people, kids especially, all they have are cell phones and tablets which were designed first and foremost for content consumption. I can&#x27;t blame developers for wanting to target the needs of that audience to whatever extent they can. reply eastbound 1 hour agorootparentYou said it: Designed for content consumption. Hence it’s important to not cripple the UI of content creation tools for platforms that aren’t suitable for that. reply gochi 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can use GarageBand perfectly fine on an iPhone, no reason Audacity can&#x27;t do the same. It&#x27;s literally just a UI issue, easily remedied especially on the web. reply reidjs 5 hours agorootparentprevSometimes I don’t need to do “serious audio editing” with audacity. I need to trim a clip or something.

Seeing this and software like photopea I can now start to feel that HTML has become powerful enough that almost any desktop app can now be built for the web just as same.A lot of people&#x2F;companies tried their best to impede this progress (1) for promoting app stores but I&#x27;m so glad we are finally getting there regardless.

Is the end-game just a universal sandboxed VM that&#x27;s cross-platform? What do we do next? reply esperkin39 11 hours agoparentFor better or for worse, that&#x27;s what Google is aiming at with ChromeOS. Especially now that the overarching \"OS\" is really just a Linux shell for multiple VMs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chromium.googlesource.com&#x2F;chromium&#x2F;src&#x2F;+&#x2F;main&#x2F;docs&#x2F;l... reply asfgiaosnio 11 hours agorootparentPeople often claim that ChromeOS is versatile enough to replace a normal computer because it has these various compatibility layers. They often fail to mention that they work terribly. You wind up with the poor performance and annoying isolation that VMs give, but with an extra helping of instability and incompatibility. Running anything Google hasn&#x27;t approved is gated behind \"developer mode\", and even for a developer the pseudo-Debian container \"developer mode\" unlocks is confusing. I regularly encounter problems (like needing to run Wireshark) that I believe are simply unsolvable.I don&#x27;t understand anything about ChromeOS. At one point it was a bad but clear idea: a machine with just a web browser, capable only of running web apps. Then at some point they decided to just make the world&#x27;s most complicated and confusing Linux distro, with the vestigial browser-centric design kept around just to make things as inconsistent as possible. reply londons_explore 11 hours agorootparentTest of if an OS is ready for regular users:Does drag and drop work? Can I choose a random image&#x2F;file somewhere in one tab&#x2F;application and drop it into another.Just testing that now...* Drag HN logo to Whatsapp Web: Pass* Drag from Google Photos to Photopea: Pass* Drag a zip file from Google Drive to Dropbox: Fail.* Drag an attachment from an email from gmail into an online hex editor: FailConclusion: The web platform isn&#x27;t yet ready. reply Klonoar 10 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve known \"regular users\" who don&#x27;t even realize you can drag and drop between desktop applications.Conclusion: this is an incredibly arbitrary metric. reply jrajav 10 hours agorootparentprevYou could just as easily construct an arbitrary usability test over interop that the web platform excels at while current desktop apps do terribly. For instance:* Send a link to a Google Drive document to another person on WeChat: Pass* Send a link to a Microsoft Word document to another person on Slack: FailThe web has different paradigms and some of them are an improvement, one being hyperlinks, another being instant delivery just for example (no install time). reply nightfly 10 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve never even considered doing many of those things, and I&#x27;ve worked in IT for ~10 years and been using computers for 25 reply esperkin39 10 hours agorootparentprevVersatile is the opposite of what ChromeOS has become. I would argue that there was a time (beginning of pandemic) where it looked like Google might strike the perfect balance between web-reliant (PWAs and safer extensions) and legacy-OS supported (Android, Linux, and even some slight Windows compatibility).Now, it just seems like a bad version of the legacy operating systems. Android, but in a VM, Linux, but in a VM, and Windows delivered via the cloud!All of this is worse than just running any of those systems alone. reply ajross 8 hours agorootparentprev> Running anything Google hasn&#x27;t approved is gated behind \"developer mode\", and even for a developer the pseudo-Debian container \"developer mode\" unlocks is confusing.This is mixed up. \"Developer mode\" is a firmware mode that allows you to run unsigned images. You use that if you want to hack your ChromeOS image itself. The Linux development environment feature (crostini) runs in a VM on any chromebook, it doesn&#x27;t require developer mode or any firmware features. Technologically it&#x27;s basically the same thing as WSL, though integrated much better with the OS UI. reply Fudgel 10 hours agorootparentprevAlso project Fugu: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chromium.org&#x2F;teams&#x2F;web-capabilities-fugu&#x2F; reply esperkin39 10 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, Fugu is totally seperate from ChromeOS, since many of Fugus capabilities don&#x27;t work on the platform. Still, on Windows and Mac, Fugu is definitely more impressive than anything ChromeOS is doing. reply ajross 9 hours agorootparentprevFWIW: native audacity (literally the debian package) runs in ChromeOS as a wayland&#x2F;somellier client from crostini. Basically everything not tied to particular driver or hardware environments runs great.The whole OS is really the best \"app fusion\" desktop environment out there. I&#x27;ve got Android apps for Threads and Tesla running alongside all the web apps you&#x27;d expect to find. I&#x27;ve got my personal email via linux Thunderbird. I read my PDFs in Evince (because, let&#x27;s be honest, both the Chrome and Adobe readers are junk) and it integrates with the native ChromeOS Files app like a normal app. In fact all the Gnome .desktop files in the Crostini personality appear as apps in the OS menu that can be associated with files types or pinned to the shelf, so there&#x27;s a surprising amount of scriptability to the process. Likewise it makes a great X terminal for shells and emacs windows from development machines.In fact I&#x27;ve moved (to be fair: for professional reasons, and I resisted for quite a while) to a mid-tier junky old Chromebook for basically all my client activity at this point (windows games being the sole exception). Really it&#x27;s pretty great. The proverbial year of Linux on the desktop arrived and won while we were all looking elsewhere. reply TheRealPomax 11 hours agoparentprevFun fact: when you don&#x27;t give a shit about whether your UI looks like what \"the OS looks like\" (no offense to Tantacrul, but audacity clearly doesn&#x27;t), you can get a surprising amount of work done. This isn&#x27;t a Windows XP application, it looked like this well before Windows XP existed. reply PaulDavisThe1st 10 hours agorootparentAudacity is a cross-platform app that runs on (at least) Linux, macOS and windows (I suspect most other *nixes are supported to).Also, note that most creative apps (music, video, art) do not follow the UI guidelines for any particular OS platform (partly because they tend to be cross-platform, partly because their needs are very different from office productivity and communications apps. This is true even when the apps are nominally made by Apple for Apple (see Logic Pro or FCP for examples).Finally, Tantacrul has zero responsibility for the UI appearance of the Audacity that Wavacity is based on. reply raincole 8 hours agorootparentprevAs a game dev I haven&#x27;t seen an app (except browser and terminal) that looks like the OS native UI for quite a while.Blender, Houdini, 3DCoat, Photoshop, Krita, FL Studio, Bitwig... all of them use their own UI widget. reply dspillett 1 hour agoparentprev> What do we do next?Recompile Chromium for webasm. Run Chromium in Chromium in Chromium…Then add Firefox into the mix.(Being facetious of course, not wishing to put down managing to get an Audacity port running this way which is cool and even potentially useful (should you find yourself desperately in need of an audio editor in a place where you can&#x27;t install software packages)). reply Lammy 7 hours agoparentprev> What do we do next?The next step will be the same stack except the browser engine will be running in \"\"\"The Cloud\"\"\" and streamed to your consumption-only device like an OnLive&#x2F;Stadia&#x2F;PSNow game.

If people like Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, and Allen Newell were among the first to think deeply about how symbolic AI, in which machines manipulate explicit verbal-like representations, might work, Doug was the first to try really hard to make it actually work. I have spent my whole career arguing for consilience between neural networks and symbolic AI, and on the strictly symbolic side of that equation, Lenat was light-years ahead of me, not just more deeply embedded in those trenches than I, but the architect of many of those trenches. Lenat spent the last 40 years of his life launching and directing a project called Cyc, an intense effort to codify all of common sense in machine-interpretable form. Too few people thinking about AI today even know what that project is. Many who do, write it off as a failure. Cyc (and the parent company, Cycorp, that Lenat formed to incubate it) never exploded commercially – but hardly anybody ever gives it credit for the fact that it is still in business 40 years later; very very few AI companies have survived that long.1 My own view is that Cyc has been neither a success nor a failure, but somewhere in between: I see it as a ground-breaking, clarion experiment that never fully gelled. No, Cyc didn’t set the world on fire, but yes, it will seem more and more important in hindsight, as we eventually make real progress towards artificial general intelligence. Most young AI researchers have never even heard about it. But every single one of them should know something about Cyc. They don’t need to like it, but they should understand what it was, and what it tried to do, and what they might do instead to accomplish the same goals. Not because Cyc will get used out of the box, as some sort of drop-in replacement for Large Language Models, but because what Lenat tried to do - to get machines to represent and reason about common sense — still must be done. Yejin Choi’s wonderful 2023 TED talk, Why AI is incredibly smart and shockingly stupid, followed directly in that tradition, explaining why common sense is still, despite their apparent success, lacking in current AI systems. (My 2019 book with Ernie Davis, Rebooting AI was very much on the same topic.) Metaphorically, Lenat tried to find a path across the mountain of common sense, the millions of things we know about the world but rarely articulate. He didn’t fully succeed – we will need a different path – but he picked the critical mountain that we still must cross. That’s what Lenat, Choi, Davis, and I have all been trying to say, and it’s exactly where Large Language Models struggle, over and over. To take but one of a zillion constantly changing examples, this very morning someone sent me, with Google Bard mixing together truth with obvious nonsense, in completely fluent paragraphs: Depending on the wording, any given model might or might not get questions like that right on any given day; Large Language Models tend to be accurate in some wordings, inaccurate in others. From them we sometimes see an illusion of common sense, depending on the vagaries of what the training set is and the precise wording of a question, but something is obviously still missing. And even if this specific example is patched up, there will inevitably be others of a similar flavor. Cyc is an effort to find a deeper, more robust answer. As the AI researcher Ken Forbus of Northwestern University put it to me in an email this morning, “The Cyc project was the first demonstration that symbolic representations and reasoning can scale to capture significant portions of commonsense. While today billion-fact knowledge bases are common in industry, Cyc remains the most advanced in terms of expressiveness, capturing more of the range of thoughts that humans are capable of. My group has been using Cyc’s representations in our research for decades… Our field would do well to learn more from the Cyc project.” A Google researcher, Muktha Ananda, Director of their Learning Platform, wrote condolences to me this morning, “I have always been a great admirer of [Lenat’s] vision, perseverance and tenacity. His work on Cyc was a great source of inspiration for my own journey into knowledge graphs/webs.” § Over the last year, Doug and I tried to write a long, complex paper that we never got to finish. Cyc was both awesome in its scope, and unwieldy in its implementation. The biggest problem with Cyc from an academic perspective is that it’s proprietary. To help more people understand it, I tried to bring out of him what lessons he learned from Cyc, for a future generation of researchers to use. Why did it work as well as it did when it did, why did fail when it did, what was hard to implement, and what did he wish that he had done differently? We had nearly 40,000 words, sprawling, not yet fully organized, yet filled with wisdom. It was part science, part oral history. Needless to say, it takes a long time to organize and polish something of that length. In between our other commitments, we were making slow but steady progress. And then in the new year, I got busy with AI policy, and he got sick; progress slowed. Closer to the end, he wrote a shorter, tighter paper, building in part on the work we had done together. When he realized that he did not have much time left, we agreed that I would help polish the shorter manuscript, a junior partner in what we both knew would likely be his last paper. One of his last emails to me, about six weeks ago, was an entreaty to get the paper out ASAP; on July 31, after a nerve-wracking false-start, it came out, on arXiv, Getting from Generative AI to Trustworthy AI: What LLMs might learn from Cyc. The brief article is simultaneously a review of what Cyc tried to do, an encapsulation of what we should expect from genuine artificial intelligence, and a call for reconciliation between the deep symbolic tradition that he worked in with modern Large Language Models. In his honor, I hope you will find time to read it. Gary Marcus has focused his career on integrating neural networks and symbolic approaches; he still hopes that will happen.

He will be missed.I worked at Cycorp (not directly with Doug very often, but it wasn&#x27;t a big office) between 2016 and 2020An anecdote: during our weekly all-hands lunch in the big conference room, he mentioned he was getting a new car (his old one was pretty old, but well-kept) and he asked if anybody could use the old car. One of the staff raised his hand sheepishly and said his daughter was about to start driving. Doug gifted him the car on the spot, without a second thought.He also loved board games, and was in a D&D group with some others at the company. I was told he only ever played lawful good characters, he didn&#x27;t know how to do otherwise :)Happy to answer what questions I can reply zitterbewegung 13 hours agoparentI would expect lawful good because it would be the most logical. reply djha-skin 3 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a very neutral thing to say. reply colordrops 3 hours agorootparentprevWhy is that? reply late25 14 hours agoparentprevI don’t know much about him. What makes you start by saying he’s blunt? reply brundolf 12 hours agorootparentIt was a part of his personality, as it is for many people who are intelligent and opinionated, and some can mistake that for unkindness. But I wanted to emphasize that in his case it wasn&#x27;t. reply chefandy 6 hours agorootparentI haven&#x27;t read much by Lenat, and haven&#x27;t seen anything that would lead me to believe he was particularly blunt, I disagree with attributing bluntness to intelligence. Some of the most intellectually blunt people I&#x27;ve met were some of the most conversationally blunt, and some of the most brilliant were absolute social butterflies. Making people needlessly uncomfortable when communicating is a shortcoming regardless of your intellectual capacity. Even if difficulty communicating appropriately and intelligence are correlated somewhat through common neuropsychiatric profiles, the relationship is not causal. reply chmod775 5 hours agorootparent> Making people needlessly uncomfortable when communicating is a shortcoming regardless of your intellectual capacity.Emphasis on needlessly. Some bluntness is a good thing, even if it makes people uncomfortable. The alternative usually is prolonged awkwardness and beating around the bush, which likely will make people uncomfortable anyways. Just get it over with like an adult. Don&#x27;t drag an uncomfortable thing out or even risk people not getting the message at all the first time around. reply late25 12 hours agorootparentprevGot it. I was merely curious if there were any particular stories, rumors, or legends about his bluntness (like there is Linus). reply brundolf 12 hours agorootparentNo, it was never anything at that level. I would describe (pre-reformed) Linus as more than just \"blunt\" replysnowmaker 14 hours agoprevI interviewed with Doug Lenat was I was a 17 year old high school student, and he hired me as a summer intern for Cycorp - my first actual programming job.That internship was life-changing for me, and I&#x27;ll always be grateful to him for taking a wild bet on a literally a kid.Doug was a brilliant computer scientist, and a pioneer of artificial intelligence. Though I was very junior at Cycorp, it was a small company so I sat in many meetings with him. It was obvious that he understood every detail of how technology worked, and was extremely smart.Cycorp was 30 years ahead of its time and never actually worked. For those who don&#x27;t know, it was essentially the first OpenAI - the first large-scale commercial effort to create general artificial intelligence.I learned a lot from Doug about how to be incredibly ambitious, and how to not give up. Doug worked on Cycorp for multiple decades. It never really took off, but he managed to keep funding it and keep hiring great people so he could keep plugging away at the problem. I know very few people who have stuck with an idea for so long. reply xNeil 12 hours agoparentThat sounds awesome! Was coming back to Cycorp to permanently work ever in the works for you? Or did you think the intern was nice but you didn&#x27;t want a career in the field?Also - what exactly did you do in the internship as a 17 year old - what skills did you have? reply snowmaker 10 hours agorootparentI was certainly interested in working at Cycorp full-time. But after two summers there, I could tell that the technical approach they were taking was just not working.My first summer, I was an ontologist, which was a role they created where people would literally hand-enter facts into Cyc using formal logic like \"A cat has four legs\". My second summer I programmed (poorly) in Lisp for them. reply gumby 6 hours agoprevI worked with Doug on Cyc from ~85-89 (we had overlapped at PARC but didn’t interact much there). The first thing undid was scrap the old implementation and start from scratch, designing the levels system and all the bootstrap code.It was a fun time with a small core team (mainly me, guha, and Doug) but over time I became dissatisfied with some of the arbitrariness of the KB. By the time I left the Cyc project (for my own reasons unrelated to work) I was somewhat negative towards the foundations of the project, despite the tight relationship we’d had and the fact it ran on my code! But over time I became smarter and came to appreciate once again its value. I had too much of a “pure math” view of things back then.As I moved on to other things I lost touch with Doug and Mary, and I’m sorry for that. reply symbolicAGI 13 hours agoprevDoug Lenat, RIP. I worked at Cycorp in Austin from 2000-2006. Taken from us way too soon, Doug none the less had the opportunity to help our country advance military and intelligence community computer science research.One day, the rapid advancement of AI via LLMs will slow down and attention will again return to logical reasoning and knowledge representation as championed by the Cyc Project, Cycorp, its cyclists and Dr. Doug Lenat.Why? If NN inference were so fast, we would compile C programs with it instead of using deductive logical inference that is executed efficiently by the compiler. reply nextos 11 hours agoparentExactly. When I hear books such as Paradigms of AI Programming are outdated because of LLMs, I disagree. They are more current than ever, thanks to LLMs!Neural and symbolic AI will eventually merge. Symbolic models bring much needed efficiency and robustness via regularization. reply mnemonicsloth 10 hours agorootparentIf you want to learn about symbolic AI, there are a lot of more recent sources than PAIP (you could try the first half of AI: A Modern Approach by Russel and Norvig), and this has been true for a while.If you read PAIP today, the most likely reason is that you want a master class in Lisp programming and&#x2F;or want to learn a lot of tricks for getting good performance out of complex programs (which used to be part of AI and is in many ways being outsourced to hardware today).None of this is to say you shouldn&#x27;t read PAIP. You absolutely should. It&#x27;s awesome. But its role is different now. reply nextos 9 hours agorootparentSome parts of PAIP might be outdated, but it still has really current material on e.g. embedding Prolog in Lisp or building a term-rewriting system. That&#x27;s relevant for pursuing current neuro-symbolic research, e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2006.08381.pdf.Other parts like coding an Eliza chatbot are indeed outdated. I have read AIMA and followed a long course that used it, but I didn&#x27;t really like it. I found it too broad and shallow. reply keepamovin 6 hours agorootparentprevIt would be cool if we could find the algorithmic neurological basis for this, the analogy with LLMs being more obvious multi-layer brain circuits, the neurological analogy with symbolic reasoning must exist too.My hunch is it emerges naturally out of the hierarchical generalization capabilities of multiple layer circuits. But then you need something to coordinate the acquired labels: a tweak on attention perhaps?Another characteristic is probably some (limited) form of recursion, so the generalized labels emitted at the small end can be fed back in as tokens to be further processed at the big end. reply optimalsolver 12 hours agoparentprevThe best thing Cycorp could do now is open source its accumulated database of logical relations so it can be ingested by some monster LLM.What&#x27;s the point of all that data collecting dust and accomplishing not much of anything? reply adastra22 10 hours agorootparentIt seems the direction of flow would be the opposite: LLMs are a great source of logical data for Cyc-like things. Distill your LLM into logical statements, then run your Cyc algorithms on it. reply xpe 8 hours agorootparent> It seems the direction of flow would be the opposite: LLMs are a great source of logical data for Cyc-like things. Distill your LLM into logical statements, then run your Cyc algorithms on it.This is hugely problematic. If you get the premises wrong, many fallacies will follow.LLMs can play many roles around this area, but their output cannot be trusted with significant verification and validation. reply zozbot234 3 hours agorootparentprevOpenCyc is already a thing and there&#x27;s been very little interest in it. These days we also have general-purpose semantic KB&#x27;s like Wikidata, that are available for free and go way beyond what Cyc or OpenCyc was trying to do. reply xpe 6 hours agorootparentprev> The best thing Cycorp could do now is open source its accumulated database of logical relations...This is unpersuasive without laying out your assumptions and reasoning.Counter points:(a) It would be unethical for such a knowledge base to be put out in the open without considerable guardrails and appropriate licensing. The details matter.(b) Cycorp gets some funding from the U.S. Government; this changes both the set of options available and the calculus of weighing them.(c) Not all nations have equivalent values. Unless one is a moral relativist, these differences should not be deemed equivalent nor irrelevant. As such, despite the flaws of U.S. values and some horrific decision-making throughout history, there are known worse actors and states. Such parties would make worse use of an extensive human-curated knowledge base. reply vtr132 11 hours agorootparentprevI think military will take over his work.Snowden documents reveled the cyc was been used to come up with Terror attack scenarios. reply halflings 12 hours agoparentprev> If NN inference were so fast, we would compile C programs with it instead of using deductive logical inference that is executed efficiently by the compiler.This is the definition of a strawman. Who is claiming that NN inference is always the fastest way to run computation?Instead of trying to bring down another technology (neural networks), how about you focus on making symbolic methods usable to solve real-world problems; e.g. how can I build a robust email spam detection system with symbolic methods? reply xpe 7 hours agorootparent> Instead of trying to bring down another technology (neural networks), how about you focus on making symbolic methods usable to solve real-world problems; e.g. how can I build a robust email spam detection system with symbolic methods?I have two concerns. First, just after pointing out a logical fallacy from someone else, you added a fallacy: the either-or fallacy. (One can criticize a technology and do other things too.)Second, you selected an example that illustrates a known and predictable weakness of symbolic systems. Still, there are plenty of real-world problems that symbolic systems address well. So your comment cherry-picks.It appears as if you are trying to land a counter punch here. I&#x27;m weary of this kind of conversational pattern. Many of us know that tends to escalate. I don&#x27;t want HN to go that direction. We all have varying experience and points of view to contribute. Let&#x27;s try to be charitable, clear, and logical. reply Nevermark 7 hours agorootparentI am desperately vetting your comment for something I can criticize. An inadvertent, irrelevant, imagined infraction. Anything! But you have left me no opening.Well done, sir, well done. reply xpe 7 hours agorootparentThanks, but if I didn&#x27;t blunder here, I can assure you I have in many other places. I strive to be mindful. I try not to \"blame\" anyone for strong reactions. But when we see certain unhelpful behaviors directed at other people, I try to identify&#x2F;name it without making it worse. Awareness helps. reply Nevermark 4 hours agorootparentWithout awareness we are just untagged data in a sea of uncompressed noise. reply xpe 8 hours agorootparentprev>> If NN inference were so fast, we would compile C programs with it instead of using deductive logical inference that is executed efficiently by the compiler.> This is the definition of a strawman.(Actually, it is an example of a strawman.) Anyhow, rather than a strawman, I&#x27;d rather us get right into the fundamentals.1. Feed-forward NN computation (&#x27;inference&#x27;, which is an unfortunate word choice IMO) can provably provide universal function approximation under known conditions. And it can do so efficiently as well, with a lot of recent research getting into both the how and why. One \"pays the cost\" up-front with training in order to get fast prediction-time performance. The tradeoff is often worth it.2. Function approximation is not as powerful as Turing completeness. FF NNs are not Turing complete.3. Deductive chaining is a well-studied, well understood area of algorithms.4. But... modeling of computational architectures (including processors, caches, busses, and RAM) with sufficient detail to optimize compilation is a hard problem. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this stretches these algorithms to the limit in terms of what developers will tolerate in terms of compile times. This is a strong incentive, so I&#x27;d expect there is at least some research that pushes outside the usual contours here. reply symbolicAGI 12 hours agorootparentprevThe point is that symbolic computation as performed by Cycorp was held back by the need to train the Knowledge Base by hand in a supervised manner. NNs and LLMs in particular became ascendant when unsupervised training was employed at scale.Perhaps LLMs can automate in large part the manual operations of building a future symbolic knowledge base organized by a universal upper ontology. Considering the amazing emergent features of sufficiently-large LLMs, what could emerge from a sufficiently large, reflective symbolic knowledge base? reply detourdog 11 hours agorootparentprevThat what I have settled on. The need for a symbolic library of standard hardware circuits.I’m making a sloppy version that will contain all the symbols needed to run a multi-unit building. reply mindcrime 15 hours agoprevIf anybody wants to hear more about Doug&#x27;s work and ideas, here is a (fairly long) interview with Doug by Lex Fridman, from last year.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3wMKoSRbGVs&pp=ygUabGV4IGZya... reply chubot 6 hours agoparentThanks for the link. I watched the first part, and an interesting story&#x2F;claim is that before Cyc started, many \"smart people\" including Marvin Minsky came up with \"~1 million\" as the number of things you would have to encode in a system for it to have \"common sense\".He said they learned after ~5 years that this was an order of magnitude off -- it&#x27;s more like 10 M things.Is there any literature about this? Did they publish?To me, the obvious questions are -- how do they know it&#x27;s not 100M things?- how do they know it&#x27;s even bounded? Why isn&#x27;t there a combinatorial explosion?I mean I guess they were evaluating the system all along. You don&#x27;t go for 38 years without having some clear metrics. But I am having some problems with the logic -- I&#x27;d be interested in links to references &#x2F; criticism.I&#x27;d be interested in any arguments for and against ~10 M. Naively speaking, the argument seems a bit flawed to me.FWIW I heard of Cyc back in the 90&#x27;s, but I had no idea it was still alive. It is impressive that he kept it alive for so long.---Actually the wikipedia article is pretty goodhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cyc#CriticismsThough I&#x27;m still interested in the ~1M or ~10M claim. It seems like a strong claim to hold onto for decades, unless they had really strong metrics backing it up. reply replwoacause 9 hours agoparentprevEnjoyed watching that. Doug sounds very impressive.

He basically made a system that detects when someone else is using your computer by e.g. comparing patterns of mouse and keyboard input to your typical usage. It would be useful in a situation such as if you left your screen unlocked and a coworker sat down at your desk to prank you by sending an email from you to your boss (or worse, obviously).

I get that you don&#x27;t like Lex Fridman, which is a perfectly fine position to hold. But there is something to be said for seeing two people just sit and talk, as opposed to seeing somebody monologue for an hour. The Fridman interview with Doug is, IMO, absolutely worth watching. And so are all of the other videos by &#x2F; about Doug. shrug reply yarpen_z 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know this particular interview, but it&#x27;s not necessarily about not liking Lex. I listened to many episodes of his podcast and while I appreciate the selection of guests from the CS domain, many of these interviews aren&#x27;t very good. They are not completely terrible but they should have been so much better: Lex had so many passionate, educated, experienced and gifted guests, yet his ability to ask interesting and focused questions is not on the same level. reply pengaru 13 hours agorootparentHe&#x27;s a shitty interviewer. Often doesn&#x27;t even engage with his guest&#x27;s responses, as if he&#x27;s not even listening to what they&#x27;re saying, instead moving mechanically to his next bullet-point. Which is completely ridiculous for what&#x27;s supposed to be a long-format conversational interview.The best episodes are ones where the guest drives the interview and has a lot of interesting things to say. Fridman&#x27;s just useful for attracting interesting domain experts somewhere we can hear them speak for hours on end.The Jim Keller episodes are excellent IMO, despite Fridman.

Truth is provability; the propagation model is basically digital logic.

That being said, I do think it could prove to be useful for testing and teaching neural net models.In any case, at the time Lenat starting working on Cyc, we didn&#x27;t really have the compute required to do NN models at the level where they start exhibiting what most would call \"common sense reasoning,\" so it makes total sense why he started out on that path.

What distinguished early Google from prior full-text search was that the latter had no ranking criteria, leading to keyword stuffing.

When Schank arrived from Stanford to join Abelson at Yale, together they represented the most identifiable center for a particular approach to artificial intelligence: what would later (in the early 1980s) come to be known as the “scruffy” approach. [7] Meanwhile, perhaps the most identifiable proponent of what would later be called the “neat” approach, John McCarthy, remained at Stanford.McCarthy had coined the term “artificial intelligence” in the application for the field-defining workshop he organized at Dartmouth in 1956. Howard Gardner, in his influential reflection on the field, The Mind’s New Science (1985), characterized McCarthy’s neat approach this way: “McCarthy believes that the route to making machines intelligent is through a rigorous formal approach in which the acts that make up intelligence are reduced to a set of logical relationships or axioms that can be expressed precisely in mathematical terms” (154).This sort of approach lent itself well to problems easily cast in formal and mathematical terms. But the scruffy branch of AI, growing out of fields such as linguistics and psychology, wanted to tackle problems of a different nature. Scruffy AI built systems for tasks as diverse as rephrasing newspaper reports, generating fictions, translating between languages, and (as we have seen) modeling ideological reasoning. In order to accomplish this, Abelson, Schank, and their collaborators developed an approach quite unlike formal reasoning from first principles. One foundation for their work was Schank’s “conceptual dependency” structure for language-independent semantic representation. Another foundation was the notion of “scripts” (later “cases”) an embryonic form of which could be seen in the calling sequence of the ideology machine’s executive. Both of these will be considered in more detail in the next chapter.Scruffy AI got attention because it achieved results in areas that seemed much more “real world” than those of other approaches. For comparison’s sake, consider that the MIT AI lab, at the time of Schank’s move to Yale, was celebrating success at building systems that could understand the relationships in stacks of children’s wooden blocks. But scruffy AI was also critiqued — both within and outside the AI field — for its “unscientific” ad-hoc approach. Weizenbaum was unimpressed, in particular, with the conceptual dependency structures underlying many of the projects, writing, “Schank provides no demonstration that his scheme is more than a collection of heuristics that happen to work on specific classes of examples” (199). Whichever side one took in the debate, there can be no doubt that scruffy projects depending on coding large amounts of human knowledge into AI systems — often more than the authors acknowledged, and perhaps much more than they realized.[...][7] After the terms “neat” and “scruffy” were introduced into the AI and cognitive science discourse by Abelson’s 1981 essay, in which he attributes the coinage to “an unnamed but easily guessable colleague” — Schank.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cse.buffalo.edu&#x2F;~rapaport&#x2F;676&#x2F;F01&#x2F;neat.scruffy.txt Article: 35704 of comp.ai From: engelson@bimacs.cs.biu.ac.il (Dr. Shlomo (Sean) Engelson) Newsgroups: comp.ai Subject: Re: who first used \"scruffy\" and \"neat\"?

He advocated building robots that were, as he put it, Fast, Cheap and Out of Control, the title of a 1989 paper co-authored with Anita Flynn. Unlike earlier robots such as Shakey or the Stanford cart, they did not build up representations of the world by analyzing visual information with algorithms drawn from mathematical machine learning techniques, and they did not plan their actions using formalizations based on logic, such as the &#x27;Planner&#x27; language. They simply reacted to their sensors in a way that tended to help them survive and move.[13]>Douglas Lenat&#x27;s Cyc project was initiated in 1984 one of earliest and most ambitious projects to capture all of human knowledge in machine readable form, is \"a determinedly scruffy enterprise\".[14] The Cyc database contains millions of facts about all the complexities of the world, each of which must be entered one at a time, by knowledge engineers.

Abelson, Yale UniversityCognitive science has barely emerged as a discipline -- or an interdiscipline, or whatever it is -- and already it is having an identity crisis.Within us and among us we have many competing identities. Two particular prototypic identities cause a very serious clash, and I would like to explicate this conflict and then explore some areas in which a fusion of identities seems possible. Consider the two-word name \"cognitive science\". It represents a hybridization of two different impulses. On the one hand, we want to study human and artificial cognition, the structure of mental representatives, the nature of mind. On the other hand, we want to be scientific, be principled, be exact. These two impulses are not necessarily incompatible, but given free rein they can develop what seems to be a diametric opposition.The study of the knowledge in a mental system tends toward both naturalism and phenomenology. The mind needs to represent what is out there in the real world, and it needs to manipulate it for particular purposes. But the world is messy, and purposes are manifold. Models of mind, therefore, can become garrulous and intractable as they become more and more realistic. If one&#x27;s emphasis is on science more than on cognition, however, the canons of hard science dictate a strategy of the isolation of idealized subsystems which can be modeled with elegant productive formalisms. Clarity and precision are highly prized, even at the expense of common sense realism. To caricature this tendency with a phrase from John Tukey (1959), the motto of the narrow hard scientist is, \"Be exactly wrong, rather than approximately right\".The one tendency points inside the mind, to see what might be there. The other points outside the mind, to some formal system which can be logically manipulated (Kintsch et al., 1981). Neither camp grants the other a legitimate claim on cognitive science. One side says, \"What you&#x27;re doing may seem to be science, but it&#x27;s got nothing to do with cognition.\" The other side says, \"What you&#x27;re doing may seem to be about cognition, but it&#x27;s got nothing to do with science.\"Superficially, it may seem that the trouble arises primarily because of the two-headed name cognitive science. I well remember the discussions of possible names, even though I never liked \"cognitive science\", the alternatives were worse; abominations like \"epistology\" or \"representonomy\".But in any case, the conflict goes far deeper than the name itself. Indeed, the stylistic division is the same polarization than arises in all fields of science, as well as in art, in politics, in religion, in child rearing -- and in all spheres of human endeavor. Psychologist Silvan Tomkins (1965) characterizes this overriding conflict as that between characterologically left-wing and right-wing world views. The left-wing personality finds the sources of value and truth to lie within individuals, whose reactions to the world define what is important. The right-wing personality asserts that all human behavior is to be understood and judged according to rules or norms which exist independent of human reaction. A similar distinction has been made by an unnamed but easily guessable colleague of mine, who claims that the major clashes in human affairs are between the \"neats\" and the \"scruffies\". The primary concern of the neat is that things should be orderly and predictable while the scruffy seeks the rough-and-tumble of life as it comes.I am exaggerating slightly, but only slightly, in saying that the major disagreements within cognitive science are instantiations of a ubiquitous division between neat right-wing analysis and scruffy left-wing ideation. In truth there are some signs of an attempt to fuse or to compromise these two tendencies. Indeed, one could view the success of cognitive science as primarily dependent not upon the cooperation of linguistics, AI, psychology, etc., but rather, upon the union of clashing world views about the fundamental nature of mentation. Hopefully, we can be open minded and realistic about the important contents of thought at the same time we are principled, even elegant, in our characterizations of the forms of thought.The fusion task is not easy. It is hard to neaten up a scruffy or scruffy up a neat. It is difficult to formalize aspects of human thought which are variable, disorderly, and seemingly irrational, or to build tightly principled models of realistic language processing in messy natural domains. Writings about cognitive science are beginning to show a recognition of the need for world-view unification, but the signs of strain are clear. Consider the following passage from a recent article by Frank Keil (1981) in Pscyhological Review, giving background for a discussion of his formalistic analysis of the concept of constraint:\"Constraints will be defined...as formal restrictions that limit the class of logically possible knowledge structures that can normally be used in a given cognitive domain.\" (p. 198).Now, what is the word \"normally\" doing in a statement about logical possibility? Does it mean that something which is logically impossible can be used if conditions are not normal? This seems to require a cognitive hyperspace where the impossible is possible.It is not my intention to disparage an author on the basis of a single statement infelicitously put. I think he was genuinely trying to come to grips with the reality that there is some boundary somewhere to the penetration of his formal constraint analysis into the viscissitudes of human affairs. But I use the example as symptomatic of one kind of approach to the cognitive science fusion problem: you start from a neat, right-wing point of view, but acknowledge some limited role for scruffy, left-wing orientations. The other type of approach is the obvious mirror: you start from the disorderly leftwing side and struggle to be neater about what you are doing. I prefer the latter approach to the former. I will tell you why, and then lay out the beginnings of such an approach.[...]To read why and how:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cognitivesciencesociety.org&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;... reply DonHopkins 15 hours agorootparentprevAs Roger Schank defined the terms in the 70&#x27;s, \"Neat\" refers to using a single formal paradigm, logic, math, neural networks, and LLMs, like physics. \"Scruffy\" refers to combining many different algorithms and approaches, symbolic manipulation, hand coded logic, knowledge engineering, and CYC, like biology.I believe both approaches are useful and can be combined and layered and fed back into each other, to reinforce and transcend complement each others advantages and limitations.Kind of like how Hailey and Justin Bieber make the perfect couple: ;)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;style&#x2F;hailey-justin-bieber-couples-f...Marvin L Minsky: Logical Versus Analogical or Symbolic Versus Connectionist or Neat Versus Scruffyhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;ojs.aaai.org&#x2F;aimagazine&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;aimagazine&#x2F;article...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ojs.aaai.org&#x2F;aimagazine&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;aimagazine&#x2F;article...\"We should take our cue from biology rather than physics...\" -Marvin Minsky>To get around these limitations, we must develop systems that combine the expressiveness and procedural versatility of symbolic systems with the fuzziness and adaptiveness of connectionist representations. Why has there been so little work on synthesizing these techniques? I suspect that it is because both of these AI communities suffer from a common cultural-philosophical disposition: They would like to explain intelligence in the image of what was successful in physics—by minimizing the amount and variety of its assumptions. But this seems to be a wrong ideal. We should take our cue from biology rather than physics because what we call thinking does not directly emerge from a few fundamental principles of wave-function symmetry and exclusion rules. Mental activities are not the sort of unitary or elementary phenomenon that can be described by a few mathematical operations on logical axioms. Instead, the functions performed by the brain are the products of the work of thousands of different, specialized subsystems, the intricate product of hundreds of millions of years of biological evolution. We cannot hope to understand such an organization by emulating the techniques of those particle physicists who search for the simplest possible unifying conceptions. Constructing a mind is simply a different kind of problem—how to synthesize organizational systems that can support a large enough diversity of different schemes yet enable them to work together to exploit one another’s abilities.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Neats_and_scruffies>In the history of artificial intelligence, neat and scruffy are two contrasting approaches to artificial intelligence (AI) research. The distinction was made in the 70s and was a subject of discussion until the middle 80s.[1][2][3]>\"Neats\" use algorithms based on a single formal paradigms, such as logic, mathematical optimization or neural networks. Neats verify their programs are correct with theorems and mathematical rigor. Neat researchers and analysts tend to express the hope that this single formal paradigm can be extended and improved to achieve general intelligence and superintelligence.>\"Scruffies\" use any number of different algorithms and methods to achieve intelligent behavior. Scruffies rely on incremental testing to verify their programs and scruffy programming requires large amounts of hand coding or knowledge engineering. Scruffies have argued that general intelligence can only be implemented by solving a large number of essentially unrelated problems, and that there is no magic bullet that will allow programs to develop general intelligence autonomously.>John Brockman compares the neat approach to physics, in that it uses simple mathematical models as its foundation. The scruffy approach is more like biology, where much of the work involves studying and categorizing diverse phenomena.[a][...]>Modern AI as both neat and scruffy>New statistical and mathematical approaches to AI were developed in the 1990s, using highly developed formalisms such as mathematical optimization and neural networks. Pamela McCorduck wrote that \"As I write, AI enjoys a Neat hegemony, people who believe that machine intelligence, at least, is best expressed in logical, even mathematical terms.\"[6] This general trend towards more formal methods in AI was described as \"the victory of the neats\" by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell in 2003.[18]>However, by 2021, Russell and Norvig had changed their minds.[19] Deep learning networks and machine learning in general require extensive fine tuning -- they must be iteratively tested until they begin to show the desired behavior. This is a scruffy methodology. reply at_a_remove 15 hours agorootparentNeats and scruffies also showed up in The X-Files in their first AI episode. reply Kuinox 15 hours agorootparentprevWhy did it didn&#x27;t work out ? reply jfengel 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s really an answer to that, beyond noting that it never turned out to be more than the sum of its parts. It was a large ontology and a hefty logic engine. You put in queries and you got back answers.The goal was that in a decade it would become self-sustaining. It would have enough knowledge that it could start reading natural language. And it just... didn&#x27;t.Contrast it with LLMs and diffusion and such. They make stupid, asinine mistakes -- real howlers, because they don&#x27;t understand anything at all about the world. If it could draw, Cyc would never draw a human with 7 fingers on each hand, because it knows that most humans have 5. (It had a decent-ish ontology of human anatomy which could handle injuries and birth defects, but would default reason over the normal case.) I often see ChatGPT stumped by simple variations of brain teasers, and Cyc wouldn&#x27;t make those mistakes -- once you&#x27;d translated them into CycL (its language, because it couldn&#x27;t read natural language in any meaningful way).But those same models do a scary job of passing the Turing Test. Nobody would ever have thought to try it on Cyc. It was never anywhere close.Philosophically I can&#x27;t say why Cyc never developed \"magic\" and LLMs (seemingly) do. And I&#x27;m still not convinced that they&#x27;re on the right path, though they actually have some legitimate usages right now. I tried to find uses for Cyc in exactly the opposite direction, guaranteeing data quality, but it turned out nobody really wanted that. reply dredmorbius 14 hours agorootparentOne sense that I&#x27;ve had of LLM &#x2F; generative AIs is that they lack \"bones\", in the sense that there&#x27;s no underlying structure to which they adhere, only outward appearances which are statistically correlated (using fantastically complex statistical correlation maps).Cyc, on the other hand, lacks flesh and skin. It&#x27;s all skeleton and can generate facts but not embellish them into narratives.The best human writing has both, much as artists (traditional painters, sculptors, and more recently computer animators) has a skeleton (outline, index cards, Zettlekasten, wireframe) to which flesh, skin, and fur are attached. LLM generative AIs are too plastic, Cyc is insufficiently plastic.I suspect there&#x27;s some sort of a middle path between the two.

This makes them untrustworthy.In contrast, Cyc represents knowledge explicitly and can logically reason over it. This makes it more reliable, though it struggles with natural language and speed.The article proposes 16 capabilities an ideal AI system should have, including explanation, reasoning, knowledge, ethics, and language skills. Cyc and generative models each have strengths and weaknesses on these dimensions.The authors suggest combining symbolic systems like Cyc with generative models to get the best of both approaches. Ways to synergize them include:Using Cyc to filter out false information from generative models.Using Cyc&#x27;s knowledge to train generative models to be more correct.Using generative models to suggest knowledge to add to Cyc&#x27;s knowledge base.Using Cyc&#x27;s reasoning to expand what generative models can say.Using Cyc to explain the reasoning behind generative model outputs.Overall, the article argues combining reasoning-focused systems like Cyc with data-driven generative models could produce more robust and trustworthy AI.

Here are two excerpts from the book AI: The Tumultuous History Of The Search For Artificial Intelligence (a fantastic read of the early days of AI) to remember him by;\"Lenat found out about computers in a a manner typical of his entrepreneurial spirit. As a high school student in Philadelphia, working for $1.00 an hour to clean the cages of experimental animals, he discovered that another student was earning $1.50 to program the institution&#x27;s minicomputer. Finding this occupation more to his liking, he taught himself programming over a weekend and squeezed his competitor out of the job by offering to work for fifty cents an hour less.31 A few years later, Lenat was programming Automated Mathematician (AM, for short) as a doctoral thesis project at the Stanford AI Laboratory.\" p. 178And here&#x27;s an count of an early victory for AI in gaming against humans by Lenat&#x27;s EURISKO system (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Eurisko):\"Ever the achiever, Lenat was looking for a more dramatic way to prove teh capabilities of his creation. The identified the occasion space-war game called Traveler TCS, then quite popular with the public Lenat wanted to reach. The idea was for each player to design a fleet of space battleships according to a thick, hundred-page set of rules. Within a budget limit of one trillion galactic credits, one could adjust such parameters as the size, speed, armor thickness, autonomy and armament of each ship: about fifty adjustments per ship were needed. Since the fleet size could reach a hundred ships, the game thus offered ample room for ingenuity in spite of the anticlimactic character of the battles. These were fought by throwing dice following complex tables based on probability of survival of each ship according to its design. The winner of the yearly national championship was commissioned inter galactic admiral and received title to a planet of his or her choice ouside the solar system.Several months before the 1981 competition, Lenat fed into EURISKO 146 Traveler concepts, ranging from the nature of games in general to the technicalities of meson guns. He then instructed the program to develop heuristics for making winning war-fleet designs. The now familiar routine of nightly computer runs turned into a merciless Darwinian contest: Lenat and EURISKO together designed fleets that battled each other. Designs were evaluated by how well they won battles, and heuristics by how well they designed fleets. This rating method required several battles per design, and several designs per heuristic, which amounted to a lot of battles: ten thousand in all, fought over two thousand hours of computer time.To participants in the national championship of San Mateo,California, the resulting fleet of ninety-six small, heavily armored ships looked ludicrous. Accepted wisdom dictated fleets of about twenty behemoth ships, and many couldn&#x27;t help laughing. When engagements started, they found out that the weird armada held more than met the eye. One interesting ace up Lenat&#x27;s sleeve was a small ship so fast as to be almost unstoppable, which guaranteed at least a draw. EURISKO had conceived of it through the \"look for extreme cases\" heuristic (which had mutated, incidentally, into mutated, incidentally, into \"look for almost extreme cases\").\" p. 182If you&#x27;re a young person working in AI, by which I mean you&#x27;re less than 30, and if you have not already done so, you should read about AI history in three decade 60s - 90s. reply brundolf 12 hours agoparentI may be getting this wrong, but I think I remember hearing that his auto-generated fleets won Traveller so entirely, several years in a row, that they had to shut down the entire competition because it had been brokenEdit: Fixed wrong name for the competition reply mindcrime 11 hours agorootparentI think you mean \"EURISKO won the Traveller championship so entirely...\"In which case, yes, something like that did happen. Per the Wikipedia page:Lenat and Eurisko gained notoriety by submitting the winning fleet (a large number of stationary, lightly-armored ships with many small weapons)[3] to the United States Traveller TCS national championship in 1981, forcing extensive changes to the game&#x27;s rules. However, Eurisko won again in 1982 when the program discovered that the rules permitted the program to destroy its own ships, permitting it to continue to use much the same strategy.[3] Tournament officials announced that if Eurisko won another championship the competition would be abolished; Lenat retired Eurisko from the game.[4] The Traveller TCS wins brought Lenat to the attention of DARPA,[5] which has funded much of his subsequent work. reply brundolf 11 hours agorootparentWhoops yes :) reply detourdog 15 hours agoprevI still intend to integrate OpenCyc. reply brindlejim 8 hours agoprevWhile I respect Doug&#x27;s intelligence, he showed a kind of perverse persistence in a failed idea, and I think it&#x27;s telling that aspiring AI czar Gary Marcus admires the ruins of Cyc while neglecting to acknowledge that it represents a dead end in AI.

    "originBody": "Skip to content Search for: Stack Diary SEARCH Secondary Navigation DEVELOPMENT DESIGN AI TECH SECURITY BUSINESS HOSTING WORDPRESS TUTORIALS Main Navigation ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE X/Twitter has updated its Terms of Service to let it use Posts for AI training Another day, another company changing its terms in disfavor of privacy. Alex IvanovsSeptember 1, 2023 Reader Disclosure I'm not looking to make a habit out of writing about the Terms of Service of companies; first, it was Brave, then Zoom, and I could have written about Microsoft, but Mozilla has taken care of that for me. And then there is AWS, which opts you in by default as opposed the other way around. It's all happening in real-time. Now, as to why the X/Twitter new terms are interesting, it's actually pretty simple. Elon has taken a lot of radical steps to build a fortress around X, to make it as isolated as possible from the outside world (cough, scrapers), but now that he got xAI going for him - it only makes sense that he'd use X as a source of data that technically only he has access to (highly unlikely, bots still rummage the platform like the plague). Wasn't Elon the one who said that Microsoft used Twitter's data illegally and that he wanted to bring them to court? It's funny how that works because now you're going to be working for Elon Musk, and he does not plan to pay you, and he certainly does not plan to ask for your permission to use your content this way. It's all about \"improving\" services with AI these days. You can read the full terms here: https://twitter.com/en/privacy - Section 2.1 The part that interests me the most is that just recently, Elon made a tweet in which he said that: If you’re a journalist who wants more freedom to write and a higher income, then publish directly on this platform! But what he is really saying is, \"Come and publish interesting information exclusively on X so that we can use it for our subsidiary companies and train our models on it!\". How unlikely is it that the endgame here is to merge X Corp together with xAI Corp down the line? It even says on the xAI homepage: We are a separate company from X Corp, but will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies to make progress towards our mission. If Elon is committed to AI and the big bottleneck is going to be data quality and uniqueness, yeah - I don't think he's going to think twice about building a drip feed for xAI. What do the updated terms mean for you? Here's the kicker: based on these AI-assigned definitions in the updated terms, your access to certain content might be limited, or even cut off. You might not see certain tweets or hashtags. You might find it harder to get your own content seen by a broader audience. The idea isn't entirely new; we've heard stories of shadow banning on Twitter before. But the automation and AI involvement are making it more sophisticated and all-encompassing. This shift isn't just about Twitter. Imagine this methodology expanding across the entire internet. Imagine if your \"definitions,\" determined by AI, controlled not only what you could see on Twitter but also what search results appeared for you on Google, or which news stories showed up in your Facebook feed. It's not that the internet has fewer pathways or offramps; it's just that you might not see them all. They are hidden or revealed based on your AI-defined identity. So while the internet remains vast and expansive, your individual experience of it could become very narrow, indeed. What makes this change particularly eye-catching is that Elon Musk, who has had his say about Twitter in the past, once showed concern over third-party organizations using Twitter data to train their own AI systems. He argued that it wasn't ethical. Now, Twitter itself has decided to do just that. So, is it a case of 'do as I say, not as I do'? That's for you to decide. In short, Twitter is no longer a universal experience but a personalized realm defined by AI algorithms. What we should really be asking ourselves is, are we okay with this AI-driven, highly customized yet restrictive internet experience? It's not a change confined to Twitter; it's a glimpse into what could be the new normal for the internet.

I had just assumed that companies like OpenAI were just crawling the web, which included Twitter, rather than targeting Twitter in particular. Is the Twitter data really that valuable for training AIs? What particular qualities does it have that make it particularly useful compared to any other freely available data set? reply adtac 17 hours agoparent(1) Twitter&#x27;s data is accurately timestamped, (2) there&#x27;s new data constantly flowing in talking about recent events. There&#x27;s no other source like that in English other than Reddit.AFAIU neither of those are relevant to GPT-like architectures but it&#x27;s not inconceivable to think there might be a model architecture in the future that takes advantage of those. Purely from a information theoretic POV, there&#x27;s non-zero bits of information in the timestamp and relative ordering of tweets. reply temporalparts 16 hours agorootparent> There&#x27;s no other source like that in English other than Reddit1) Facebook Posts&#x2F;Comments, 2) Instagram Posts&#x2F;Comments, 3) Youtube Comments, 4) Gmail content, 5) LinkedIn Comments, 6) TikTok contents &#x2F; commentsX and Reddit are definitely valuable, but they&#x27;re definitely not unique. I think Meta and Google have inherent advantages because their data is not accessible to LLM competitors and they have the actual capabilities to build great LLMs.Unless X decides to tap AI talent in China, they&#x27;re going to have a REALLY hard time spinning up a competitive LLM team compared to OpenAI, Google, and Meta, which I think are the top three LLM companies in that order. reply jfoster 16 hours agorootparentThe discourse on Facebook & Instagram is significantly different than what you would find on X or Reddit, both in terms of quality & topics. reply monetus 15 hours agorootparentFacebook groups has, weirdly enough, had a bunch of quality discussions similar to Reddit. Can&#x27;t speak for Instagram, but FB groups are worth peeking into to follow your favorite software projects. reply loa_in_ 2 hours agorootparentFandom&#x2F;topic or hobby&#x2F;writing groups on Facebook are better quality discussion venues than Reddit if you can accept seeing some very obvious instances of spam posts and spam comments. reply nerdponx 14 hours agorootparentprevMy local city&#x2F;town Facebook groups are surprisingly good. Like on Reddit there&#x27;s always the specter of sketchy weird things happening behind the scenes with the mods&#x2F;admins, but the day-to-day experience is very much that of chatting and sharing with my neighbors. reply rapind 16 hours agorootparentprev> 3) Youtube CommentsIs probably LLM poison.> 4) Gmail contentIs huge but also has enormous privacy issues. Most people by default assume their emails are reasonably private, whereas most people wouldn&#x27;t assume their comments on these platforms are private. reply NavinF 13 hours agorootparentThat totally depends on the youtube channel. The tech and project channels I follow have excellent comments, often better than HN and proggit. Eg:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@HyperspacePiratehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@scottmanleyhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@3blue1brownhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@repshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@AppliedScience reply boywitharupee 15 hours agorootparentprevHow is AI talent from China related? reply buzzert 15 hours agorootparentI assume it’s for access and expertise into the “Sinosphere” of knowledge. Wherein the other side of the coin is the Anglosphere in the west. reply emodendroket 16 hours agorootparentprevHiring a lot of experts from China sounds extremely politically challenging. reply fjfuvucucuc 12 hours agorootparentChina doesn&#x27;t have any ai experts. Stop parroting CCP propoganda. reply emodendroket 10 hours agorootparentOh give it a rest, will you? Hiring AI \"also-rans\" or whatever term satisfies your sense of national chauvinism then.For kicks I tried searching for news about \"Chinese AI experts\" and found the CCP has apparently infiltrated august institutions such as the Financial Times and Harvard Business Review (here, for instance: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;is-china-emerging-as-the-global-lead...). Maybe you can go pester them. reply peter422 16 hours agorootparentprevJust take an aggregate of every news article written in the top 100 newspapers.That&#x27;s high quality content, timestamped and about current events.There is very little content on Twitter that compared in quality to one will written news article. reply throwaway4aday 12 hours agorootparentI would assume this is simply not enough data. You also have access to all public domain books and they usually make up a small fraction of the data used to train a model from scratch. For fine tuning a model, having a unique source of high quality data is probably valuable even if small. reply daem 15 hours agorootparentprevThere is information posted to X which the top 100 newspapers are not willing to &#x2F; do not care to publish. reply reaperducer 15 hours agorootparentAs we&#x27;ve learned in recent months, it goes both ways. reply matchagaucho 16 hours agorootparentprevIt could also be argued that the Twitter firehose requires substantial RLHF, de-biasing and moderation controls because of its colloquial nature. reply politician 16 hours agorootparentSafety&#x2F;Alignment researchers have been too fixated on making the one perfect LLM that has zero bias (or, arguably, one preferred bias) in my opinion.I don&#x27;t think Musk is the type of person to make the same mistake, so we&#x27;ll either end up with a Twitter LLM that accurately represents the sum total of the Twitter firehose, and&#x2F;or many derivative LLMs each having a set of, possibly orthogonal, biases. Honestly, I think the later is preferable and would represent the diversity of opinions in reality more accurately.Given the data source, I think it will be important to be able to switch between LLM personalities in the future to get the \"crowd truth\". reply rapind 16 hours agorootparent> Twitter LLM that accurately represents the sum total of the Twitter firehose,We need an xkcd showing a conversation between twitter, reddit, and hacker news based LLMs. Political rage meets memes meets pedantry. reply mejutoco 16 hours agorootparentprevWire news services come to mind as an alternative. reply Wowfunhappy 16 hours agorootparentPerhaps, but the quantity of data is comparatively miniscule. reply mejutoco 16 hours agorootparentThe quantity of information is probably higher though :) reply Wowfunhappy 15 hours agorootparentOf course, but for training data current LLMs seem to need quantity above all else. reply bee_rider 13 hours agorootparentI’m sure it depends on the type of prediction task, right?Current LLMs are trying to predict typical human prose from samples pulled from the internet. So it isn’t as if they are sacrificing quality for quantity. A bunch of text from the internet is a very good representation of typical human prose. Whether it is well written or the descriptions contained in the prose accurately represent, like, actual physical reality is another issue.Maybe they want to predict something with, like, less dimensionality but more utility than a paragraph of fiction. reply hef19898 16 hours agorootparentprevAgreed, not that anyone really seems to care so. reply berkes 17 hours agorootparentprev> there&#x27;s new data constantly flowing in talking about recent events.In which the distinction between \"data\" and \"information\" is crucial. Especially now that the \"floodgates\" have been re-opened regarding misinformation, bots, impersonators and the likes.Data is crucial when in need of training body. But information is crucial when the training must be tuned, limited or just verified. reply holler 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat about HN? reply nextos 16 hours agorootparentProbably HN is already part of The Pile [1]?I guess X is harder to scrap without permission.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pile.eleuther.ai reply capableweb 16 hours agorootparentIt is indeed:We introduce new datasets derived from the fol- lowing sources: PubMed Central, ArXiv, GitHub, the FreeLaw Project, Stack Exchange, the US Patent and Trademark Office, PubMed, Ubuntu IRC, HackerNews, YouTube, PhilPapers, and NIH ExPorter.

Similar, but also not really comparable. reply capableweb 16 hours agorootparentSmaller in scale, yeah, but probably high bias towards technical content and written by people who (mostly) care about how to write properly. There is at least 37,354,035 items that could be indexed with lots of it high quality, percentage wise probably higher quality&#x2F;post than Twitter, Facebook and other sources. reply summerlight 17 hours agoparentprevI think Twitter is not a great place to dig out training data in general. Most of its data is not well structured and&#x2F;or tagged. Its signal to noise ratio is relatively low. Its texts are generally very short and very dependent on context. Twitter has been largely failing as a short-form video platform. There&#x27;s some trace of algorithmic generation of interest&#x2F;topic-based feed on Twitter, but you know, its quality was never great. I guess it&#x27;s just a hard problem given Twitter&#x27;s environment.Its strength is freshness and volume, but I guess these can be achieved without Twitter if you have a strong web crawling infrastructure? Also, the current generation of LLM is not really capable of exploiting minute-level freshness... at least for now. reply dheera 16 hours agorootparentAlso, Twitter is not where people go to be nice. Twitter incentivizes snarky, disparaging, curt behavior because (a) it limits message length to an extent where nice speech doesn&#x27;t have a place (b) saying nice things gets you likes while saying not-nice things gets you retweets, and retweets are more highly valued by the algorithm. reply nonfamous 17 hours agoparentprevTwitter’s data would be very valuable for generating tweet-like content: short, self-contained snippets, images and video.There’s not a lot of data in Twitter today resembling long-form content: essays, news articles, books, scientific papers, etc. That’s probably why Twitter&#x2F;X expanded the tweet size limit, to be able to collect such data. reply jahewson 16 hours agorootparentYep! It would be a great it generating hot takes and click bait. reply hn1986 16 hours agorootparentand racist, anti-Semitic content reply cpeterso 16 hours agoparentprevIf Twitter was as much a treasure trove of user data that Elon thinks it is, then why is Twitter&#x27;s ad targeting so much worse than Facebook&#x27;s and Instagram&#x27;s? reply elondaits 12 hours agoparentprevTwitter has the largest database of tweets. If you want an AI that writes tweets, there’s nothing better. Why? Twitter could offer a service that bypasses the need for community manager… just feed it a press release, or product website, and it will provide a stream of well crafted ad tweets… or astroturf, even. reply throwaway4aday 12 hours agorootparentDoesn&#x27;t really matter what the content is as long as the sequences of tokens make sense. That&#x27;s the goal: predict the next token given the previous N tokens. Higher level structures like tweets just fall out of that but I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised if a model trained only on tweets could also generalize to some other structures. reply emodendroket 16 hours agoparentprevTwitter and Reddit are extremely valuable to LLMs and makers of both are really kicking themselves over missing the boat with open APIs. reply mistymountains 16 hours agoparentprevComment datasets are valuable for conversational AI, it’s the same reason Reddit locked down the API I imagine. reply smrtinsert 16 hours agoparentprevTraining anything on a network of bot traffic. What a time to be alive... reply ilamont 18 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s not a change confined to Twitter; it&#x27;s a glimpse into what could be the new normal for the internet.You can bet Google&#x2F;Gmail&#x2F;YouTube, Amazon, Microsoft, TikTok, and every other Internet platform that works with user-generated content will soon do the same ... if they haven&#x27;t done so already. reply dayvid 17 hours agoparentGMail&#x27;s already been using your data for classification, data mining, etc. other AI purposes. I would be legitimately surprised if they&#x27;re NOT using processed GMail data (potentially removing sensitive data, etc.) in training their LLMs or other AI projects. reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparentYup. To be clear, that&#x27;s with the free version though.If you pay, corporate versions of Google Workspace won&#x27;t train on your data. That&#x27;s very much by design, since companies don&#x27;t want anything internal ever being exposed.But with the free version, that&#x27;s part of what you&#x27;re \"paying\" for it to remain free. reply tikkun 16 hours agorootparentCould you share a source? I&#x27;ll immediately switch off my gmail onto one of my google workspace domains, if so. reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;workspace.google.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;identity-and-security&#x2F;prot...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;9to5google.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;07&#x2F;03&#x2F;google-privacy-policy-ai-t...Although judging from that, it sounds like Google may have changed policy so that even private data in the free versions is no longer used for AI training.They stopped targeting ads in free Gmail based on your e-mail contents years ago because of the bad press. So maybe they&#x27;ve stopped training AI on free Gmail&#x2F;Docs data out of similar precaution, now that LLM&#x27;s are everywhere in the news. reply lern_too_spel 16 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;d certainly use it to train their spam classifiers, but using that data in a generative model shared with other users would risk information leaks, so they wouldn&#x27;t do that. reply frob 17 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;ve been doing it for years. Everything you put on their servers is a source for them to train on.

Just let it happen. reply frank_nitti 17 hours agorootparentI interpret this as more of a call to greater action, lest people thinking boycotting Twitter is going to address this problem, while happily continuing their use of instagram, google search, tiktok et al. reply lynndotpy 18 hours agoprevThe terms now also have a class-action waiver clause reply waveBidder 17 hours agoparenthow the fuck are those legal? frankly more disturbing to me than the AI training one, which I find less objectionable than selling people&#x27;s attention to advertisers reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agorootparent>how the fuck are those legal?The US doesn&#x27;t have loser pays and has some of the most expensive litigation in the world, which has created all kinds of problems. Someone can file a lawsuit against you knowing that they&#x27;re unlikely to win, but in so doing they could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars for lawyers, so why don&#x27;t you just go ahead and settle for tens of thousands of dollars? It will cost you less to settle than to win in court.This flaw was made to scale by class action lawsuits, which more than any other should be loser pays, because there is little question that thousands of people who have each been harmed to the tune of $100 could each front $10 for a meritorious lawsuit. But instead you get opportunistic lawyers signing up anyone they can find for questionable claims, so they can reach a settlement where the plaintiffs each get $7 -- or a $7 gift certificate -- and the lawyers get millions.This was rightly regarded as a problem but the lawyers had enough political power to prevent a good solution, so what we got instead was to make it easier to force binding arbitration and opt out of class action suits.Lawyers ruin everything. They even ruin lawyers. reply danans 16 hours agorootparentprevIANAL. According to [1] they are legal per Supreme Court precedent, but it also says:\"Contract formation is increasingly scrutinised. Following Concepcion and its progeny, some courts have focused on issues of contract formation to determine whether the consumer in fact agreed to arbitration and the class action waiver. This inquiry is largely confined to online transactions, where a consumer is deemed to have consented to arbitration by using the business&#x27;s website to purchase goods or services. These contracts fall within the rubric of \"clickwrap,\" \"browsewrap,\" or \"webwrap\" agreements and their enforceability is beyond the scope of this article. However, it is important to note that the courts will refuse to enforce class action waivers and arbitration agreements in such agreements when the arbitration provisions were insufficiently conspicuous to ensure the consumer objectively agreed to their terms.\"The article also mentions that non-negotiable consumer contracts are viewed with more suspicion by some courts.1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;content.next.westlaw.com&#x2F;practical-law&#x2F;document&#x2F;I9f1.... reply nostromo 16 hours agorootparentprevClass action lawsuits suck for victims.

It needs to be clear to the average person (and I’m not even sure if I’m being generous there by suggesting 8th grade writing&#x2F;reading level). reply lsmeducation 17 hours agorootparentprevWe need legislation that forces companies to prompt users with a ToS that’s no longer than 400 characters.The prompt should read “So, you cool with that brah?”, and the word “Accept” needs to be replaced with “Yeah sure why not”, and “No” with “Nah, no thank you”.Current TOS’s don’t provide enough clarity.That way any semantic issues down the line can be boiled down to “brah, users said they were cool with it” (to the judge). reply jabradoodle 15 hours agorootparentprevUnfortunately that is basically all of them. reply transformi 17 hours agorootparentprevYea that&#x27;s the first step... but I think that as a group of users we can do much more and build a better internet.This is like Cold-war between companies, that we as users are the cannon fodder... reply thinkingtoilet 17 hours agoparentprevThe obvious first step is to not give these companies your data in the first place. reply SkipperCat 17 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t upvote this enough.

No consent is no consent.Further, you can&#x27;t expect people who have a life in general to sit around all day just waiting to figure out where they have to delete accounts before they are misused.Bazillions of websites nowadays want you to create an account, the normal behavior is that users just abandon accounts which they don&#x27;t need anymore.

Surely there&#x27;s a limit. The statement \"your account balance belongs to Twitter\" is not against the law (like they can say the service is worth whatever amount of money and that you owe them this money), but you&#x27;re not allowed to do that, because you&#x27;re not allowed to retroactively change a contract&#x27;s terms.So, surely, you can&#x27;t change ToS retroactively and expect that any of it applies? reply ipaddr 16 hours agorootparentLet&#x27;s breakdown what tos is. It&#x27;s the terms they are enforcing to provide you a service. They can refuse you service at any point for any reason. You can have your own terms of service that they must follow or you will refuse to do business with them.By adding that they can train AI they are trying to get out of a future lawsuit that may happen if the courts require consent for training (current anyone can train on anything).Your right to sue them for using the data they hold might be lost if you continue to use after the term change.If they asked for your car and you refused they could stop service but they can&#x27;t take your car.They can&#x27;t change payment terms from the past and sue for them. But if they change the tos to say it costs more now your next bill will go up. If they say they can use your data now that they hold and you have an active account they could take that as an acceptance that past&#x2F;future can be used to train ai.A better example might be a right given.

For up to 30 days after deactivation, it is still possible to restore your Twitter account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated.Keep in mind that search engines and other third parties may still retain copies of your public information, like your profile information and public Tweets, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account. reply Raed667 17 hours agorootparentprevThey don&#x27;t have a form to request the information to be deleted under GDPR. I have looked everywhere under help.twitter.com and they just ask you to disable your account. reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparentprevGDPR means absolutely nothing between an American customer and an American company. It&#x27;s completely irrelevant.And I&#x27;m not even sure it means anything even for users in the EU. If Twitter doesn&#x27;t have any offices&#x2F;subsidiaries&#x2F;bank accounts in the EU, then even if the EU fined them, I&#x27;m not sure how that would ever be enforced? reply jedberg 17 hours agorootparentTwitter has an office in Ireland and is most definitely regulated under GDPR. reply crazygringo 17 hours agorootparentIs it still there? I knew they did previously, but last year there were reports it was possibly closing as part of Musk&#x27;s layoffs.Looking online I can&#x27;t find any recent information.Basically, given the way Musk has been ignoring other regulations and&#x2F;or not paying for things, I&#x27;m wondering if he even cares about GDPR. And if he doesn&#x27;t care and shuts down any legal European presence, then does it matter?(Of course if the Ireland office is still active and receiving lots of European advertiser revenue, then of course the GDPR has teeth.) reply Erikun 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s Twitter International Unlimited, headquartered in Ireland. Still operational it seems, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.solocheck.ie&#x2F;Irish-Company&#x2F;Twitter-International... reply jedberg 17 hours agorootparentprevMy friend works there, it&#x27;s definitely still there. reply Alupis 16 hours agorootparentPerhaps not for long...Shutting that office down and safely ignoring the GDPR is probably a valid concession for a US-based business built around data collection.It&#x27;s not like EU users will stop or be blocked from using X anyway. reply crazygringo 16 hours agorootparentprevThanks! OK, GDPR should still have teeth then. Good to know. reply tiffanyg 16 hours agorootparentprevMusk only cares about \"getting his way\" at this point.Years ago, \"dark triad incarnate\" was checked by lack of nearly as established a position* and a longer timeline over which to grow and consolidate wealth and power (which does require time and attention).He&#x27;s past 50 now, and started transitioning into his own \"late Putin phase\" (substitute your own &#x27;favorite megalomaniac&#x27; at will) quite aggressively in the past 5 years (especially). Now the game is using that wealth and power for a kind of ultimate \"spoiled child fantasy camp\".Regardless of how directly any of them channel the childishness of the archetype, the traits are always there - \"I&#x27;m special\", \"your (parent-style) &#x27;rules&#x27; don&#x27;t apply to me\"**, \"I will get my way\", etc. It&#x27;s the whole point, and the motivation that people who don&#x27;t think this way miss. The motivation that makes the behavior make at least some sense.Musk is one of the real extreme examples in terms of how transparent the behavior is - whenever he does something that seems hard to explain, ask yourself how the situation might look \"in a sandbox\". Seriously. This may sound like typical rhetoric, but I&#x27;m serious: try it. Twitter is a perfect example - \"if I can&#x27;t have it my way, then I&#x27;ll make sure no one can have it\" ...... and, just like in the analogy, there are layers of goals. I.e., it&#x27;s also good if while we (may ultimately) destroy \"the sandbox\", we can use it to harm those we don&#x27;t like who&#x27;ve been playing in it. Either directly (e.g., firing employees of Twitter), or in various indirect ways (reporting \"troublesome users\" to their authoritarian governments [when applicable], etc.).* Specifically, still needing something from others here and there - most recently and likely the final example: funding for Twitter deal** People who think this way can&#x27;t help &#x27;telegraphing&#x27; - it&#x27;s one way they identify members of their own flock, in part. \"Nanny state\", \"snowflake\", etc.\"Snowflake\" has got to be a personal favorite. Every time someone uses that one, I know I&#x27;m going to need a WHINE break after a few sentences... https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;tl4VD8uvgec?si=H2MadAVDduLfolfS&t=1m17s reply squarefoot 17 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not sure the GDPR can be enforced outside of the EU, therefore one can&#x27;t be absolutely certain the posts will not appear if accessed from elsewhere. reply fzeindl 17 hours agorootparentIt is enforced internationally just like copyright law. It is a law for EU users no matter where their data resides. Meta was fined 1.3 billion dollars in spring for GDPR violation. reply Alupis 16 hours agorootparentBeing fined != paying a fine.Realistically, a company is only obligated to pay the fine if they have a physical presence within the EU, and care to keep that presence.For some companies, the calculus says pay the fines and cooperate with EU laws.But for most companies, they can and do safely ignore GDPR and other EU laws. EU laws do not apply outside the EU... despite what many Europeans want to believe. reply fzeindl 4 hours agorootparentThat is your opinion. We will see what the courts say to Meta and Amazon. reply lnxg33k1 4 hours agorootparentprevBut for most companies, they can and do safely ignore GDPR and other EU laws. EU laws do not apply outside the EU... despite what many Europeans want to believe.You’re right but when did you meet Europeans who said that a company selling in India has to respect GDPR?

And yet, it&#x27;s also gross and slimy. So I guess I&#x27;m not at all surprised to find out you&#x27;re a monetization person.Gross. reply marricks 16 hours agorootparentprevComments like this act like the consumer has all the power to choose and create the world they want. We don&#x27;t, companies own this world and major public forums and make decisions together like this which we are powerless to change.Corporations have more power in our government than individuals. They have a better understanding and coordination. Acting like a public forum owned by a company is immune from criticism because it&#x27;s a private company is sweeping so much under the rug.I imagine you wouldn&#x27;t be where you are in life if you didn&#x27;t believe such things, though. reply fluidcruft 17 hours agorootparentprevTwitter: the public square that owns your speech. reply brokencode 17 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know how people can be so absolutely shocked that their public posts online could be used by anybody for basically any purpose.If you want to keep your thoughts private, then maybe don’t post them publicly?If WhatsApp or another private messaging app started doing this, I’d be right there with the people calling that absolutely unacceptable.But I’m not surprised at all that Twitter is doing this, and I don’t know how anybody even remotely tech savvy could be. reply singleshot_ 17 hours agorootparentIf only there was some legal regime that turned this conundrum into a scenario whereby people could publicly share their intellectual property while still retaining control of their rights in the material.This seems so critical to a functioning society that one would have thought it would have been considered in the Constitution. Oh well! reply brokencode 15 hours agorootparentIf you think Twitter is violating the constitution or copyright law, then take them to court.But by agreeing to the terms of use, Twitter retains certain rights over what you post on the platform.If that is not acceptable, then don’t use Twitter. If you think your thoughts are too valuable for Twitter to use, then write them into a book or blog or some other venue where your intellectual property can be protected. reply singleshot_ 14 hours agorootparentI do not think Twitter is violating the Constitution unless we are talking about some kind of state actor doctrine vis a vis misinformation censorship under previous ownership.I do not think there are any violations of intellectual property law given that there is surely a waiver of ownership of posts in the TOS.I, of course, do not have the kind of free time required to do something like engage with Twitter, and accordingly I have no account, cannot post, and have not agreed to the TOS.I think you have misconstrued my post, but that’s ok. reply rambojohnson 16 hours agorootparentprevthe ethical implications of using someone&#x27;s data without explicit, informed consent for each specific use case is obviously problematic.the data landscape is ever-evolving, and what was acceptable or even conceivable years ago may not be the same today.companies should not only be transparent but also dynamically update users on how their data is being used and offer an option to opt-out.ignoring this not only impacts individual users but also has broader societal implications.consent fatigue is real; expecting users to keep track and delete their accounts across numerous platforms is neither practical nor ethical.also, cancelling your account or laboriously deleting all of your content doesn&#x27;t necessarily guarantee that all your data will be deleted on the backend... did you think your comment through at all? reply libraryatnight 17 hours agorootparentprevSomething tells me Elon could announce he&#x27;s going to shit on all your faces and you&#x27;d be like \"it&#x27;s his company he can do it!\" While opening your mouth and looking up with a smile. reply parl_match 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s been entertaining watching the pro-Elon crowd shrink and get quieter as he repeatedly screws up. I&#x27;m not saying every decision he&#x27;s made has been bad (some, like revenue sharing and using Twitter Blue, are good imo). But he really has been screwing up bad, and in ways that are indefensible by anyone with common sense. reply ulkesh 14 hours agorootparentprevI did. Right after Musk took over.

I&#x27;d be surprised if Twitter didn&#x27;t have this for years. reply nextaccountic 12 hours agorootparentIf they are changing the TOS now that&#x27;s because past TOS didn&#x27;t allow them to do it. And previous interactions are governed by past TOS reply EGreg 17 hours agoparentprevEveryone is doing it, because it’s capitalism! Our public forums are privately managed and controlled by a few people. Venture CAPITALISTS invest in startups, get shares, prop up money-losing economics for years and then sell the shares to the public in an IPO. The corporations have quarterly earnings calls where they have to explain how they are extracting rents from their ecosystem, in order to make “number go up”, ie make shareholders happy.Open source can liberate us from this, but we need someone to build really good and competitive alternatives to Twitter, Zoom et al.I started Qbix to do it. LA Weekly just published this piece about my company and what it’s doing differently: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37353229 reply FactKnower69 17 hours agorootparentCapitalism isn&#x27;t \"things I don&#x27;t like\", capitalism is when investors are paid simply for \"owning\" things rather than being forced to sell their labor in exchange for a wage like everyone else. Your company is selling shares to external investors and is not worker-owned; it is a capitalist firm that pays dividends to people who didn&#x27;t necessarily do any work for the company. Words have meaning. reply EGreg 16 hours agorootparentWords do indeed have meaning. Absolutely! And I am using the words advisedly, and in their original meaning. Venture capitalists are … well, capitalists! I don’t mischaracterize anything.Capitalism is characterized by PRIVATE ownership of the “means of production”. That’s the term used in the 19th century, but today we could point to the technological infrastructure which enables each new user to engage with a network.“Ownership” means exercising exclusive control over this, and excluding others from using (even a copy of) it.Musk controls Twitter. Zuck controls Facebook. Durov controls Telegram. Moxie controls Signal. And so on. This is centralized control by people who won’t give you their back-end software. They’ll at best let you have your own custom client for a while, until they don’t (Reddit).But in the meantime they’ll spy on you everywhere so they can mine your data and try to extract profits for shareholders. It’s called surveillance capitalism: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surveillance_capitalismCory Doctorow recently wrote about the “enshittification” that happens as the end result of all this private ownership. “I built it — I own it!” Well, if you believe that, you shouldn’t complain when a privately owned company does something, not even when they deplatform you. What you should complain about is the lack of open source alternatives.Does Linus own Linux?Does TimBL own the Web?Does Rasmus Lerdorf own PHP?Does Vitalik own Ethereum?Just because one specific company in an ecosystem is privately owned does not mean the network infrastructure is centrally controlled by a few people.In fact our company has experimebted with ways to reward contributors properly:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;properly-valuing-contributi...Wordpress, Drupal, Magento, Linux etc. can be hosted anywhere. It is a free market. By contrast, Twitter and Facebook (oh sorry, X and Meta) are digital feudalism!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qbix.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;15&#x2F;open-source-communities&#x2F;We also are working on utility tokens that, unlike shares, entitle people only to services in that free market, and not to expect rents to be extracted forever. If Qbix or Automattic extracts too much rents from their open source ecosystem, or doesn’t do the best hosting in, say, Hawaii, then a competitor can arise and compete with them, locally or globally.In fact, Qbix can be used to host social networks in areas with bad internet, including rural villages, cruise ships and planes. They can help young people of all sexes be educated in rural areas with bad internet. Can the same be said of Google or Facebook? NO! Their capitalist ideas always involve sending the signals back to their own server farms. Whether it’s Project Loon (google) or the solar-powered drones (facebook), what they don’t offer is local villages to simply load their own forked copy of their backend software, and owe them nothing!We do. We give the source code away and help hosting companies install it. We are working on creating an entire decentralized ecosystem where we don’t have centralized control … so if host locally, you NEVER have to worry about us training our AI models on your data, or any of the other thousands of things to ebtray your trust.

Our flagship event is Crisis at Christmas, where we open homeless shelters during the Christmas period where many other homelessness facilities close and the homeless population face loneliness during the festive period. We provide shelter, warmth, food and drink, activities and entertainment, Internet Cafe, international phone calls, and most importantly advice services to get people out of homelessness for good.There&#x27;s a ton of IT that goes on: We need internet connectivity to run our centres (and to provide our clients with Wi-Fi), software to manage everything that goes on in a centre like inventory &#x2F; incidents &#x2F; client relationships, making sure we have enough IT supplies like hardware (desktops, tablets and printers), and the list goes on. On top of that, we need a robust service desk to help our (also volunteer) users if they run into issue with IT.We would appreciate any volunteers in any IT specialities (hardware, software, SRE, VoIP, tech support, etc) in any level (student, starting out or years in the field) to join us and help out with developing and maintaining IT solutions to ensure our event is a success and lift people out of homelessness. As a volunteer at Crisis myself, I&#x27;ve learnt a lot of things I wouldn&#x27;t have a chance to do in my real job, and that&#x27;s what makes it interesting to volunteer here.I can be reached at timothy.choi (at) crisis.org.uk if you have questions or would like to know more. reply dbuscher 15 hours agoprevMagdalena Ridge Observatory$80,000-$85,000&#x2F;annumFull-timeSocorro, NM, USASenior Software EngineerONSITEVISAThe Magdalena Ridge Observatory Interferometer (MROI) is an optical&#x2F;near-infrared astronomical interferometer being built in central New Mexico, USA.

The US is famously hard to get into for foreigners wanting to work, as is Australia really. Are they working in the EU, or nomading? reply gumballindie 2 hours agorootparentThose from the eu are moving back to the eu, and those with skills in demand that hold british citizenship only and cant leave find remote work in the us or the eu. The uk contract market which used to be the ultimate goal for highly skilled engineers is getting slaughtered by silly regulation that pushes work either to outsourcing companies or, surprise surprise, to remote workers from the eu.For instance, when i speak with folks from east europe they tell me there are remote jobs available from … the uk (somehow remote within uk is not ok, remote outside is). With a pay gap of roughly 20-30% that means that due to the cost of living and taxes being lower their pay is significantly higher than pay within the uk. The reasons companies outsource or externalise are because hiring contract workers is a tax nightmare (have to prove they are not disguised employees, otherwise rates would be much higher since the worker will have to pay as much tax as an employee..although non employee taxation is also pretty high, because eat the “rich”).Then you have companies that hire locally in a crappy hybrid setup. As if anyone with skills in demand is going to uproot their family or want to live in expensive london only to work on crappy agiled to death products, where the only challenges are getting the process to work instead of solving actual problems.It feels as if this country is making one wrong choice after the other. Brexit was one of them but since then there are plenty more.I do believe that things can turn around, and as such, I will call out what i think damages progress any time i see it.Hybrid or onsite that’s forcing people to return to an overcrowded over expensive city such as london is one of them.

    "originBody": "ALL THINGS DISTRIBUTED NOW GO BUILD! ARTICLES @WERNER Farewell EC2-Classic, it’s been swell September 01, 2023 • 849 words Retiring services isn’t something we do at AWS. It’s quite rare. Companies rely on our offerings – their businesses literally live on these services – and it’s something that we take seriously. For example SimpleDB is still around, even though DynamoDB is the “NoSQL” DB of choice for our customers. So, two years ago, when Jeff Barr announced that we’d be shutting down EC2-Classic, I’m sure that there were at least a few of you that didn’t believe we’d actually flip the switch — that we’d let it run forever. Well, that day has come. On August 15, 2023, we shut down the last instance of Classic. And with all of the history here, I think it’s worth celebrating the original version of one of the services that started what we now know as cloud computing. EC2 has been around for quite a while, almost 17 years. Only SQS and S3 are older. So, I wouldn’t blame you if you were wondering what makes an EC2 instance “Classic”. Put simply, it’s the network architecture. When we launched EC2 in 2006, it was one giant network of 10.0.0.0/8. All instances ran on a single, flat network shared with other customers. It exposed a handful of features, like security groups and Public IP addresses that were assigned when an instance was spun up. Classic made the process of acquiring compute dead simple, even though the stack running behind the scenes was incredibly complex. “Invent and Simplify” is one of the Amazon Leadership Principles after all… If you had launched an instance in 2006, an m1.small, you would have gotten a virtual CPU the equivalent of a 1.7 GHz Xeon processor with 1.75 GB of RAM, 160 GB of local disk, and 250 Mb/second of network bandwidth. And it would have cost just $0.10 per clocked hour. It’s quite incredible where cloud computing has gone since then, with a P3dn.24xlarge providing 100 Gbps of network throughput, 96 vCPUs, 8 NVIDIA v100 Tensor Core GPUs with 32 GiB of memory each, 768 GiB of total systems memory, and 1.8 TB of local SSD storage, not to mention an EFA to accelerate ML workloads. But 2006 was a different time, and that flat network and small collection of instances, like the m1.small, was “Classic”. And at the time it was truly revolutionary. Hardware had become a programmable resource that you could scale up or down at a moment’s notice. Every developer, entrepreneur, startup and enterprise, now had access to as much compute as they wanted, whenever they wanted it. The complexities of managing infrastructure, buying new hardware, upgrading software, replacing failed disks — had been abstracted away. And it changed the way we all designed and built applications. Of course the first thing I did when EC2 was launched was to move this blog to an m1.small. It was running Moveable Type and the this instance was good enough to run the server and the local (no RDS yet) database. Eventually I turned it into a highly-available service with RDS failover, etc., and it ran there for 5+ years until the Amazon S3 Website feature was released in 2011. The blog has now been “serverless” for the past 12 years. Like we do with all of our services, we listened to what our customers needed next. This led us to adding features like Elastic IP addresses, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, CloudWatch, and various new instance types that would better suit different workloads. By 2013 we had enabled VPC, which allowed each AWS customer to manage their own slice of the cloud, secure, isolated, and defined for their business. And it became the new standard. It simply gave customers a new level of control that enabled them to build even more comprehensive systems in the cloud. We continued to support Classic for the next decade, even as EC2 evolved and we implemented an entirely new virtualization platform, Nitro — because our customers were using it. Ten years ago, during my 2013 keynote at re:Invent, I told you that we wanted to “support today’s workloads as well as tomorrow’s,” and our commitment to Classic is the best evidence of that. It’s not lost on me, the amount of work that goes into an effort like this — but it is exactly this type of work that builds trust, and I’m proud of the way it has been handled. To me, this embodies what it means to be customer obsessed. The EC2 team kept Classic running (and running well) until every instance was shut down or migrated. Providing documentation, tools, and support from engineering and account management teams throughout the process. It’s bittersweet to say goodbye to one of our original offerings. But we’ve come a long way since 2006 and we’re not done innovating for our customers. It’s a reminder that building evolvable systems is a strategy, and revisiting your architectures with an open mind is a must. So, farewell Classic, it’s been swell. Long live EC2. Now, go build!

It felt like we were finally living in the future: a world where software was in charge of networking, and all of the legacy cruft that came from having to build networks out of cable could be forgotten.Rather than care about legacy IP \"subnets\", the cloud cared about \"security groups\", which were missing only a couple features (such as \"hierarchy\") to entirely replace the role of a subnet in traditional networking.Having spent a lot of time working with EC2-Classic, it made network engineering fun and easy. The new \"VPC\" mechanism is demoralizing in its complexity, and doesn&#x27;t seem to allow anything you couldn&#x27;t express using security groups.I&#x27;ve written about this before--in more detail or with more rhetoric, depending on my mood--but the big feeling I get from the transition from EC2-Classic was the frustration that comes when other people make something worse.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36829190https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=33569889https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=27990847https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25988915 reply jedberg 18 hours agoparentIf you create a new account, it will work like classic EC2.

I can understand the need for VPC when integrating with on-premise networks, VPNs, etc. However, you often run into cases where VPC is simply not necessary and over complicates things. reply jen20 11 hours agoparentprevVPC absolutely allows you to do something that classic did not - add a single entry to your on-prem route table to AWS without transiting the public internet. A shared flat network is problematic for this. reply brianshaler 20 hours agoprevOff topic, but I&#x27;m confused about the IPv4 notation in this quote:> When we launched EC2 in 2006, it was one giant network of 10.2.0.0&#x2F;8.In my understanding, &#x2F;8 means the first octet would be fixed (10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255) and I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the significance of the 2 here. If the 2 is significant, wouldn&#x27;t you write it as &#x2F;16? Given the source and my confidence on this notation, I feel like there must be some meaning an expert can glean from this.

The largest subnet you can make starting with 10.2.0.0 is 10.2.0.0&#x2F;15. reply jedberg 18 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s still a valid subnet notation, the 2 just doesn&#x27;t mean anything.When you take the logical AND of the IP and the expanded mask, you&#x27;ll just end up with 10.0.0.0 as the network address and 10.255.255.255 as the broadcast address. reply thargor90 20 hours agoparentprevYou are right. The &#x2F;8 is 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8.I guess it&#x27;s not a typo, but a weird way to write 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8 excluding 10.1.0.0&#x2F;16 . reply mlyle 20 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t exclude 10.1.0.0&#x2F;16, or any of the rest of 10&#x2F;8. reply chacham15 18 hours agoparentprevMy thought was that 10.2.0.0&#x2F;16 is part of the 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8 address range which is by default a private network address range (i.e. not routable by any other machines). I interpreted what the author wrote to say that your machine would be assigned an address in 10.2&#x2F;16 but would still be able to route to other AWS services &#x2F; machines in other 10&#x2F;8 subnets (e.g. 10.1&#x2F;16) reply gilbetron 20 hours agoparentprevFormally it should be 10.0.0.0&#x2F;8, but you&#x27;ll often encounter CIDRs written less formally by including set bits outside of the cidr prefix length.

Or it might be a typo! ;) reply unilynx 19 hours agorootparentI would interpret 192.254.33.12&#x2F;16 to mean &#x27;host 192.254.33.12 in a &#x2F;16 subnet&#x27;.That&#x27;s also the notation `ip` on Linux supports reply rob74 20 hours agoprev> The complexities of managing infrastructure, buying new hardware, upgrading software, replacing failed disks — had been abstracted away...and replaced by the complexities of AWS.

Yes, you didn’t go into the data center and replace the disk yourself, but it was a very different process than what you get with AWS.There are still plenty of web hosts that operate the old fashioned way if people want to use them. There is a reason people prefer services like AWS though. reply ceejayoz 19 hours agoparentprevSure, but it often required a) you to detect and diagnose it on your own and b) a couple hours to a couple of weeks for them to agree and swap it out.

I mean, Oracle still rakes in billions, despite everything. reply dangus 19 hours agoparentprevAWS doesn’t have to be complex if those aren’t your requirements, you can use something like Lightsail. If all you need is a VPS, get a VPS. (Though if that’s what you need, I personally like Hetzner more).But AWS needs to be complex to handle the needs of huge organizations.I will also point out that the AWS console EC2 launching interface has come such a long way. So much to the complexity is handled for you. reply stilwelldotdev 19 hours agoprev\"Retiring services isn’t something we do at AWS.

I can understand why the service is going away as Chef and Puppet are not exactly gaining marketshare.AWS rarely retires services and when they do they pretty much give months&#x2F;year(s) worth of notice before forcing you to migrate which is very nice. reply isbvhodnvemrwvn 1 hour agorootparentprevCompare this to Azure and you&#x27;ll understand. reply mh- 19 hours agoparentprevand I, while dealing with the fallout of migrating something from AWS Data Pipeline (it entered \"Maintenance Mode\" and they removed console access earlier this year.) reply hughesjj 16 hours agorootparentData pipelines was also a perennial shit show behind the scenes. Turns out integration is a lot of complexity even if the service is \"simple\" in concept and doesn&#x27;t need to be so real time.I feel like data pipelines and swf have been replaced by step functions+event bus+lambdas&#x2F;fargate. We&#x27;ve furthered abstractions over time, and that&#x27;s a good thing.Edit that said no idea how they scale in comparison reply davedx 21 hours agoprevI still remember when I worked at Serif and we needed web hosting for our new social media website that would be integrated into our scrapbooking desktop software. There were a lot of shiny new technologies around at the time (as there always are). One of them was Microsoft Silverlight, and we implemented its \"Deep Zoom\" into the website so our users could easily zoom around in the scrapbooks that got published and enjoy the details.Another was AWS. I think EC2 had just launched, and we happened to be re-evaluating where we hosted our web properties, because we thought the social media website would get a bit more traffic than our older \"web components\" offering. It was pretty exciting that we could just click a button and spin up an instance in the US, or in Ireland, or Amsterdam. And if the instance died, just click a button again to spin up another one.As it is today, so it was then: the simple UI hid quite some complexity. There were the different kinds of storage to learn about, and which ones were persistent, and which weren&#x27;t. If I remember rightly those early EC2 instances weren&#x27;t as reliable as they seem to be today either, we actually lost one or two completely and had to rebuild them, so we snapshotted a lot.There was no infrastructure as code or DevOps, but we did implement our own highly available cluster. One of the engineers I worked with actually wrote it from scratch, in C++ (we were primarily a C++ company). It would monitor the databases in the different EC2 instances, and ensure the database cluster stayed alive.We didn&#x27;t really know what we were doing, what was smart, there weren&#x27;t any cloud architects around back then. But the technology worked really well. Once we got past the initial hiccups, we built a pretty active internet community. The website itself was built in PHP with MySQL, and used XSLT to transform XML data (that in turn was built from relational data from SQL) to generate the HTML. There wasn&#x27;t a great deal of JavaScript, just some jQuery (another technology I just randomly stumbled on while working on this project that also changed quite a few things). Progressive enhancement, and server-side rendering.I&#x27;m trying to remember how we deployed it. I think we used FileZilla, and then the C++ cluster software would clone the uploaded files to the other EC2 instances in the other AZ&#x27;s.I can&#x27;t remember how much peak traffic we had, but in retrospect, we probably didn&#x27;t need a server in 3 different AZ&#x27;s. But damn, it was fun to work on, and it gave me my first introduction to AWS.Good times. reply pirate787 21 hours agoparentI remember those days, there was no database layer at AWS so we used instances with Elastic Block store for durability. reply davedx 21 hours agorootparentYeah, that was it! It was so confusing initially trying to figure out what should go in the EC2 instances&#x27; local disk storage, what should go into EBS, and what should go into S3. It all seems so obvious now of course... reply viraptor 21 hours agorootparentIt was also confusing to the users. I remember seeing a post every other week on HN about a service going down or losing data because they accidentally used the ephemeral devices for their databases. Haven&#x27;t seen one of those in ages. reply psadauskas 19 hours agorootparentprevYup, and for performance, you would RAID Stripe a bunch of EBS volumes together. But sometimes you&#x27;d get a volume on a noisy neighbor, and its performance would be terrible.Where I worked at the time, I wrote some Chef tooling that would hdperf the volumes it provisioned, and if some weren&#x27;t any good it would provision more until it got 8 good ones. Only then would it RAID them together, then deprovision the bad ones.Now they have provisioned iops, and I haven&#x27;t seen a slow EBS volume in a decade. reply SillyUsername 20 hours agoprevNow all they need to do is actually allow a fixed budget instead of possible runaway credit card charges.Microsoft do it, and IIRC Google, so why not Amazon?I&#x27;ve been waiting for this for about 20 years too :D reply bdcravens 19 hours agoparentIt would kill the ecosystem of highly paid \"cloud cost optimization\" consultants who do little more than flip a few switches in the AWS console. reply poxrud 8 hours agoparentprevI know it’s not the same but you can setup billing alarms and budget alerts. reply ZoomerCretin 19 hours agoparentprevBecause it would make them less money and their customers aren&#x27;t so price sensitive. reply aranchelk 18 hours agoprevPersonally I wish they would have just bit the bullet and continued Classic with IPv6.Ironically I think post-classic was a regression — it looks a lot more like the infrastructure we had to deal with pre-cloud.My new stuff is mostly on Cloudflare, so now I’m really not thinking about subnets, VPCs, etc. reply xxpor 14 hours agoparentIt turns out the way to grow the ec2 business is to get existing companies into the cloud - not just brand new startups. They all have to integrate with on prem networks, which necessitates VPC. reply londons_explore 21 hours agoprevSo if I&#x27;m understanding correctly, all the classic instances were migrated to more modern types with no intervention from the account holder?Did they suffer a reboot during that migration, or was it done via some live-migration process (it&#x27;s hard to live-migrate off a virtualization platform that was never designed with that in mind!).What about the original network setup? Is that still emulated, or might some customer applications have broken? reply jseutter 21 hours agoparentNo, migrating did involve intervention from the account holder. More information here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;aws&#x2F;ec2-classic-is-retiring-her...It seems like AWS spent time, people and money to migrate customers off EC2 classic. They made a fairly good effort to automate the process and make it less painful for customers. For example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repost.aws&#x2F;knowledge-center&#x2F;ssm-migrate-ec2classic-v...The original network was from an everyone-on-the-same-subnet model to a you get your own subnet, so yes, customer applications could break in the process. People do all sorts of non-smart things for good reasons, like hardcoding an ip address in &#x2F;etc&#x2F;hosts when a nameserver is down. And then they forget to change it back. To do these sorts of migrations well requires a sort of stick and carrot approach. The stick, which is we want to shut down this service and will eventually refuse you service, and the carrot, which includes automation, reminders that people need maintenance windows for their applications, clear directions, and above all, willingness to deal with people and actually talk to them. reply londons_explore 20 hours agorootparentLooking at that blog post, I think AWS could have done the migration for most users with no involvement of the user themselves.In the ideal world, they would have written software to live-migrate VM&#x27;s to the new platform and emulate the old networking.Emulating old stuff should be pretty easy, because hardware moves on, and an instance back in 2006 probably had far lower performance expectations - and therefore even a fairly poor performance emulation will be sufficient to meet user needs. reply TheDong 18 hours agorootparent\"emulate the old networking\" is something that can&#x27;t be done per customer, and the new platform makes networking per customer.Let&#x27;s say I have my aws account \"account1\", and my friend has their account \"account2\", both running classic. We could have both talked to each other&#x27;s instances by their _private IPs_ even though they&#x27;re in different accounts. AWS has no way of knowing those two instances are related, other than that they&#x27;re both in classic.Sure, AWS could make a global cross-account emulated flat network, but at that point, it&#x27;s probably cheaper to just use the real thing, which was already built and functions... and at that point, you&#x27;re not migrating them to \"the new platform\", but rather to \"ec2 classic 2\" reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentIf there is a small number of classic users, a single special case in the code to have all classic users connected to a single network of an admin account seems very doable...I wonder if perhaps part of the reason for not doing this was they were worried about malware spreading across that shared internal network from one VM without security patches to the next VM without security patches.Even if that were the case, they could monitor all VM&#x27;s on the classic network, and any VM which doesn&#x27;t contact another users VM&#x27;s for ~1 month would have the ability to do so be blocked. reply lclarkmichalek 19 hours agorootparentprevI wonder why they didn&#x27;t do that in the 14 years since VPCs were introduced? reply motoboi 21 hours agoparentprevThe had to be restarted, but not only that, has to have their networks reconfigured.But they gave people YEARS to do that, and tracked down every user to help them if necessary. reply londons_explore 20 hours agorootparent> has to have their networks reconfigured.I don&#x27;t see why every user couldn&#x27;t be auto-created a virtual network with the same 10.x.x.x IP addresses as their original machine had - and therefore there is no need to do any reconfiguration on the users side. reply Sohcahtoa82 12 hours agorootparentBecause there&#x27;s more than just the local IP address to worry about.Remember, all of EC2 Classic was in a single &#x2F;8 of private IPs. You could communicate with EC2 instances in another account via their private IP address.If you have two instances in different accounts that need to communicate, upgrading from EC2 Classic to VPC couldn&#x27;t be done automatically. reply motoboi 18 hours agorootparentprevBecause people could have that same network on-promises on the other side of the VPN (I have). reply londons_explore 18 hours agorootparentBut that isn&#x27;t a new problem if the same user already uses that address - you&#x27;re just leaving them with the same issue they already had. reply devit 21 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s not clear, but my interpretation is that they contacted every account holder, somehow convinced them to migrate (perhaps with discounts and&#x2F;or threats of termination) and then shut down once everyone migrated.Would be very interesting to learn how that was possible, it seems surprising to me that there wasn&#x27;t even one instance that the owner forgot about or just was unwilling to do any work on.It&#x27;s possible that credit card expiration was the key, as that may have automatically disabled almost all forgotten accounts. reply crabbone 20 hours agorootparentThey don&#x27;t need to threaten. Their SLAs don&#x27;t offer to run VMs indefinitely. AWS will send you an email about shutting down your VM if, eg. they need to rotate the disk used for storing VM image etc. It&#x27;s somewhere there in the contract, and it&#x27;s a usual process for someone who keeps long-running VMs in EC2. reply devit 20 hours agorootparentDo they really not do live migration or at least auto-restart (if configured) in those cases? reply acdha 20 hours agorootparentThey have live migration now (for many years) but they didn’t back in the early era. I’m not sure they set it up for the classic environment but I think they must have - in the early 2010s you could get notices that your VM’s host had failed or was about to fail and you needed to launch a new one but I think that stopped by around 2015 as I had servers running for a deprecated project which were finally shutdown this decade and it seems like rather good luck not to have any failures in 7+ years on old hardware. reply crabbone 19 hours agorootparentI received last such email about a year ago for a VM in either free-tier or like the cheapest one available. This probably has to do with VM flavor you choose as well as with the time you created it. reply acdha 19 hours agorootparentDefinitely possible - I only had about ten old servers but that’s a nice stretch without a hardware failure. reply tekla 19 hours agorootparentprevIts your responsibility to make your systems resistant to failure reply crabbone 20 hours agoparentprevI don&#x27;t know the details of this particular migration, but I used to have a VM in some low-price tier that was running for a long time (few years), and, eventually AWS sent me an email telling they are going to shut it down for maintenance reasons.Guess this was something similar. VMs, if not specifically configured to be able to move cannot really be moved automatically. Think about eg. randomness of ordering in PCIe bus (i.e. after moving the devices may not come up in the same order as before moving), various machine ids, like MAC address -- if you don&#x27;t make sure VM isn&#x27;t affected by these changes, it&#x27;s likely that it will be, if moved. reply mschuster91 19 hours agorootparent> Think about eg. randomness of ordering in PCIe bus (i.e. after moving the devices may not come up in the same order as before moving), various machine ids, like MAC address -- if you don&#x27;t make sure VM isn&#x27;t affected by these changes, it&#x27;s likely that it will be, if moved.QEMU&#x2F;KVM&#x2F;libvirt&#x2F;... are idempotent when it comes to hardware the VM sees - the exception is the CPU model, that one can&#x27;t be changed on the fly without at least rebooting the VM in question, and hardware in passthrough mode like GPUs.All the VM sees from a live migration is a few seconds of \"lost\" time, as if someone had stopped the CPU clock. reply ec109685 19 hours agorootparentprevThe clouds have figured this out: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;doi&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;10.1145&#x2F;3186411.3186415 reply crabbone 19 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a very bold claim :)If you prepare for migration, then it will work. If you don&#x27;t -- it might or might not work, and it depends on way too many things to be confident that it will.For example, in our VM deployment process we heavily rely on PXE boot and our code that runs during initramfs and also after pivot. So, even if whatever you have in the hypervisor and the virtualized OS has somehow managed to solve the moving problem, our own (screwy) code might not be so smart.In general, the more of the underlying infrastructure you touch, the harder it will be to move you, unless you specifically prepare to move. Eg. what if you set up BMC for various components on your system? What if your code relies on knowing particular details of hardware to which you were given pass-through access from your VM, like, eg. you record somewhere the serial number of your disk in order to be able to identify it on next boot, but suddenly that disk is gone?Even simpler: MIG flag on NVidia&#x27;s GPUs is stored in the persistent writable memory of the GPU itself. Suppose your VM has moved to a different location and is connected to a different (but compatible) GPU -- you need to run the code that sets the flag again and then reboot the system in order to start working with the GPU, but the host may not be even aware of the fact that you need that particular setting.The guest side of things needs to be prepared to move, to mitigate these problems. reply tabeth 21 hours agoprevThis is a level of support all software companies should aspire to.

They were getting lost in trying to cobble together lambda, s3 and some other stuff to basically host some JS and images. I suggested Linode (had a working example) but \"that&#x27;s not enterprise\" (this was a small pre-revenue startup testing ideas). I then suggested (and setup) a lightsail instance for $5&#x2F;month doing what was needed, and it too was rebuffed as not enterprise(y) enough.

That culture change is the root of the issues we&#x27;re talking about in this thread. reply slyall 20 hours agorootparentprevNo because if anything (the effect might have been small) it reduced the power of the open web and many websites (which Google tied togeather) and encouraged people to go to walled gardens ( Facebook, Instagram, twitter, etc ) which are controlled by other companies. reply flir 20 hours agorootparentA lot of heavyweight bloggers and aggregators used Reader in their toolchains - it was very good at surfacing trending content. I don&#x27;t think the effect on the blogging ecosystem was small.I could believe they were clearing a path for G+ and Discover on Android. reply freeAgent 16 hours agorootparentWhat&#x27;s frustrating is that Reader would have been complementary to Google+. It could have served as a huge funnel by which users could discover content to share on Google+. That&#x27;s how I used to use Reader (though at the time I found content that I shared other places, such as Facebook, Digg, or Reddit). reply wombat-man 20 hours agorootparentprevI think it just was never going to get the mass adoption it needed to justify the upkeep. reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentThe upkeep was apparently 12 engineers and they had tens of millions of users. It doesn&#x27;t take that many users to justify 12 engineers plus infra, so it sounds like it was more that Google doesn&#x27;t care to operate any product unless it will have users in the hundreds of millions. reply mike_hearn 17 hours agorootparentBy the end it had an upkeep of one dude&#x27;s 20% time. It was very reliable and the Google infrastructure didn&#x27;t require much ongoing maintenance at that time, the servers just kept on trucking. reply dylan604 19 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn&#x27;t take that manyusers to justify 12 engineers plus infra,Otherwise, those 12 engineers and infra are pure negative on the balance sheet reply LamaOfRuin 19 hours agorootparentHaving basically all their users (well, as much as for any of their revenue generating products anyway) be revenue generating would require practically no effort for google specifically. It fit their revenue model perfectly. It is trivial to put the exact same ads in there as they already had on search and gmail, and it is stickier than search or gmail. reply pests 16 hours agorootparentThat would seem a little rude wouldn&#x27;t it?Taking content from another site, maybe that has ads, and then displaying it in Reader next to your own ads instead?I think it would have caused some issues in the RSS world that such a big player was using everyone&#x27;s content for themselves.I used Reader daily back then. It&#x27;s strange to think my current method of manually checking sites for updates was solved so long ago. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentLOL. the Googs worrying about being rude is charmingly funny in a webcomic kind of way. they removed their tag line of don&#x27;t be evil. you think they are concerned about being rude?however, this is precisely what Reddit was complaining about 3rd party apps doing to their content. everyone was trying to pivot to blaming AI scrappers, but that&#x27;s just FUD. reply wombat-man 19 hours agorootparentprevBroadly, I think some business models are better suited for smaller companies than Google for sure.Reader probably didn&#x27;t have much B2B potential and was maybe profitable but yeah, they tend to swing for larger audiences. reply wombat-man 18 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t think they ever put ads on it, really wonder what the decision process on that was. reply mike_hearn 17 hours agorootparentMany blogs have ads on them. So you&#x27;d be stripping ads and replacing them with your own - not cool. reply wombat-man 17 hours agorootparentWell, sure, but they could just not show ads for blogs that didn&#x27;t use google ads.The ones that do... Well, why not show ads for them as originally intended? replyjustinpombrio 20 hours agorootparentprevObligatory reminder that RSS is alive and well. It remains popular. I both subscribe to RSS, and support it on my blog. You can too. reply flir 18 hours agorootparentStill use it - I even read HN via RSS - but I&#x27;ve never found a tool with the critical mass of users you need to show trending content the way GR did. reply freeAgent 16 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s true. I use Newsblur. It has social features, but the community is so small and the social aspect is so limited that it has little value. With that said, the people who engage with it tend to be authentic users interested in high-quality content and respectful discussion. Discovery of other users is terrible, though. You basically have to stumble upon them if they&#x27;re interacting with an article already in your RSS feeds. reply flir 13 hours agorootparenttheoldreader, same problem.Idle musing 1: A mechanism for all these small readers to federate their trending content? Out of many comes one?Idle musing 2: These tools were mostly written a decade ago. It might be possible, with the current state of the art, to extract a more useful signal out of a smaller pool of users. replyrakkhi 9 hours agoparentprevSoftware engineering at Google even had a law for theirhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;se-101-software-engineering&#x2F;what-is-the-h... reply weinzierl 20 hours agoparentprevI agree with everything you wrote, except for the very last sentence. This is just wishful thinking. First of all \"when the same person is responsible\" is a very big if, and then no two buying decisions are the same and even if the person with decision-making power remembers it&#x27;ll be just one point on a long list. reply rob74 20 hours agorootparentOTOH, I have a feeling that \"nobody ever got fired for choosing AWS\" will become the new \"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\", so... reply ilyt 20 hours agorootparentprevSure but if you ask online and those people will be yelling \"dont pickthey will pull a rug from under you\" at every occasion... reply bilalq 17 hours agoparentprevGoogle clearly doesn&#x27;t care about their reputation. Their shutdown of Pixel Pass before users got a chance to upgrade was just ridiculous[1]. It&#x27;s hard to quantify the impact that this poor reputation has on their business. Their revenue is still growing, but it&#x27;s definitely not where it could be.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2023&#x2F;8&#x2F;30&#x2F;23851107&#x2F;google-graveyard... reply mongol 21 hours agoparentprev [–] That&#x27;s a good point. But I am curious how special this Classic offering was, compared to what came after. Would migration have been hard? reply snewman 21 hours agorootparent [–] It&#x27;s not so much that EC2 Classic offered any features that were difficult to live without. It&#x27;s just that migraine away from it means migrating, period. You need to move all of your systems, including any data stored on those systems (in instance store or EBS), to effectively a new data center. Migrating a live production environment can be a pain and&#x2F;or cause downtime. reply brianshaler 21 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also worth remembering that infrastructure stuck on EC2 Classic would have been built so long ago it may predate modern cloud tooling and even modern best practices around reproducibility and CI&#x2F;CD.(EC2 user since 2010) reply MichaelZuo 20 hours agorootparentThis. Unless a written guarantee could be offered by the cloud provider that migration will be absolutely trouble free, why wouldn&#x27;t customers just stick to what they know works?And if they&#x27;re not willing to provide a written guarantee, then that says a lot. reply snewman 19 hours agorootparentIn this scenario, it&#x27;s nothing to do with the cloud provider. Migrating a live production system is inherently difficult. You can make a reasonable analogy to moving houses – say, with two kids who are in school, and while you and your spouse are both working. No matter what guarantees you&#x27;re given regarding the condition of the new house, simply moving all of your stuff (while you are using it) is a big hassle. reply MichaelZuo 17 hours agorootparentIn this example, it wouldn&#x27;t be the guarantees for the new house, which presumably would have been examined and accepted well beforehand, it would be guarantees for the moving process itself. reply acdha 20 hours agorootparentprevExactly - and with fewer managed services back then they’d also be more likely to have hand-rolled servers doing things which you’d now try to hand off to a managed service. I remember entire servers running small tasks which you’d now have, say, CloudFront or an ALB invoking Lambdas or at least sending it to a container. reply knodi123 21 hours agorootparentprev [–] > It&#x27;s just that migraine away from it means migrating, period.Freudian slip? replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

      "On August 15, 2023, Amazon Web Services (AWS) completely discontinued EC2-Classic, the initial variant of their cloud computing service EC2, which had been operational for close to 17 years.",
      "EC2-Classic simplistically managed the infrastructure, making it easier to design and build applications, and, over time, evolved with new features such as Elastic IPs, Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and VPC, which led to the design of individually managed cloud segments.",
      "The retirement of EC2-Classic denotes a significant step in the progression of cloud computing; however, AWS remains devoted to advancing and building adaptable systems for customer use."

What tends to happen is that a retail buyer would work with a supplier and order a product in . That product packaging will have a promotional or information site it will link to & is printed as a QR code. From a buyers perspective they are doing this as it’s a way to provide value or information to their customer and supplier fronts the cost of this. The IT teams within retail aren’t kept in the loop and neither are they aware of a site that is hosting any of this content. All the content and marketing of this is done by a agency who are hired and managed by the category or merchandising teams in the head office . Product sells for a quarter or maybe 6 months at the most . Products get rotated and goes back to warehouse until such time in a year they need to liquidate the stock and do promotional discount pricing as part of back to school or Black Friday etc., By then the agency that fronted this and created the site has lost its domain or the site isn’t maintained&#x2F; gets compromised etc., At that point the product is on the shelf , domain is hijacked or the hosting provider &#x2F; host gets taken over by a malicious actor. Then the IT &#x2F; security teams in the retail organisation are asked to step in and support their business colleagues. Every major retail corporation will have this happen to them at least once a year. IT teams will have a laugh about this and nothing ever changes as a process as it doesn’t really affect the share value or damage the reputation of the retailer as such reply hedora 16 hours agoparentAlways remember to convert a QR code back to text before printing &#x2F; distributing it.There are some shady QR code generation sites on the Internet that produce codes that work for a week or so, but go to some unexpected third-party domain that redirects to your site. Later, you find out that you have to pay them a subscription fee if you want the QR code to keep working. reply tetha 18 hours agoparentprevThis is why I&#x27;ve grown even more careful about introducing new domains in production.If I keep everything in one or a small amount of production domains, even if a product is shut down, a project ends, and everyone has long forgotten about it - it&#x27;s still hitting my load balancers and I can deal with it. Cheaply, too. Some 404 pages delivered by a loadbalancer probably cost cents or less per month. I can also make it a cute branded image based on a few conditions as well if you give me that.And some POs are arguing how this is controlling and how this might be constricting freedom and such. And, yes it is. But on the other hand, we won&#x27;t have porn hosted on something the company once promoted. Unless the company wants to rebrand as such. reply SoftTalker 17 hours agorootparentYeah registering a domain is sort of a permanent act. If you ever let it expire, someone else can take it over and start receiving all emails, http requests, and anything else directed at services you used to run there. And possibly responding to them. They&#x27;ll easily get certificates to verify the domain, since all that&#x27;s needed to do that is control of the domain. reply Iulioh 15 hours agorootparent\"a domain is forever\" is kind of a scary thing reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentDNS was designed to delegate subdomains, and we should do it.But easier for every team to grab a new domain. reply Too 5 hours agorootparentprevFrom a customer point of view this is also a lot more trustworthy. Hypothetical example. If i visit annualpromotion2023.pepsi.com.

Changing registrars and WHOIS info is exactly the kind of thing a shady site might do to throw off investigation.

It can definitely be useful to \"change the URL\" after deploying the code, but you still have the same problem that you don&#x27;t control the domain. If you stop making payments or the company goes out of business then you are out of luck.IDK if any of these services support custom domains. So that you could have qr.mycompany.example or whatever. That way if something goes wrong with the service you can at least direct it to something else.But I think in general you should control your URLs. Especially for printed material. Often this would be something like a short URL or some other small name that can be directed to the intended final site and changed at any point. reply jahewson 16 hours agorootparentprevIn other words, the biscuits need more shortening. reply seabass-labrax 19 hours agoprevI can completely understand the concern with a compromised promotional website listed on the packaging, but a full product recall seems to me extremely wasteful. Presumably, all those bags (which look to me like they&#x27;re made of plastic) will have to be disposed of, if not the actual biscuits themselves.This is just one factor in a multitude of reasons why single-use plastics are wasteful, but I believe that if a company is not responsible enough to look after a URL they should not be plastering it all over consumer products.A URL is for life, not just for Christmas.

The amount of perfectly good product that goes to waste in \"developed\" countries is certainly one of the most infuriating things about modern life. Perhaps future historians will also comment on this point as they unearth perfect artifacts from landfills.The pragmatic approach would be to put a small piece of opaque tape over the offending text and put the product back on the shelves. I&#x27;ve seen that happen with nutritional information on imported products, where the original label printed on the packaging presumably didn&#x27;t meet the legal requirements and thus a new one was put over it.This is just one factor in a multitude of reasons why single-use plastics are wastefulIMHO that&#x27;s not the real worry here --- that would&#x27;ve ended up in landfill or been incinerated anyway regardless of the recall, and it&#x27;s a tiny amount of waste relative to the rest of the otherwise usable product. reply krisoft 15 hours agoparentprev> all those bags will have to be disposed of, if not the actual biscuits themselves.Nobody will repackage the biscuits.

Disposing of them given that the URL is itself no longer useful might well be the pragmatic approach.I also doubt the public will return sold product, though they might take actions against the packaging itself.

It’d be a solid choice for a lazy Saturday afternoon of getting baked and zoning out on TV, even for those without kids. Mellow, funny, you get little wins to root for, and some fun bits that go over kids’ heads. Rare for a show targeted that young to be as appealing to (or, at least, tolerable for) adults. Far better than, say, Daniel Tiger, which is already well above the bottom tier of that kind of show.[edit] incidentally, I think Fred Rogers would have been disgusted by all the heavy-handed auto tune in Daniel Tiger. Giving kids a wildly incorrect model of what ordinary, real human singing sounds like strikes me as the kind of thing that would have prompted him to bring down the “no” hammer on his own show in a damn hurry, if someone had suggested it. Bugs me every time I watch it. reply Al-Khwarizmi 18 hours agorootparentI also love Bluey but I think we might be somewhat biased, because it clearly makes an effort to cater to adults as well (most chapters can be seen as being about parenting, and sometimes contain non-obvious lessons for parents). Perhaps from the viewpoint of a child it wouldn&#x27;t be so superior to other cartoons.Although it does have the quite objective advantage of not being overstimulating.

Regarding the parenting lessons, they resonate with the kids as well. There was an episode after which one of our kids compared the story of an episode with something that happened in our household and it gave us a nice chance to talk about it on their level.

This show is on another level. reply autoexec 17 hours agorootparentprev> and move at such a fast pace that in some I can barely follow the action, and we throw them at small kids...I love animation so I end up watching a ton of cartoons and I have to agree that shows these days can move way too fast. You can tell a whole story in a 5-15 minute episode, but telling a story well in that time takes serious talent and I&#x27;d love to see what talented writers like that could do with a story that had room to breathe.It matters a lot less for shows with little if any continuity but serious story telling needs a lot more time. I&#x27;d feel better about it if there were a bunch of animated shows with 40-60 run times to balance things out.One good thing I&#x27;ll say about hyper-fast paced animation is that it forces the audience to fill in a lot of blanks on their own. That could engage a kid&#x27;s imagination if they take the time. I get the feeling that it&#x27;s the older audiences who tend to go nuts with that though. reply RandallBrown 16 hours agorootparentprev> Perhaps from the viewpoint of a child it wouldn&#x27;t be so superior to other cartoons.My friend&#x27;s son LOVES Bluey.

Just that for most parents it tends to be the uncontested best among shows for that age, miles ahead of any competitor without a second thought (an opinion that I myself share) while for kids it&#x27;s probably just one more that some may prefer while others don&#x27;t.My son does like it quite a lot, and it prefers it to many others such as Dora, Spongebob, Paw Patrol or the infamous Peppa Pig, but he will choose PJ Masks or Superkitties over Bluey, and those two I find... not very good, to be honest. Especially Superkitties.Your friend&#x27;s son has great taste in cartoons, although not blinking might be taking it a bit too far :) reply omnicognate 16 hours agorootparentprevBluey is by far my kids&#x27; favorite show, FWIW. reply blamazon 19 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a new one in the mix too, called Pupstruction, which seems to be Disney&#x27;s \"this is legally distinct from paw patrol\" entry.

I&#x27;ve (unfortunately) had to sit through hundreds of episodes and it really isn&#x27;t. The police dog is not particularly treated as a main character as all of them are given pretty equal screen time and storylines (out side the recent film, which does focus on him). And even when the episodes do focus on Chase it&#x27;s barely police work, certainly he doesn&#x27;t go around pointing his gun at immigrants. His main ability as a police officer seems to be that he has a megaphone. reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparent> And even when the episodes do focus on Chase it&#x27;s barely police work, certainly he doesn&#x27;t go around pointing his gun at immigrants.If he did go around pointing is gun at immigrants that would be the opposite of police propaganda wouldn&#x27;t it? Most young kids don&#x27;t interact with police directly, so nearly everything they know about police comes from the media they consume. The question comes down to what kids need to learn about police and what role media plays in that education. Families in certain communities have been educating their children on how dangerous police are for a very long time.Is it better to introduce an idealized version of police to kids and let them learn on their own that police are dangerous or is it better to present police in children&#x27;s media realistically so that they&#x27;re prepared when they see their 8 year old classmate thrown to the ground, handcuffed, and arrested because they acted up in class or so they understand when they see protesters march past their house because police officers beat and murdered another person on camera without consequences?I suspect that it&#x27;s better to show kids what police are supposed to be like before introducing them to the harsher reality we live in, but I can&#x27;t blame people for looking at shows like Paw Patrol and thinking that it&#x27;s giving kids a very unrealistic view of policing at a time when they should be increasingly made aware of the issues and the risks they face. reply TeMPOraL 18 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. And even if it had some police propaganda, this wouldn&#x27;t be that bad anywhere in the developed world except the US.

It&#x27;s kind of their thing. French farmers routinely shut down whole cities when they&#x27;re vaguely irritated about something; it&#x27;s unsurprising that protests around more serious and emotive matters than France enforcing an EU ban it was already meant to be enforcing on a pesticide get a bit dramatic. reply stavros 15 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just a France thing, I remember here (Greece) ten years or so ago, when a police officer shot a teenager, and the whole country was in flames for a week from the riots. There are still marches and protests every year, on the anniversary. reply civilitty 17 hours agorootparentprevThe French do love a good riot but don&#x27;t forget that the George Floyd protests just a few years ago were the largest in US history - during pandemic lockdowns, no less. They devolved into something resembling riots in only a few cities but \"extra-high shrug\" is hardly how I&#x27;d describe that series of events or the other smaller protests since.

    "originBody": "Little Short Bulletins About Wikipedia search-by-vibes through millions of pages offline Jun 1, 2023 Check it out! https://leebutterman.com/wikipedia-search-by-vibes/ What is this? This is a browser-based search engine for Wikipedia, where you can search for “the reddish tall trees on the san francisco coast” and find results like “Sequoia sempervirens” (a name of a redwood tree). The browser downloads the database, and search happens offline. To download two million Wikipedia pages with their titles takes roughly 100MB and under 50 milliseconds to see the final results. This uses sentence transformers to embed documents, product quantization to compress embeddings, pq.js to run distance computation in the browser, and transformers.js to run sentence transformers in the browser for queries. Is this good? Yes. Real-time search over millions of documents is happening in real-time completely offline. Results stream back every 10ms on a mobile device, and search results update gradually as the database is sequentially scanned. Timing: first results in 21ms, 70% of final results in 116ms, faceted search in 23ms The distance computation over 2M embeddings takes 250ms in total, over 20 iterations, and we can display intermediate results with a faceted top-10 computation that takes 8ms. To display intermediate results, we run batches of 100k distance computations at a time, and compute the top-k and repaint after a (30ms) timer runs out. We order embeddings by compressed page size: more information-dense pages are the first to be analyzed and returned in a top-10 ranking, and might be more useful in a search result. Note that the search results continue to stream in and update the top results, but most of the lower-page-size pages do not rank in the top 10, so the search appears faster than if we did not update the UI until everything returned. 70% of the final search results were in the first 670K embeddings, which in total rendered in 116 milliseconds (note the topk timing at the bottom left, which counts distance calculations as positive times and topk calculations as negative times): Note that changing the facet for the onomatopoeia search (changing the first letter of the page to return) avoided running a new embedding, and returned in under 25ms. Changing the number of results from top 10 to top 20 or top 100 is similarly instantaneous. 200k embeddings and page titles compress down to 10MB in Arrow The database is small enough to support casual use cases of up to a million embeddings without special treatment. Note that, for high performance, we use Arrow instead of JSON. Arrow can store our 8-bit integer product quantization arrays compactly, and Arrow can store an array of strings as an array of indexes into one buffer, which is a significant savings over a million Javascript string objects. These ONNX models run in WASM for now There is no GPU acceleration, only WebAssembly, so far. ONNX is a convenient compile target. WebGPU is still very new, and is an eagerly-anticipated future direction. Step 1: embed all of Wikipedia with a sentence transformer There are a lot of sentence transformers to choose from! There is a leaderboard of sentence embeddings: https://huggingface.co/blog/mteb The all-minilm-l6-v2 model has reasonable performance https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 and is small and available in ONNX weights https://huggingface.co/Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/ for transformers.js https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js . Step 2: use product quantization to compress embeddings 6M pages * 384-dimension embeddings * 32-bit floats is over 9GB. Even a million embeddings in float16 precision is 800MB. This is too large for casual usage. As a first approximation, to choose the top million, one approach would be to choose the pages with the most information: compress each page and see the number of bytes that come out. Lists would be overrepresented (lists are less compressible than general text), there’s no appreciation of the link structure of webpages, but it’s cheap to compute and easy to start with. FAISS (https://faiss.ai) is a highly popular embedding search engine serverside, with a lot of tuning knobs for creating different styles of search indices. Autofaiss (https://github.com/criteo/autofaiss) will usually recommend using Product Quantization, after creating IVF indices or HNSW indices (Pinecone has a great intro to vector indexing https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-indexes/). Product quantization is exceptionally simple to implement: creating a ‘distance table’ is under 5 lines of numpy and using that to find distances is a one-liner. Intermezzo: faceted search Often times, you will want to search in some product subcategories, like finding only PDFs in a web search, or results in ancient Latin. Splitting up the distance computation from computing a top-10 ranking allows us to fudge the distances in flight before ranking. For million-scale search, this is highly feasible. In this search of Wikipedia, there is one search facet: the first character of the page. Because the top-k ranking is separate from distance computation we can avoid recomputing query embeddings and distances to explore different facet values in real time. Step 3: hand-write ONNX ONNX has a specific opcode that does exactly the product quantization step! That opcode is GatherElements. Unfortunately, the PyTorch ONNX export does not use this special opcode for the model as written. Thankfully, there is abundant support for reading and writing ONNX outside of a PyTorch compilation step. A useful graphical editing tool for ONNX is ONNX-modifier, at https://github.com/ZhangGe6/onnx-modifier , which presents a friendly interface to add elements into the dataflow graph of any exported ONNX model. By taking the multiple steps in the PyTorch model that gets compiled to ONNX, and replacing all of those with one ONNX opcode, distance computation is roughly 4x faster. Step 4: export numpy to Arrow As mentioned, the Arrow format is much more compact in memory and much more compact on disk to store the embeddings and the metadata (page titles). Because the Arrow array format only stores one-dimensional data, and because we have 48 dimensions of embedding data, and because we do not want to store embedding data wrapped in another data format, we need two separate schemas, one for the metadata (with a hundred thousand rows each), and one for the embeddings (with a hundred thousand * 48 rows each), and we reshape the embeddings at load time. Storing the product quantization codebook in JSON is under 1.0MB, so it is less crucial to optimize this part. Step 5: let me know what you think 🙂 Lots of the library functions in the full Wikipedia search app should migrate into reusable pq.js components. A lot of the ONNX shapes are pre-baked, so it would be useful to support different quantization levels and different embedding dimensions. Give a shout!

(Far more popular but less accurate items were populated above it -- e.g. no matter what I typed trying to define a specific modality of psychotherapy, \"psychotherapy\" was always the #1 result.)In contrast, I&#x27;ve used ChatGPT to identify the names of certain niche subfields when I couldn&#x27;t remember what they were called, and it was right every time.I love the idea of an AI service specifically designed to identify the names of things from descriptions. But I don&#x27;t think restricting it to Wikipedia (or Wikipedia page titles) is the right approach, and it seems like general-purpose LLM&#x27;s are doing a great job.Still, as a proof of concept and as something you can run locally in the browser, this is extremely cool. reply lsb 6 hours agoparentThanks! The goal was to demo the database engine and show off how everything can work airgapped (after the browser downloads everything). I think there’s a lot of parameters to tune (Use just the first paragraph of the article, or everything? Search within some short distance of a particular article?) and I haven’t yet.Wikipedia is a great demo dataset, and I’m definitely up for adding more datasets. Specifically, just like iPhoto lets you search “mountain” and you can get pictures with mountains, might be cool to search with some multi modal models like CLIP on various datasets reply PartiallyTyped 12 hours agoparentprevI have found myself describing ideas and goals, and getting back a field, or rather the name of it and certain keywords to look for. It seems that LLMs are the best fuzzy search engines and work in a rather unique though possibly complementary way to traditional search engines. reply googlryas 13 hours agoprevI like the concept, but I&#x27;m not having much luck. I entered \"weird looking monkey\", hoping to get Proboscis, golden snub nosed, etc, but I just end up with the articles \"Pet monkey\",\"List of individual monkeys\", \"Ethnoprimatology\", \"Monkey\".Whereas when I type the same query into google, I get exactly what I expected. Which is kind of disappointing, I was hoping to find out about some weird looking monkeys that I didn&#x27;t know about. reply lsb 10 hours agoparentYeah it’s an off the shelf sentence-transformer model from over a year ago. The demo was more to show off the embedding database, but the embeddings themselves are slightly useful too.I don’t keep any analytics on the page about what people find and don’t find, so I haven’t set myself up to improve the search results :&#x2F; reply pizza 3 hours agorootparentFWIW sentence-transformers truncates the input to at most 256 tokens by default; you might just be embedding the first paragraph or so. reply kikokikokiko 11 hours agoparentprevWikipedia editors&#x2F;guidelines are generally not in favor of \"opinionated\" adjectives, and the use of \"weird looking\" in your query sounds a lot like something that would be frowned upon on a wikipedia article. This makes it hard for your search to retrieve good results on this corpus of knowledge. reply kristopolous 4 hours agorootparentCouldn&#x27;t someone pretty easily merge it with something more informal?For instance, Reddit data dump (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academictorrents.com&#x2F;details&#x2F;7c0645c94321311bb05bd87...), filter for Wikipedia links, include a context of the thread, combine that with the contents of the article reply znagengast 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also largely dependent on the embeddings model as others have mentioned. Even if wikipedia doesn&#x27;t have any words specifically referring to that monkey as \"weird\", the model itself would know to correlate this monkey&#x27;s embeddings with the \"weird\" concept. The main issue with this particular implementation is the model used (all-minilm-l6-v2) which is designed for speed and efficiency over accuracy. reply dougb5 12 hours agoprevReally nice implementation! And it&#x27;s so cool to be able to do this offline. The embeddings aren&#x27;t quite there yet.One trick that might be helpful is to embed only the defining (usually the first) sentence or paragraph of the Wikipedia article, rather than the whole document -- not clear to me which portion you&#x27;re using now.My own site, OneLook, has had a similar feature (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onelook.com&#x2F;thesaurus&#x2F;) since &#x27;03 that lets you find words and concepts by description. It was a pure reverse-dictionary search back when I started, but over the past two decades I&#x27;ve explored word embeddings, then sentence embeddings, and more recently LLMs. Nowadays it uses GPT to generate some guesses for inputs that it can&#x27;t answer itself.LLMs are so much better than earlier methods at this task, it&#x27;s taken some of the wind out of my sails on improving this aspect of OneLook. I frequently hear from people for whom reverse-definition lookups are the main reason they use ChatGPT! reply kemayo 11 hours agoprevThe page is currently failing to work for me, because `model_quantized.onnx` isn&#x27;t loading -- I&#x27;m watching it and it has currently managed to get 19.2MB downloaded (at ~50KB&#x2F;sec) as I type this, so if every visitor is triggering that...I think we may be doing awful things to Lee Butterman&#x27;s bandwidth bill. reply lsb 10 hours agoparentIt’s static files on one t2.nano! Who knows. reply mcint 10 hours agorootparentLooks like it would help to use a (free) CDN for the static files. You could set up a subdomain that provides caching access to the base site. reply do-me 2 hours agoprevVery nice work! We are working on a similar project called SemanticFinder and might have some common interests. You copy & paste any text of any length in the tool, embeddings are calculated for a particular segment length and it returns the most similar segments, all in the browser with transformers.js.

Such pre-indexed examples are super fast, see e.g.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;geo.rocks&#x2F;semanticfinder&#x2F;ipcc&#x2F;Would love to cooperate on some things and share ideas! reply marginalia_nu 13 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s incredibly impressive for what it does, but the results don&#x27;t seem very good.Although I know from experience it&#x27;s really difficuly to assess search result quality by hand, you can be very close to something great and return far worse matches than this does. reply lovasoa 13 hours agoprevThe tech is very impressive but the results are not.I searched \"pointy building in Paris\", and got :Tourism in Paris, Bourse de commerce (Paris), Grands Projets of François Mitterrand, List of tallest buildings and structures in the Paris region, List of tourist attractions in Paris, Palais des congrès de Paris, Landmarks in Paris, Palais de la Bourse, Lyon, Outline of Paris, Architecture of Parisno mention of the most famous pointy building in Paris...Maybe sentence embedding of the entire article is not the best thing for this kind of application. reply extraduder_ire 12 hours agoparentIf you mean the Eiffel Tower, it&#x27;s not a building.I just checked the article, and of the 19 times the word \"building\" appears, it&#x27;s mostly a verb, followed by \"Chrysler Building\"Unless there&#x27;s some other famously pointy building I&#x27;m not thinking of. reply yorwba 11 hours agorootparenthttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q243 (the Eiffel Tower, which is so famous it gets an extremely small ID) is an instance of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q1440476 (lattice tower), a subclass of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q12518 (tower) a subclass of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wikidata.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Q41176 (building). reply sp332 12 hours agoparentprevAt least 5 of those would have the answer to your question. reply scubbo 8 hours agorootparentBut are not _the_ answer to the question. reply sp332 8 hours agorootparentAs mentioned, it searches embeddings of each sentence in the article.

Power over Data Lines PoDL Types and Classes Detection & Classification Fast Startup Submersible Sensor Node Mechanical Design Backplane PCB PD Function Board PSE Function Board Printable mounting brackets Electronics Assembly & Testing Making late night mistakes Firmware Writing a MS5837 Driver Internal Sensors ADIN1110 Serial Bridge User Interface Final Assembly Field Testing Useful Resources & Thanks A deep dive into Single Pair Ethernet Scott Having used a wide range of field device communications busses from simple 4-20mA, classic serial busses like UART and Modbus, and more modern CAN bus, native USB, and Ethernet options I'm always playing with different transports and protocols to see what solutions make sense in my grab-bag of designs for hardware projects. I first became aware of Single Pair Ethernet when I was mindlessly browsing Sparkfun's new products announcements a while ago, but didn't jump in because I felt the real utility was the ability to power devices over the same cable. More than a year later, Sparkfun's Single Pair Ethernet Design Challenge gave me the excuse to create the hardware I originally wanted, offering a power budget that can handle non-trivial hardware with data rates to match. This write-up summarises my (successful) attempts at building a Power over Data Line (PoDL) compliant device and power supply as part of a one-month 'sink or swim' approach to designing and testing new hardware, and getting to look at maturity of the 10Base-T1 ecosystem. I'll quickly cover some PoDL basics, then walk through the critical design decisions and test process for a prototype underwater sensor node suitable for ocean research. All project files and full schematics are available on GitHub. Why is Single Pair Ethernet interesting? Put simply, it's a step closer to what sounds like my ideal transport: Supports reasonably high data rates (for microcontrollers) at ~10 Mbps, Adds the ability to provide reasonable amounts of power with up to 50W, Has the ability to integrate easily with existing networking stacks, and doesn't over-complicate wiring. As a bonus, Single Pair Ethernet supports long range >1km cable runs which exceed typical Ethernet specifications, and does so while aiming for far lower power consumption. Off to the side, 10Base-T1S has similar goals but is built around a multi-drop half-duplex wiring configuration for shorter distance networks. Power over Data Lines With conventional PoE, two spare pairs are used for power transfer which avoids the need to mix power and data. With SPE+PoDL, the high frequency data signals are low voltage (1.0Vpp or 2.4Vpp) compared to the large DC offset required by PoDL. Add in the fact that a single cable run can be >1km long and some care needs to be taken to correctly couple and decouple data from the power lines. The coupled inductors (differential mode) couple DC supply onto the twisted pair, while the transceiver's data is inductively coupled through the isolation transformer. To reduce common mode noise, a choke filters the input, and it's also a good idea to protect the transceiver from high voltage transients with suitable ESD supression measures (typically TVS diodes). For convenience in the field, the specification allows the conductors to be installed in any orientation. This means that downstream devices need to support reverse polarity power with a rectification or FET based switching arrangement. PoDL Types and Classes Standards develop and change over time as the group and industry work out the details. SPE+PoDL is just as confusing as I expected and has 16 supported power classes and a compatibility matrix between power classes and 10Base-T1S, 10Base-T1L, 100BaseT1, 1000BaseT1. IEEE 802.3bu started by defining several Types of power capable SPE devices A, B, C and D, primarily for automotive use. This included 10 classes for unregulated and regulated 12V and 24V options, along with regulated 48V. Class PD Power Budget (W) PD Vmin PD Vmax Current Limit (mA) 0 0.5 4.94 18 101 1 1 4.41 18 227 2 3 12 18 249 3 5 10.6 18 471 4 1 10.3 36 97 5 3 8.86 36 339 6 5 23.3 36 215 7 10 21.7 36 461 8 30 40.8 60 735 9 50 36.7 60 1360 IEEE 802.3cg later simplified things by adding Type E devices (10Base-T1L only) and another 6 classes of power delivery suitable for ~1-8W devices running with 20-30V (nominally 24V), and a massive 50W when using 54V supplies. Class PD Power Budget (W) PD Vmin PD Vmax Current Limit (mA) 10 1.23 14 30 92 11 3.2 14 30 240 12 8.4 14 30 632 13 7.7 35 58 231 14 20 35 58 600 15 52 35 58 1579 For my typical projects, being able to use 24V with a few watts of power budget is the right balance of capable and practical, so I decided to aim for Class 12 support. When a power supply wants to provide power to a downstream device, it first attempts to detect compliant PD hardware, and then uses a bidirectional communications process called SCCP to classify the device. Detection & Classification Detection is reasonably straightforward - the power supply uses a constant-current source capable of 9-16mA and ensure the open-loop voltage doesn't exceed 5.5V. The downstream device uses this stimulus current to power up a small regulator for it's VID circuitry. Then, it sinks current until the voltage is brought within the specified signature range of 4.05-4.55V. The power supply monitors the power line voltage and can signal to when a valid downstream device is identifying itself correctly. The classification process is more involved, where both sides implement current sinking circuitry for a half-duplex 333bps communications link. The TI SNLA395 appnote explains it reasonably well. Electrically this can be as simple as some resistors and an extra mosfet on each board controlled by a microcontroller, but reference material often includes extra buffering and input protection circuitry. While literature suggest either bit-banging or an SPI peripheral make data transfer easy, I wasn't particularly keen to spend several hundred dollars to buy the specification and then implement a driver to communicate correctly. Looking for alternatives, the Analog Devices LTC9111 is a viable option for adding SCCP to the Type E downstream devices, with the added benefit of simplifying input polarity handling. For ~$5 and a simplified BOM this is probably a pretty easy choice. Unfortunately, a simple supply-side SCCP controller doesn't seem to exist yet, the only option I could find was the incredibly expensive ($20) LTC4296 5-port controller intended for switch style devices. Fast Startup For a fully capable PoDL supply, both detection and classification steps would be implemented. However the standard allows us to only implement detection OR classification and call it 'Fast-start operation'. Given the lower complexity of detection, this was a pretty appealing option. Submersible Sensor Node So now we understand what SPE+PoDL will let us do, lets get into the design. Marine scientists often need to make observations or stimulate the environment. The combination of harsh environmental conditions, specialised hardware, and tricky cross-domain skill-sets needed to develop bespoke hardware presents a special challenge. Did you know: Playing sounds of healthy reefs can help attract marine life to damaged reefs and accelerate recovery processes! A single conductor pair providing power and data over long distances offers some interesting improvements in data rate, reduced power consumption, and simpler (cheaper/lighter) cabling. Building on the Sparkfun MicroMod ecosystem (and hardware provided as part of the design challenge), I'll design replacements for the data-only ADIN1110 function boards which add PoDL capabilities. Then we'll package them in a waterproof enclosure suitable for small sensing payloads as a technology demonstrator. Mechanical Design The electronics need to fit inside a practical waterproof housing, so I let the mechanical design drive the design choices for the electronics stack. I considered building a housing out of PVC pipe with glands and a heaping of potting compound, but found BlueRobotics sell reasonably configurable waterproof housing parts for building custom modules for use on their ROV platforms. As a bonus, STEP models for most of their parts made it pretty easy to plan out the housing and mock up the electronics. I chose the smallest 2″ acrylic tube (~58mm OD) and matching aluminium end-caps. This provides an internal volume constrained by the 50 mm tube diameter and ~118 mm maximum gap between bulkheads. The top cap/bulkhead has 4×M10 threaded holes for accessories as part of BlueRobotic's hardware ecosystem. The prototype uses: 4.5mm Wetlink penetrator for the tether cable 10m, high resolution pressure sensor White indicator LED Pressure relief/test valve Whilst this prototype won't see properly deep water, BlueRobotics suggest this tube configuration should be capable of withstanding 200 meter operation, and far deeper if an aluminium sleeve is used. I created mockup PCB models which I could use for board outlines in KiCAD, and to check how much height was available for the tall parts like SPE connector block and inductors. There's a reasonable amount of room in the tube, but clearances like these usually have a habit of looking larger when being designed on a screen. There are 3 PCB's that need to be designed - the main 'spine' PCB which behaves like a MicroMod compliant carrier board, and the power supply and device variants of the SPE+PoDL communications board. Backplane PCB Acting as the MicroMod 'carrier', this board acts as the tube's electrical spine and provides the processor and function board NGFF (aka M.2) connectors, as well as USB and SWD connectors, a 3.3V regulator, some I2C headers, and breakout pads for expansion IO. The hardest part of designing this board was trying to untangle the supported GPIO across the range of processor boards, and how that's mapped against the function boards. While Sparkfun's documentation and guides normally sit between 'pretty good' and 'excellent', this process was rather tedious. From another (unfinished) project, I already had pretty much the entire range of MicroMod processor boards laying around (ESP32, STM32F405, NRF52840, RP2040, SAMD51, Teensy, Apollo3/Artemis) and wanted the design to support the widest range of targets possible (the whole point of MicroMod). This list of options is cut down substantially if much more than the primary SPI and I2C busses are needed, you want ADIN1110 example library to work, and most processor boards have subtle implementation inconsistencies which turn the pin allocation into a trade-off balancing act. It's a two-layer 46 x 100 mm 1.6 mm 2-layer board with pretty relaxed fabrication requirements, costing under $10 from typical commodity Chinese PCBA fabs. I opted to try the taller 4mm solderable standoff on the rear for sensor mounting and added some spare IO pads and solderable links to make/break the I2C1 bus from the connectors. PD Function Board This function board implements the ADIN1110 SPE transceiver in a similar manner to Sparkfun's function board, but deviates from the dev-kit by adding the necessary coupling network and detection circuitry to act as a Class 10-12 PoDL device aka PD. I won't go into the implementation details around the ADIN1110 or MicroMod edge-connector, but if you're interested the full schematics are in the Git repository. The key areas of discussion are the signature circuitry, and how power is handled once the supply enables full bus voltage. From left to right, we've got a AP7375 wide input voltage LDO which can tolerate bus voltage providing the 3.3V supply to a MCP65R41T comparator with an internal 1.2V internal reference. The voltage divider (R1, R2) is configured to output approximately 1.2V (matching the internal reference voltage) for a 4.05V input voltage. The output of the comparator then controls a simple N-channel mosfet which switches the TL431 shunt regulator on or off, resulting in a regulated voltage which matches the signature voltage range. In bench testing the signature voltage measured on the supply side was ~3.905V, slightly lower than intended. I ended up replacing R2 with 390k to compensate for voltage drop over the rectifier diodes, resulting in a signature voltage of 4.4V. Assuming the detection circuit works correctly, the power supply would then enable the full bus voltage of 24VDC. The TPS26625 eFuse switch is configured to automatically switch on once the input voltage is above the PoDL Class 10-12 minimum voltage specification of 14V. It also provides configurable over-voltage and current limiting which makes a compact layout possible. The 5V regulator is an interesting part - the Texas Instruments TLVM23625 is a tiny, 36V capable, 2.5A switch-mode regulator with an integrated inductor and switch. This was pretty helpful with the constrained layout. The 5V output is used to power the function board's 3.3V LDO, and also back-powers the carrier board. I included a current shunt and amplifier allow for sink-side current measurement on the 5V rail. The resulting layout is reasonably dense, but maintains the same MicroMod Function board dimensions. I tweaked the 5V regulator's feedback network after testing. I was seeing the intended 5.03V regulated voltage, but needed to compensate for the ~0.205V drop over the protection diode. PSE Function Board This board shares the input coupling network and ADIN1110 design with the PD board, but replaces the detection signalling circuitry and bulk regulator with the necessary circuitry to test and detect valid downstream devices. Instead of using the power switch to power up the board when bus voltage is within spec, it's used to switch the HV input on once detection succeeds. Unlike the PD board, managing the detection process does require microcontroller interaction to enable the current source, watch the detection circuit, and then disable the current source before enabling the HV switch. Additionally, maintain full voltage signature (MVFS) behaviour needs the microcontroller to monitor the current sense signal for a minimum peak load of 11mA per 10ms span to keep the power supply active (though this can be set lower if needed). From left to right, a 7V output wide input LDO powers the current stimulus circuit. Instead of building a constant-current source from scratch, I use a NSI50010YT1G LED driver IC which is switched on/off by a P-channel mosfet. This approach is intentionally simple, but probably not ideal as there's limited control over the current output and startup slew-rate. The current source output is protected from the switched 24V output by a diode, and also has a 5.6V zener diode to clamp the output voltage to the specified maximum open-loop voltage of 5.5V. Once the downstream powers up and starts presenting the signature voltage range of 4.05V to 4.55V, the TLV6700 window comparator output provides the microcontroller with the VID_VALID signal. The microcontroller then enables this board's TPS26625 eFuse to pass the 24V input supply to the downstream device. On this board, the eFuse's ULVO and OVP is configured for the Class 10-12 allowable PSE range of 20-30V. I'm a little annoyed with how the detection circuitry part placement and routing turned out, a mix of rushing the design late at night and higher part count made it tricky to fit in the same area as the PD's circuitry. As an aside, this PSE design probably makes more sense as it's own carrier board, or as a media converter to 10BaseT ethernet. Implementing it as a function board allowed for design re-use and opens up some flexibility in final use-cases though. Printable mounting brackets With the boards designed, I brought exported STEP models back into my CAD model and designed a pair of 3D printed board mounts use the 4×M3 internal mounting holes in the bulkheads. The upper bracket abuses the solderable standoffs on the rear of the backplane board as mounting features, along with the key cutout in the PCB to force alignment. Because the mounted electronics need to slide through the tube to meet the other end-cap, a simple tapered groove design is used to retain the PCB once installed. Electronics Assembly & Testing PCBs and printed parts were ordered from China and arrived in South Australia in a pretty impressive 4-days. The components from DigiKey arrived a day or two later. I assembled 2 of each board using a pretty typical paste stencil and reflow plate, with some hot air assisting for heavier parts. Bring-up testing didn't throw any surprises, I started with a lab supply to check the power paths didn't have any critical errors. The PD board eFuse ULVO/OVP behaviour and 5V regulator behaved as expected. The rectifier and decoupling network also handled 24V with either polarity without issue, dropping about 0.4V across the rectifier diodes. Testing the PSE board was similar, checking the current source output with a multimeter, then using the lab supply to provide a 4.2V test voltage to trigger the window comparator's output. I quickly wrote some simple PD detection handling code which uses a state-machine to control the detection behaviour: Enable the current source, Wait for the downstream device to boot, Check the comparator output for VID valid flag (and filter it), Disable the current source, wait a bit, Enable the power switch to enable 24V supply. The scope trace below shows the PoDL bus voltage in yellow (CH1), and the PD board's 5V regulator is the blue trace (CH2). The state-machine timing was intentionally slowed down to make the trace easier to understand. We can see the current source enable, settle at 4.4V for 5ms, then decay once the current source is disabled. Then the 24V switch enables with a nicely controlled slew rate thanks to the eFuse, followed by the 5V regulator cleanly coming up a couple of milliseconds later. This is a successful power up sequence for 24V PoDL! On the data side, I mounted the custom function boards into the MicroMod function carrier and flashed some basic Arduino test sketches to exercise the ADIN1110's self-test loopback. Adin1110 found! Frame Generator/Checker Results: (FG) Sent: 20000 frames (FC) Received: 20000 frames Rx Errors = 0 LEN_ERR_CNT = 0 ALGN_ERR_CNT = 0 SYMB_ERR_CNT = 0 OSZ_CNT = 0 USZ_CNT = 0 ODD_CNT = 0 ODD_PRE_CNT = 0 FALSE_CARRIER_CNT = 0 We can communicate with the MAC over SPI successfully, so that part of the implementation is also working fine! Making late night mistakes At this point, it's rather amazing that the design and implementation has gone almost perfectly to plan... So I tried testing a 6S LiPo battery as my 'field' 24V source instead of my lab supply. I'm sure a few of you reading are seeing where this is going. The inrush spike resulted in the PSE board's onboard (unprotected) 7V LDO being sacrificed to the cause. Hindsight is 20/20 and immediate, so I cobbled together a simple resistor based soft-start circuit and filter from scrap parts to prevent any future mishaps. Also, it was about this time when I noticed I had unfortunately placed the processor board mounting standoff about 1.05mm further than it's intended position. Not a big deal, but incredibly frustrating to see gap between screw and board edge. Firmware With the electronics mostly working without issue, it was time to interface to the test sensors and send some packets. The boards were designed without assuming any specific sensors would be used, but I used these I2C sensors: Temperature & Humidity - SHTC3 via Sparkfun SEN-16467 Motion - LSM6DSO via Sparkfun SEN-18020 Depth/Pressure - MS5837 via BlueRobotics Bar02 The Sparkfun breakouts mount directly to the standoffs on the rear of the backplane board. The Bar02 comes with a JST-GH connector, so I re-terminated it with a JST-SH connector for consistency with the other boards and headers on the backplane PCB. Attempting to avoid any more scope-creep, I opted to use the Arduino ecosystem instead of going bare-metal with my preferred STM32 or ESP32 toolchains. The promise of quick integration with pre-made libraries for the sensors, T1L transciever, and communications protocol was alluring. The project is structured as a simple super-loop which runs some state-machines to handle polling sensors before packing data into packets for transfer over SPE. Writing a MS5837 Driver The very cool MS5837-02 pressure sensor supports absurdly high precision (via oversampling) at rather high sample rates - starting with a base resolution of 0.11 mbar at 1.5kHz and 0.016 mbar at ~60Hz. Converting the pressure resolution into a more understandable unit puts the absurdity of this sensor into context: 0.016 mbar equates to a depth change of roughly 0.16 millimeters in sea water. 160 μm! Unfortunately, the BlueRobotics Arduino driver only supports the maximum oversampling (OSR = 8192) setting and forces a 40ms blocking delay... I implemented a generic C library to work with the MS5837-02, letting the integrating developer take back some control over configuration and sampling behaviour. This approach allows the library to be used with a simple state-machine or with RTOS style yields. // FreeRTOS example task uint16_t wait_us = 0; // Measurement request function returns a microsecond duration // which we need to wait out before attempting to read the sample. // Request a pressure reading wait_us = ms5837_start_conversion( &sensor, SENSOR_PRESSURE, OSR_8192 ); vTaskDelay( pdMS_TO_TICKS(wait_us/1000) ); ms5837_read_conversion( &sensor ); // Request temperature reading wait_us = ms5837_start_conversion( &sensor, SENSOR_TEMPERATURE, OSR_2048 ); vTaskDelay( pdMS_TO_TICKS(wait_us/1000) ); ms5837_read_conversion( &sensor ); // Once pressure and temp are sampled, run the conversion function ms5837_calculate( &sensor ); float pressure = ms5837_pressure_mbar( &sensor ); float temperature = ms5837_temperature_celcius( &sensor ); While the temperature is needed for the 2nd order pressure compensation maths, I didn't see any downside from reducing the temperature oversampling slightly which also allows for quicker turnaround time. My driver is a simple open-sourced and available standalone on GitHub. Internal Sensors The SHTC3 and LSM6DS0 Arduino libraries were better behaved, and I was able to throw together a reasonable implementation sampling the IMU's FIFO buffer reasonably easily. ADIN1110 Serial Bridge At the start of the project I wanted to implement proper TCP/IP support via LwIP to connect the sensor node directly to a normal Ethernet network through a media converter, but the lack of integration examples and diminishing amount of time meant I knew I would run out of time during debugging. Maybe next time! Building off Sparkfun's reasonably thin sfe_spe_advanced wrapper around Analog Device's library, I was able to send raw buffers of bytes between the transcievers with fairly minimal effort. Because I'm familiar with the protocol (and wrote the library) I was able to connect the electricui-embedded read and write callbacks, and setup the power-supply side MicroMod process to act as a nearly transparent SPE-to-Serial proxy. The fact that a 10 Mbps networked node was constrained by a 10x slower serial link (912600 baud) was slightly amusing, but will hopefully be an area I can address with a bit more time in the future. User Interface I'm using Electric UI's DataFlow and DataTransformer system to calculate real-time wave height statistics on the stream of depth sensor data. Turns out wave analysis and meaningful visualisations are slightly non-trivial, so I'll probably write a second post going into greater depth. As a quick overview: Filter the incoming pressure measurement stream to reduce noise, Calculate the rate of depth change (derivative), Detect peak and troughs, and the time between them, Average the midpoint height of detected waves to create a long-running reference depth, Generate a histogram to show wave behaviour relative to the reference depth. These statistics are data-loggable alongside the raw sensor streams. Thanks to reasonably easy export from the CAD packages, we have a high quality 3D model of the tube and custom electronics just sitting there... A quick trip through Blender to perform Planar Decimation helps bring the model complexity down from ~2M tris to a couple hundred thousand, and we export the file as a gltf. It's pretty easy to then import and use with ThreeJS. Final Assembly With firmware running and the boards finished, it was time to mount the PoDL PD function board, ESP32 MicroMod processor, and internal sensor breakouts to the backplane board. Also pictured is the vanity APA102-2020 LED rings which were intended to act as an adjustable mock load to test the power delivery components. The printed mount was then screwed to the aluminium cap, where I had already installed the 2-core tether cable and external sensors. After a bit of cable management, the assembly was suspended in the acrylic sleeve and the bottom cap carefully aligned to retain the backplane PCB. Once assembled, I removed the pressure-relief valve stem and attached a vacuum pump to perform a leak test. Overall, I'm pretty happy with how everything turned out, just wished I had a bit more time for refinement! Field Testing We tested the tube in a pool briefly to check buoyancy. During the early mechanical design stages I created a simple spreadsheet to estimate the assembly mass and displacement from first-principles which suggested additional ballast weight was not needed (slightly negatively buoyant). In the real-world it was slightly positively buoyant and could use a bit of extra weight. Being the natural over-achiever (and qualified diver) that he is, my colleague Michael suggested we should give it real-world test. We drove down to a popular dive reef with good jetty access to test the sensor node. By stitching some velcro lengths to each side of some printed mounting clamps, it provided a fairly easily removable and non-invasive mounting solution that could be handled underwater. If the sensor node was deployed for longer periods of time, a more carefully designed mount would be necessary. I think we got the tick of approval from the locals.

Just like with other Ethernet protocols, the lowest frequency of comms is basically DC; it&#x27;s only statistically brought above that by the scrambler, but there&#x27;s no useful true lower bound. Having an order of magnitude more separation, such as it is, allows a more reasonably sized filter to stomp over less (ideally, approximately none) of the data.2) Only the 1 Gb protocol includes FEC, 100 Mb is a simpler, non-error-correcting encoding. This means that even though the maximum frequency on the twisted pair goes up by an order of magnitude to ~660 MHz, requiring better cabling, better twist spacing, etc... it allows a \"sloppier\" job at both high and low frequencies, since the FEC really does hide a few errors. This can be spent on even worse filters for PoDL, on frequency-specific interference (e.g. an RF amp running nearby), etc.Basically, I was surprised to find that 1 Gb was not only not more challenging at the system design level, it was often simpler. (I haven&#x27;t played with 10 Mb in either of its two incarnations seriously yet.) reply gumby 17 hours agoparent> PoDL is substantially lighter, smaller, and simpler (though not necessarily cheaper) at 1 Gb than at 100 Mb,This was one of those wonderful \"oh of course\" points for me: when you read something and it&#x27;s blindingly obvious, but until reading it my intuition pointed the other way (easier to deal with lower frequencies rather than unnecessarily high data rates). reply wmf 17 hours agoparentprevPoDL = Power over Data Line.

In a lot of cases you can rely on your hardware for this. Watchdog Timers are specifically intended for this. You set up a watchdog when you deploy the device and your software has to periodically \"pet\" the watchdog or the system triggers some action. In practice this is used to verify that the software never gets stuck or else it triggers a recovery&#x2F;restart sequence and maybe sends out an alert.

Scott put a hell of a lot of effort into planning and design, making sure in the end we could get what we needed out of the hardware. During the process, there&#x27;s a constant stream of problems that are fixed or worked around in pursuit of the end goal. One nice thing about this kind of project is the scope is fixed and known, and scope creep won&#x27;t happen. We can build safe guards for attaining the known scope instead of predicting future scope creep. Originally we wanted a turbidity sensor in there as well, but we just didn&#x27;t have the time to get it working.On one of the boards we reflowed, something happened with the solder paste (it was probably a bit old) and it started exploding (in a small way), sending components flying across the board. Scott had to jump in with tweezers and put stuff back in real time on the hot plate. Unfortunately I had the macro shot set up for the other side of the board so I didn&#x27;t get to capture it.Shooting the top down macro shots, it would take literally 6+ minutes for the rig to stop wobbling visually in the footage, so every top down shot is 6+ minutes of swaying footage before the action. It took so long we only did a couple of these shots.We thought it would be very dark underwater, and brought a camera that could do 12800 ISO base, but it turned out it was actually surprisingly bright on the day, and we ended up way down at ISO 640 for the shoot.We couldn&#x27;t get the camera to focus underwater when zoomed to a focal length of 70mm, so there&#x27;s a whole setup of footage that just didn&#x27;t work. But since everything had already been shot at 35mm, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal in the scheme of things.The camera rig was incredibly buoyant underwater, I had to steal weights from our other divers just so I could get neutrally buoyant.> Why not make \"the perfect espresso machine\" or \"the perfect bike\" or whatever? Why not, with your skills, make a thing and fucking sell it?I think I can sum up my personal drive as \"I like making things\", essentially no matter what the thing is, be it hardware or software. I saw that \"inventor\" character in the movies, and that&#x27;s who I wanted to be growing up. In most engineering jobs you&#x27;d probably be happy to spend 20% of your time making stuff, with the other 80% spent in paperwork. We&#x27;re trying our best to flip those percentages for ourselves.We&#x27;ve worked on several projects with hardware together over the years. From multicopters, to camera gimbals, to an entire space ship set for a short film. Time and time again, we found ourselves building user interfaces from scratch, and that was amongst the hardest parts. So we figured maybe there&#x27;s a business here, and we started Electric UI - tooling for engineers to build user interfaces for their products, both during development and for production. Selling software must be easier than hardware, right?It turns out it&#x27;s unfathomably difficult to market products effectively to the right audience, especially if you don&#x27;t have millions of dollars to blow on targeted advertising. We&#x27;re constantly seeing the success stories of good marketing and we intrinsically don&#x27;t see the thousands of shots that didn&#x27;t work out. There&#x27;s just a lot of luck involved, hitting the right people at the right times, even assuming you have perfect product-market fit.We figured our best chance is to go back to our roots and just build stuff that we find interesting, and document the process. Hopefully people will come along for the ride, and other engineers out there will see our user interface software and the next time they&#x27;re building something that could use a UI, they&#x27;ll think of us. reply Timon3 16 hours agoparentprevMight I suggest using an ffmpeg frontend like HandBrake?

Or silicone cables that end up in stagnant water, which can dissolve them (don&#x27;t ask me about specifics, but it&#x27;s a hotbed of issues in PV power plants). Or people not burying their cables deep enough, i.e. below the frost line, and the ground freezing over killing the cables.Outdoor wiring is fun for everyone involved. If anyone here wants to deal with that crap, please read up on using the correct cable for the job, and FFS have a certified electrician sign off on the grounding of such cables and surge arrestor designs and installation. reply peterleiser 18 hours agorootparentI worried about all of these things before installing 8 outdoor security cameras using PoE. The system is in a rural area with lots of critters and 100+ degree summers. I used direct burial & outdoor cabling but left it above ground and in some cases strung from pole to pole. It&#x27;s been 3 years and the only issue was 2 cameras shorted at the \"waterproof\" Ethernet jack connector on the camera.This was not mission critical so I just \"went for it\" and it worked out. It was a great payoff since it only took 2 days to mount all the cameras and lay the cables. It would have taken much longer to dig trenches and put the cables in buried pipes. I treated it like a prototype and figured I would improve later based on actual problems that came up.I did make sure all of the boxes with wire connections, power supplies, and PoE switches were in waterproof boxes and I used silicone sealer where cables entered the boxes.

So 4 bits of data get turned into 3 symbols, each symbol being either negative voltage, positive voltage, or zero voltage, and then the symbols are transmitted at 7.5MHz.Something to note is that it has a much lower bandwidth requirement than 10BASE-T, because 10BASE-T uses manchester encoding with two symbols per bit (either 01 or 10).

The SPE standards are designed to make things easier for automotive and industrial applications, and they seem fine. Automotive needs are not the same as industrial needs, so flexibility in the standards allows them to meet the specific needs of each application better. It also allows them to remove unnecessary weight and complexity. Weight reduction is one of the main reasons automotive is interested in SPE.SPE has no obvious advantages for home users over something like Monoprice&#x27;s Micro SlimRun cables, which are extremely thin and flexible, for example. So, it makes sense that they haven&#x27;t put effort into giving it cool branding like \"WiFi 7\".[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=35074023 reply aeyes 18 hours agorootparent> SPE has no obvious advantages for home users over something likeIt does, I already have a single twisted pair running in the walls of a building where it is hard to run new cables but I can&#x27;t get more than 100Mb&#x2F;s at the moment.Using existing wiring is always a use case, a lot of people use MoCA or PLC because they can&#x27;t run new cables for whatever reason.But as you said, unfortunately SPE is strictly for industrial applications at the moment and there is no affordable product for consumers. reply wolrah 18 hours agorootparent> It does, I already have a single twisted pair running in the walls of a building where it is hard to run new cables but I can&#x27;t get more than 100Mb&#x2F;s at the moment.The 100mbit and gigabit variants of SPE require higher grade cabling than their multi-pair counterparts. 1000BaseT1 requires Cat6A, which would normally be needed for 10 gigabit. It is very unlikely that you have a single pair of Cat6A grade wiring available, or that anyone does anywhere.They&#x27;re not really for reusing existing wiring, they&#x27;re for reducing wire count in new harnesses in automotive, aerospace, and other applications where size&#x2F;lightness matters.The 10 mbit SPE varieties on the other hand, those are more closely targeted at reusing existing wiring, but they mean the sort of wiring that might have previously carried CAN or other common control bus. reply addaon 18 hours agorootparentprev> SPE has no obvious advantages for home users over something like Monoprice&#x27;s Micro SlimRun cables, which are extremely thin and flexible, for example.PoDL does have real advantages over PoE.

The two varieties let you pick between long distances (10BaseT1L) or the ability to connect multiple devices to a single network segment like old school coax ethernet (10BaseT1S). There are also use cases for the short range variant internal to machines, where it can in many cases run over the same harness one might have run CAN over.The 100 megabit and gigabit variants don&#x27;t care about existing wiring, they&#x27;re there to move a lot of data over as few wires as possible so harnesses can be light, thin, flexible, cheap, take your pick. Automotive infotainment and high bandwidth industrial sensors are the obvious target markets.You aren&#x27;t expected to ever need to mix and match between these variants. While more than one could plausibly be found in the same system it&#x27;d be rare for there to be any need to mix and match hardware between the different forms.

What Will the Supreme Court Do? Civil forfeiture is a highly unaccountable practice. The justices have the opportunity to make it a bit less so. BILLY BINION7.11.2023 7:00 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Reddit Share by email Print friendly version Copy page URL (Illustration: Lex Villena; Matthew Benoit ) Gerardo Serrano and Stephanie Wilson may have little in common. But there is at least one major tie that binds them: The government seized their vehicles, never charged either of them with a crime, and, most pertinently, made them wait years before resolving their cases. It is not uncommon for victims of civil forfeiture—the practice that allows law enforcement to take people's assets without having to prove the owner was guilty of a crime—to endure protracted delays before they have the opportunity to even step foot in a courtroom and defend themselves. The U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear Culley v. Attorney General of Alabama and decide if those who find themselves in that situation are entitled to a probable cause hearing after the seizure and, if so, how speedily it must happen. That the highest court in the country has to rule on whether people get such a hearing is an apt indictment of how unaccountable civil forfeiture has become. Serrano's case is instructive. In September 2015, while traveling to Mexico, he stopped at the border in Eagle Pass, Texas, to take pictures. That upset some Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents, who demanded he surrender the password to his cellphone. Serrano refused. The agents then searched his new Ford F-250 truck, found five stray bullets, and accused him of smuggling \"munitions of war.\" Serrano had a concealed carry permit, and there was no firearm in his vehicle. The officers confiscated his car anyway. But the fragile nature of the allegation didn't matter, because it would never be subject to scrutiny. The government didn't press charges. They did, however, keep his vehicle for two years, without holding a hearing where he could contest the seizure—or without ever filing a formal forfeiture complaint. The dearth of due process protections was devastating. Serrano paid the government $3,800—10 percent of the car's value—as a requirement to fight the move in federal court; he was met with more radio silence, even after the feds cashed the check. A Kentucky resident, he subsequently spent thousands of dollars on rental cars while his vehicle sat halfway across the country, locked in a Texas parking lot. Serrano never got that hearing, which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled was fine. The federal government mysteriously changed its tune after two years went by—only when Serrano filed a lawsuit, represented by the Institute for Justice (I.J.), the libertarian-leaning public interest law firm. But as I.J., Serrano, and Wilson write in a recent amicus brief to the Supreme Court, the majority of innocent property owners do not have the resources to file a major class-action suit in order to coerce the government into returning their assets. It is almost always the government, in fact, that has the leverage to do the coercing, which they use to deter property owners from reclaiming what is theirs. One important tool at its disposal: delaying any hearings. Top Stories 01:12 Arkansas Social Media Age Verification Law Likely Violates First Amendment Wilson knows first-hand. In 2019, over the span of less than six months, police in Detroit seized two of her cars after alleging that her ex-boyfriend and the father of her child was a petty drug offender. Wilson, a nursing student, was not suspected of wrongdoing, no arrests were made, and cops did not find drugs or guns in either of her vehicles. They proceeded forthwith. In the first instance, Wilson attempted three times, unsuccessfully, to fight the seizure: She was initially told she was too early to file a claim of interest on the car; on the second try, the government couldn't locate her paperwork; by the third try, she had missed a deadline, precluding her from further fighting for her car. After the second seizure, almost two years went by before Wilson was permitted to go before a judge, who sided with her. The government would not get to keep another one of her vehicles. It was not for lack of trying. Detroit is a fitting case study of how byzantine the process of contesting a forfeiture has become. Before any victim is allowed to state their case, and only after they have successfully filed that claim of interest on their property, they must attend four in-person \"pre-trial\" conferences where prosecutors put a \"deal\" on the table: The owner may have their property back if they pay the government a fixed fee. In Wilson's case, she would have to buy her own car back for $1,800, not including storage and towing fees, an offer she declined at every conference. She couldn't afford it. Those meetings happen during the workday; if victims are unable to skirt professional commitments that conflict with any of the conferences, the government lays claim to their property, and the victim can no longer contest the seizure. Wilson is named in a suit challenging those practices, which was argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in May. The court's decision is yet to be released. But in her case, and in similar cases across the country, the government has a considerable stake in upholding the status quo. You don't have to look very far to figure out what it is. Law enforcement agencies typically pocket the majority of the proceeds from civil forfeiture seizures. As of 2020, Wilson's home state, Michigan, along with 24 others—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming—direct 95 percent to 100 percent of the funds extracted from seizures toward law enforcement, according to the I.J. report Policing for Profit. The federal government, which targeted Serrano, is also in that category, funneling money to either the Department of Justice or the Department of the Treasury. An additional seven states—Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Washington—send 80 percent to 95 percent of the proceeds to law enforcement. Several more fall below that threshold but still benefit handsomely from forfeitures, which in part explains why governments are loath to change course. Law enforcement agencies bolster their budgets with forfeiture funds in interesting ways. A 2017 report from the Philadelphia Weekly found that police used the money to purchase, among other things, submachine guns, uniform embroidery, web design services, and a lawn mower, along with tens of thousands of dollars in cash withdrawals. (Forfeiture money also went toward satisfying someone's parking ticket.) In 2021, law enforcement in Georgia were revealed to have spent the money illegally on furniture, Fitbits, gym paraphernalia, and vehicles. In police seminars a few years back, session leaders offered suggestions for what sort of property to target based on cops' wishlists, which included flat-screen televisions—those \"are very popular with the police departments,\" one government employee said on video—along with cash and cars (the nicer the better). Indeed, governments across the U.S. collectively take billions of dollars each year in forfeitures. Between 2002 and 2018, according to the I.J. report, people forfeited at least $63 billion. That stratospheric figure woefully undercounts the actual total, as only 20 states and the feds provided data for that time frame. So it's not surprising, then, that the government opposes even modest measures of accountability and due process—something as simple as a hearing—when they come across people like Serrano and Wilson. Deprived of the ability to formally and publicly air the cases against them, which are often less than flimsy, the government can pressure victims into giving up their assets entirely or accepting a \"deal\" like the $1,800 offer Wilson received. Such settlements are common. Consider the case of Carl Nelson and Amy Sterner Nelson, from whom the FBI seized almost $1 million in May 2020 after alleging Carl, who formerly worked as a real estate transaction manager for Amazon, had participated in an illegal kickback scheme with developers. (He was never charged with a crime.) Following the seizure, the family sold their car and their West Seattle house, liquidated their retirement, and temporarily moved with their four daughters into Amy's sister's basement. In February 2022, the FBI and the Nelsons agreed to settle: Out of the $892,000 the government took, it would give back $525,000. Carl and Amy would forfeit $109,000, with the rest of the sum eaten by court fees. Getting $525,000 back is certainly better than nothing, but losing about $367,000 can hardly be called a bargain. Serrano, Wilson, and the Nelsons all saw around two years go by before their forfeiture cases were resolved. But even that is not exhaustive. In 2013, police in Indiana seized Tyson Timbs' Land Rover after arresting him for selling drugs to undercover cops. His car—which he had purchased a few months prior for about $42,000—was not connected with drug money. He bought it with his father's life insurance payout. Perhaps more importantly, Timbs, who has a history of drug addiction and relapsed after his dad died, turned his life around post-arrest. But law enforcement would still spend the next eight years fighting for the right to keep his car—a reminder that civil forfeiture has little to do with crippling crime and more to do with making the government richer. Timbs' case provides a particularly vivid illustration of that motive. In the struggle to keep his Land Rover, the state of Indiana argued multiple times that it should be able to take ownership of someone's car for going five mph over the speed limit. That is not parody, although when the solicitor general made that argument in 2018 in front of the Supreme Court, it was reportedly met with laughter from some of the justices. The state also submitted that law enforcement should be able to seize everything you own if you're suspected of committing a drug offense; that there should be no proportionality. The Indiana Supreme Court rejected that in 2021. Many people, however, do not have the time and financial resources to fight their cases for months or years on end as they hope for, say, a hearing—which is evident in the billions of dollars the government successfully pockets each year via civil forfeiture. And if a victim is able to wade through the bureaucracy and finally get his or her day in court, it is not guaranteed they will be able to find representation. In April 2015, cops in Indiana seized about $10,000 cash from Terry Abbott after he sold drugs to a confidential informant. A little more than three years passed, and in July 2018, the government moved for summary judgment in the case. Abbott intended to fight the seizure, but he had a problem: The government had taken his money, which he needed to pay an attorney. While defendants are constitutionally entitled to a lawyer in criminal proceedings, civil forfeiture is a civil proceeding, as its name suggests, and thus that constitutional protection no longer applies—despite that the practice is used when police suspect someone of a crime, and that its stated purpose is hamstringing criminal activity. So Abbott had to represent himself. It's a quandary many civil forfeiture defendants confront. \"If you can't afford to defend yourself, let alone feed yourself, it becomes complicated,\" Amy Nelson told me last year, which captures just how coercive the forfeiture process is and how few options people have. But the first step is getting before a judge at all. When the Supreme Court hears Culley next term, they will consider the facts of two cases, both centered around innocent people whose cars were confiscated in Alabama. In one, police seized Halima Culley's vehicle after they arrested her son—who had borrowed the car—for marijuana possession and drug paraphernalia. In the other, cops took Lena Sutton's vehicle after she let a friend, who was found with methamphetamine, use it to run an errand. Sutton would go on to wait over a year before her car was returned; Culley was barred from reclaiming her property for 20 months. No matter the Court's ruling, the government will still have the upper hand in civil forfeiture proceedings. But the justices have an opportunity to blow over one of the many cards stacked against the people and to send the government a reminder: that due process is a right, not a privilege.

The Burglary side says it takes place when people are absent, but then says it&#x27;s a violent crime (and shows one person punching another). I get it&#x27;s probably a legal definition of \"violent\" or something, but in that case showing an image of one person punching another is somewhat misleading... reply zerocrates 15 hours agorootparentBurglary isn&#x27;t necessarily&#x2F;traditionally a violent crime. Crime stats usually report it as a non-violent property crime, though there are parts of federal law that treat it as violent or similarly to violent crimes. It doesn&#x27;t have violence as an element of the crime, but breaking into peoples&#x27; houses obviously sets the stage for more violent encounters.Robbery on the other hand is by definition a violent crime, the threat of violence is what distinguishes it from other forms of theft or larceny. reply dmoy 15 hours agorootparentGeneral data from the US for burglary depends on the source, yea.If you look at victim data it&#x27;s roughly it&#x27;s 3 million burglaries per year, about 1&#x2F;3 of which are home invasions. And about 1&#x2F;4 of those (so 1&#x2F;12 of total) are also violent crimes where the resident is injured.But then when it comes time to report crime stats some stuff gets partitioned off into other buckets (I guess to avoid double counting? Idk). So e.g. some sources will take those 250k assaults-during-burglary and not count them as burglaries.It gets really confusing really fast. reply bdowling 14 hours agorootparentprevRobbery and burglary are both considered inherently dangerous crimes for which the felony murder rule can be applied. That means that if someone dies (victim, perpetrator or bystander) during a burglary or robbery, then the perpetrators can be charged with murder.Also, I’d add that robbery can be done by trick instead of threat of violence. E.g., a robber tricks victim into handing over their wallet or purse, then distracts them while they remove valuables. The victim may not even know they’ve been robbed until later. If the victim, later noticing she has been robbed, then has a heart attack and dies, however, then the robber could potentially be charged with felony murder. reply r3trohack3r 15 hours agorootparentprev> Robbery on the other hand is by definition a violent crime, the threat of violence is what distinguishes it from other forms of theft or larceny.This is exactly it for me.When I first read that the TSA would report you to the DEA for carrying large sums of cash into an airport, and the DEA would intercept you and seize it, I’ve been referring to it as armed robbery.When the DEA asks you to hand over the $10k in your backpack, they’re doing it under threat of violence. It’s armed robbery, they just haven’t “drawn their gun yet.”Try sticking to “I’m sorry sir, you can not have my money” and you’ll quickly see what the full weight of the U.S. Government looks like when escalated against you.From the time they decided they wanted your money, it was theirs. reply EGreg 14 hours agorootparentprevThe bottom right of that slide says \"victims are absent\", then proceeds to show someone violently attacking a victim. Pretty self-contradictory.The entire right side seems to be trying to redefine what \"Burglary\" means in everyday English. It means people stealing things, without the victims finding out right away, and without intimidating or threatening anyone.The definition is completely overbroad, and seems like it&#x27;s done with some agenda. Someone \"entering with intent to commit a crime\" is not always burglary, for example someone intending to defecate in a hallway or spray graffiti in the bathroom is not a burglar. reply jkubicek 18 hours agoprevSeverely limiting the scope of civil forfeiture seems like one of those political issues that everyone across the political spectrum can agree on.I&#x27;m constantly hearing horror stories like the ones in this article and I&#x27;ve never heard any reasonable defense of our current system. In fact, I&#x27;ve never even heard an unreasonable defense. reply banannaise 16 hours agoparentGenerally speaking, the political argument against is \"If you do anything that gives even the appearance of curtailing police powers in any way, we will create the illusion of a crime wave, attribute it to you, and absolutely hammer every form of media with that narrative.\" (If, God help you, you manage to pass a law that actually curtails police powers, they&#x27;ll generally act in open defiance instead of doing their jobs.)The opponent here isn&#x27;t other citizens, it&#x27;s the police and their organizations (police benevolent associations, police unions, etc.) which wield considerable political power, and to an extent also legal power (since they collectively have nearly full discretion over what laws are enforced and by what means, to the extent they can cooperate amongst themselves). reply DebtDeflation 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not just an empty threat either. It&#x27;s happened numerous times in NYC when the mayor or city council has attempted to reign in the NYPD, they simply stop responding to calls for service and then blame it on the politicians.

Seems like the logical thing to do would be to fire the whole PD and replace them with another group. Except that&#x27;s basically the model used by secret-police dictatorships (eg. Russia, Iran) and anarchist failed states (eg. Haiti, much of Africa), so it doesn&#x27;t seem to work very well either.Seems like the root problem is that we grant the state a monopoly on physical violence because the alternative (no group having a monopoly on physical violence, and hence all of them battling it out) is worse. But then like the holders of any monopoly, they abuse it. This is why we can&#x27;t have nice things. reply grotorea 9 hours agorootparentI remember reading an article about Georgia (the country) successfully doing that with its highway patrol, but I can&#x27;t find it again. reply Gibbon1 14 hours agorootparentprevI seem to remember some city in the east coast fired their whole department and then hired back selected ones. And hired new cops to replace the guys they wanted to get rid of. And it helped.A suggestion I&#x27;ve thought of before and have seen in the wold increasingly is pay cops a stipend to pay for their own insurance. If they can&#x27;t get insurance they get fired automatically. reply AtlasBarfed 15 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s happened in Minneapolis as well after the George Floyd.The solution to this is either:- setup a second security force to gradually replace themor- subdivide the coverage map into different districts, suss out the districts with poor performing management, then merge the territories of bad areas under the management of good areasor- subdivide responsibilities between violent crime, petty crime, and mundane enforcement like traffic, with separate departments for each, and tackle cleaning them up separately.Really the notion of taking the same \"trained\" cop for all the roles in an urban area is pretty stupid. Specialized enforcement roles are likely a better solution.Shadow defunding, without calling it defunding, is also another weapon, but of course Minneapolis blew that by outright calling it defunding.But really the drug war is what fuels corruption and excessive power.

They’re arguably a lot less socialist than many actual gangs, as far as providing material benefits of their criminal activity to the people who “host” them.

If this is really true, how can it possibly happen?I&#x27;m from one of the more stable countries in Europe. While there is corruption and abuse in the police, the average officer has greater loyalty to the system than to their superiors. Which means that if someone refuses to do their job, you can fire them and possibly charge them with crimes, and you will eventually find a replacement willing to do the job.The only way I can see something like this happening is if the average police officer does not believe in the legitimacy of the political and legal system. reply HDThoreaun 15 hours agorootparentprevNo, I&#x27;m pretty sure the political argument is \"if we stop doing this we&#x27;ll have to raise taxes because it makes up a non insignificant portion of police revenue\" reply 0max 11 hours agorootparentprevMakes me hope that these POAs will know what Air Traffic Controllers went through in the 80s reply Mountain_Skies 12 hours agorootparentprevWe just went through a cycle of politicians coast to coast, though less in the middle, screaming loudly to defund the police.

But it&#x27;s just gotten to really batshit levels that there is probably nothing to do but stop the practice.As I understand it, some of the origins were that for debts owed to the government, with the person not present in the country, it was much more practical to target assets that may exist within the country than try and get the individual.Even in the introduction in the criminal context, I sort of understand the logic. In criminal organizations, there are likely people profiting a lot, that have engineered enough doubt that proving their connection to the beyond a reasonable standard is so difficult. But meeting a preponderance of the evidence standard in the civil context to reclaim those assets I can understand the argument.So I think there are some bad and weak arguments, but they certainly don&#x27;t outweigh what&#x27;s happening now.I think one of the worst argument I heard for not returning the money, was the police department wasn&#x27;t able to follow the judges order, because they deposited the money into a bank account and transferred to another agency. And they&#x27;ll never be able to find the exact same bills again that they gave to the bank, so are unable to follow the court order to return the money they took to the rightful owner. reply fnordpiglet 16 hours agorootparentYes the basic premise for why people would support civil forfeiture is “due process let’s too many people ‘get away with it’ so we need an extrajudicial process”.It’s the same basic rationale that all freedoms are ultimately curtailed with - all those rules are inconvenient, let’s by pass them a little bit. Then the reason for the rules start to become readily apparent again. Then the rationale takes on the old “can’t make an omelet” refrain, as if the world revolves around punishing criminals and everyone need to accept the collateral damage.Personally I’m of the old “rather let a thousand guilty go free than punish a single innocent,” but I also don’t set policy. reply westurner 15 hours agorootparentprevCivil forfeiture in the United States > History > Holder &#x2F; Obama: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United...Account for the seized assets.Interledger Protocol works with any type of (digital) asset ledger; W3C ILP.The FTC CAT Consolidated Audit Trail system does not uniquely identify individual bills &#x2F; [ledger] dollars, either FWIU.

This was aided by the fact that, in practice, the Soviets could and did do that. However, it was not at all a unique feature of socialism or communism. Police states don&#x27;t care about who nominally owns the economy, they care about what can be looted from it.Capitalism has no defense mechanisms against unwarranted seizure of property. Private ownership is a precursor to capitalism, not a byproduct of it. Furthermore, there are plenty of ways by which capitalist entities can gain government-like powers, if not totally supplant the government[0]. Concentration of wealth is a problem whether or not the person who owns the wealth claims to own it for themselves or in the name of the working class.The way that you prevent the government[1] from stealing your stuff is to make it inconvenient for them to do so. In the US, we have presumption of innocence, right to due process, and so on. These are constitutional rights that the government broadly respects. If they regularly didn&#x27;t, you&#x27;d see brain drain as people and businesses with the means to do so would escape the country. Those without such means would begin economically sabotaging the country. However, these are blunt instruments whose use entails personal cost, so people don&#x27;t use them right away. The US can therefore get away with ignoring its own constitutional obligations some of the time, and in this case, that&#x27;s how they get away with civil forfeiture.Think of it like this: when Apple or Google start screwing over developers, or Reddit or Twitter start screwing over users, we don&#x27;t all immediately jump ship, but some do. If they continue doing this, and they exceed a particular threshold of bullshit, they continue losing people faster than they gain. This creates a feedback loop of stupider and stupider tactics pissing off more and more people until the platform collapses.Countries work in similar ways.[0] The basic idea of Rothbardian ancap economics is that we should deliberately encourage this.

Much of the time you&#x27;ll even see the \"no step on snek\" and \"thin blue line\" flags in the same place. Furthermore, a lot of the worry about government overreach is specifically about gun confiscation. While not everyone who owns a gun is a tyrant in waiting, obviously, a lot of people have specific fantasies about seizing power from governments they think are oppressive, while still saying we need to ignore power abuses of local police officers when they aren&#x27;t targeted at them[0].I call this mentality \"no stop snek from stepping on other snek\". It is not an ideology, but the consequence of right-wing outrage perverting that ideology. Right-libertarians do write long rants about police brutality, civil asset forfeiture, and so on; but right-wingers more broadly care solely for identity politics that benefit them. Think about how Louis Rossmann, who is very vaguely right-wing and very libertarian, got shat on by the right-wing half of his audience[2] for interviewing Sam Seder about right-to-repair.What SCOTUS decides will likely be informed by the calculus of who exactly is petitioning them and what benefits the people who put them there. They aren&#x27;t yet willing to completely shit on the concept of stare decisis[1], but we have to at least present a case to right-wingers that not only civil asset forfeiture is bad and unconstitutional, but that it&#x27;s bad and unconstitutional in ways that hurt the kinds of people they are sympathetic to.[0] Case in point: the relative lack of outrage in right-wing circles whenever black people get their guns confiscated or are summarily executed for having them[1] The overturn of Roe v. Wade is concerning me, though[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5DR1AIsyzZ0&lc=UgxdShhyG9NmA... reply Borg3 13 hours agoprevYes yes..

It is already obvious that the government has a monopoly on violence. The entire structure of democracy is geared around spreading around that power to check it, and prevent any one actor from having greater access to it. The only viable solution is to reinforce those checks on power and remove the reins from bad actors trying to consolidate and strengthen their own access to the power. reply miah_ 16 hours agoprevWhat will SCOTUS do?

If that&#x27;s the case, charge one or both of them, there&#x27;s no just reason to take the car.A hypothetical situation that could somewhat justify the police taking someone&#x27;s car would be if the car was known to be stolen, but presumably she wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply to get it back in that case, so that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case. reply assimpleaspossi 12 hours agorootparentAs I said, there must be more to this story. replyyieldcrv 16 hours agoprevSCOTUS should:Limit the ability to charge unincorporated property.

    "originBody": "SIGN IN / UP SOFTWARE Arm wrestles assembly language guru's domains away citing trademark issues 88 Maria Markstedter spent years writing about chip biz's ISA, is a tad miffed by heavy-handed takedown tactics Tobias Mann Thu 31 Aug 2023 // 12:01 UTC If you fancy creating a blog or website to discuss the Arm architecture or the Softbank-owned outfit that develops it, keep the British CPU designer's name out of the domain name you choose – or draw the wrath of its lawyers. The Register offers that advice after Maria Markstedter – a noted author, assembly language expert, and security researcher who's written extensively about Arm at the websites she operates – received a cease-and-desist demand from Arm's lawyers. Her offense? According to the letter she shared on Xitter, using the trademark \"Arm\" in the domain name arm-assembly.com that she used to promote a book she wrote about the ISA. Strictly speaking, the letter went to the web host provider for her Arm-related websites, who passed it onto Markstedter to handle. The missive demanded that the website come down as it featured Arm's \"Arm\" trademark in the domain name. \"The website operated under the domain name arm-assembly.com ... is using Arm IPR in the domain name,\" the legal letter stated. \"The domain name incorporates the famous Arm Ltd mark and suggests an association with the famous Arm Ltd brand and/or Arm Ltd sponsorship or endorsement of this website.\" Yes, there is a need for trademark holders, like Arm, to assert their ownership and rights and protect their marks. Still, the order came as quite a shock to Markstedter, given her close relationship with the design house stretches back six years. \"I first thought this must've been a misunderstanding given my previous relationship with Arm,\" she told The Register last night. \"I wrote my thesis about Arm security features and exploit mitigations for Arm's internal use, [have] given internal presentations, keynoted their conference, advocated for them, visited them at their HQ in Cambridge – all without compensation because I wanted this to be a mutually beneficial relationship instead of a gig.\" Markstedter, who runs the Arm programming training'n'tutorial outfit Azeria Labs, therefore asked Arm what all the fuss was about – only to meet radio silence. Then, on Monday, blogs and websites owned and operated by Markstedter were taken down by her hosting provider after it received another cease and desist letter. These websites included: arm-reversing.com arm-exploitation.com arm-basics.de azeria-labs.com Markstedter told us the sites offered educational resources, courses on reverse-engineering Arm code, and promotions for her latest book. Azeria-Labs.com was taken down despite not including \"Arm\" in its name – the cease and desist order Arm sent to Markstedter's hosting provider identified her sites by a single IP address they all shared, which led to the provider tearing down everything. The labs dotcom, and its catalog of tutorials covering Arm assembly and exploit mitigation, is now back online. \"In order to get my site back ASAP, I yielded and transferred my domains to them, and Azeria Labs got unblocked,\" Markstedter told us. Arm reveals just how vulnerable it is to trade war with China Need a datacenter processor? Try our take-and-bake Neoverse N2 cores, says Arm It's official! Arm files for IPO on Nasdaq Up in arms! Arm kills off its anti-RISC-V smear site after own staff revolt This resolution did involve transferring ownership of four of the domains containing the offending \"Arm\" trademark to Arm. \"At the very least, I expected a simple heads-up or direct contact from them acknowledging the unfortunate necessity of their actions and asking for input on possible resolutions,\" Markstedter said. At the very least, I expected a simple heads-up or direct contact from them acknowledging the unfortunate necessity of their actions \"Yet I have only been contacted by their lawyers, and despite bringing this matter to their attention, I have yet to receive an official email from Arm attempting to address and resolve the issue or apologize.\" In the wake of the takedown, Markstedter registered leg-assembly.com to promote her book and plans to spin up additional body-part-related domains to provide additional resources on the Arm instruction set architectures. \"My disappointment with Arm's actions doesn't mean I've got any hard feelings towards the amazing folks working at Arm. They've been a huge support over the years, and I genuinely appreciate that,\" she emphasized. \"The frustration is more about the decision-making from the higher-ups and legal teams that led to this domain issue.\" Litigate or lose it? The Register asked Arm to comment on the cease-and-desist order, and its representatives told us it had nothing to say. Then as we were preparing to publish this article, the chip designer came back and said its actions were necessary to protect its Arm brand. \"We value the contributions that our developer and researcher community make to the Arm ecosystem and are committed to continuing to work with them as collaboratively and constructively as possible,\" a spokesperson told The Register. We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved \"At the same time, we have a duty to protect the Arm brand, which has been built over more than 30 years. Like all companies with registered trademarks, Arm is legally obligated to ensure those trademarks are protected and used appropriately. We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved.\" However, Markstedter told us that, apart from Arm's legal team, she hasn't received a single email from the firm itself that discusses finding a mutual solution. Markstedter said she had suggested Arm could donate her book to universities and persons who couldn't afford them, but had yet to receive any feedback on the proposal. Arm's rush to snatch up domain names is somewhat ironic, considering that in 2018 the biz create the website riscv-basics.com and used it to host content smearing rival RISC-V architecture and list multiple reasons why Arm's tech is superior. Arm pulled the dot-com after an internal revolt by its staff, and the domain has since lapsed into someone else's hands. Arm's takedown comes just a week after the Neoverse designer officially filed for an IPO on the US Nasdaq. In the filing, Arm disclosed numerous risk factors, including many related to its operations in China. However, we don't recall any mention of experts writing tutorials about its ISA as something Arm thinks investors need to worry about. That said, it did warn: \"We primarily rely on patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection and contractual protections ... to protect our IP rights. \"The steps we take to protect our IP rights may be inadequate.\" Some may well agree with that. ® Sponsored: Why putting off refresh cycles puts off power users and younger workers alike More about Arm Copyright Legal More like these 88 COMMENTS TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Arm reveals just how vulnerable it is to trade war with China COMMENT 你那里的生意不错，如果出了什么事就太可惜了 SYSTEMS 10 days18 Need a datacenter processor?

Though, I see complications if the information is true, but hurtful for the brand, or if the website gets ad revenue.Obvious mention: IANAL reply kalleboo 1 hour agoparentprev“Hi, we saw your site has our trademark in the domain name.

They&#x27;ll never make a judgement call where they stick their neck out. And unless someone important is threatening them they&#x27;re utterly lazy and unaccountable. reply greysun 18 hours agoprev [–] This seems to be a bit of a non-story, these kind of cease-and-desist letters (when it comes to trademarks) are usually triggered by automatic systems that monitor trademark usage across the web.While Azeria is definitely a well respected member of the community, there was a lack of due diligence on her part, specially when she has claimed on her \"arm-assembly.com\" website \"All Rights Reserved\", which she can&#x27;t clearly claim from the domain.It&#x27;s not nice to receive a cease-and-desist letter but we need to put things in perspective and put the emotional part aside before throwing drama on Twitter. reply anigbrowl 18 hours agoparentWhere she went wrong was in contacting ARM to try to get it resolved. The smart thing to do would have been to politely reply to the C&D and refer the lawyers to her contacts at ARM, CCing it to the people she worked with there.\"I wrote my thesis about Arm security features and exploit mitigations for Arm&#x27;s internal use, [have] given internal presentations, keynoted their conference, advocated for them, visited them at their HQ in Cambridge – all without compensation because I wanted this to be a mutually beneficial relationship instead of a gig.\"When are engineers going to learn that corporate entities have no more capacity for friendship than a scorpion?

The corporate officers are not your pals.People are downvoting the parent comment here, but it&#x27;s correct.

This doesn’t serve ARMs best interest nor Azeria. It’s a lose lose.Maybe it was automatically triggered, but I guess the point is a lot of things in the world are some shade of grey and employing machines to make a binary decision without any review process doesn’t serve anybody’s best interest. Perhaps throwing “drama on Twitter“ is the only way to get a real human in the loop of the automated insanity we’ve trapped ourselves in. reply greysun 18 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think Arm&#x27;s boss is personally offended by any of this but trademark laws require companies to protect their own trademark, otherwise they might simply lose the rights to own it.It is explained in the article:\"At the same time, we have a duty to protect the Arm brand, which has been built over more than 30 years. Like all companies with registered trademarks, Arm is legally obligated to ensure those trademarks are protected and used appropriately. We recognize that this activity is sometimes met with frustration and are actively working to find a solution that works for all parties involved.\"It&#x27;s not about &#x27;rules&#x27;, it is a legal requirement. reply lesserknowndan 18 hours agorootparentThis is wrong. Companies only need to “protect” trademarks by going after companies that offer similar products using that trademarked name. Unless a company gets a service mark, trademarks also only apply in certain categories.This was massive overreach by ARM. And frankly it was really inappropriate of the hosting provider to interfere with the websites. reply greysun 18 hours agorootparent\"Effective Trademark Enforcement Without LitigationAs the trademark owner, it is your legal duty to police the marketplace for infringement on your trademark.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gerbenlaw.com&#x2F;university&#x2F;trademark-protection-pu... reply clankyclanker 17 hours agorootparentNowhere does acknowledging and permitting the use require a C&D. A simple “we see you and this is fine” letter would’ve also met the policing requirement.The C&D is only required when you want to shut folks up and get the lawyers their bonuses. reply talideon 16 hours agorootparentprevThis isn&#x27;t one of those cases. This isn&#x27;t a Xerox, Hoover, or even Google situation. Simple reference of a trademark is allowed. What holders need to guard against is dilution and generification within the applicable domain. reply shkkmo 17 hours agorootparentprevThose websites were not selling chips or chip designs. Those websites used the trademark to refer the same product and do not create any potential for confusion.Please show me where there is a \"legal duty\" to go after fair use and be callous and lazy towards someone who is actively working to make your product better.Edit: Even if ARM had been completely unwilling to allow the fair use here, they could still have reached out directly since there is already a close relationship, rather than to going to the hosting provider and getting everything, even unrelated stuff, yanked down.I sure hope this is the end of the Pro Bono work the author does for them. replytoast0 18 hours agorootparentprevFor a case like this, it&#x27;s easy: give this site a license (or sell it one for $1), have them put trademark notices, and call it a day. reply shkkmo 18 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s the assertion ARM made.Yet it seems to me that is is pretty unclear that this is an open and shut case of trademark infringement. This appears to an example of fair-use to me as there is nothing her that would indicate any potential for confusion to the market or harm to the brand.Part of problem here is that the incentives support over enforcement, there is little to no legal consequence when companies go after fair use and a lack on enforcement does carry risks of eventually losing the trademark.However, that doesn&#x27;t justify ARM&#x27;s actions here. There are plenty of ways that ARM could have approached this that would have protected their trademark without the loss of goodwill from someone they have a valuable relationship with.Taking this approach is indicative of laziness and indiffence. reply spookie 18 hours agorootparentprevUnderstandable, it&#x27;s unfortunate reply Foobar8568 18 hours agoparentprevI highly doubt it was the case,and follow-ups should have cleared a few things and not a straight uncompensated handover, especially to someone who keynoted your conferences. In light of IPO, most likely the corporation wanted to kill any lose ends and it results in a PR disaster which eventually won&#x27;t have any impacts.
