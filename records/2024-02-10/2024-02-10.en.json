    "originBody": "(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup February 1, 2024 19-minute read aws • infrastructure • DevOps Image from UnSplash I’ve led infrastructure at a startup for the past 4 years that has had to scale quickly. From the beginning I made some core decisions that the company has had to stick to, for better or worse, these past four years. This post will list some of the major decisions made and if I endorse them for your startup, or if I regret them and advise you to pick something else. AWS Link to heading Picking AWS over Google Cloud Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Early on, we were using both GCP and AWS. During that time, I had no idea who my “account manager” was for Google Cloud, while at the same time I had regular cadence meetings with our AWS account manager. There is a feel that Google lives on robots and automation, while Amazon lives with a customer focus. This support has helped us when evaluating new AWS services. Besides support, AWS has done a great job around stability and minimizing backwards incompatible API changes. There was a time when Google Cloud was the choice for Kubernetes clusters, especially when there was ambiguity around if AWS would invest in EKS over ECS. Now though, with all the extra Kubernetes integrations around AWS services (external-dns, external-secrets, etc), this is not much of any issue anymore. EKS Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Unless you’re penny-pinching (and your time is free), there’s no reason to run your own control plane rather than use EKS. The main advantage of using an alternative in AWS, like ECS, is the deep integration into AWS services. Luckily, Kubernetes has caught up in many ways: for example, using external-dns to integrate with Route53. EKS managed addons Link to heading 🟧 Regret We started with EKS managed addons because I thought it was the “right” way to use EKS. Unfortunately, we always ran into a situation where we needed to customize the installation itself. Maybe the CPU requests, the image tag, or some configmap. We’ve since switched to using helm charts for what were add-ons and things are running much better with promotions that fit similar to our existing GitOps pipelines. RDS Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Data is the most critical part of your infrastructure. You lose your network: that’s downtime. You lose your data: that’s a company ending event. The markup cost of using RDS (or any managed database) is worth it. Redis ElastiCache Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Redis has worked very well as a cache and general use product. It’s fast, the API is simple and well documented, and the implementation is battle tested. Unlike other cache options, like Memcached, Redis has a lot of features that make it useful for more than just caching. It’s a great swiss army knife of “do fast data thing”. Part of me is unsure what the state of Redis is for Cloud Providers, but I feel it’s so widely used by AWS customers that AWS will continue to support it well. ECR Link to heading 🟩 Endorse We originally hosted on quay.io. It was a hot mess of stability problems. Since moving to ECR, things have been much more stable. The deeper permission integrations with EKS nodes or dev servers has also been a big plus. AWS VPN Link to heading 🟩 Endorse There are Zero Trust VPN alternatives from companies like CloudFlare. I’m sure these products work well, but a VPN is just so dead simple to setup and understand (“simplicity is preferable” is my mantra). We use Okta to manage our VPN access and it’s been a great experience. AWS premium support Link to heading 🟧 Regret It’s super expensive: almost (if not more) than the cost of another engineer. I think if we had very little in house knowledge of AWS, it would be worth it. Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Before integrating AFT, using control tower was a pain mostly because it was very difficult to automate. We’ve since integrated AFT into our stack and spinning up accounts has worked well since. Another thing AFT makes easier is standardizing tags for our accounts. For example, our production accounts have a tag that we can then use to make peering decisions. Tags work better than organizations for us because the decision of “what properties describe this account” isn’t always a tree structure. Process Link to heading Automating post-mortem process with a slack bot Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Everyone is busy. It can feel like you’re the “bad guy” reminding people to fill out the post-mortem. Making a robot be the bad guy had been great. It streamlines the process by nudging people to follow the SEV and post-mortem procedure. It doesn’t have to be too complex to start. Just the basics of “It’s been an hour of no messages. Someone post an update” or “It’s been a day with no calendar invite. Someone schedule the post-mortem meeting” can go a long ways. Using pager duty’s incident templates Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Why reinvent the wheel? PagerDuty publishes a template of what to do during an incident. We’ve customized it a bit, which is where the flexibility of Notion comes in handy, but it’s been a great starting point. Reviewing pager duty tickets on a regular cadence Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Alerting for a company goes like this: There are no alerts at all. We need alerts. We have alerts. There are too many alerts, so we ignore them. We’ve prioritized the alerts. Now only the critical ones wake me up. We ignore the non-critical alerts. We have a two tiered alerting setup: critical and non-critical. Critical alerts wake people up. Non-critical alerts are expected to ping the on-call async (email). The problem is that non-critical alerts are often ignored. To resolve this, we have regular (usually every 2 weeks) PagerDuty review meetings where we go over all our alerts. For the critical alerts, we discuss if it should stay critical. Then, we iterate the non-critical alerts (usually picking a few each meeting) and discuss what we can do to clear those out as well (usually tweaking the threshold or creating some automation). Monthly cost tracking meetings Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Early on, I set up a monthly meeting to go over all of our SaaS cost (AWS, DataDog, etc). Previously, this was just something reviewed from a finance perspective, but it’s hard for them to answer general questions around “does this cost number seem right”. During these meetings, usually attended by both finance and engineering, we go over every software related bill we get and do a gut check of “does this cost sound right”. We dive into the numbers of each of the high bills and try to break them down. For example, with AWS we group items by tag and separate them by account. These two dimensions, combined with the general service name (EC2, RDS, etc) gives us a good idea of where the major cost drivers are. Some things we do with this data are go deeper into spot instance usage or which accounts contribute to networking costs the most. But don’t stop at just AWS: go into all the major spend sinks your company has. Manging post mortems in datadog or pager duty Link to heading 🟥 Regret Everyone should do post-mortems. Both DataDog and PagerDuty have integrations to manage writing post-mortems and we tried each. Unfortunately, they both make it hard to customize the post-mortem process. Given how powerful wiki-ish tools like Notion are, I think it’s better to use a tool like that to manage post-mortems. Not using Function as a Service(FaaS) more Link to heading 🟥 Regret There are no great FaaS options for running GPU workloads, which is why we could never go fully FaaS. However, many CPU workloads could be FaaS (lambda, etc). The biggest counter-point people bring up is the cost. They’ll say something like “This EC2 instance type running 24/7 at full load is way less expensive than a Lambda running”. This is true, but it’s also a false comparison. Nobody runs a service at 100% CPU utilization and moves on with their life. It’s always on some scaler that says “Never reach 100%. At 70% scale up another”. And it’s always unclear when to scale back down, instead it’s a heuristic of “If we’ve been at 10% for 10 minutes, scale down”. Then, people assume spot instances when they aren’t always on market. Another hidden benefit of Lambda is that it’s very easy to track costs with high accuracy. When deploying services in Kubernetes, cost can get hidden behind other per node objects or other services running on the same node. GitOps Link to heading 🟩 Endorse GitOps has so far scaled pretty well and we use it for many parts of our infrastructure: services, terraform, and config to name a few. The main downside is that pipeline oriented workflows give a clear picture of “here is the box that means you did a commit and here are arrows that go from that box to the end of the pipeline”. With GitOps we’ve had to invest in tooling to help people answer questions like “I did a commit: why isn’t it deployed yet”. Even still, the flexibility of GitOps has been a huge win and I strongly recommend it for your company. Prioritizing team efficiency over external demands Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Most likely, your company is not selling the infrastructure itself, but another product. This puts pressure on the team to deliver features and not scale your own workload. But just like airplanes tell you to put your own mask on first, you need to make sure your team is efficient. With rare exception, I have never regretted prioritizing taking time to write some automation or documentation. Multiple applications sharing a database Link to heading 🟥 Regret Like most tech debt, we didn’t make this decision, we just did not not make this decision. Eventually, someone wants the product to do a new thing and makes a new table. This feels good because there are now foreign keys between the two tables. But since everything is owned by someone and that someone is a row in a table, you’ve got foreign keys between all objects in the entire stack. Since the database is used by everyone, it becomes cared for by no one. Startups don’t have the luxury of a DBA, and everything owned by no one is owned by infrastructure eventually. The biggest problem with a shared database are: Crud accumulates in the database, and it’s unclear if it can be deleted. When there are performance issues, infrastructure (without deep product knowledge) has to debug the database and figure out who to redirect to Database users can push bad code that does bad things to the database. These bad things may PagerDuty alert the infrastructure team (since they own the database). It feels bad to wake up one team for another team’s issue. With application owned databases, the application team is the first responder. All that said, I’m not against stacks that want to share a single database either. Just be aware of the tradeoffs above and have a good story for how you’ll manage them. SaaS Link to heading Not adopting an identity platform early on Link to heading 🟥 Regret I stuck with Google Workspace at the start, using it to create groups for employees as a way to assign permissions. It just isn’t flexible enough. In retrospect, I wish we had picked up Okta much sooner. It’s worked very well, has integrations for almost everything, and solves a lot of compliance/security aspects. Just lean into an identity solution early on and only accept SaaS vendors that integrate with it. Notion Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Every company needs a place to put documentation. Notion has been a great choice and worked much easier than things I’ve used in the past (Wikis, Google Docs, Confluence, etc). Their Database concept for page organization has also allowed me to create pretty sophisticated organizations of pages. Slack Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Thank god I don’t have to use HipChat anymore. Slack is great as a default communication tool, but to reduce stress and noise I recommend: Using threads to condense communication Communicating expectations that people may not respond quickly to messages Discourage private messages and encourage public channels. Moving off JIRA onto linear Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Not even close. JIRA is so bloated I’m worried running it in an AI company it would just turn fully sentient. When I’m using Linear, I will often think “I wonder if I can do X” and then I’ll try and I can! Not using Terraform Cloud Link to heading 🟩 No Regrets Early on, I tried to migrate our terraform to Terraform Cloud. The biggest downside was that I couldn’t justify the cost. I’ve since moved us to Atlantis, and it has worked well enough. Where atlantis falls short, we’ve written a bit of automation in our CI/CD pipelines to make up for it. GitHub actions for CI/CD Link to heading 🟧 Endorse-ish We, like most companies, host our code on GitHub. While originally using CircleCI, we’ve switched to Github actions for CI/CD. The marketplace of actions available to use for your workflows is large and the syntax is easy to read. The main downside of Github actions is their support for self-hosted workflows is very limited. We’re using EKS and actions-runner-controller for our self-hosted runners hosted in EKS, but the integration is often buggy (but nothing we cannot work around). I hope GitHub takes Kuberentes self-hosting more seriously in the future. Datadog Link to heading 🟥 Regret Datadog is a great product, but it’s expensive. More than just expensive, I’m worried their cost model is especially bad for Kubernetes clusters and for AI companies. Kubernetes clusters are most cost-effective when you can rapidly spin up and down many nodes, as well as use spot instances. Datadog’s pricing model is based on the number of instances you have and that means even if we have no more than 10 instances up at once, if we spin up and down 20 instances in that hour, we pay for 20 instances. Similarly, AI companies tend to use GPUs heavily. While a CPU node could have dozens of services running at once, spreading the per node Datadog cost between many use cases, a GPU node is likely to have only one service using it, making the per service Datadog cost much higher. Pagerduty Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Pagerduty is a great product and well priced. We’ve never regretted picking it. Software Link to heading Schema migration by Diff Link to heading 🟧 Endorse-ish Schema management is hard no matter how you do it, mostly because of how scary it is. Data is important and a bad schema migration can delete data. Of all the scary ways to solve this hard problem, I’ve been very happy with the idea of checking in the entire schema into git and then using a tool to generate the SQL to sync the database to the schema. Ubuntu for dev servers Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Originally I tried making the dev servers the same base OS that our Kubernetes nodes ran on, thinking this would make the development environment closer to prod. In retrospect, the effort isn’t worth it. I’m happy we are sticking with Ubuntu for development servers. It’s a well-supported OS and has most of the packages we need. AppSmith Link to heading 🟩 Endorse We frequently need to automate some process for an internal engineer: restart/promote/diagnose/etc. It’s easy enough for us to make APIs to solve these problems, but it’s a bit annoying debugging someone’s specific installation of a CLI/os/dependencies/etc. Being able to make a simple UI for engineers to interact with our scripts is very useful. We self-host our AppSmith. It works … well enough. Of course there are things we would change, but it is enough for the “free” price point. I originally explored deeper integration with retool, but I couldn’t justify the price point for what, at the time, was just a few integrations. helm Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Helm v2 got a bad reputation (for good reason), but helm v3 has worked … well enough. There are still issues with deploying CRDs and educating developers on why their helm chart did not deploy correctly. Overall, however, helm works well enough as a way to package and deploy versioned Kubernetes objetcs and the Go templating language is difficult to debug, but powerful. helm charts in ECR(oci) Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Originally our helm charts were hosted inside S3 and downloaded with a plugin. The main downsides were needing to install a custom helm plugin and manually managing lifecycles. We’ve since switched to OCI stored helm charts and haven’t had any issues with this setup. bazel Link to heading 🟧 Unsure To be fair, a lot of smart people like bazel, so I’m sure it’s not a bad choice to make. When deploying Go services, bazel personally feels like overkill. I think Bazel is a great choice if your last company used bazel, and you feel home sick. Otherwise, we have a build system that only a few engineers can dive deeply into, compared to GitHub Actions, where it seems everyone knows how to get their hands dirty. Not using open telemetry early Link to heading 🟥 Regret We started off sending metrics directly to DataDog using DataDog’s API. This has made it very hard to rip them out. Open telemetry wasn’t as mature 4 years ago, but it’s gotten much better. I think the metrics telemetry is still a bit immature, but the tracing is great. I recommend using it from the start for any company. Picking renovatebot over dependabot Link to heading 🟩 Endorse I honestly wish we had thought about “keep your dependencies up to date” sooner. When you wait on this too long, you end up with versions so old the upgrade process is long and inevitably buggy. Renovatebot has worked well with the flexibility to customize it to your needs. The biggest, and it’s pretty big, downside is that it’s VERY complicated to setup and debug. I guess it’s the best of all the bad options. Kubernetes Link to heading 🟩 Endorse You need something to host your long running services. Kuberentes is a popular choice and it’s worked well for us. The Kubernetes community has done a great job integrating AWS services (like load balancers, DNS, etc) into the Kubernetes ecosystem. The biggest downside with any flexible system is that there are a lot of ways to use it, and any system with a lot of ways to use has a lot of ways to use wrong. any system with a lot of ways to use has a lot of ways to use wrong Jack Lindamood Buying our own IPs Link to heading 🟩 Endorse If you work with external partners, you’ll frequently need to publish a whitelist of your IPs for them. Unfortunately, you may later develop more systems that need their own IPs. Buying your own IP block is a great way to avoid this by giving the external partner a larger CIDR block to whitelist. Picking Flux for k8s GitOps Link to heading 🟩 No Regrets An early GitOps choice for Kubernetes was to decide between ArgoCD and Flux: I went with Flux (v1 at the time). It’s worked very well. We’re currently using Flux 2. The only downside is we’ve had to make our own tooling to help people understand the state of their deployments. I hear great things about ArgoCD, so I’m sure if you picked that you’re also safe. Karpenter for node management Link to heading 🟩 Endorse If you’re using EKS (and not fully on Fargate), you should be using Karpenter. 100% full stop. We’ve used other autoscalers, including the default Kubernetes autoscaler and SpotInst. Between them all, Karpenter has been the most reliable and the most cost-effective. Using SealedSecrets to manage k8s secrets Link to heading 🟥 Regret My original thought was to push secret management to something GitOps styled. The two main drawbacks of using sealed-secrets were: It was more complicated for less infra knowledgeable developers to create/update secrets We lost all the existing automations that AWS has around rotating secrets (for example) Using ExternalSecrets to manage k8s secrets Link to heading 🟩 Endorse ExternalSecrets has worked very well to sync AWS -> Kubernetes secrets. The process is simple for developers to understand and lets us take advantage of terraform as a way to easily create/update the secrets inside AWS, as well as give users a UI to use to create/update the secrets. Using ExternalDNS to manage DNS Link to heading 🟩 Endorse ExternalDNS is a great product. It syncs our Kubernetes -> Route53 DNS entries and has given us very little problems in the past 4 years. Using cert-manager to manage SSL certificates Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Very intuitive to configure and has worked well with no issues. Highly recommend using it to create your Let’s Encrypt certificates for Kubernetes. The only downside is we sometimes have ANCIENT (SaaS problems am I right?) tech stack customers that don’t trust Let’s Encrypt, and you need to go get a paid cert for those. Bottlerocket for EKS Link to heading 🟥 Regret Our EKS cluster used to run on Bottlerocket. The main downside was we frequently ran into networking CSI issues and debugging the bottlerocket images were much harder than debugging the standard EKS AMIs. Using the EKS optimized AMIs for our nodes has given us no problems, and we still have a backdoor to debug the node itself when there are strange networking issues. Picking Terraform over Cloudformation Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Using Infrastructure as Code is a must for any company. Being in AWS, the two main choices are Cloudformation and Terraform. I’ve used both and don’t regret sticking with Terraform. It’s been easy to extend for other SaaS providers (like Pagerduty), the syntax is easier to read than CloudFormation, and hasn’t been a blocker or slowdown for us. Not using more code-ish IaC solutions (Pulumi, CDK, etc) Link to heading 🟩 No Regrets While Terraform and CloudFormation are data files (HCL and YAML/JSON) that describe your infrastructure, solutions like Pulumi or CDK allow you to write code that does the same. Code is of course powerful, but I’ve found the restrictive nature of Terraform’s HCL to be a benefit with reduced complexity. It’s not that it’s impossible to write complex Terraform: it’s just that it’s more obvious when it’s happening. Some of these solutions, like Pulumi, were invented many years ago while Terraform lacked a lot of the features it has today. Newer versions of Terraform have integrated a lot of the features that we can use to reduce complexity. We instead use a middleground that generates basic skeletons of our Terraform code for parts we want to abstract away. Not using a network mesh (istio/linkerd/etc) Link to heading 🟩 No regrets Network meshes are really cool and a lot of smart people tend to endorse them, so I’m convinced they are fine ideas. Unfortunately, I think companies underestimate the complexity of things. My general infrastructure advice is “less is better”. Nginx load balancer for EKS ingress Link to heading 🟩 No Regrets Nginx is old, it’s stable, and it’s battle tested. homebrew for company scripts Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Your company will likely need a way to distribute scripts and binaries for your engineers to use. Homebrew has worked well enough for both linux and Mac users as a way to distribute scripts and binaries. Go for services Link to heading 🟩 Endorse Go has been easy for new engineers to pick up and is a great choice overall. For non-GPU services that are mostly network IO bound, Go should be your default language choice.",

Every so often I price out RDS to replace our colocated SQL Server cluster and it's so unrealistically expensive that I just have to laugh. It's absurdly far beyond what I'd be willing to pay. The markup is enough to pay for the colocation rack, the AWS Direct Connects, the servers, the SAN, the SQL Server licenses, the maintenance contracts, and a full-time in-house DBA. https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=48b0bab00fe90c5e6de68d0... Total 12 months cost: 547,441.85 USD Once you get past the point where the markup can pay for one or more full-time employees, I think you should consider doing that instead of blindly paying more and more to scale RDS up. You're REALLY paying for it with RDS. At least re-evaluate the choices you made as a fledgling startup once you reach the scale where you're paying AWS \"full time engineer\" amounts of money. reply nyc_data_geek 7 hours agoparentSome orgs are looking at moving back to on prem because they're figuring this out. For a while it was vogue to go from capex to opex costs, and C suite people were incentivized to do that via comp structures, hence \"digital transformation\" ie: migration to public cloud infrastructure. Now, those same orgs are realizing that renting computers actually costs more than owning them, when you're utilizing them to a significant degree. Just like any other asset. reply jumploops 1 hour agorootparentFunny story time. I was once part of an acquisition from a much larger corporate entity. The new parent company was in the middle of a huge cloud migration, and as part of our integration into their org, we were required to migrate our services to the cloud. Our calculations said it would cost 3x as much to run our infra on the cloud. We pushed back, and were greenlit on creating a hybrid architecture that allowed us to launch machines both on-prem and in the cloud (via a direct link to the cloud datacenter). This gave us the benefit of autoscaling our volatile services, while maintaining our predictable services on the cheap. After I left, apparently my former team was strong-armed into migrating everything to the cloud. A few years go by, and guess who reaches out on LinkedIn? The parent org was curious how we built the hybrid infra, and wanted us to come back to do it again. I didn't go back. reply smitty1e 9 minutes agorootparentMy funny story is built on the idea that AWS is Hotel California for your data. A customer had an interest in merging the data from an older account into a new one, just to simplify matters. Enterprise data. Going back years. Not even leaving the region. The AWS rep in the meeting kinda pauses, says: \"We'll get back to you on the cost to do that.\" The sticker shock was enough that the customer simply inherited the old account, rather than making things tidy. reply stingraycharles 4 hours agorootparentprevThat’s made possible because of all the orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes being standardized, and as such you can get pretty close to a cloud experience while having all your infrastructure on-premise. reply nyc_data_geek 4 hours agorootparentYes, virtualization, overprovisioning and containerization have all played a role in allowing for efficient enough utilization of owned assets that the economics of cloud are perhaps no longer as attractive as they once were. reply oooyay 3 hours agorootparentprevContext: I build internal tools and platforms. Traffic on them varies, but some of them are quite active. My nasty little secret is for single server databases I have zero fear of over provisioning disk iops and running it on SQLite or making a single RDBMS server in a container. I've never actually run into an issue with this. It surprises me the number of internal tools I see that depend on large RDS installations that have piddly requirements. reply pinkgolem 2 hours agorootparentprevKeep in mind, there is an in between.. I would have a hard time doing servers as cheap as hetzner for example including the routing and everything reply jwr 1 hour agorootparentI do that. In fact I've been doing it for years, because every time I do the math, AWS is unreasonably expensive and my solo-founder SaaS would much rather keep the extra money. I think there is an unreasonable fear of \"doing the routing and everything\". I run vpncloud, my server clusters are managed using ansible, and can be set up from either a list of static IPs or from a terraform-prepared configuration. The same code can be used to set up a cluster on bare-metal hetzner servers or on cloud VMs from DigitalOcean (for example). I regularly compare this to AWS costs and it's not even close. Don't forget that the performance of those bare-metal machines is way higher than of overbooked VMs. reply pinkgolem 1 hour agorootparentI was more talking about physical backbone connection which hetzner does for you. We are using hetzner cloud.. but we are also scaling up and down a lot right now reply swores 1 hour agorootparentCould you please explain what you mean by \"physical backbone connection\", as I can't think of a meaning that fits the context. If you mean dealing with the physical dedicated servers that can be rented from Hetzner, that's what the person you replied to was talking about being not so difficult. If you mean everything else at the data centre that makes having a server there worthwhile (networking, power, cooling, etc.) I don't think people were suggesting doing that themselves (unless you're a big enough company to actually be in the data centre business), but were talking about having direct control of physical servers in a data centre managed by someone like Hetzner. (edit: and oops sorry I just realised I accidentally downvoted your comment instead of up, undone and rectified now) reply pinkgolem 1 hour agorootparentWith \"routing\" I meant the backbone connection, which is included in the hetzner price. Aka if I add up power (including backup) + backbone connection rental + server deprication I can not do it for the hetzner price.. That was quite imprecise, sorry about that. reply fgonzag 58 minutes agorootparentprevYou usually just do colocation. The data center will give you a rack (or space for one), an upstream gateway to your ISP, and redundant power. You still have to manage a firewall and your internal network equipment, but its not really that bad. I've used PFsense firewalls, configured by them for like $1500, with roaming vpn, high availability, point to point vpn, and as secure as reasonably possible. After that it's the same thing as the cloud except its physical servers. reply pinkgolem 52 minutes agorootparenti mean, yes.. but you pay for that, and colocation + server deprication in the case i calculated was higher then just renting the servers reply nextos 6 hours agorootparentprevSame experience here. As a small organization, the quotes we got from cloud providers have always been prohibitively expensive compared to running things locally, even when we accounted for geographical redundancy, generous labor costs, etc. Plus, we get to keep know how and avoid lock-in, which are extremely important things in the long term. Besides, running things locally can be refreshingly simple if you are just starting something and you don't need tons of extra stuff, which becomes accidental complexity between you, the problem, and a solution. This old post described that point quite well by comparing Unix to Taco Bell: http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-progra.... See HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10829512. I am sure for some use-cases cloud services might be worth it, especially if you are a large organization and you get huge discounts. But I see lots of business types blindly advocating for clouds, without understanding costs and technical tradeoffs. Fortunately, the trend seems to be plateauing. I see an increasing demand for people with HPC, DB administration, and sysadmin skills. reply layoric 5 hours agorootparent> Plus, we get to keep know how and avoid lock-in, which are extremely important things in the long term. So much this. The \"keep know how\" has been so greatly avoided over the past 10 years, I hope people with these skills start getting paid more as more companies realize the cost difference. reply lanstin 5 hours agorootparentWhen I started working in the 1980s (as a teenager but getting paid) there was a sort of battle between the (genuinely cool and impressive) closed technology of IBM and the open world of open standards/interop like TCP/IP and Unix, SMTP, PCs, even Novell sort of, etc. There was a species of expert that knew the whole product offering of IBM, all the model numbers and recommended solution packages and so on. And the technology was good - I had an opportunity to program a 3093K(?) CM/VMS monster with APL and rexx and so on. Later on I had a job working with AS/400 and SNADS and token ring and all that, and it was interesting; thing is they couldn't keep up and the more open, less greedy, hobbyists and experts working on Linux and NFS and DNS etc. completely won the field. For decades, open source, open standards, and interoperability dominated and one could pick the best thing for each part of the technology stack, and be pretty sure that the resultant systems would be good. Now however, the Amazon cloud stacks are like IBM in the 1980s - amazingly high quality, but not open; the cloud architects master the arcane set of product offerings and can design a bespoke AWS \"solution\" to any problems. But where is the openness? Is this a pendulum that goes back and forth (and many IBM folks left IBM in the 1990s and built great open technologies on the internet) or was it a brief dawn of freedom that will be put down by the capital requirements of modern compute and networking stacks? My money is on openness continuing to grow and more and more pieces of the stack being completely owned by openness (kernels anyone?) but one doesn't know. reply nyc_data_geek 4 hours agorootparentprevEven without owning the infrastructure, running in the cloud without know-how is very dangerous. I hear tell of a shop that was running on ephemeral instance based compute fleets (EC2 spot instances, iirc), with all their prod data in-memory. Guess what happened to their data when spot instance availability cratered due to an unusual demand spike? No more data, no more shop.

Paying the licensing fees on top make it more expensive. It really depends on the circunstance a managed database usually has exended support from the compaany providing it. You have to weigh a team's expertise to manage a solution on your own and ensure you spent ample time making it resilient. Other half is the cost of upgrading hardware sometimes it is better to just outright pay a cloud provider if you business does not have enough income to outright buy hardware.There is always an upfront cost. Small databases or test environment databases you can also leverage kubernetes to host an operator for that tiny DB. When it comes to serious data and it needs a beeline recovery strategy RDS.

By the time your db is big enough to cost an unreasonable amount on RDS, you’re likely a big enough team to have options.

You can buy a used server and find colocation space and still be pennies on the dollar for even the smallest database. If you're doing more than prototyping, you're probably wasting money. reply macNchz 4 hours agorootparentIn the small SaaS startup case, I’d say the production database is typically the most critical single piece of infra, so self hosting is just not a compelling proposition unless you have a strong technical reason where having super powerful database hardware is important, or a team with multiple people who have sysadmin or DBA experience. I think both of those cases are unusual. I’ve been the guy managing a critical self-hosted database in a small team, and it’s such a distraction from focusing on the actual core product. To me, the cost of RDS covers tons of risks and time sinks: having to document the db server setup so I’m not the only one on the team who actually knows how to operate it, setting up monitoring, foolproof backups so I don’t need to worry that they’re silently failing because a volume is full and I misconfigured the monitoring, PITR for when someone ships a bad migration, one click HA so the database itself is very unlikely to wake me at 3am, blue/green deploys to make major version upgrades totally painless, never having to think about hardware failures or borked dist-upgrades, and so on. Each of those is ultimately either undifferentiated work to develop in-house RDS features that could have been better spent on product, or a risk of significant data loss, downtime, or firefighting. RDS looks like a pretty good deal, up to a point. reply remus 2 hours agorootparentI like fiddling with databases, but I totally agree with this. Unless you really need a big database and are going to save 100k+ per year by going self managed then RDS or similar just saves you so much stress.

This is the single biggest factor, and it's the hardest one to be honest about. No one wants to say \"RDS is a good choice . . . because I don't know how nor have I ever self managed a database.\" If you want a different opportunity cost, get people with different experience.

I've self-managed databases, and I still think that RDS is compelling for small engineering teams. There's a lot to get right when managing a database, and it's easy to screw something up. Perhaps none of the individual parts are super-complicated, but the cost of failure is high. Outsourcing that cost to AWS is pretty compelling. At a certain team size, you'll end up with a section of the team that's dedicated to these sorts of careful processes. But the first place these issues come up is with the database, and if you can put off that bit of organizational scaling until later, then that's a great path to choose. reply ehnto 4 hours agorootparentprev> Sure, maybe if you are some sort of SaaS with a need for a small single DB, that also needs to be resilient, backed up, rock solid bulletproof.. it makes sense? But how many cases are there of this? Very small businesses with phone apps or web apps are often using it. There are cheaper options of course, but when there is no \"prem\" and there are 1-5 employees then it doesn't make much sense to hire for infra. You outsource all digital work to an agency who sets you up a cloud account so you have ownership, but they do all software dev and infra work. > If its so fundamental to your product and needs such uptime & redundancy, what are the odds its also reasonably small? Small businesses again, some of my clients could probably run off a Pentium 4 from 2008, but due to nature of the org and agency engagement it often needs to live in the cloud somewhere. I am constantly beating the drum to reduce costs and use as little infra as needed though, so in a sense I agree, but the engagement is what it is. Additionally, everyone wants to believe they will need to hyperscale, so even medium scale businesses over-provision and some agencies are happen to do that for them as they profit off the margin. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentprevI have a small MySQL database that’s rather important, and RDS was a complete failure. It would have cost a negligible amount. But the sheer amount of time I wasted before I gave up was honestly quite surprising. Let’s see: - I wanted one simple extension. I could have compromised on this, but getting it to work on RDS was a nonstarter. - I wanted RDS to _import the data_. Nope, RDS isn’t “SUPER,” so it rejects a bunch of stuff that mysqldump emits. Hacking around it with sed was not confidence-inspiring. - The database uses GTIDs and needed to maintain replication to a non-AWS system. RDS nominally supports GTID, but the documented way to enable it at import time strongly suggests that whoever wrote the docs doesn’t actually understand the purpose of GTID, and it wasn’t clear that RDS could do it right. At least Azure’s docs suggested that I could have written code to target some strange APIs to program the thing correctly. Time wasted: a surprising number of hours. I’d rather give someone a bit of money to manage the thing, but it’s still on a combination of plain cloud servers and bare metal. Oh well. reply viraptor 8 hours agorootparentprevLots of cases. It doesn't even have to be a tiny database. WithinMost large SaaS companies can run off of $5k / m or cheaper RDS Hard disagree. An r6i.12xl Multi-AZ with 7500 IOPS / 500 GiB io1 books at $10K/month on its own. Add a read replica, even Single-AZ at a smaller size, and you’re half that again. And this is without the infra required to run a load balancer / connection pooler. I don’t know what your definition of “large” is, but the described would be adequate at best at the ~100K QPS level. RDS is expensive as hell, because they know most people don’t want to take the time to read docs and understand how to implement a solid backup strategy.

Therefore the \"sticker price\" that people compare on the public site is no where close to a fair comparison. We technically aren't supposed to talk about pricing publically, but I'm just going to say that we run a few 8XL and 12Xl RDS instances and we pay ~40% off the sticker price. If you switch to Aurora engine the pricing is absurdly complex (its basically impossible to determine without a simulation calculator) but AWS is even more aggressive with discounting on Aurora, not to mention there are some legit amazing feature benefits by switching. I'm still in agreeance that you could do it cheaper yourself at a Data Center. But there are some serious tradeoffs made by doing it that way. One is complexity and it certainly requires several new hiring decisions. Those have their own tangible costs, but there are a huge amount of intangible costs as well like pure inconvenience, more people management, more hiring, split expertise, complexity to network systems, reduce elasticity of decisions, longer commitments, etc.. It's harder to put a price on that. When you account for the discounts at this scale, I think the cost gap between the two solutions is much smaller and these inconveniences and complexities by rolling it yourself are sometimes worth bridging that smaller gap in cost in order to gain those efficiencies. reply jq-r 37 minutes agorootparent> but I'm just going to say that we run a few 8XL and 12Xl RDS instances and we pay ~40% off the sticker price.

Then last month we had some crazy stuff happen and we were spamming logs into DataDog for a variety of reasons. I knew I didn't want to pay for these billions of logs to be indexed, so I made an exclusion filter to keep them out of our log indexes so we didn't have a crazy bill for log indexing. So our rep emailed me last week and said \"Hey just a heads up you have $6,500 in on-demand costs for CloudSIEM, I hope that was expected\". No, it was NOT expected. Turns out excluding logs from indexing does not exclude them from CloudSIEM. Fun fact, you will not find any documented way to exclude logs from CloudSIEM ingestion. It is technically possible, but only through their API and it isn't documented. Anyway, I didn't do or know this, so now i had $6,500 of on-demand costs plus $400-500 misc on-demand costs that I had to explain to the CTO. I should mention my annual review/pay raise is also next week (I report to the CTO), so this will now be fresh in their mind for that experience. reply macNchz 4 hours agorootparentThat’s just the sort of hypothetical scenario that kept running through my head as I tried to find a way for us to use Datadog. I even particularly wanted to use the CloudSIEM product. Bummer. reply gen220 7 hours agorootparentprevI’m a big fan of Datadog from multiple angles. Their pricing setup is evil. Breaking out by SKUs and having 10+ SKUs is fine, trialing services with “spot” prices before committing to reserved capacity is also fine. But (for some SKUs, at least) they make it really difficult to be confident that the reserved capacity you’re purchasing will cover your spot use cases. Then, they make you contact a sales rep to lower your reserved capacity. It all feels designed to get you to pay the “spot” rate for as long as possible, and it’s not a good look. I understand the pressures on their billing and sales teams that lead to these patterns, but they don’t align with their customers in the long term. I hope they clean up their act, because I agree they’re losing some set of customers over it. reply viraptor 3 hours agorootparentAnother annoying thing is that the billing dashboards do not map clearly to what's on the pricing pages / in the contract. Good luck figuring out the extras for RUM when you have multiple orgs. Then they have things that I wanted to try for a long time, but... support doesn't care? Repeated \"would you like to use this? / very likely, can we try it out? / (silence)\". I love their product, but they are so annoying to deal with at the billing level. reply xtracto 7 hours agoparentprevDatDog is a freaking beast.

It doesn't support custom fields, so if that's a critical feature for you, I can see it falling short.

It's wild that this is a selling point, but it's actually a huge deal. JIRA and so many other tools like it are as slow as molasses. Speed is honestly the biggest feature. - It looks pretty. If your team is going to spend time there, this will end up affecting productivity. - It has a decent degree of customization and an API. We've automated tickets moving across columns whenever something gets started, a PR is up for review, when a change is merged, when it's deployed to beta, and when it's deployed to prod. We've even built our own CLI tools for being able to action on Linear without leaving your shell. - It has a lot of keyboard shortcuts for power users. - It's well featured.

GitHub actions are a mess but gitlab online's ci cd is not much better at all, and for self hosted it opens a whole different can of worms. At least with GitHub actions you have a plugin ecosystem that makes the super janky underlying platform a bit more bearable. reply jacurtis 5 hours agoparentprevI mostly agreed with OP's article, but you basically nailed all of the points of disagreement I did have. Jira: Its overhyped and overpriced. Most HATE jira. I guess I don't care enough. I've never met a ticket system that I loved. Jira is fine. Its overly complex sure. But once you set it up, you don't need to change it very often. I don't love it, I don't hate it. No one ever got fired for choosing Jira, so it gets chosen. Welcome to the tech industry. Terraform Cloud: The gains for Terraform Cloud are minimal. We just use Gitlab for running Terraform pipelines and have a super nice custom solution that we enjoy. It wasn't that hard to do either. We maintain state files remotely in S3 with versioning for the rare cases when we need to restore a foobar'd statefile. Honestly I like having Terraform pipelines in the same place as the code and pipelines for other things. GitHub Actions: Yeah switch to GitLab. I used to like Github Actions until I moved to a company with Gitlab and it is best in class, full stop. I could rave about Gitlab for hours. I will evangelize for Gitlab anywhere I go that is using anything else. DataDog: As mentioned, DataDog is the best monitoring and observability solution out there. The only reason NOT to use it is the cost. It is absurdly expensive. Yes, truly expensive. I really hate how expensive it is. But luckily I work somewhere that lets us have it and its amazing. Pagerduty: Agree, switch to OpsGenie. Opsgenie is considerably cheaper and does all the pager stuff of Pager duty. All the stuff that PagerDuty tries to tack on top to justify its cost is stuff you don't need. OpsGenie does all the stuff you need. Its fine. Similar to Jira, its not something anyone wants anyway. No ones going to love it, no one loves being on call. So just save money with OpsGenie. If you're going to fight for the \"brand name\" of something, fight for DataDog instead, not a cooler pager system. reply bigstrat2003 5 hours agorootparentI'm right there with you on Jira. The haters are wrong - it's a decent enough ticket system, no worse than anything else I've used. You can definitely torture Jira into something horrible, but that's not Jira's fault.

Kubernetes is way too complicated for our needs. It wants to be in control and is hard to direct with eg CloudFormation. Load balancers are provisioned from the add-on, making it hard to reference them outside kubernetes. Logging on EKS Fargate to Cloudwatch appears broken, despite following the docs.

We have moved off of it though, you can eventually need more features than it provides. Of course that journey always ends up in Kubernetes land, so you eventually will find your way back there. Logging to Cloudwatch from kubernetes is good for one thing... audit logs. Cloudwatch in general is a shit product compared to even open source alternatives.

Side node: There is a small typo repeated twice \"Kuberentes\" reply Scubabear68 9 hours agoprevThe kitchen sink database used by everybody is such a common problem, yet it is repeated over and over again. If you grow it becomes significant tech debt and a performance bottleneck. Fortunately, with managed DBs like RDS it is really easy to run individual DB clusters per major app. reply eduction 7 hours agoparentManagement problem masquerading as a tech problem. Being shared between applications is literally what databases were invented to do. That’s why you learn a special dsl to query and update them instead of just doing it in the same language as your application. The problem is that data is a shared resource. The database is where multiple groups in an organization come together to get something they all need. So it needs to be managed. It could be a dictator DBA or a set of rules designed in meetings and administered by ops, or whatever. But imagine it was money. Different divisions produce and consume money just like data. Would anyone imagine suggesting either every team has their own bank account or total unfettered access to the corporate treasury? Of course not. You would make a system. Everyone would at least mildly hate it. That’s how databases should generally be managed once the company is any real size. reply dalyons 6 hours agorootparentWhy would you make it a shared resource if you don’t have to?

Each team maintains their own DB and pays for their own choices.

And even then, it’s usually on me to work around the insane schema dreamt up by the devs. Multi-tenant DBs can work fine as long as every app has its own users, everyone goes through a connection pooler / load balancer, and every user has rate limits. You want to write shitty queries that time out? Not my problem. Your GraphQL BFF bullshit is trying to make 10,000 QPS? Nope, sorry, try again later. EDIT: I say “not my problem,” but as mentioned, it inevitably becomes my problem. Because “just unblock them so the site is functional” is far more attractive to the C-Suite than “slow down velocity to ensure the dev teams are doing things right.” reply dalyons 6 hours agorootparentOr, you just avoid doing multi tenet from the start and none of those become your problem to unblock. What’s the downside? reply sgarland 4 hours agorootparentDone that as well; it still becomes my problem because teams without RDBMS knowledge eventually break it, and… then I get paged. Full Stack is a lie, and the sooner companies accept that and allow people to specialize again, and to pay for the extra headcount, the better off everyone will be. reply dalyons 3 hours agorootparentI disagree I guess. Multiple companies I’ve worked at have broken up their shared db into many dbs that individual teams own the operations of, and it works just fine. At significant scale in traffic and # of eng.

Anyone have any good resources for learning how not to fuck up schema/db design for those of us who will probably never have a DBA on the team? reply magicalhippo 7 hours agorootparentGood question. We don't have a DBA either. I've learned SQL as needed and while I'm not terrible, it's still daunting when making the schema for a new module that might require 10-20 tables or more. One thing that has worked well for us is to alway include the top-most parent key in all child tables down yhe hierarchy. This way we can load all the data for say an order without joins/exists. Oh and never use natural keys. Each time I thought finally I had a good use-case, it has bitten me in some way. Apart from that we just try to think about the required data access and the queries needed. Main thing is that all queries should go against indexes in our case, so we make sure the schema supports that easily. Requires some educated guesses at times but mostly it's predictable IME. Anyway would love to see a proper resource.

If you're looking for successful businesses, indie hackers like levelsio show you how far you can get with very simple architectures. But that's solo dev work - once you have a team and are dealing with larger-scale data, things like infrastructure as code, orchestration, and observability become important. Kubernetes may or may not be essential depending on what you're building; it seems good for AI companies, though. reply charred_patina 5 hours agorootparentHow many people if I may ask? And how many TPS for your services? I am hoping I can get away with a simple monolith for a very long time. reply kevinqi 1 hour agorootparent30-40 people; not much TPS but we're not primarily building a web app; we have event-driven data pipelines and microservices for ML data. If you're primarily building a web app, a monolith is fine for quite a while, I think. But a lot of the stuff in the post is still relevant even for monoliths - RDS, Redis, ECR, terraform, pagerduty, monitoring/observability. reply krmboya 5 hours agorootparentprevI bet you can get pretty far with just ec2 and autoscaling, or comparable tech in other cloud platforms. With a managed database service. reply charred_patina 5 hours agorootparentThat I'd be comfortable with. reply AznHisoka 4 hours agorootparentprevI bet Craigslist runs on much simpler infrastructure. Not sure how much they’re worth though reply mixmastamyk 43 minutes agorootparentStackoverflow famously grew huge for a long time on a single Windows box. I don’t recommend that but yeah KISS rule definitely. Floss version: supabase, open telemetry, etc. reply icameron 6 hours agoparentprevI would like to know what you’re being downvoted for. It’s not bad advice, necessarily… this was the way 20 years ago. I mean isn’t hacker news running kind of like this as a monolith on a single server? People might be surprised how far you can get with a simple setup. reply krmboya 5 hours agoparentprevKey term here: 'cloud native'. Which is supposedly the future reply sroussey 8 hours agoprevIf you are startup that can can’t afford a DBA, then why why why are you using Kubernetes? reply maccard 6 hours agoparentBecause I can go from main.go to a load balanced, autoscaling app with rolling deploys, segeregated environments, logging & monitoring in about 30 minutes, and never need to touch _any_ of that again. Plus, if I leave, the guy who comes after me can look at a helm chart, terraform module + pipeline.yml and figure out how it works. Meanwhile, our janq shell script based task scheduler craps out on something new every month. What started as 15 lines of \"docker run X, sleep 30 docker kill x\" is now a polyglot monster to handle all sorts of edge cases. I have spent vanishingly close to 0 hours on maintaining our (managed) kubernetes clusters in work over the past 3 years, and if I didn't show up tomorrow my replacement would be fine. reply yellow_lead 2 hours agorootparentIf you can do all that in 30 minutes (or even a few hours), I would love to read an article/post about your setup, or any resources you might recommend. reply sroussey 5 hours agorootparentprevI spent zero hours on a MySQL server on bare hardware for seven years. Admittedly, I was afraid of ever restarting as I wasn’t sure it would reboot. But still… reply jrockway 7 hours agoparentprevWhy wouldn't you use Kubernetes? There are basically 3 classes of deployments: 1) We don't have any software, so we don't have a prod environment. 2) We have 1 team that makes 1 thing, so we just launch it out of systemd. 3) We have between 2 and 1000 teams that make things and want to self-manage when stuff gets rolled out. Kubernetes is case 3. Like it or not, teams that don't coordinate with each other is how startups scale, just like big companies. You will never find a director of engineering that says \"nah, let's just have one giant team and one giant codebase\". reply otterley 7 hours agorootparentOn AWS, at least, there are alternatives such as ECS and even plain old EC2 auto scaling groups. Teams can have the autonomy to run their infrastructure however they like (subject to whatever corporate policy and compliance regime requirements they might have to adhere to). Kubernetes is appealing to many, but it is not 100% frictionless. There are upgrades to manage, control plane limits, leaky abstractions, different APIs from your cloud provider, different RBAC, and other things you might prefer to avoid. It's its own little world on top of whatever world you happen to be running your foundational infrastructure on. Or, as someone has artistically expressed it: https://blog.palark.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kubernete... reply klooney 5 hours agorootparentK8S has a credible local development and testing story, ECS and ASGs do not. The fact that there's a generic interface for load-balancer like things, and then you can have a different implementation on your laptop, in the datacenter, and in AWS, and everything ports, is huge. Also, you can bundle your load balancer config and application config together. No written description of the load balancer config + an RPM file to a disinterested different team. reply ezrast 6 hours agorootparentprevThe alternatives aren't frictionless either; many items from that image are not specific to Kubernetes. I personally find AWS API's frustrating to use, so even if I were running a one-person shop (and was bound to AWS for some reason - maybe a warlock has cursed me?) I'd lean towards managing things from EKS to get an interface that fits my brain better. It's just preference, though - EC2 auto-scaling is perfectly viable if that's your jam. reply jrockway 6 hours agorootparentprevThe iceberg is fine, but using ECS doesn't absolve you from needing to care about monitoring, affinity, audit logging, OS upgrades, authentication/IAM, etc. That's generally why organizations choose to have infrastructure teams, or to not have infrastructure at all. I have seen people rewrite Kubernetes in CloudFormation. You can do it! But it certainly isn't problem-free. reply otterley 3 hours agorootparentECS Fargate does manage the security of the node up to and including the container runtime. Patches are often applied behind the scenes, without many folks even knowing, and for those that require interruption, a restart of the task will land it on a patched node. You’re right that if you use a cloud provider, IAM is something that has to be reckoned with. But the question is, how many implementations of IAM and policy mechanisms do I want to deal with? reply kccqzy 6 hours agorootparentprevOne giant codebase is fine. Monorepo is better than lots of scattered repos linked together with git hashes. And it doesn't really get in the way of each team managing when stuff gets rolled out. reply jrockway 6 hours agorootparentI'm a big monorepo fan, but you run into that ownership problem. \"It's slow to clone\"; which team fixes that? reply Yasuraka 2 hours agorootparentsome bored guy at $trillion_dollar_company https://github.com/martinvonz/jj https://github.com/facebook/sapling reply vander_elst 3 hours agorootparentprevGoogle has one giant codebase. I am pretty sure the aren't the only ones. reply tomas789 6 hours agoparentprevThis is my case. I’m one man show ATM so no DBA. I’m still using Kubernetes. Many things can be automated as simply as helm apply. Plus you get the benefit of not having a hot mess of systemd services, ad hoc tools which you don’t remember how you configured, plethora bash scripts to do common tasks and so on. I see Kubernetes as one time (mental and time) investment that buys me somehow smoother sailing plus some other benefits. Of course it is not all rainbows and unicorns. Having a single nginx server for a single /static directory would be my dream instead of MinIO and such. reply sroussey 5 hours agorootparentI don’t push to implement Kubernetes until I had 100 engineers and a reason to use it. reply ezrast 7 hours agoparentprevBecause it works, the infra folks you hired already know how to use it, the API is slightly less awful than working with AWS directly, and your manifests are kinda sorta portable in case you need to switch hosting providers for some reason. reply paulgb 6 hours agoparentprevI think a lot of startups have a set of requirements that is something like: - I want to spin up multiple redundant instances of some set of services - I want to load balance over those services - I want some form of rolling deploy so that I don’t have downtime when I deploy - I want some form of declarative infrastructure, not click-ops Given these requirements, I can’t think of an alternative to managed k8s that isn’t more complex. reply sroussey 5 hours agorootparentA startup with no DBA does not need redundant anything. Too small. reply slyall 3 hours agorootparentPlaces get pretty big with no dedicated DBA resources these days. Last place I was at was a Fintech SaaS with 50 engineers and half a million paying customers. Running off a couple of medium ( $3k/month each range ) RDS databases with failover setup. ECS for apps. Databases looked after themselves. The senior people probably spent 20% of a FTE on stuff like optimizing it when load crept up. Place before that was a similar size and no DBA either. People just muddled though. reply mardifoufs 4 hours agorootparentprevUh? Even some larger startups don't have DBAs anymore. For better or for worse. Hell even the place I currently work in, which is not a startup at all has basically no DBA role to speak of. reply klooney 5 hours agoparentprevHelm is the only infrastructure package manager I've ever used where you could reliably get random third party things running without a ton of hassle. It's a huge advantage. reply kwillets 6 hours agoparentprevTo make up for having a better schema in Terraform than in the database. reply hayst4ck 9 hours agoprevI would love to see this type of thing from multiple sources. This reflects a lot of my own experience. I think the format of this is great. I suppose it would take a motivated individual to go around and ask people to essentially fill out a form like this to get that. reply kaycebasques 8 hours agoparentI also think it's a great format. One suggestion if we're gonna standardize around this format. Avoid the double negatives. In some cases author says \"avoided XYZ\" and then the judgment was \"no regrets\". Too many layers for me to parse there. Instead, I suggest each section being the product that was used. If you regret that product, in the details is where you mention the product you should have used. Or you have another section for product ABC and you provide the context by saying \"we adopted ABC after we abandoned XYZ\". I don't recommend trying to categorize into general areas like logging, postmortems, etc. Just do a top-level section for each product. reply brycelarkin 3 hours agoprevAwesome writeup! Just had a couple comments/questions. > Not adopting an identity platform early on The reason for not adopting an IDP early is because almost every vendor price gouges for SAML SSO integration. Would you say it's worth the cost even when you're a 3-5 person startup? > Datadog What would you recommend as an alternative? Cloudwatch? I love everything about Datadog, except for their pricing.... > Nginx load balancer for EKS ingress Any reason for doing this instead of an Application Load Balancer? Or even HA Proxy? reply danielovichdk 49 minutes agoprevI would have liked some data around why these technologies were chosen and preferably based on loads from customers. Seems like yagni to me but please prove me wrong reply ChuckMcM 6 hours agoprevThis is fabulous. I keep lists like this in my notebook(s). The critical thing here is that you shouldn't dwell on your \"wrong\" choices, instead document the choice, what you thought you were getting, what you got, and what information would have been helpful to know at the time of decision (or which information you should have given more weight at the time of the decision.) If you do this, you will consistently get better and better. And by far \"automate all the things\" is probably my number one suggestion for DevOps folks. Something that saves you 10 minutes a day pays for itself in a month when you have a couple of hours available to diagnose and fix a bug that just showed up. (5 days a week X 4 weeks X 10 minutes = 200 minutes) The exponential effect of not having to do something is much larger than most people internalize (they will say, \"This just takes me a couple of minutes to do.\" when in fact it takes 20 to 30 minutes to do and they have to do it repeatedly.) reply corentin88 40 minutes agoprevCurious about the mention of buying IPs. Anyone else can share feedback/thoughts on this? reply tofflos 1 hour agoprev> Using cert-manager to manage SSL certificates > Very intuitive to configure and has worked well with no issues. Highly recommend using it to create your Let’s Encrypt certificates for Kubernetes. > The only downside is we sometimes have ANCIENT (SaaS problems am I right?) tech stack customers that don’t trust Let’s Encrypt, and you need to go get a paid cert for those. Cert-manager allows you to use any CA you like including paid ones without automation. reply hitekker 3 hours agoprevProps to the author for writing up the results from his exercise. But I think he should focused on a few controversial ones, and not the rotes ones. Many of the decisions presented are not disagreeable (choosing slack) and some lack framing that clarifies the associated loss (Not adopting an identity platform early on). I think they're all good choices worth mentioned; I would have preferred a deeper look into the few that seemed easy and turned out to be hard, or the ones that were hard and got even harder. reply 8organicbits 2 hours agoparent> not the rotes ones It helps to hear the validation, although I think almost every decision has a dissenting voice in the HN comments. reply roughly 4 hours agoprevThe Bazel one made me chuckle - I worked at a company with an scm & build setup clearly inspired by Google’s setup. As a non-ex-Googler, I found it obviously insane, but there was just no way to get traction on that argument. I love that the rest of this list is pretty cut and dry, but Bazel is the one thing that the author can’t bring themself to say “don’t regret” even though they clearly don’t regret not using it. reply busterarm 3 hours agoparentI've seen Bazel reduce competent engineers to tears. There was a famous blog post a half-decade ago called something like \"Bazel is the worst build system, except for all the others\" and this still seems to ring true for me today. There are some teams I work with that we'll never bother to make use Bazel because we know in advance that it would cripple them. reply endisneigh 7 hours agoprevGreat post. I do wonder - what are the simplest K8s alternatives? Many say in the database world, \"use Postgres\", or \"use sqlite.\" Similarly there are those databases that are robust that no one has heard of, but are very limited like FoundationDB. Or things that are specialized and generally respected like Clickhouse. What are the equivalents of above for Kubernetes? reply Too 3 hours agoparentIt’s mainly running your own control plane that is complex. Managed k8s (EKS, AKS, GKE) is not difficult at all. Don’t listen to all the haters. It’s the same crowd who think they can replace systemd with self hacked init scripts written in bash, because they don’t trust abstractions and need to see everything the computer does step-by-step. I also stayed away for a long time due to all the fear spread here, after taking the leap, I’m not looking back. The lightweight “simpler” alternative is docker-compose. I put simpler in quotes because once you factor in all the auxiliary software needed to operate the compose files in a professional way (IaC, Ansible, monitoring, auth, VM provisioning, ...), you will accumulate the same complexity yourself, only difference is you are doing it with tools that may be more familiar to what you are used to. Kubernetes gives you a single point of control plane for all this. Does it come with a learning curve? Yes, but once you get over it there is nothing inherent about it that makes it unnecessary complex. You don’t need autoscaler, replicasets and those more advanced features just because you are on k8s. If you want to go even simpler, the clouds have offerings to just run a container, serverless, no fuzz around. I have to warn everyone though that using ACI on Azure was the biggest mistake of my career. Conceptually it sounds like a good idea but Azures execution of it is just a joke. Updating a very small container image taking upwards of 20-30 minutes, no logs on startup crashes, randomly stops serving traffic, bad integration with storage. reply busterarm 3 hours agoparentprevThe simplest k8s alternative (that is an actual alternative) is Nomad. reply marcosdumay 6 hours agoparentprevKubernetes aren't like that. It's just that, you should start with a handful of backed-up pet servers. Then manually automate their deployment when you need it. And only then go for a tool that abstracts the automated deployment when you need it. But I fear the simplest option on the Kubernetes area is Kubernetes. reply lucw 3 hours agorootparentThis is good advice, if you haven't experienced the pain of doing it yourself, you won't know what the framework does for you. There are limits to this reasoning of course, we don't reimplement everything on the stack just for the learning experience. But starting with just docker might be a good idea. reply doctor_eval 5 hours agorootparentprevI don’t know that this is good advice. I shunned k8s for a long time because of the complexity, but the managed options are so much easier to use and deploy than pet servers that I can’t justify it any more. For anything other than truly trivial cases, IMO kubernetes or (or similar, like nomad) is easier than any alternative. The stack I use is hosted Postgres and VKS from Vultr. It’s been rock solid for me, and the entire infrastructure can be stored in code. reply tomas789 6 hours agoparentprevYou can always use old boring AWS EC2 and such. And sprinkle in some Terraform if you feel fancy. That would be my “use sqlite” Kubernetes is probably “use postgres” reply 46 more comments...

Fully glazed ware is good for wet areas when the ceramic may not be entirely vitrified, as this prevents water from soaking into the ceramic body. Dry-footed ware that hasn't been high-fired will soak up moisture, eg when washing, and so cause problems - crazing, and getting very hot when used in a microwave oven (which can cause more crazing, but also burn your hand!

    "originBody": "MATT SIMON SCIENCEFEB 7, 2024 5:00 AM These States Are Basically Begging You to Get a Heat Pump You need a heat pump, ASAP. Now nine states are teaming up to accelerate the adoption of this climate superhero. PHOTOGRAPH: RALF GEITHE/GETTY IMAGES Death is coming for the old-school gas furnace—and its killer is the humble heat pump. They’re already outselling gas furnaces in the US, and now a coalition of states has signed an agreement to supercharge the gas-to-electric transition by making it as cheap and easy as possible for their residents to switch. Nine states have signed a memorandum of understanding that says that heat pumps should make up at least 65 percent of residential heating, air conditioning, and water-heating shipments by 2030. (“Shipments” here means systems manufactured, a proxy for how many are actually sold.) By 2040, these states—California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island—are aiming for 90 percent of those shipments to be heat pumps. “It’s a really strong signal from states that they’re committed to accelerating this transition to zero-emissions residential buildings,” says Emily Levin, senior policy adviser at the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), an association of air-quality agencies, which facilitated the agreement. The states will collaborate, for instance, in pursuing federal funding, developing standards for the rollout of heat pumps, and laying out an overarching plan “with priority actions to support widespread electrification of residential buildings.” Instead of burning planet-warming natural gas, a heat pump warms a building by transferring heat from the outdoor air into the interior space. Run it in the opposite direction, and it can cool the inside of a building—a heat pump is both a heater and AC unit. Because the system is electric, it can run off a grid increasingly powered by renewables like wind and solar. Even if you have to run a heat pump with electricity from fossil-fuel power plants, it’s much more efficient than a furnace, because it’s moving heat instead of creating it. A heat pump can save an average American household over $550 a year, according to one estimate. They’ve gotten so efficient that even when it’s freezing out, they can still extract warmth from the air to heat a home. You can even install a heat pump system that also warms your water. “We really need consumers to move away from dirty to clean heat, and we really want to get the message out that heat pumps are really the way to go,” says Serena McIlwain, Maryland’s secretary of the environment. “We have homeowners who are getting ready to replace their furnaces, and if they're not aware, they are not going to replace it with a heat pump.” The coalition’s announcement comes just months after the federal government doubled down on its own commitment to heat pumps, announcing $169 million in funding for the domestic production of the systems. That money comes from 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act, which also provides an American household with thousands of dollars in rebates or tax credits to switch to a heat pump. These states are aiming to further collaborate with those heat pump manufacturers by tracking sales and overall progress, sending a signal to the industry to ramp up production to meet the ensuing demand. They'll also collaborate with each other on research and generally share information, working toward the best strategies for realizing the transition from gas to electric. Basically, they’re pursuing a sort of standardization of the policies and regulations for getting more heat pumps built, bought, and installed, which other states outside of the coalition might eventually tap into. MOST POPULAR GEAR The Best Valentine’s Day Sex Toy Deals JAINA GREY CULTURE The 43 Best Shows on Netflix Right Now MATT KAMEN POLITICS Russian Memes Celebrate ‘Tucker Carlson Day’ After Putin Interview DAVID GILBERT BUSINESS Here’s the Thing AI Just Can’t Do STEVEN LEVY “A consistent approach between states helps to ease the market transition,” says Matt Casale, senior manager of appliance standards at the Building Decarbonization Coalition, which is collaborating with the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. “There are all of these manufacturers, and all of these contractors, all along the supply chain, trying to plan out their next several years. They want to know: What is it going to look like?” There’s also the less-talked-about challenge of the green energy revolution: training enough technicians to actually install the heat pumps. To that end, the memorandum calls for workforce development and contractor training. “If we’re pushing heat pumps and more installations, and we don’t have enough electricians to do the job, we’re not going to meet the goal—period,” says McIlwain. “We do need to put a lot of money and energy and resources into making sure that we have the workforce available to do it.” In addition to the technicians working with the systems, the country needs way more electricians to retrofit homes to go fully electric beyond heat pumps, with solar panels and induction stoves and home batteries. To help there, last year the White House announced the formation of the American Climate Corps, which aims to put more than 20,000 people to work in clean energy and overall climate resilience. With states collaborating like this on heat pumps, the idea is to lift the device from an obscure technology cherished by climate nerds into ubiquity, for the good of consumers and the planet. “We need to be sending these unmistakable signals to the marketplace that heat pumps and zero-emission homes are the future,” says Casale. “This agreement between this many states really sets the stage for doing that.”",

    "commentBody": "Nine US states are teaming up to accelerate the adoption of heat pumps (wired.com)400 points by LinuxBender 18 hours agohidepastfavorite623 comments mdasen 14 hours agoOne of the big problems with heat pumps in New England is that our electricity costs 1.7x the US average (https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.ph...). If you're in the South, a heat pump makes perfect sense. You're going to want AC anyway and it'll be way more efficient and save a ton of money when you want heat. In most of the country, even if it gets cold your electricity prices are still a ton cheaper. Iowa/Kansas/Missouri/Nebraska get cold, but their electric rates are less than half ours. Heat pumps do work into freezing New England temperatures, but they're a bit less efficient as it gets to zero fahrenheit. That wouldn't matter if our electric rates were more reasonable, but at our high rates a heat pump would probably cost me an additional $50/mo in the winter (compared to natural gas). That isn't so bad and our electric rates might come down as offshore wind actually starts happening. Plus it might actually be cheaper than gas given that mini-splits would mean I could choose which rooms I want to heat rather than heating the whole place as a single zone. Plus there's the option to get solar power to drive down prices. But I think the biggest issue in New England (and California) will probably be the high cost of electricity. In most of the country, heat pumps are a huge no-brainer. reply bagels 13 hours agoparentRight, the heat pump will reduce energy use to maybe 1/3 of a gas furnace, but natural gas is something like 6x cheaper for the same amount of energy, so it is an expensive folly. If California is serious about this, they need to reign in the utilities to reduce prices and or stop the attacks on solar installation. reply smcleod 11 hours agorootparentNatural gas won’t stay cheap. It was cheap here in Australia 10 years ago and now it’s so expensive no one can afford to run gas heating and it’s only going up. Now (thankfully) the government has banned the installation of new gas heating and a lot of people are getting rid of gas cooking, hot water heating etc… it’s for the best. reply jbarham 6 hours agorootparentThe only reason that natural gas prices in Australia have gone up in the past 10 years is that gas producers in the eastern states were able to start exporting gas as LNG. As of 2023, Australia is the world's second largest LNG exporter (source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1262074/global-lng-expor...) after the US (take that Russia!) and ahead of Qatar. Great for the gas exporting cartel but not so great for ordinary Australians in eastern states who now pay the same for gas as people in Tokyo. (And Aussies wonder why manufacturers keep leaving...) Banning domestic gas usage for new homes (which the fools running Victoria, the state I live in, have done) will do nothing for emissions but will mean that the gas cartel can make even more money exporting LNG to Asia. Bravo! The exception is Western Australia which is also a massive LNG exporter but has stricter domestic reservation requirements than the eastern states. All of the above has been extensively documented at https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/ (source: https://www.google.com.au/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww....). reply paranoidrobot 5 hours agorootparent> will do nothing for emissions How can that be? Direct consumption emissions are eliminated. Those with solar (a growing percentage) reduce their indirect emissions from grid non-renewable generators. And there is a growing percentage of green generation on the grid. reply jbarham 5 hours agorootparent>> will do nothing for emissions > How can that be? Because a reduction of domestic gas usage will just be diverted to less efficient LNG exports. Given that by far the largest source of Victoria's electricity generation capacity is from dirty brown coal [1] if anything banning domestic gas usage might even make emissions worse since it will force people to use only electricity for cooking and heating. > Direct consumption emissions are eliminated.

If it displaces burning coal in Asia, maybe it is? https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14670874 reply paranoidrobot 1 hour agorootparentprevThe chart you link to shows that Brown Coal, as both a total, and as an overall percentage of the grid, is decreasing, with renewables increasing. Indeed, if you look at the three Brown Coal generators in Victoria[1], Yallorn is due to shut down in 2028 taking ~30% (1480MW) of that away, followed by Loy Yang A in 2035 which will take another ~40% (2200MW) of that capacity. So, banning new LNG appliances now, and starting that migration will have a net positive impact. This is true even if the LNG continues to be burned overseas if it's replacing coal fired generation capacity.

That doesn't seem like a winning strategy. Someone always has to be last. reply tsimionescu 9 minutes agorootparentIf you want to help the environment, you regulate both gas usage and exports. The goal is to keep gas in the ground, where it belongs, not to move it to other countries. looofooo0 3 hours agorootparentprevIt is stupid, with less Gas available on the LNG Market other LNG Producers will increase production or they will use other Energy sources such as coal. reply paranoidrobot 2 hours agorootparentIt's banning the installation of NEW LNG appliances in homes in Victoria. It doesn't impact commercial use of LNG, or the extraction or export of LNG. reply rmm 4 hours agorootparentprevThis. Have friends in this industry. The biggest pushers of no domestic gas are the producers and finance guys. They make a lot more money on exports. reply AnarchismIsCool 1 hour agorootparentprevIt costs money to transport LNG abroad. Ships, terminal infrastructure maintenance, people, it's all overhead. Ultimately if people stop using natural gas domestically there will be a reduction in production because that overhead eats into the profits of the producers. reply letitbeirie 4 hours agorootparentprevDepends where you are. In the US natural gas is a byproduct of shale oil extraction and we have a limited capacity to move or export it so it's almost priced as a waste product. It's unlikely that electricity will be any cheaper than gas soon either, since that's where 40% (and growing, as our coal and nuclear fleet are retired) of our electricity comes from. reply rmm 4 hours agorootparentprevIt will stay cheap in most of Australia and United States.

Although the cost of electricity is important, when deciding on using a heat pump for heat, the big question is the cost of electricity for heating, relative to the cost of the fuel you are already using (natural gas, propane, oil, etc.). It's definitely annoying to calculate! Since a heat pump's efficiency can vary with the outside temperature, it takes a bit of work to estimate your potential added electricity cost. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentAlso cost of capital for installing the heat pump, if a new installation. reply mullingitover 10 hours agorootparentTo me the heat was a freebie. I installed it for the AC, wasn't expecting to use it for heat at all. reply valenterry 6 hours agorootparentprevModern great heatpumps, installed correctly, are rather between 5 and 7 in terms of COP. Also, even the best gas heating systems only achieve 90% efficiency. In other words, it either be very very very cold in your area, or you have to screw up the installation before gas has lower running(!) costs. Besides that, a gas power plant easily achieves 33% of efficiency for generating electricity from gas, rather 50% for the new ones. In other words, if the price for electricity is more than 3 times as high as gas, there is a high chance that it's due to tax, regulations, etc. Though, the price for maintaining a stronger power grid comes on top. reply Retric 11 hours agorootparentprevIn the continental US you get ~2x the heat from burning natural gas in a combined cycle turbine to run a heat pump than you would from using a high efficiency gas furnace. The market price of electricity vs gas varies quite a bit through time and various distortions of the market. Currently gas is cheap, but you want to compare historical averages when buying something that lasts 15+ years not simply look at current rates. reply Aloha 11 hours agorootparentI don't think your math adds up. Combined cycle is like at most 70% efficient, subtract 10% of distribution, you end up with 60%. At 50f my 5T heat pump takes 6.6 kWh to generate 50,000 BTU. 6 kWh of energy takes 71cf of gas to make - accounting for transmission and generation losses. 71cf of gas will make 71,000 BTU of heat, assuming an 80% efficiency furnace, that comes out to 56,000 BTU usable. Yes a heat pump will vastly outperform resistive strip heat - but not even an 80% gas furnace. reply aero_code 10 hours agorootparentI don't think the numbers are accurate in the quantity of gas. Since kWh and BTU are both units of energy, finding the cf of gas is unnecessary (assuming the efficiency numbers are correct). 1 kWh = 3.6 megajoules and 1 BTU = 1055 joules The 6.6 kWh of the heat pump is 23.76 MJ which is 22,521 BTU of energy. Assuming that the power plant and distribution are 60%, it would take 37,535 BTU of gas to produce (22,521/60%). Instead, using that 37,535 BTU of gas in an 80% efficient furnace would only produce 30,028 BTU of heat, which is worse than the 50,000 BTU from the heat pump. I'm pretty sure even a poor heat pump will be more efficient than heating directly with gas. (Of course, they have drawbacks, like they can leak their refrigerant that causes more of a greenhouse effect than CO2.) reply Reason077 7 hours agorootparent> \"(Of course, they have drawbacks, like they can leak their refrigerant that causes more of a greenhouse effect than CO2.)\" My heat pump contains 2.1 kg of R32 refrigerant. R32 has a GWP of 675, so that 2.1 kg is the equivalent of 1417 kgs of CO2. (older refrigerants were much worse!) Heat pumps should never leak their refrigerant during their lifetime, and installers will remove and recycle the refrigerant when servicing or decommissioning systems. But of course, accidents happen, so let's pessimistically assume that 50% of systems installed will eventually leak. In the real world it's hopefully far less than that, but that would mean on average 708 kg CO2e in refrigerant is emitted per system over its lifetime. On the other hand, heating a typical US home with natural gas emits 2900 kgs of CO2 per year. I think it's safe to say that the climate impact of refrigerant leaks in modern heat pump systems is minuscule compared to that of the CO2 emitted from natural gas heating. reply Aloha 9 hours agorootparentprevYou kinda do need to figure that out - EIA says that it takes 7.42cf of gas to make 1kWh of energy. https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=667&t=8 I dont know where EIA gets those numbers, but that was the basis of my calculation. Maybe I shouldn't have multiplied that by the efficiency of the plant, but rather just taken of distribution losses. reply Retric 8 hours agorootparentThey are averaging the efficiency from the current fleet of gas turbines after subtracting the useful heat output and coming up with 44.4%. However, it’s a misleading number in multiple ways because the fleet is made up of a mix of low and high efficiency turbines. Grid operators use a mix of turbine types as a cost optimization, a far cheaper and far less efficient turbine that’s only used 1% of the time it worth it. The average number of kWh per cf of gas is therefore heavily in favor of high efficiency turbines. reply contravariant 7 hours agorootparentprevDear god how do you keep sane with those kinds of units? You're making it so confusing you fail to realise some of your numbers don't quite line up In sane units: - 2 m^3 of gas generates 6.6 kWh of electricity - which generates 14.7 kWh of heat (at some temperature differential). - The same 2 m^3 of gas generates 20.8 kWh of heat - of which about 16.4 kWh is usable assuming some losses. Of course your implied electricity generation is only around 31% efficient, so I'm not sure what that 60% you mention in the beginning is about. The COP you're using is around 2.2, which together with a 60% efficiency for generating electricity would be greater than 1, outstripping anything that's physically possible to achieve with a furnace. reply stephen_g 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat kind of system do you have that is only giving you (if I’ve converted the those very confusing units correctly) a COP of 2.2 at 10° C? That’s really very poor… There are air-to-water units that can achieve COP > 4 at 0° C, and even a good air-to-air should still be over COP 3… I’d expect to see a COP like that at -15° C or below on a modern unit… reply Aloha 10 hours agorootparentShould have been 60,000 BTU, I read the wrong column reply Retric 10 hours agorootparentprevReplace your heat pump? People installing new heat pumps are going to see much higher efficiency. 50,000 BTU = 5.27528 * 10 ^ 7 J = 14.6 kWh / 6.6 kWh = COP of 2.2 at 50f which is absolutely terrible. Modern heat pumps should have a COP around 4 at those temperatures and 3 near freezing. Also, “Subtracting 10%” would mean your grid losses are 17%. “annual electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) losses averaged about 5% of the electricity transmitted and distributed in the United States in 2018 through 2022.” So, (70% * (1 - 5%)) = 66.5%, but resistive losses are reduced in the cold. https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=105&t=3 4 * 0.665 = 2.66x though obviously what matters here is the annual average COP.

Can you share what you're referring to? reply SECProto 13 hours agorootparentAll electricity generation throughout the US is subsidized in various ways already - eg low interest loans for new generation capacity, programs for low income earners, not (or not effectively) charging for carbon and methane emissions, low fuel taxes on sources used for electricity generation. The \"subsidies\" you list help make a desirable energy source compete on a more level playing field - matching benefits that competing energy sources already receive. reply gnicholas 12 hours agorootparentMy understanding is that when utilities buy energy from solar farms, they do so based on the demand and available supply, meaning that solar farms get paid more or less depending on these factors. But with net metering for residential solar installations, utilities are buying independent of supply/demand, which gives the residents a subsidy even vis-a-vis other solar producers. I understand that all kinds of energy production methods are subsidized, but if net metering lets residential solar owners get paid more for the energy they produce than solar farms would be paid, I don't see how that's anything but a subsidy. reply Retric 12 hours agorootparentMost US solar farms have a power purchase agreement that’s independent of real time market prices. Solar farms agree because being paid 2c/kWh or whatever for the first X years guarantees they can repay all loans. Utilities agree because it’s guaranteed to save them money. Those power purchase agreements then makes it really easy to get loans. reply SECProto 12 hours agorootparentprevThere are all kinds of complications - commercial solar isn't dispatchable so it does tend to get lower rates than most other sources. In my jurisdiction residential (net metering) customers are only allowed to install a certain numbers of panels - corresponding with household energy consumption and assumed production levels (i.e. your monthly bill will never be negative - at lowest you'll be paying distribution charges and 0 for consumption). With low levels of residential solar installation, locally installed panels can help balance the grid as it is consumed on distribution lines and doesnt need transmission lines (conversely, high levels can unbalance the grid). > if net metering lets residential solar owners get paid more for the energy they produce than solar farms would be paid, I don't see how that's anything but a subsidy.

The price is simply going up for customers who are not poor. I don't see how this makes someone more or less likely to switch to solar, since the dollar amount they can save stays the same. An analogy: your kid's preschool has an option where you can volunteer once a month and save $50/month. One day, they announce that they are going to institute a new fee that ranges from $10-100, depending on your income. How does that new fee cause fewer people to decide to volunteer? reply bagels 8 hours agorootparentPreviously: Spend $60k to save $200/month Now: Spend $60k to save $100/month Break even would then be much further in to the future.

I have also had conversations about this specific question with a friend who has a PhD in urban planning, lives in CA, and is in the process of installing solar panels. It's possible she's wrong, but everything she says lines up with what I have read. It sounds like you're referring to the net metering changes, which are separate from the income-based fee.

Money is fungible and not unlimited - a dollar that goes to subsidize residential rooftop solar is a dollar that would go much, much further if it was used to subsidize utility grade solar or wind. Rooftop solar subsidies are also unusual in that much of the subsidy is often paid by less well-off households to subsidize their wealthier neighbors - sort of a reverse Robinhood scheme. reply gnicholas 13 hours agorootparentprevI don't generally view the removal of subsidies as being \"attacks\". I view that as the end of the free money. reply what_ever 13 hours agorootparentprevIs net metering a subsidy? reply wongarsu 12 hours agorootparentIf few people use net metering it's kind of fair. Your solar installation generates electricity, any excess gets delivered to your neighbors. The electricity is providing the infrastructure for that without making any money on that specific transaction (it gets deducted from your meter and added to your neighbors' meter), but that's easy enough to account for in base fees. The issues start if too many people do net metering. Imagine everyone has a solar roof and reaches net-zero electricity. You can still maintain the infrastructure with base fees, but the electricity company still has to run power plants in the morning and evening when demand outstrips solar supply, and for baseload in the night. And during the day there's now an oversupply of electricity that they somehow have to sell. In commercial electricity generation many countries have a kind of spot market for electricity, where prices are determined by demand (down to the minute) and available supply. Prices can go close to zero if lots of solar and wind capacity is available, or far above the price charged to consumer for capacity to cover the evening peak. If we changed consumer prices to more accurately reflected this \"true\" market price (plus markup for the grid operator), with prices changing by the minute, net metering would be pretty fair. But so far there's little desire to dump all that complexity on regular consumers. reply secabeen 11 hours agorootparent> You can still maintain the infrastructure with base fees In theory yes, but the grid has not used properly scoped base fees to pay for infrastructure.

Like, a new power pole costs (say) $1000 regardless of how many watts are going through the wires attached to it. Someone has to pay the person that cut down the tree and hauled it to its final location money. That they loan you money on the infrastructure and you repay through using electricity isn't the actual cost model, it's just a pricing model people are OK with. When it stops working, the model will have to change. I always laughed about the pricing structure of the business ISP that I worked at. We charged $1000 to install your service, then $1000 per month (without a contract). This was a financial game; we would lose money if you cancelled after your first month. I always thought the pricing should be $15,000 to install, and then $5 per month. That's closer to what the actual costs are. But instead of you going to the bank to get a loan to pay the $15,000, we hid that for you. It made more people sign up, and we had a better source of funding than bank loans. But, at the end of the day, we would have been out of business if a bunch of people signed up and didn't pay. If that happened, I imagine the pricing would have changed to reflect actual costs. reply gnicholas 10 hours agorootparentComcast quoted rates in this range for installations in areas near Palo Alto.

Someone has to pay the person that cut down the tree and hauled it to its final location money. That pole is carrying the power for, say, 100 people. Half of them use a below-average amount of electricity. If you stick them with a $100/month fixed fee, they don't need a large solar/battery system to get off the grid entirely, so you've made that economical and that's what they do. Now you have the same number of poles and half as many customers, so the fixed fee rises to $200/month, and more customers do the same thing. This is not going to a great place. Meanwhile there is a rural road somewhere that only has two things on it. One is a large commercial operation and the other is somebody's house. Putting up poles along that road is going to cost $100,000, but the commercial operation is content to pay the entire amount because their alternative is buying land somewhere that it costs significantly more than $100,000 more. The house on the same road is not content to pay half of that and will just use their $50,000 to install a solar/battery system and have quite a bit left over, even though a model where they only pay for usage would get them to sign up, and the power company is installing the poles either way. The problem we're looking at is that if you charge a fixed fee for a grid connection, low users opt out of the grid, and then the fixed fee goes up and creates a new set of low users. But if you charge for distribution per kWh, everybody installs local solar generation because it's cheaper than any generation method that has a significant distribution fee as part of the cost per kWh, which in turn raises the distribution component of the price per kWh even more. Under the first option, a large proportion of rural and suburban customers aren't going to want a grid connection at all. Under the second option, they'll take the grid connection but then only use it if local generation isn't available (i.e. it's cloudy) and the grid price per kWh at those times will be quite high. But that's plausibly the better of the two alternatives, because a grid connection with a high price per kWh will generally be better than losing power at those times, or having enough local storage/generation to prevent that from ever happening even in rare circumstances. A third option is to charge everyone the fixed fee for the power grid and force them to take a grid connection even if that isn't economical, but that's even worse. You've essentially created a head tax with no way to avoid it even if you can't afford it, because you can't cancel your service and you can't pay less by reducing consumption. reply bagels 9 hours agorootparentThere's a pole in my backyard.

If a customer is permitted to buy as much electricity as they want at a fixed price while also being able to sell as much as they can at a different time at a fixed price, it seems like there's an obvious subsidy happening anytime they sell electricity at other than when the wholesale price is the highest or buy other than when the wholesale price is lowest.

I wish I could find a study that properly quantified this. reply Tarball10 10 hours agorootparentprevThe cheap homebuilders around here (midwest) are still putting standard 80% efficiency gas furnaces which draw interior air in brand new homes. reply giobox 13 hours agorootparentprevMy experience in the US at least is that its not uncommon for the furnace air intake to draw air from inside the house (my last two homes in PNW as one example). reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentThat used to be very common in the US, and there are a lot of old systems still working. However every new furnace I've seen is installed to use outside air. Using outside air needs $100 more in parts and labor and it prevents air balance issues in modern well sealed houses. reply CaliforniaKarl 12 hours agorootparentprevThe furnace my parents (who live in Ohio) installed 10+ years ago uses outside air for combustion, not conditioned inside air. As it's older, it's not got a 99 AFUE, but it's high (I think in the low 90s). reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentprevYou could get high efficiency with a furnace that uses inside air, but they’re basically no longer installed. 20 years ago quite common. reply zbrozek 12 hours agorootparentprevCalifornia resident here.

In Oakland for the baseline tier on the time of use plan: Peak is $0.51536 (delivery) - $0.10556 (baseline credit) + $0.16225 (generation via East Bay Community Energy / Ava) or just over of $0.57 per kWh. Off-peak is $0.48701 - $0.10556 - $0.13772 or just shy of $0.52/kWh. Add that baseline credit back in for when you reach tier 2 (currently 12.9 kWh/day for my apartment which factors in winter usage and electric heat). I have about 3.5 kW of baseboard heaters (and use 2.75 kW at most). Whatever the duty cycle is to keep the apartment at 60°F 24x7 is well more than 12.9 kWh so obviously I don't do that anymore.

If heat pumps and electric water heaters were set up to run more when the sun is out, it would noticeably decrease the evening spike in electricity demand. reply bbarn 11 hours agorootparentprevSolar with Battery storage is a very useful source for heating energy, even in the coldest climates in CA. Even in the mountains where it drops below freezing at night, most places it's still sunny a lot more than the US average during the day. Most Battery setups I know of target a 4 day stretch of cloud cover for storage capacity, so it is certainly an option. Where I live at 7000 feet, we have so much sunshine, even in winter, solar is a very viable option. Legislation removing people's ability to recoup the costs is the only reason it's not in every house in the city. The only option left is a much more costly battery setup. reply PaulDavisThe1st 10 hours agorootparentWhere I live, at 6200 feet, we have oodles of sunshine. Even so, the air-source heat pumps in my old adobe use 3x more than we generate (which in turn is 3x more than we need during the summer). No (sane, residential) battery system can handle this. Which mostly goes to show the value and necessity for serious insulation and air-sealing, which this house does not have.

This is $0.30/kWh at $2/therm, compared to the $0.323/kWh I pay the power company. If you were doing this for real you'd put in the work to find something more efficient than this unit, which would then be enough to make up for the cost of the generator and the maintenance.

Well the proposal was to run a small engine powering a generator, then you cool the engine to heat the house, while the electric is sold (or otherwise powers the house). However modern gas furnaces are > 90% efficient and it is hard to get an engine that efficient for heat (remember the engine will be running indoors so it needs to not fill the house with noise of CO).

Ultimately you have a gas that you compress to release heat (outside for AC, inside for heat pump), which then expands (inside for A/C, outside for a heat pump). The compressor can run off a pedal bike for all it cares. reply tootie 8 hours agorootparentprev> 6x cheaper It will have a lower price but not a lower cost. At this point we can't wait for price efficiency we have to pay whatever dollar amount to avoid the catastrophic human costs of burning fossil fuels. reply colechristensen 13 hours agorootparentprevUtilities cost excesses in California are largely PG&E paying for its liability for causing wildfires in places where people probably shouldn’t live anyway. For example Silicon Valley Power which serves Santa Clara (or something like that) has rates that are literally half as much as PG&E. In Minnesota I’m paying for Xcel Energy’s mistakes in Texas. reply s1artibartfast 10 hours agorootparentPeople should be able to live wherever they want. That doesn't imply others should have to subsidize them doing so. It is really quite simple. If someone remote wants power, they should secure power and pay for it at a market clearing rate, given the cost and risk to deliver it. reply AnthonyMouse 7 hours agorootparentThis is something else. California has wildfires, and climate change has made them worse. Then the people who built their houses in a silly place prone to wildfires watch them burn down. This is becoming a problem as the frequency which with it happens increases, because it can bankrupt fire insurance companies (who then can't pay claims), or make fire insurance there unaffordable and then people don't buy it, their house burns down, and you have angry constituents. The political solution to this is to put the liability on the power company whenever possible, even though it isn't really their fault. The fire is caused by dry conditions and that wood is going up the first time there is any kind of flame anywhere near it. If it wasn't PG&E it would have been a lightning strike or something else. Having the fires less often can actually make them worse. But the power company is a deep pocket, so if there is any way to pin the fire on them, that's what everybody wants to do, so that the uninsured people in the fire zone can collect from someone and the currently insured people who are still there don't become unable to afford fire insurance. Then the power company raises rates on everybody in their service area, including people who don't live in high fire risk areas, because the government has them acting as the fire insurance company, but now you can't cancel your \"fire insurance\" without turning off your electricity and it also has to be paid by people who didn't build their house in a silly place. reply s1artibartfast 2 hours agorootparentI pretty strongly disagree. There is some liability on the state and voters for anti burn policy. However, there is more liability on the PG&E for failure to adequately mitigate risk, and failure to asses and frontload charges for probable payment. If homes are uninsurable, then they shouldn't be. That should only be an issue for an insurer and home owner to work out. If people want to live somewhere uninsurable, or with more expensive power, I have no issue whatsoever, and won't call them silly. That is their perogitive and values. I view it the same way as if someone wants to base jump, or eat a $500 steak. I fully support them doing whatever makes them happy, as long as they don't expect me to pay for it reply kccqzy 9 hours agorootparentprevIt's not just about causing wildfires in places where people shouldn't live, but causing wildfires in places that no people actually live, but these places happen to be between other places where people live. reply newZWhoDis 11 hours agorootparentprevThe point you’re missing is electricity should never be expensive, if it is then you’re doing something very stupid. reply oooyay 13 hours agoparentprevYeah, I made this mistake this year. I pumped $20k into a heat pump system, coming from what used to be Natural Gas. I wasn't given any kind of relief because I live in Oregon where most relief is income based. Then at the beginning of the year PGE announced a 20% rate hike. My house is covered in trees, so solar isn't really an option. I really regretted my decision once I got a $300-$400 bill for heating three months in a row. In the summer I now have AC where I didn't at all before, but it hardly makes up for the cost of a heat pump during winter. I probably won't be doing any of these kinds programs again. reply jdeibele 12 hours agorootparentI'm moving from Portland to McMinnville in a couple of months.

While those cycles run, heat couldn't. Except that even emergency heat (heating element inside) would disable the outside defrost, supposedly to meet EPA set energy budget, not technology limits.

You get about 1-ton of heating/cooling per 100' of drilled well. reply Animats 2 hours agorootparent\"Artesian\" does not mean \"drilled\". It means the well emits water without pumping. You have to be downhill from the watershed for that to work. reply aurizon 12 hours agorootparentprevThe big cost for ground source HP, is the large area you have to dig with 4 foot deep trenches. I have seen one where the installer digs 2 trenches about 16 feet apart and 30 feet long down to 6 feet. They then use a soil drill to make about 50-60 holes between the trenches and insert 17 foot plastic pipes(1 inch diameter) They then connect the pipes on each side to a common pipe(3\"), all well sealed ABS pipes below the frost line. This allow for a large volume of coupled and warm(55 degrees) that the heat pump extracts/deposits heat as needed for heating/cooling the home.

An electric vehicle is on the order of 5X more efficient than a gasoline vehicle per kWh (that is, an EV that will go 5 km on 1 kWh of electricity would be lucky to get 1 km per kWh if it were running on gasoline). So in this case, it's still cheaper to operate an EV than a gasoline vehicle in MA, even if electricity costs more per kWh. reply jhallenworld 8 hours agorootparentIt's more like 2.5 to 3x for good ICE cars (they are around 30% efficient- I think it's been going up over the years, in the past I assumed 15%): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency#:~:text=in%2.... But anyway, the big issue is for electric cars fast chargers, more like $.48 / kwh..

(I'm guessing it's significantly worse than this in the USA where the average vehicle is larger and there is less focus on fuel efficiency) At 8.9 kWh per litre, that means gasoline takes 81.88 kWh to get you 100 km. A typical EV, on the other hand, will use about 18 kWh to go 100 km (at 5.5 km per kWh). That makes the EV around 4.5 times more efficient. As for carbon emissions, burning 1 litre of gasoline creates 2.3kg of CO2. At 9.2 litres per 100 km, that works out around 210g per km. Grid carbon intensity varies greatly by country and region. In France at only 42g/kWh, an EV's energy would emit less than 10g per km, even after accounting for grid and charging inefficiencies! But even in coal-dependent Germany at 354g CO2/kWh (2023), an EV would be well under 100g per km, still better than an average petrol car. (Also, remember that auto industry emissions/efficiency numbers are based on testing protocols which produce far lower figures than the real world. And do not account for upstream emissions in the fossil fuel supply chain - there is an awful lot of upstream carbon emitted to produce 1 litre of gasoline!) reply skywal_l 1 minute agorootparentI agree we should look at the whole picture but that would mean to look at how much CO2 is rejected to produce an EV compare to a Petrol car, and how much to recycle it. jefftk 12 hours agoparentprevThat's right.

It is basically a hot water tank so doesn't last through the night However for other hydronic applications such as solar water heaters there is typically a thermal storage tank which can help store heat like a battery. Keep in mind a few things. One is some heat pumps are now operating down around -22*F. Second is geothermal is a water to water heat pump that isn't affected as much by the limitations of air temperature (but has other limitations). Third is radiant heat flooring with tubes in concrete acts as a thermal storage tank. Finally heat pumps for heating work best at low temperature hydronic water and can also be used for other applications such as DHW (domestic hot water) which needs to be at slightly higher temperatures than a buffer tank has. reply smeej 9 hours agorootparentprevMaybe, but unless your house is very well insulated, this would probably require making the home so warm as to be very uncomfortable.

They will pair to low ambient temperature capable condensers. Daikin FXTQ series models Mitsubishi SVZ series models If you are searching. I don't think having backup heat is a terrible idea, but it could be any fuel source. The fan should still function with minimal power to circulate air as long as there's some heat to move around. reply lsllc 8 hours agorootparentprevThe ideal design (IMHO) for a cold-climate (such as New England) is forced air ducting with a heat pump (better GSHP than ASHP if possible) with a 2-zone high efficiency natural gas boiler for domestic hot water and AUX heat. People always forget the hot water. A GSHP usually has a de-superheater that can provide some heat during the shoulder seasons, but you can't rely on it and need the backup heat (as you do for the AUX heat for both when it's super-cold out and for the defrost cycle). reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentprevThat is what I got: a heatpump good to about 28F, and natural gas backup. I still save a lot of money over the previous 50 year old propane furnace. However so many variables changed at once I can't say if it was worth it. reply pkulak 7 hours agoparentprevTradesfolk are _so_ political, it boggles my mind. I own a house, and need to get quotes for HVAC and plumbing stuff occasionally, and holy shit, I do not look forward to those conversations. Just nodding my head for 15 minutes while they look over my setup ranting about what they heard on cable TV last week. I mean, it's good to force me out of my bubble, but maybe not right into the deep end where, and this is from about 8 hours ago, \"heat pumps are no good in the Pacific Northwest because they use more electricity than resistive heating\". The PNW: a climate renowned for two things: rain and mild temperatures, where heat pumps are no good. All I can do is nod and say \"uh huh\". reply huytersd 14 hours agoparentprevIf you’re somewhat rural the contractors just don’t have the experience to do it so they try to quote you out of the decision. I had to shop around until I found a contractor that had done this before and I was able to get a whole home heat pump for about the same price as a regular furnace/AC system (because of the rebates). reply bonton89 14 hours agorootparentA guy at work doesn't have a heatpump, just some really high efficiency oil boiler. He lives in a rural area and basically had to become an expert on maintaining and repairing it himself because no one seems to know how to service the thing. My father had similar issues with his new boiler although in his case after constant failed repair attempts his local place finally hired some guy who knew what he was doing. There's also rebates on heatpumps around here but local forums seem to suggest that the installers are super backed up and quote \"go away\" prices. You can't get the rebate unless you go with a state approved installer, so even if you can install it yourself you're out of luck. Seems like they've just raised their prices to compensate for the rebate since they already had to much work. reply TuringNYC 14 hours agorootparentprev>> I had to shop around until I found a contractor that had done this before and I was able to get a whole home heat pump for about the same price as a regular furnace/AC system (because of the rebates). Not sure the trouble is over. You are only good until you need servicing, and then you need to shop around again. Servicing is even worse, because it is an acute problem and you are under so much time pressure to solve the issue. Sometimes even the company that sold the unit does not honor their warranty. They shut down. They re-incorporate under a new company, etc. reply readingnews 13 hours agorootparentprevI thought of that, I am not rural (town is about 300,000 people)... Perhaps that is rural in some areas I guess. The HVAC contractors here are pretty small, maybe they do not want to take the risk. As someone else said, if I had more time, I would have purchased a few DIY split systems... I might do that for AC only, as I did not replace the AC at that time. reply bluedino 14 hours agorootparentprev> If you’re somewhat rural the contractors just don’t have the experience to do it so they try to quote you out of the decision. Or they're so busy they can pick and choose their jobs. I had a quote to replace a 12 foot section of pipe come in at $700, not even two hours worth of work. reply TheBlight 14 hours agorootparentprevHow well do they function? Do they provide nice consistent heat? How's the noise? Sorry to clog up HN with a random request of a product quality review but I'm in the market right now to replace my furnace as well. Thanks. reply gertlex 14 hours agorootparentOne anecdote I've seen is that the right way to run them is to maintain a near-steady-state temperature in the house, including overnight. I'm not sure if that's maybe a bit extreme and just how they suggest use to non-savvy home-owners, but it makes sense... They're not going to blast out heat to raise the house temperature 10 degrees in an hour in the morning. Spreading heat-increase over several hours is more feasible. Good insulation presumably helps a bunch, too. For a similar reason, heat pump water heaters tend to have a larger storage tank, as they take longer to heat the water and you want more of a usage buffer. reply crazygringo 10 hours agorootparentYou don't need to run it overnight. But I do set a timer for mine to turn back on an hour before I get up. Because exactly -- it's not blasting hot air, it's merely circulating warm air. An hour beforehand works fine for mine though. reply demondemidi 14 hours agorootparentprevHeat pumps need to come with an electric heater because pumps stop working below 30 deg F. reply Fuut 14 hours agorootparentThis is just not true at all. Why do you even respond if you don't know enough about heat pumps? reply bluGill 12 hours agorootparentIt is practically true. Sure my heat pump can make heat below 28F - but it was sized for cool my house in summer and so it cannot make enough heat anymore and so I need the backup heat. reply demondemidi 12 hours agorootparentprevOh, sorry, I guess I was brainwashed by the \"anti heat pump mafia\". I had this conversation with three HVAC installers but according to this thread any HVAC installer that speaks ill of heatpumps is old and stupid. Recently, I stayed at an AirBNB recently that had a heatpump and the temps dropped during the deep freeze and it was running 100% of the time and failing. The AirBNB owner said it was brand new and I would be responsible for excessive electricity use. They didn't charge me. Based on this, I am sooo glad I replaced my dead furnace with gas three years ago and steered clear of heat pumps. But do go on about how I don't know enough. reply lkbm 11 hours agorootparentOld heat pumps didn't do well in old temperatures. In the 80s and 90s, a heat pump couldn't handle freezing temps. Modern heat pumps do fine well below 0 degrees Celsius. Here's one that's great to -15 C and okay down to -25 C[0]. If you search cold-climate heat pumps, you'll find plenty of information about how modern heat pumps are fine in most the temperatures you'll find in most of the US (including up north). (I have heard that a lot of them are still only available in Europe, but you can definitely find some in the US.) [0] https://carbonswitch.com/best-cold-climate-heat-pump/ reply Fuut 10 hours agorootparentprevYou clearly don't know if this is your only source. \"Below 0° Fahrenheit, heat pumps can still heat your home with more than twice the efficiency of gas heating or standard electric heating (such as electric furnaces and baseboard heaters). They’ve been tested and approved as far north as the Arctic Circle, and are popular options in very cold countries like Finland and Norway.\" Finland has over 60% heat pumps. And heat pumps, just to be clear, work by generating a temp difference. The main problem is the efficiency and that drops also because there is a heating cycle needed for the air intake. How many models did you actually research yourself? reply antisthenes 11 hours agorootparentprevI mean, instead of an argument you responded with some kind of rant about your Airbnb experience. So his point still stands. reply demondemidi 10 hours agorootparentThe reply made no point, so what exactly stands? Reply just said I don't know what I'm talking about, so I explained where my knowledge came from, which is more than the reply did. And somehow that's a better \"point\"? kids these days. reply Fuut 1 hour agorootparentYou clearly communicate wrong information and the answer to this is that you had some Airbnb experience and talked to three people. That's basically explaining that you did zero basic research. And I'm not a kid fyi. Learn to Google and learn to do research reply wtallis 14 hours agorootparentprevThey come with an electric heater, but they don't stop working until far below freezing point. It's normal for a heat pump to still be better than pure resistive electric heating even at 10°F. reply huytersd 13 hours agorootparentprevNot true, mine goes down to 23F with negligible decrease in efficiency and still functions after that, but with reduced efficiency. reply headsupernova 14 hours agorootparentprevThis isn't true, the latest models work at temps far below that. There are still thresholds where you'd want another source, but they're very functional even in the upper Midwest. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 14 hours agorootparentprevGround source heat pumps are available that go down significantly lower than 30F. They are more expensive. Though running the electric wires is also very expensive due to their inefficiency. Typical heat pumps are often better suited for warmer climates because of this It also appears that the tech for the more typical air source heat pumps has improved significantly in recent years which makes it more viable for colder climates reply virtue3 14 hours agorootparentI believe they run a heat conductive fluid through heat exchange coils in the ground. This allows you to pump heat into the ground during winter and extract said heat (not sure how accurate this is) during the winter. reply BobaFloutist 11 hours agorootparentYou're not storing the heat that's underground, it's just that the ground is a huge thing with massive heat storage capacity that doesn't notice weather as much as above ground does. If above ground ranges from 0-100 degrees F, underground likely ranges from like 64-68 degrees F, which makes it really energetically \"cheap\" to get to your preferred temperature range, heating to idk 70 at most and cooling to probably not even 65. reply yterdy 14 hours agoparentprevReminds me of the hissy fit plumbers made over no-flush urinals. reply lazide 10 hours agorootparentTurns out they were right about that one though. reply g8oz 6 hours agorootparentAre you sure? I still see them around in some local shopping malls. reply jazzyjackson 14 hours agoparentprevwait I didn't know I could replace my AC with a heat pump, can I replace my noisy AF condenser that's always grinding and hissing or do heat pumps make the same noises reply wtallis 14 hours agorootparentAC is just a heat pump that doesn't give you the option of running it backwards. There can be good and bad implementations of either. reply czbond 14 hours agorootparentNew to heat pumps. Can I replace sub-components of an existing AC system with a heat pump for benefits of both? reply widdakay 14 hours agorootparentI'm surprised this isn't more common. The only difference between a heat pump and standard air conditioner is a reversing valve. These are usually $50-$100, and just require one more wire to the thermostat. In colder weather, defrost and fancier controllers are needed, but for mild climates the reversing valve is really all that is needed. reply cogman10 14 hours agorootparentYou are dealing with different pressures on the refrigerant lines, but honestly that shouldn't really matter all that much. You also need a bit of logic for if the condenser starts freezing over to temporarily reverse the flow (and turn off the home fan) to defrost. But otherwise, yeah, almost identical and a little crazy they'd cost much more over a typical install. reply rainbowzootsuit 10 hours agorootparentprevOff the shelf heat pumps will have a defrost control board too, but you make a solid point. The hard part is that you have to recover the refrigerant and refill, which takes HVAC/R equipment and and EPA certification to do legally. reply sumtechguy 13 hours agorootparentprevThings like the ducts plug right in. Other things like the blower and condenser may need to be swapped out. It also depends on how old your system is. The controller will probably most certainly need to be swapped out. Do the normal thing with contractors like that. Call 3 different dudes have them come out and give you an estimate. Tell them you want quotes for partial swap out, full swap out, and 3 different price points. Within a couple of weeks you will have most of the knowledge you need if you want to do it. My parents when they switched out they replaced both the indoor unit and outdoor too because they were 30+ years old at that point. Now you probably have NG? If so you can also leave that fairly in place as is. I did that with my prev house. Then have the heat pump for when it is warm outside. Then switch over to NG when it gets to a particular temp. I set it to switch over at about 30F. I could have gone as low as 15 with that unit. It worked decently for most of the time. Where I live it maybe gets in the 20s for about a week a year at most. So the heat pump worked decently. One thing though I would say is if you have a older home especially 1990 or older start with the insulation. It is wildly cheaper to get and gets you part of the way there. Many power companies even run deals where they will help you buy it. reply esaym 13 hours agorootparentprevA \"heatpump\" is an AC with a reversing valve. Yes you can just get a reversing valve and have some hack cut and solder it in for you. I'd assume any normal contractor would charge $1000+ for that job though. It would take multiple hours for a tech when instead he could make multiple house calls in that same time (and possible making more money doing house calls). So that is why you won't find someone to do it. It make no sense. Right now on ebay you can get a \"Goodman 4 Ton 14 SEER Heat Pump\" for $1800 delivered to your doorstep. Oh and I guess another thing a heatpump has that an AC doesn't is a defrost controller board. You'd need one of those too. reply briffle 14 hours agorootparentprevI'd be very interested as well. My gas furnace is only a few years old, but my AC system is probably 10 years old. If I could replace just that with a heat pump, and leave my gas furnace in place as a backup, that would be ideal. reply turtlebits 14 hours agorootparentYou can install non ducted mini splits, which is what I did. I left my oil furnace intact and added 4 high wall units (each bedroom and living room) with 2 outdoor condenser/compressors. I still use my oil furnace when it gets below 40. reply nixgeek 14 hours agorootparentprevYou can do that. It’s very common in New England to go this way because the heat pumps generally only work down to -15F and then you need to switch to furnace for heat. reply sokoloff 14 hours agorootparentprevNot really. You replace your existing AC with a split heat pump. It's not a mix-and-match situation, but the heat pump will both heat and cool and, if you already have existing ductwork that's correctly sized, you should be fine to just drop in a heat pump. (In an extreme heating dominated climate, you could have ducts that are too small for a heat pump, but adequately sized for AC and a furnace. That's pretty uncommon though.) reply jvanderbot 14 hours agorootparentprevYou have just constructed a heat pump. Heat pumps have the benefits of both. reply ajross 14 hours agorootparentprevIn theory but not practice. No one makes that kind of conversion kit, and there are enough \"minor\" differences (e.g. heat pumps need a defrost mechanism where AC's are presumed to operate with hot ambient air) to make it impractical. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentprevA heat pump is just an air conditioner that can be run in reverse. Replacing your air conditioner might help if it makes the noise because it's old and broken, but if you just really dislike the sound of an air conditioner it probably won't help much. reply ericd 14 hours agorootparentThe variable speed inverter ones tend to be much quieter than the old single-stage ones that most people have, fwiw. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentAh, right! I actually have a variable stage regular AC unit, so that's not a benefit unique to heat pumps, that's something you can get by replacing your AC unit in general. reply modeless 14 hours agorootparentprevMaybe one of the new variable speed ones would help? reply jlawrence6809 14 hours agorootparentprevA heat pump is just an AC that can move heat in either direction so you should be able to. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 14 hours agorootparentprevA heat pump is the same technology as what your condenser is doing, just in reverse. So you could otherwise just think of an air conditioner as one half of the heat pump in this case. So no reply twiceaday 14 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's actually worse. The heat pump will make that same compressor noise when cooling in the summer AND heating in the winter. reply jxramos 13 hours agoparentprevwhat were the justifications, did you ask out of curiosity for them to share what was driving their decisions? reply Dowwie 14 hours agoparentprevwhere are you located? I was quoted 14k to replace a gas furnace for a single family in NJ reply ecshafer 14 hours agorootparentUnless that's a massive furnace that's robbery. In philly I replaced my furnace for $6k 2 years ago. reply Dowwie 12 hours agorootparentGot two quotes thus far and they're in the same ballpark. I asked for quotes in December 2023, 2 months ago. Bergen County, NJ. reply losvedir 6 hours agorootparentprevI had our gas furnace replaced this past November, a 100k BTU Rheem one, for $2,200. This was outside Chicago in Northwest Indiana, though, which is a pretty low cost of living area. I spent some time trying to get a heat pump instead, but no one around here was familiar with them. I worried that if it failed service would be a pain. reply tilwidnk 13 hours agoparentprevWe've owned three homes, our first one had a heat pump. In Virginia. It generally sucked. It wasn't as good as real A/C in the summer and wasn't as good as gas or electric heat in the winter. I hope to never end up in a place that uses a heat pump. reply hasbot 7 hours agorootparentIt may have been low on refrigerant. I'm in Virginia now and most of my neighbors have heat pumps including me.

These are two sentences that describe the same process, just in different words. The last quote is potentially relevant: a heat pump is an air conditioner that can run in reverse to provide heat in the winter, so you're running it in both situations, and thus for more time. reply ikiris 10 hours agorootparentprevMy guy, a heat pump is effectively an air conditioner with some added reversing valves. reply 284 more comments...

Away from a few dazzling patches of direct sunshine, everything glowed softly in the diffuse light: the matte white brick walls, the imitation (imitation) mahogany furniture; even the posters – Bosch, Dali, Ernst, and Giger – looked harmless, domesticated. Wherever he turned his gaze (if nowhere else), the simulation was utterly convincing; the spotlight of his attention made it so. Hypothetical light rays were being traced backwards from individual rod and cone cells on his simulated retinas, and projected out into the virtual environment to determine exactly what needed to be computed: a lot of detail near the centre of his vision, much less towards the periphery. Objects out of sight didn’t “vanish” entirely, if they influenced the ambient light, but Paul knew that the calculations would rarely be pursued beyond the crudest first-order approximations: Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights reduced to an average reflectance value, a single grey rectangle – because once his back was turned, any more detail would have been wasted. Everything in the room was as finely resolved, at any given moment, as it needed to be to fool him – no more, no less. Paul Durham keeps making Copies of himself: software simulations of his own brain and body which can be run in virtual reality, albeit seventeen times more slowly than real time. He wants them to be his guinea pigs for a set of experiments about the nature of artificial intelligence, time, and causality, but they keep changing their mind and baling out on him, shutting themselves down. Maria Deluca is an Autoverse addict; she’s unemployed and running out of money, but she can’t stop wasting her time playing around with the cellular automaton known as the Autoverse, a virtual world that follows a simple set of mathematical rules as its “laws of physics”. Paul makes Maria a very strange offer: he asks her to design a seed for an entire virtual biosphere able to exist inside the Autoverse, modelled right down to the molecular level. The job will pay well, and will allow her to indulge her obsession. There has to be a catch, though, because such a seed would be useless without a simulation of the Autoverse large enough to allow the resulting biosphere to grow and flourish — a feat far beyond the capacity of all the computers in the world.

It was great, and left me full of unfinished thoughts -- just what you want from a good SF yarn. For folks who enjoyed the ideas in it I can heartily recommend qntm's short story Lena (https://qntm.org/lena), which explores some of the same ideas but with a hefty dollop of (implied, but all the more intense for it) psychological horror. reply edanm 18 hours agoparentCan confirm - I'm a huge fan of Greg Egan and specifically Permutation city, and also a huge fan of qntm's stories. Lena is probably the most famous, though not even the best (\"I don't know Timmy\" is better IMO). Also, I finally read qntm's Antimemetics division and, while it is a bit lacking in the end, it is one of the most \"oh wow this is a crazy good idea\" stories I've read in years. reply Vetch 15 hours agorootparentI'd also wager that \"I don't know Timmy\" is more thematically related. I feel most of the discussion in this thread glosses over what is most unsettling about Permutation City. It isn't just a book about what it could be like to be a simulated mind, it's most deeply about exploring the disquieting metaphysical consequences of computable minds. I can't think of a story that has as thoroughly scattered my basic grasp of reality as this one. Only Blindsight even begins to comes close. In \"I don't know Timmy\" there's a sequence that goes: \"Well, we can't exactly turn it off.\" \"Why not?\" asked Tim, halfway to the door, then stopped mid-stride and stood still, realising. \"Oh.\" But you can turn it off without consequence and Permutation City explores the disturbing implications of why thoroughly (with a deus ex machina ending to save causal physics, as expected of an Egan story, physics is what has plot armor). reply edanm 14 hours agorootparent> I can't think of a story that has as thoroughly scattered my basic grasp of reality as this one. Only Blindsight even begins to comes close. Absolutely! Very few books have also basically changed my philosophical outlook on something as much as this has (I had the seeds of the idea before the book, but the book really cemented specific concepts around computation and thought/consciousness/identity even mean). Another book that is fairly different, but has had a big impact on some of my views of things, is the Three Body Problem trilogy (specifically the second and third book). reply zeekaran 17 hours agorootparentprevMake sure to read Ra as well. One of my favorite webfics. https://qntm.org/ra reply LeifCarrotson 16 hours agorootparentIt's one of my favorite webfics too, so I got a hardcover: https://www.amazon.com/Ra-qntm/dp/B096TRWRWX Have this in my personal library as well as a (paperback) of Permutation City. I think it's awesome they're published online but there's something special about having it in print too. reply ajmurmann 11 hours agorootparentprevI just read the Antimemetics division and qntm's short story collection.

I've always thought that folks who enjoyed Permutation City might also enjoy Glasshouse[1] by Charles Stross[2]. The two novels aren't necessarily overtly similar, but I feel like there's a sort of abstract conceptual kinship there.

Do you think Glasshouse is a good place to start with his writing and is representative of his style? I loved Permutation City, one of my favorite books. (I would've asked cstross himself but that would seem too awkward!) reply mindcrime 16 hours agorootparentDo you think Glasshouse is a good place to start with his writing and is representative of his style? Well... to me, I'd almost divide Stross' works into two tranches: the \"The Laundry Files\" books, and everything else. In that regard, I think Glasshouse is fairly representative of the \"everything else\" tranche. But even then, there's a fair amount of variance in his works. I wouldn't, for example, necessarily compare Halting State and Glasshouse, or Rule 34 and Singularity Sky. I guess that's a way of saying that while Stross has his favored themes and topics, he's far from formulaic and I don't feel like you can pigeon-hole his \"style\" too narrowly. That said, I haven't read every other work Stross has written, but I've read a pretty good chunk of them. And almost all of the \"The Laundry Files\" novels. Me personally, I recommend pretty much all of it. :-) EDIT: Just realized that there's really a 3rd major tranche of works in Stross' ouvre: the \"The Merchant Princes\" books. I forgot about those, as I haven't actually read any of them (shame, shame, I know...). All of what I've read of Stross to date is from the \"The Laundry Files\" series or the \"everything else\" batch, minus \"The Merchant Princes\". reply KineticLensman 13 hours agorootparent> I forgot about those, as I haven't actually read any of them (shame, shame, I know...) It's a really great set of stories, nine in total now, and unlike The Laundry Files, a finalised / completed story arc. They evolve quite radically, from an initial portal fantasy (reporter finds herself in an apparently medieval parallel world), via trans-dimensional techno-thriller, multi-timeline developmental economics, to high-concept space war. Highly recommended. And the Laundry Files has to be the only series I've read where vampires use agile / scrum techniques to source their blood supplies, and where an Elven combined-arms battlegroup make the Waffen-SS look like soft jessies.

How do you make sense of that? I was disappointed there wasn't a clearer motivation for it. reply AgentME 12 hours agorootparent(spoiler warning for others!) Durham's \"dust theory\" is basically that every possible universe is simulated an infinite number of times across space and time within our universe as Boltzmann brains (he doesn't call them this but his idea of random bits of dust randomly computing things is equivalent), so actually running a simulation containing mind uploads on a computer ourselves is unnecessary to allow consciousness to exist within the simulation. Durham describes the theory with a few more steps, like his idea of \"launching\" which I can't help but think Maria is correct in calling unnecessary. I think the story is trying to communicate that Durham's theory is subtly wrong or incomplete, especially when the surprising event happens at the end. I think the explanation for the surprising event at the end is (heavier spoilers ahead!) that there's a mix of Boltzmann brains running two different versions of Permutation City (one where Permutation City and the A-life universe are artificial simulations with arbitrary complicated physics and starting states exactly as we saw them be designed within the story, and one where the A-life universe is natural with a simple unified underlying physics and starting state and Permutation City is an artificial simulation/construct within it with a complicated starting state) which have been running in parallel and producing equivalent conscious experience, but by the end of the story, the latter version of Permutation City is simpler and therefore simulated in proportionally more Boltzmann brains than the first version. The latter version exists more, so when the conscious experiences of these two versions of Permutation City finally diverge, the story follows the latter version. (I'm pretty confident in this reading of it. The story makes a regular point in talking about the complexity of the artificial simulations containing mind uploads and how much they're unlike the simple unified physics of our world. The point is brought up in a way as if the author or characters expect it to have significance; the surprising event at the end of the story is this point's significance finally being seen.) reply NoMoreNicksLeft 15 hours agorootparentprev> How do you make sense of that?

I principally recommend Diaspora for far future post-human history with a strong focus on physics and maths, and Quarantine which is a sort of heist thriller with a unique quantum physics hook in a relatively near future Northern Australia setting where First Nations people have gained independence and positioned themselves as an Asian financial / biotech hub.

(Still good, just... not great.) reply prepend 18 hours agoparentprevI’ve liked every Egan book I read but also want to mention Distress. I got shipped it accidentally when I ordered Diaspora and the seller told me to keep it. It’s set in the “near future” so probably 2020 since it was published in 1998 and does a good job, I think, of talking about things that are happening now- third world empowerment, body augmentation, transgenders, precision pharmacy, biohacking. And some things we don’t have yet- artificial island nations, self-autists, custom engineered plagues. I like it because it’s one of those books that stuck with me for describing tech that “we should and one day will have” in that Egan described a “pharm” that compounds medication on the fly to precisely medicate us. For example, it will give you stimulants with your vitamix but have to counter it the next day based on how your body performs. I can’t wait for that and hate having to wait days to adjust meds. I feel similarly about Stephenson’s metaverse description and young lady’s illustrated primer, and nanodrones, and cryptocurrency. And Doctorow’s “comm” device that he described a few years before the iPhone. reply cdogl 9 hours agorootparentDistress also has a short passage explaining the collapse of the collapse of CBDs and inflation of the suburban property market and cost of living due to remote work, set in an area of suburban Sydney that’s now not far off Egan’s predictions. Few hard science fiction authors of recent decades can pull that off, as the 21st century has shown that our 20th century science fiction tropes are either already here (computing and networking revolution, hydrogen bombs, DNA sequencing) or will likely not materialise for centuries (space colonisation, mind uploading).

Permutation City seems to get talked about more, but the dust theory stuff just felt implausible, and it has one of the worst sex scenes I've ever read.

It will be neat that I think at some point we’ll be able to boost up to like 1000x with implants or whatnot and think about something that doesn’t require any new information and then return to the present with insight to continue the conversation. I hope this is affordable because it will be so handy for many things. If even to just spend more time staring at the Mona Lisa and contemplating.

The same captivating exploration of interesting ideas is omnipresent throughout his work, and that's always been why I keep coming back. I think it's important to go into his stories with an open mind towards what literature is allowed to be - namely that it can focus on things other than narrative or characterization without being a detriment to itself. A steak does not need to be as sweet as a cake in order to satisfy a diner, after all. And that's not to say that he avoids interesting narration or character development entirely, but there are definitely stories of his where he's clearly focusing on other aspects, and the choice to do that feels intentional and appropriate to me. reply edanm 14 hours agoparentWhich Egan is your favorite? reply bhaney 8 hours agorootparentIt's been years since the last one I read, so it's a bit hard to recall. But the stories that have really stuck in my mind are the results of Egan tweaking some physical law, constructing a universe that might reasonably arise under those physical conditions, and then writing a plausible adventure within that universe. Dichronauts (2 spacial and 2 time-like dimensions instead of our 3 and 1) and the Orthogonal trilogy (Riemannian spacetime instead of our \"Lorentzian\") come to mind. I just really like the care he puts into constructing these universes, from how planets form (the worlds in Dichronauts are infinite hyperboloids instead of spheres), to how scientific discovery progresses (as a result of the physics in Orthogonal, light of different frequencies travel at different speeds and visually separate as a common matter of course, which leads to a much earlier understanding of relativity by a fairly primitive civilization). It feels like he's building universes from first principles and taking care to consider every little consequence and detail, which leads to a lot of \"Ohhhhh\" moments when you encounter something counter-intuitive but then realize it directly follows as a consequence of the initial physics tweak. reply loudmax 20 hours agoprevGreg Egan's Mastodon profile is https://mathstodon.xyz/@gregeganSF He's fairly active there and likes to post math problems.

Would be cool if someone could recommend sci-fi that equally good. reply cdogl 21 hours agoparentIt’s not an easy read, but Blindsight by Peter Watts has some equally unique and compelling synthesis of scientific concepts into a big concept plot. reply zeekaran 17 hours agorootparentSemi related: If you like The Thing (1982), Watts' The Things is pretty great: https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/ reply goatlover 7 hours agorootparentBrilliant fan fiction that takes a few liberties, but it would be interesting to have The Thing's perspective if The Thing was made into a series. I think in the movies was just supposed to be cosmic horror who's only real goal was to survive by spreading. Communicating with it would be pointless, unlike in Watt's story, where you have a fundamental philosophical difference based on The Thing's understanding of biology, but you could at least have a meaningful conversation with it. reply bejd 20 hours agorootparentprevBlindsight hit all the right hard sci-fi notes for me. I've yet to find something that scratches that same itch. reply paul80808 20 hours agorootparentSecond this recommendation. Blindsight hits much harder and faster than Egan - and in my opinion the writing is much tighter. Similar focus on science-based idea exploration, particularly in regards to theories of consciousness, brain structure, probability, and vampires. If you like Egan I'd be shocked if you didn't like watts. He is one of the hidden gems of science fiction and an absolute gift to humanity. reply gpderetta 20 hours agorootparentprevBlindsight is his best book, but Watts has written a lot of great stuff, I recommend all of Rifters and, for something a bit different, especially the Sunflowers cycle. reply badcppdev 19 hours agorootparentStandard internet Watts warning that the Rift novels have random sexual torture just in case you prefer to avoid that reply gpderetta 19 hours agorootparentRight, yes, especially the last Rifter book made me wonder a bit about the sanity of the author. reply k__ 18 hours agorootparentI read the acknowledgements in some of his books and found him rather dislikeable. reply caskstrength 16 hours agorootparentYou might want to read his blog [0] to get more insight into his character.

Regardless Blindsight is a good book and definitely has interesting concepts and good writing throughout. reply davely 16 hours agorootparentprevHah, well then, maybe I just don't like vampires! In all seriousness, I thought I had seen it in a list of \"top hard sci-fi books\" awhile back and a quick Kagi search seems to imply that a lot of people seem consider it hard sci-fi for whatever reason. Maybe this means there's still a chance for me. reply k__ 19 hours agorootparentprevHaha, I already read Blindsight reply Frotag 21 hours agoparentprevBeen asking myself the same question for months. So Egan's stories are basically a mathy whodunit -- start from first (fictional) principles and eventually solve some universe-scale question or crisis. His characters are basically walking textbooks meant for info dumping / FAQing the derivations. In that light, some similar stories I've found are... - Dragon's Egg (Robert Forward) - Of Ants and Dinosaurs (Liu Cixin, 3 body problem author) - The Andromeda Strain (Crichton, more medsci than math) - Schilds Ladder, Diaspora (other Egan stuff) The first two are especially similar to Egan's stuff in that the only real character is the civilization / setting not the people. I've also tried some of the more common hard scifi recommendations like Reynolds and Stephenson, but I personally don't enjoy the dialogue / scenes meant for character development. I guess it's because the stories usually take a human-scale perspective instead of taking a what-if to its reality-bending extreme like Egan does. reply yencabulator 18 hours agorootparentYou should try the old master, Hal Clement. Mission of Gravity is a classic \"start from first principles\" story. reply k__ 19 hours agorootparentprevHm...

I’m very far from a prude, but JFC.

It's certainly quite twisted, with people taking out death contracts that allow them to die painfully (but they are ressurected by the godlike AI every time). There's also torture and other unsavoury things. To me, this was not unnecessary, but quite fundamental to the story. Everyone was trapped by the AI who would not let anyone come to harm without their permission anyway, and nobody could die. Various people tried to push back against these constraints in creative but disturbing ways. reply gpvos 21 hours agorootparentprevYou could try his other writings, such as The Curators, which I just finished and can recommend.

In the book, everything was accepted and there were weren’t any “downtrodden.” The show changed all this with the meths being super billionaires and then there being lots of poor people. And the whole thing with the rebellion. Book takashi was an envoy super spy person with immense training that stuck with him through sleeves. Tv takashi is like a rebel/terrorist who just got some training and has personality. In the book, it was fruitless to fight against the government because what’s the point? The tv show seems to want to make a more simple rebels vs big brother. Still cool, but I think changed the flavor quite a bit.

But going beyond that, if I need to do anything complicated that might hit the baked in filters on these other models I don't have to worry about it with mixtral. I'm not doing anything illegal btw.

I only found a GitHub issue (https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues/4439) that mentions that mainline llama.cpp isn't working for the model. Bonus question if you have the time: there's a release by TheBloke for this on HuggingFace (TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF); but I thought his models were \"quantised\" usually - does that kneecap any of the performance? reply Me1000 13 hours agorootparentIf you're new to this then just download an app like LMStudio (which unfortunately is closed source, but it is free) which basically just uses llama.cpp under the hood. It's simple enough to get started with local LLMs. If you want something open source ollama is probably a good place to look too, it's just a CLI tool but several GUIs integrate with ollama specifically. As for your bonus question, that is the model you want. In general I'd choose the largest quantized version that you can fit based on your system. I'm personally running the 8bit version on my M3 Max MacBook Pro and it runs great! Performance is unfortunately a loaded word when it comes to LLMs because it can mean tokens per second or it can mean perplexity (i.e. how well the LLM responds). In terms of tokens per second, quantized models usually run a little faster because memory bandwidth is a constraint, so you're moving less memory around. In terms of perplexity there are different quantization strategies that work better and worse. I really don't think there's much of a reason for anyone to use a full 16fp model for inference, you're not really gaining much there. I think most people use the 4bit quants because it's a nice balance. But really it's just a matter of playing with the models and seeing how well it works. For example, some models perform okay when quantized down to 2 bits (I'm shocked that's the case, but I've heard people say that's the case in their testing), but Mixtral is not one of those models. reply codeisawesome 3 hours agorootparentThank you so much for the detailed answer!

I credit who I am as an adult today (the good things that I like about myself) to some of the early Internet communities I became involved in. But I’m having a hard time with this: > let's not pretend that social media is a net negative I recognize that Facebook (and others) have enabled tremendously good outcomes for some of its users, but I think the jury is out on the net effect of social media as it exists today. I think it’s tempting to over index on the positive outcomes in a way that becomes fallacious - the reality is more complex: the platforms have created tremendous good. The platforms have created tremendous harm. These are not quantifiable, and any estimate of net effect is suspect as a result. The kinds of harms are the democracy threatening kind, and the mental health of a generation kind. The genocide of nations kind. I don’t think it’s possible to actually say social media has been a net good, without first addressing the ongoing harms it’s creating and charting a path to a healthier and safer implementation of the technology. The same communities and platforms I once relied on no longer resemble what they once were. The places that were tremendously positive in my life are now in many cases the exact opposite. This isn’t to say that there aren’t good places left, but to point out that even when something was arguably excellent for a time, that excellence has gradually been replaced by something else. When combined with the downright awful aspects of social media, it really calls into question the net effect. What Facebook and others provided is that tech can be extremely beneficial. But this should not mistaken for ongoing benefit. I don’t think shitty social media is inevitable. But I think it’s inevitable with the current incentive structures. Until those change, it’s difficult (and probably dangerous) to remain the techno-optimist that I once was. reply logicchains 14 hours agorootparentprevViolent crime rates are lower than ever before.

    "title": "How Shūji Nakamura Overcame Challenges to Create the First Blue LED",
    "originLink": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AF8d72mA41M",
    "originBody": "- LEDs don't get their color from their plastic covers. And you can see that because here is a transparent LED that also glows the same red color. The color of the light comes from the electronics themselves. The casing just helps us tell different LEDs apart. In 1962, general Electric engineer Nick Holonyak created the first visible LED. It glowed a faint red. A few years after that, engineers at Monsanto created a green LED. But for decades, all we had were those two colors. So LEDs could only be used in things like indicators, calculators, and watches. If only we could make blue, then we could mix red, green, and blue to make white, and every other color, unlocking LEDs for every type of lighting in the world, from light bulbs, to phones, to computers, to TVs to billboards. But blue was almost impossible to make. (dramatic music) Throughout the 1960s, every big electronics company in the world, from IBM to GE, to Bell Labs, raced to create the blue LED. They knew it would be worth billions. Despite the efforts of thousands of researchers, nothing worked. 10 years after Holonyak's original LED turned into 20, then 30, and the hope of ever using LEDs for light, faded away. According to a director at Monsanto, these won't ever replace the kitchen light. They'd only be used in appliances, car dashboards, and stereo sets to see if the stereo was on. This might still be true today, if not for one engineer who defied the entire industry and made three radical breakthroughs to create the world's first blue LED. (dramatic music) Shūji Nakamura was a researcher at a small Japanese chemical company named Nichia. They had recently expanded into the production of semiconductors to be used in the manufacture of red and green LEDs. But by the late 1980s, the semiconductor division was on its last legs. They were competing against far more established companies in a crowded market, and they were losing. Tensions started to run high. Younger employees begged Nakamura to create new products, while senior workers called his research a waste of money. And at Nichia, money was in short supply. Nakamura's lab mainly consisted of machinery he had scavenged and welded together himself. Phosphorus leaks in his lab created so many explosions, that his coworkers had stopped checking in on him. By 1988, Nakamura's supervisors were so disillusioned with his research that they told him to quit. So it was out of desperation that he brought a radical proposal to the company's founder and president Nobuo Ogawa. (dramatic music) The elusive blue LED, that the likes of of Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic had all failed at. What if Nichia could be the one to create it? After suffering loss after loss on their semiconductors for more than a decade, Ogawa took a gamble. He devoted 500 million yen or $3 million, likely around 15% of the company's annual profit, to Nakamura's moonshot Project. Everyone knew that LEDs have the potential to replace light bulbs, because light bulbs, the universal symbol for a bright idea, are actually terrible at making light. They work by running current through a tungsten filament, which gets so hot, it glows. But most of the electromagnetic radiation comes out as infrared, heat. Only a negligible fraction is visible light. In contrast, LED stands for light emitting diode. It's right there in the name. LEDs primarily create light, so they're far more efficient, and a diode is just a device with two electrodes, which only allows current to flow in one direction. So here's how an LED works. When you have an isolated atom, each electron in that atom occupies a discreet energy level. You can think of these energy levels like individual seats from a hockey stadium, and all atoms of the same element, when they are far apart from each other have identical available energy levels. But when you bring multiple atoms together to form a solid, something interesting happens. The outermost electrons now feel the pole, not only of their own nucleus, but of all the other nuclei as well. And as a result, their energy levels shift. So instead of being identical, they become a series of closely spaced, but separate energy levels. An energy band. The highest energy band with electrons in it, is known as the valence band, and the next higher energy band is called the conduction band. You can think of it like the balcony level. In conductors, the valence band is only partially filled. This means with a little bit of thermal energy, electrons can jump into nearby unfilled seats, and if an electric field is applied, they can jump from one unfilled seat to the next and conduct current through the material. In insulators, the valence band is full, and the difference in energy between the valence and conduction bands, the band gap, is large. So when an electric field is applied, no electrons can move. There are no available seats to move into in the valence band, and the band gap is too big for any electrons to jump into the conduction band, which brings us to semiconductors. Semiconductors are similar to insulators, except the band gap is much smaller. This means at room temperature, a few electrons will have sufficient energy to jump into the conduction band, and now they can easily access nearby empty seats and conduct current. Not only that, the empty seats they left behind in the valence band can also move. Well, really, it's the nearby electrons jumping into those empty seats. But if you look from afar, it's as though the empty seat or hole is moving like a positive charge in the opposite direction to the electrons in the conduction band. (soft music) By themselves, pure semiconductors are not that useful. To make them way more functional, you have to add impurity atoms into the lattice. This is known as doping. For example, in silicon, you can add a small number of phosphorus atoms. Phosphorus is similar to silicon, so it easily fits into the lattice, but it brings with it one extra valence electron. This electron exists in a donor level just beneath the conduction band. So with a bit of thermal energy, all these electrons can jump into the conduction band and conduct current. Since most of the charges that can move in this type of semiconductor are electrons, which are negative, this sort of semiconductor is called n-type, n for negative, but I should point out that the semiconductor itself is still neutral. It's just that most of the mobile charge carriers are negative. They're electrons. So there is also another type of semiconductor where most of the mobile charge carriers are positive, and it's called p-type. To make p-type silicon, you add a small number of atoms of, say, boron. Boron fits into the lattice, but brings with it one fewer valence electron than silicon. So it creates an empty acceptor level just above the valence band. And with a bit of thermal energy, electrons can jump outta the valence band, leaving behind holes. It is these positive holes which are mostly responsible for carrying current in the p-type semiconductor. Again, the material overall is uncharged, it's just that most of the mobile charge carriers are positive holes. Where things get interesting is when you put a piece of p-type and n-type together. Without even connecting this to a circuit, some electrons will diffuse from n to p and fall into the holes in the p-type. This makes the p-type a little negatively charged, and the n-type a little positively charged. So there is now an electric field inside an inert piece of material. Electrons keep diffusing until the electric field becomes so large, it prevents them from crossing over. And now we have established the depletion region, an area depleted of mobile charge carriers. There are no electrons in the conduction band and no holes in the valence band. If you connect a battery the wrong way to this diode, it simply expands the depletion region until its electric field perfectly opposes that of the battery and no current flows. But if you flip the polarity of the battery, then the depletion region shrinks, the electric field decreases, and electrons can flow from n to p. When an electron falls from the conduction band into a hole in the valence band, that band gap energy can be emitted as a photon. The energy change of the electron is emitted as light, and this is how a light emitting diode works. The size of the band gap determines the color of the light emitted. In pure silicon, the band gap is only 1.1 electron volts. So the photon released isn't visible, it's infrared light. These LEDs are actually used in remote controls for your TV, and you can capture them on camera. Moving up the spectrum, you can see why the first visible light LEDs were red and then green, and why blue was so hard. A photon of blue light requires more energy, and therefore a larger band gap. By the 1980s, after hundreds of millions of dollars had been spent hunting for the right material, every electronics company had come up empty handed. But researchers had at least figured out the first critical requirement, high quality crystal. No matter what material you used for the blue LED, it required a near perfect crystal structure. Any defects in the crystal lattice, disrupt the flow of electrons. So instead of emitting their energy as visible light, it is instead dissipated as heat. So the first step in Nakamura's proposal to Ogawa, was to disappear to Florida. He knew an old colleague there whose lab was beginning to use a new crystal making technology called Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition, or MOCVD. An MOCVD reactor, essentially a giant oven, was and still is the best way to mass produce clean crystal. It works by injecting vapor molecules of your crystal into a hot chamber where they react with a base material called a substrate to form layers. It's important that the substrate lattice matches the crystal lattice being built on top of it to create a stable, smooth crystal. This is a precise art. The crystal layers often need to be as thin as just a couple of atoms. Nakamura joined the lab for a year to master MOCVD. But his time there was miserable. He wasn't allowed to use the working MOCVD, so he spent 10 of his 12 months assembling a new system, almost from scratch. Even worse, his lab mates shunned him because Nakamura didn't have a doctorate, nor any academic papers to his name, as Nichia didn't allow publishing. His lab mates, all PhD researchers, dismissed him as a lowly technician. This experience fueled him. Nakamura wrote, \"I feel resentful when people looked down on me. I developed more fighting spirit. I would not allow myself to be beaten by such people.\" (inspirational music) He returned to Japan in 1989 with two things in hand. One, an order for a brand new MOCVD reactor for Nichia, and two, a fervent desire to get his PhD. At that time in Japan, you could earn a PhD without having to go to university, simply by publishing five papers. Nakamura had always known his chances of inventing the blue LED were low. But now he had a backup plan. Even if he didn't succeed, he could at least get his PhD. But now the question was with MOCVD under his belt, which material should he research? By this time, scientists had narrowed the options down to two main candidates, zinc selenide, and gallium nitride. These were both semiconductors with band gaps, theoretically, in the blue light range. Zinc selenide was the far more promising option. When grown in an MOCVD reactor, it had only a .3% lattice mismatch with its substrate, gallium arsenide. Therefore, zinc selenide crystal had about a thousand defects per square centimeter, within the upper limit for LED functioning. Its only issue was that while scientists had figured out multiple different ways to create n-type zinc selenide, no one knew how to create p-type. In contrast, gallium nitride had been abandoned by almost everybody for three reasons. First, it was much harder to make a high quality crystal. The best substrate for growing gallium nitride was sapphire, but its lattice mismatch was 16%. This resulted in higher defects, over 10 billion per square centimeter. The second problem was that like zinc selenide, scientists had only ever created n-type gallium nitride using silicon. P-type was elusive. And third, to be commercially viable, a blue LED would have to have a total light output power of at least a thousand microwatts. That's two orders of magnitude more than any prototype had ever achieved. So between the two candidates, almost all researchers were focused on zinc selenide. Nakamura surveyed the crowded field and decided that if he were going to publish five papers by himself, he'd better focus on gallium nitride, where the competition was much less fierce. This material's main claim to fame was one development back in 1972, when RCA engineer Herbert Maruska made a tiny gallium nitride blue LED, but it was dim and inefficient. So RCA slashed the project's budget, calling it a dead end. 20 years later, scientific opinion hadn't changed. When Nakamura attended the biggest applied physics conference in Japan, the talks on zinc selenide had over 500 attendees. The talks on gallium nitride had five. (dramatic music) Two of those five attendees were the world experts on gallium nitride, Dr. Isamu Akasaki and his former grad student, Dr. Hiroshi Amano. In contrast to Nakamura's academic background, they were researchers at Nagoya University, one of Japan's best. A few years earlier, they had made a breakthrough on the first problem of high quality crystal. Instead of growing gallium nitride directly on sapphire, they first grew a buffer layer of aluminum nitride. This has a lattice spacing in between that of the other two materials, making it easier to grow a clean gallium nitride crystal on top. The only issue was that the aluminum caused problems for the MOCVD reactor, making the process hard to scale. But Nakamura wasn't even close at this stage. Back at Nichia, he couldn't get gallium nitride to even grow normally in his new MOCVD reactor. After six months, desperate for results, he decided to take the machine apart and build a better version himself. His 10 months spent putting together the reactor in Florida, were suddenly invaluable. He began following the same routine each day, arrive at the lab at 7:00 AM. Spend the first half of the day welding, cutting, and rewiring the reactor. Spend the rest of the day experimenting with the modified reactor to see what it can do. At 7:00 PM go home, eat dinner, wash and sleep. Nakamura repeated this routine every single day, taking no weekends and no holidays except for New Year's Day, the most important holiday in Japan. (soft music) After a year and a half of continuous work, he came into the lab on a winter day in late 1990. As usual, he tinkered around in the morning grew a gallium nitride sample in the afternoon, and tested it. But this time, the electron mobility was four times higher than any gallium nitride ever grown directly on sapphire. Nakamura called it the most exciting day of his life. His trick was to add a second nozzle to the MOCVD reactor. The gallium nitride reactant gases had been rising in the hot chamber, mixing in the air to form a powdery waste. But the second nozzle released a downward stream of inert gas, pinning the first flow to the substrate to form a uniform crystal. For years, scientists had avoided adding a second stream to MOCVD because they thought it would only introduce more turbulence. But Nakamura used a special nozzle so that even when the streams combined, they remained laminar. He called his invention the two-flow reactor. Now, he was ready to take on Akazaki and Amano, but instead of copying their aluminum nitride buffer layer, his two flow design allowed him to make gallium nitride so smooth and stable, it itself could be used as a buffer layer on the sapphire substrate. This in turn, yielded an even cleaner crystal of gallium nitride on top, without the issues of aluminum. Nakamura now had the highest quality gallium nitride crystals ever made. But just as he was getting started, things took a wrong turn. (dramatic music) While he had been in Florida, Nobuo Ogawa had stepped back from Nichia to become chairman. In his day, Nobuo had been a risk taking scientist, designing the company's first products. It's why he supported Nakamura's lofty plans all this time. But in his place, his son-in-law, Eji Ogawa, became CEO of the company, and the younger Ogawa had a much stricter outlook. One Nichia client said, \"He has a mind of steel, and he remembers everything.\" In 1990, an executive at Matsushita, an LED manufacturer and Nichia's biggest customer, visited the company to give a talk on blue LEDs. In it, he claimed zinc selenide was the way forward, declaring \"gallium nitride has no future.\" That very same day, Nakamura received a note from Eji, stop work on gallium nitride immediately. Eji had never supported the research and wanted to end what he saw as a colossal waste. But Nakamura crumpled up the note and threw it away, and he did so again, and again, when a succession of similar notes and phone calls came from company management. Out of spite, he published his work on the two-flow reactor without Nichia's knowledge. It was his first paper. One down, four to go. With crystal formation settled, he turned to the second obstacle, creating p-type gallium nitride. Here Akazaki and Amano had again beaten him to the punch. They had created a gallium nitride sample doped with magnesium, but at first, it didn't perform as a p-type as they expected. However, after exposing it to an electron beam, it did behave as a p-type, the world's first p-type gallium nitride, after 20 years of trying. The catch was that no one knew why it worked. And the process of irradiating each crystal with electrons was too slow for commercial production. At first, Nakamura copied Akazaki and Amano's approach, but he suspected the beam of electrons was overkill. Maybe all the crystal needed was energy. So he tried heating magnesium doped gallium nitride to 400 degrees Celsius in a process known as annealing. The result, a completely p-type sample. This worked even better than the shallow electron beam, which only made the surfaces of the samples p-type, and simply heating things up was a quick scalable process. His work also revealed why the p-type had been so difficult. To make gallium nitride with MOCVD, you supply the nitrogen from ammonia, but ammonia also contains hydrogen. Where there should have been holes in the magnesium doped gallium nitride, these hydrogen atoms were sneaking in and bonding with the magnesium, plugging all the holes. Adding energy to the system, released the hydrogen from the material, freeing up the holes again. (dramatic music) By now, Nakamura had all the ingredients to make a prototype blue LED, and he presented it at a workshop in St. Louis in 1992 and received a standing ovation. He was beginning to make a name for himself, but even though he had created the best prototype to date, it was more of a blue violet color and still extremely inefficient, with a light output power of just 42 microwatts, well below the 1000 microwatt threshold for practical use. At Nichia, the new CEO's patience had run out. Eji sent written orders to Nakamura to stop tinkering and turn whatever he had into a product. His job was on the line, but in Nakamura's own words, \"I kept ignoring his order. I had been successful because I didn't listen to company orders and trusted my own judgment.\" At this point, he only had the third hurdle left, getting his blue LED to a light output power of a thousand microwatts. (soft music) A known trick to increase the efficiency of LEDs was to create a well, a thin layer of material at the p-n junction called an active layer that shrinks the band gap just a bit. This encourages more electrons to fall from the end type conduction band into holes in the p-type valence band. The best active layer for gallium nitride was already known to be indium gallium nitride, which would not only make the band gap easier to cross, but also narrow it just the right amount to bring its blue violet gap down to true blue. This time, Akasaki and Amano didn't scoop Nakamura. They were stuck trying to grow indium gallium nitride in the first place. Amano recalled, \"It was generally said that gallium nitride and indium nitride would not mix, like water and oil.\" But Nakamura had an advantage, his ability to customize his MOCVD reactor. This allowed him to use brute force, adjusting the reactor to pump as much indium as he could onto the gallium nitride, in the hopes that at least some would stick. To his surprise, the technique worked, giving him a clean indium gallium nitride crystal. He quickly incorporated this active layer into his LED, but the well worked a little too well and overflowed with electrons, leaking them back into the gallium nitride layers. Unfazed, within a few months, Nakamura had fixed this too by creating the opposite of a well, a hill. He returned to his reactor one more time to make aluminum gallium nitride, a compound with a larger band gap that could block electrons from escaping the well once inside. (dramatic music) The structure of the blue LED had become far more complex than anyone could have imagined, but it was complete. By 1992, Shūji Nakamura had this. - And I showed the chairman, I told him, \"Please, hey chairman come to my office.\" I showed him the blue LED and he said, \"ohh, this is great no?\" I became so happy. I just became, out of my office, yeah. - [Derek] After 30 years of searching by countless scientists, Nakamura had done it. He had created a glorious, bright blue LED that could even be seen in daylight. It had a light output power of 1,500 microwatts and emitted a perfect blue at exactly 450 nanometers. It was over 100 times brighter than the previous pseudo-blue LEDs on the market. Nakamura wrote, \"I felt like I had reached the top of Mount Fuji.\" Nichia called a press conference in Tokyo to announce the world's first true blue LED. The electronics industry was stunned. A researcher from Toshiba remarked, \"Everyone was caught with their pants down.\" The effect on Nichia's fortunes was immediate and explosive. Orders flooded in, and by the end of 1994, they were manufacturing 1 million blue LEDs per month. Within three years, the company's revenue had nearly doubled. In 1996, they made the jump from blue to white, by placing a yellow phosphor over the LED. This chemical absorbs the blue photons and re-radiates them in a broad spectrum across the visible range. Soon enough, Nichia was selling the world's first white LED. At last, unlocking the final frontiers so many had doubted, LED lighting. Over the next four years, their sales doubled again. By 2001, their revenue was approaching $700 million a year. Over 60% came from blue LED products. Today, Nichia is one of the largest LED manufacturers in the world with an annual revenue in the billions. As for Nakamura, to whom Nichia owed the quadrupling of its fortunes? (dramatic music) - I increased my salary, $60,000. After doubling, yeah. - I heard you only got $170 bonus - Each patent. - So you got $170 bonus for the patent. - Yes, yes. - [Derek] This was all while the blue LED was generating hundreds of millions of dollars in sales. Eji Ogawa had always seen Nakamura's stubborn individuality as a liability, not a strength. The message was clear. In 2000, after more than 20 years at Nichia, Nakamura left the company for the US, where job offers had been pouring in. But his troubles with Nichia weren't over. He began consulting for Cree, another LED company. Nichia was furious and sued him for leaking company secrets. Nakamura responded by counter-suing Nichia for never properly compensating him for his invention, seeking $20 million. In 2001, the Japanese courts ruled with Nakamura and ordered Nichia to pay him 10 times his initial request. But Nichia appealed and the case was eventually settled with a payout of $8 million. In the end, this was only enough to cover Nakamura's legal fees. (soft music) This is all he got for an invention that now comprises an $80 billion industry, from house lights to streetlights. While you watch this video on a phone, computer or TV. If you're outside following traffic lights or displays, chances are you are relying on blue LEDs. We might even be getting too much of them. You may have heard warnings to avoid blue light from screens before bed because it can disrupt your circadian rhythm. That all comes from the gallium nitride blue LED. But as for lighting, there are virtually no downsides to an LED bulb. Compared to an incandescent or fluorescent bulb, they are far more efficient. They last many times longer, are safer to handle, and are completely customizable. 30 years after the first white LED, high-end bulbs today allow you to choose between 50,000 different shades of white. Most importantly, their price has come down to only a couple of dollars more than other types of bulbs. And at their efficiency, with average daily use and electricity pricing, you can recoup that cost in only two months and continue to save for years after that. The result is a lighting revolution. In 2010, just 1% of residential lighting sales in the world were LED. In 2022, it was over half. Experts estimate that within the next 10 years, nearly all lighting sales will be LED. (soft music) The energy savings will be enormous. Lighting accounts for 5% of all carbon emissions. A full switch to LEDs could save an estimated 1.4 billion tons of CO2, equivalent to taking almost half the cars in the world off the road. Today, Nakamura's research is on the next generation of LEDs, micro LEDs, and UV LEDs. - [Derek] So what are they making in there? - LEDs, lasers, power devices. This is one the best facility in the US. - And this is because of you? What's a standard LED size? - [Shūji] 300 times 200 microns. - [Derek] Okay. - [Shūji] Smallest is five microns. - [Derek] That is insanely tiny. - So basically you can use that for like near-eye display such as AR and VR. - You could have like a retina display that's like right up here? - Yep. - A human hair would be about that thick. - [Shūji] Yep. - And that's a really, really tiny LED. UV LEDs could be used to sterilize surfaces like in hospitals or kitchens. Just flick on the UV lights and pathogens would be dead in seconds. - COVID-19, you know, UV LED companies' stock prices were going, skyrocketed because everyone expected to be using these UV LEDS. We can sterilize all the COVID-19, no? For emitting diode, we use indium gallium nitride. For UV, we use aluminum gallium nitride. [Derek] Okay. - [Shūji] 'Cause the band gap is much bigger. - [Derek] Do you think this is what's coming? - [Shūji] It's okay, it work, but the problem is the cost. The efficiency is less than 10%. The cost is very high. But if the efficiency becomes more than 50%, cost is almost comparable to the mercury lamp. - [Derek] And you think it will happen, right? Like the efficiency will go up? - [Shūji] Yeah, yeah, I think so. - It's just a matter of time. - Yeah, I think so. - [Derek] And he's even tackling one of the biggest challenges of our time. - [Shūji] I'm interested in physics. - [Derek] Me too! - I'm still interested in nuclear fusion. So recently I started the company of nuclear fusion. - Really? - Oh yeah, last year. - No way. - No way, aha. (soft music) - In 2014, Nakamura, Akasaki and Amano were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics for creating the blue LED. Shortly afterwards, Nakamura publicly thanked Nichia for supporting his work, and he offered to visit and make amends, but they turned down his offer and today their relationship is still cold. But perhaps even more important than the Nobel Prize, By the time Nakamura released his blue LED in 1994, he had published over 15 papers, and he finally received his doctorate in engineering. Today he has published over 900 papers. Throughout his entire journey, one thing has never changed. What is your favorite color? - Oh, blue. - [Derek] Was it always blue? Or only after you made the LED? - I was born in a fishing village. Fishing village. In front of the house is awesome like, ocean. Blue always. - While I was learning about Nakamura's story, I realized that what set him apart from the thousands of researchers trying to unlock the blue LED, it wasn't necessarily his knowledge, but his determination, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. Where others saw dead ends, he saw potential solutions.

    "commentBody": "It was almost impossible to make the blue LED [video] (youtube.com)344 points by keepamovin 23 hours agohidepastfavorite171 comments ddingus 12 hours agoThat was a great story! We have the blue ones because one guy was willing to put it all on the line to get it done. Amazing so much hangs on just one of us sometimes. We also have it because the research scientist acquired real electromechanical skill. Most of the time those skills are not there and my mind is on fire thinking about what could be done, and done faster with that kind of know how more broadly distributed. Not having that PhD sucked mostly due to peers not valuing other skills. I know a chemistry professor who values these things. I met him while setting some polymer equipment up. (Limiting details here to keep from outing people who may well read here. (Hello, from you know who in Oregon!)) Basically, this prof has a parts and equipment depot. Anytime there is an opportunity to score inexpensive, relevant gear, they do it. Students often build the gear they need. This may not be science grade, but it is almost always enough to validate a research path, or some other plan, including procurement or access to science grade equipment later on. In my discussions, those students live the program and know the value they are getting. Essentially, it is the same high value our Blue LED making friend has seen; namely, more direct agency and control with far fewer, maybe even zero dependencies navigate. They can explore even higher risk areas of research and then upon seeing potential outcomes worth publishing, can put their stuff to work how they need, when they need. A quick look back through history shows us a whole lot of the hard won scientific understanding we value and depend on, engineer with, came to us via people who could make things as well as think and observe. Add computation to that list as well. Academia could use a whole lot more of this as could public research and even private research programs. Again, great story. Love it. reply cypherpunks01 17 hours agoprevI thought this was a really well-produced video! It's difficult to communicate science to the public in an accessible way at the right level, and I think Derek does a commendable job. I really liked the LED explanation at the 4:00 mark. Can anyone who is familiar with semiconductor physics opine on how well this explanation models the reality? reply archontes 12 hours agoparentBachelor's in engineering physics (condensed matter experimental)/EE specializing in semiconductors here. The explanation starting at 4:00 is very accurate. When he talks about the electrons \"feeling\" the neighboring atoms, he's talking specifically about a result that follows from the materials being crystalline, that is, having regular ordered structure. The regular structure gives rise to a periodic potential. You plug that periodic potential into the Schrodinger equation and apply continuity conditions and translational symmetry to the wavefunction. Computing the solutions to the Schrodinger equation with those conditions reveals that there are allowed and disallowed energy levels, and also reveals the relationship between energy and momentum in the crystal lattice. You can step through this by reading the wikipedia page on the Kronig-Penney Model. This depends on the periodicity, which obviously can change depending on direction in a crystal. His explanation, and the result that \"the\" band gap is a single number, isn't dishonest because when we grow semiconductor devices, we grow them such that the crystal is oriented such that current flows in the desired direction, so that simple result holds true. Even his portrayal of the bands leaning down as potential/voltage is applied mirrors how potential change is shown in diagrams of semiconductor devices, see Streetman and Banerjee - Solid State Electronic Devices. reply cypherpunks01 12 hours agorootparentThat's great! Much appreciated, thanks :) reply archontes 12 hours agorootparentDo be careful, though. Some other folks here are saying, correctly, that this glosses over the \"direct\" or \"indirect\" nature of a semiconductor. I only very slightly alluded to this when mentioning the relationship between energy and momentum. Trying to make a long story short, it can be the case that in order to transition to another energy level, an electron also has to exchange momentum with something, usually the lattice in the form of quantized vibrations. Photons carry energy but almost no momentum, so an indirect semiconductor (one that requires both energy and momentum exchange for a transition to the conduction band) is usually an abysmal choice for optoelectronics. reply 01HNNWZ0MV43FF 12 hours agoparentprevI liked it, though it bugs me a little when people equate infrared and heat. Infrared is light. Light can heat things, and hot things can glow, but \"infrared is heat\" isn't exactly right. reply Smoosh 11 hours agorootparentI agree with you, but I think that for the general public you have to relate to what they experience, and thus intuitively know, and that is that heat “seems” to be different from light. reply amarant 11 hours agorootparentprevI know basically nothing about physics, so sorry if this is a dumb question. The existence of infrared LEDs seems to indicate to me that infrared light can exist without heat. The existence of infrared thermometers seems to imply that hot stuff radiates infrared light, at least usually. So my question is, is there any case where heat does not cause infrared radiation? What are those cases? Some special materials? Special colours(perhaps outside the visible spectrum)? reply elevatedastalt 11 hours agorootparentThat's a good question. All bodies above the temperature of absolute zero emit electromagnetic radiation across the whole spectrum (this is called Black-body radiation). Think of it as a mixture of different amounts of light of every possible wavelength. However, what the exact mixture is depends on the temperature of the body. As the body gets hotter, the 'peak' wavelength, i.e. the wavelength whose \"amount\" is highest in the mixture decreases. Objects at room temperature emit most of their energy outside of the visible spectrum, so they are not 'visible' in the dark. However, as you heat them up, the radiation mixture moves towards lower wavelengths, closer to infra-red. Heat it up further and things become red hot, yellow, blue hot and so on. Infra-red LEDs produce light of the the specific infrared wavelength through semi-conductors. They have nothing to do with the black-body radiation one associates with 'hot' objects. reply quenix 14 hours agoparentprevYeah, all I can say is that is tracked my undergraduate semiconductor theory classes pretty well. More confirmation needed. reply ace2358 14 hours agorootparentI would agree. Having said that I still think it was a bit wishy washy. The whole treatment of band gap energies I think is quite complicated beyond the simple diagram shown. reply pfdietz 12 hours agorootparentAlso, I don't think the explanation for silicon was correct. As I understand it, the problem with Si is not that the bandgap is in the infrared, it's that it's an indirect bandgap semiconductor which suppresses emission of photons. Instead, the energy of recombination goes into heat. reply thirdhaf 11 hours agoparentprevThe explanation is really well done, it captures the essence of the Pauli exclusion principle without delving too deeply into the weeds. In my opinion the best part of the video is the explanation of the \"hole\" quasiparticle at 6:10 (I learned this as a pseudo-particle but will defer to Wikipedia [1]). While a great introduction to semiconductor behavior this does gloss over a very important detail namely direct vs indirect semicondoctors as some others have mentioned. In the video the detail that's glossed over relates to the nature of crystals, namely that they're highly ordered repeating structures but that they don't look the same when viewed from every direction. This means that there isn't a single band-gap but multiple ones depending on the direction of the crystal you're contemplating. At this point you may reasonably ask why the direction matters and now we unfortunately get deep into the weeds with quantum mechanics again. When a single photon is absorbed in the semiconductor system both momentum and energy must be conserved. The momentum of the photon for something like the Silicon bandgap is quite small (something like the equivalent of an electron traveling at 1500m/s) while the momentum of room-temperature conduction electrons is substantially faster [2] so as a very slight simplification transitions due to the absorption of photons are not accompanied by a change in momentum and so we only care about the band structure (and the accompanying free carriers) associated with a particular crystal direction. In particular in Silicon you have what's called an indirect bandgap, namely the minimum energy conduction band electrons have a different momentum from the valence band holes ([3]) and as a consequence while you can _absorb_ a photon in order to make a detector you cannot make it efficiently _emit_ a photon as an LED should (something the video got wrong). None of this matters for the heart of the video, which focuses blue LEDs in the GaN materials system which is definitely a direct bandgap material, however if someone does manage to create a manufacturable light emitter in pure Silicon expect an absolute revolution with regards to optical computing and photonics.

Funny as it may seem now, being a mere 20 years later (or: \"holy crap, it's been 20 years!, how did that happen??\"), there were a few years there in the 2000-2005 region during which the de-riguer of computer nerdery was to go blue LED crazy. It felt elite, cutting edge, rare, oh-so-techy. And it's funny now, to look back at the windowed PC cases full of LEDs and garishly lit by cold cathode tubes, with our mouses and speakers and other electronic gadgets painstakingly swapped over to blue. And within a further couple of years - from about 2005 onward, if not sooner - the commercial market had taken over the trend and made it boring, passe. We hackers and overclockers weren't interested any more. Indeed, these ultra bright things began to get annoying.

The LED on this thing is not EXACTLY blue, but it's birthed of the exact same hellhole, and close enough in general color to count. So let's walk through this: 1. It's piercingly bright in the exact perfect shade of light that you can't help but notice everywhere in a dark room. 2. It's designed in a way that projects that thing across the room like a spotlight. 3. The light comes out of a silly small surface on an inconvenient placed spot on the edge of the shell.

I tried to just shove a needle in there to short out the LED, but it's probably some kind of surface mount and I couldn't hit it. Alternatives to cracking it open have been stuffing like 4 inches of electrical tape in the hole with a dental pick/needle, and then covering it up with more tape to seal it in.

Interstellar ships are very old and mix many technologies from different systems and civilizations. They touch on the fact that computer systems have evolved for so long that nobody really knows most of the code anymore. They just use it and build on top of it. One particular character has been traveling and in stasis so long that he is probably one of the oldest humans alive. A systems engineer of old. It turns out to be a big advantage to know the workings and vulnerabilities of his time because he can use them in the future when everyone else is building many layers on top of that and have no way of knowing exactly what he's doing. Vernor had a point, I think. reply theamk 4 hours agoparentThere are two kinds of \"nobody knows\": \"Nobody knows how to make room temperature semiconductors\" and \"Nobody knows why my washing machine failed\" In the former case, it's a genuine mystery that can be only solved by very smart people and modern science. In the latter, it's the lack of interest - sure, for $$$ a knowledgeable engineer will take the washing machine apart and figure out the exact defect, but no one is going to pay this, they'll just throw the washing machine away and get a new one. The historical software knowledge is definitely the latter. It is eminently possible to dig into any part of software and eventually get a full understanding of this part. But most of the time, it's way cheaper and more practical to shrug and ignore the problem, or maybe add yet another layer to compensate. reply fxtentacle 3 hours agorootparentUnless, for example, you invested billions into trains that run on Windows 3.11 and retrofitting all of them with a modern control system is prohibitively expensive.

My uncle is in his 60's and maintains old truck shipping software in COBOL. Btw there are job openings in old tech like this, for those that are interested. Happy to provide introductions. But the basic problem stands, the left-pad issue. We still deride this choice. Junior engineers without supervision hap-hazardly installing dependencies. But over the course of decades and generations of developers we still \"sum to zero\", where most software will rely on some number of unknown dependencies. Say in 2100 an update needs to be issued. You push it through whatever is managing npm dependencies at the time. Meanwhile there is a solar system of dependent devices that need security updates. There could be trillions of dependent devices and any number of of independent intermediary caches that may or may not be recently updated. I can't event imagine what that dependency tree would look like. reply oreally 8 hours agoparentprevUnfortunately knowing humanity and it's gatekeeping mechanisms he'd be near-unemployable.

The highest-paid devs I personally know earn their living working with old COBOL code. It's highly paid simply because there aren't that many expert COBOL programmers around anymore.

We had to support several old mainframes that don't actually exist anymore outside of museums -- but these companies ran emulators of the mainframes solely to continue to use the software they'd been using for decades.

The authors don't know good design and instead try to make every library do everything. Oh, my library converts strings from one encoding to another, I'll make it load files for you, save files for you, download them over the internet, and give you a command line tool, all in the same repo. The library should just do its one thing. The rest should be left to the user. I get the impression it's no better in rust land. Go try to edit the rust docs. Watch it install ~1000 crates. The issue is not the language, it's that anyone can post a library (not complaining) and anyone does. People who \"just want to get stuff done\" choose the library with the most features and then beg for even more since they can't be bothered to write the 3 lines of code it would have been to solve it outside the library. \"Can you add render to pdf?\" I don't know how to solve it.

It sounds like you're conflating low bloat and low dependency, which is like trying to have your cake and eat it too. If you want low bloat libraries, then it's likely you're going to be pulling a lot in that don't independently do much. If you want low dependency libraries, then you'll be pulling in a few that do do a lot. From my perspective I'd rather have slightly fatter libraries if they're low dependency and by authors I trust. Lodash for instance, sure it's big but the es6 module version supports tree shaking and it's basically the standard library JS never had. Same for something like date-fns for Date. I pretty much pull these two in by default into any project to fill those holes in JS's core library. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 11 hours agoparentprev> People who \"just want to get stuff done\" choose the library with the most features and then beg for even more since they can't be bothered to write the 3 lines of code it would have been to solve it outside the library. I feel this so much. I once had a contract for ruby on rails work. They were experiencing severe performance issues, so bad that they were developing in release mode (server won't detect a file change and reload for you). One day I get tired of it and start digging into it. I don't remember how many gems they were pulling in but it was A LOT. I came across one particular gem which saved 3 lines of code. Seriously. I stayed away from the RoR community after that. I recently picked up a contract for more RoR work (after all these years, lol) and ... it's not nearly as bad but it's not good either. Some communities just do NOT respect the risk that dependencies bring. reply sgarland 9 hours agorootparentMy experience from having worked at a mostly Python shop (and loving Python myself), and working at a Node shop, is that the latter is by far the worst. Python probably has just as many shitty packages as Node, but Python’s stdlib is so vast that you often don’t need to, if you bother to read the docs. Today, I was marveling at a function someone wrote at my work to cast strings to Titlecase. I learned today that JS has no built-in for that. That’s a tiny example, but there are far more. reply spyke112 57 minutes agorootparentThat’s also just a one line function with template literals in JS, if by Titlecase you mean upper casing the first character. Maybe a bit overkill to bake into a stdlib. reply moritonal 8 hours agorootparentprevGiven you've seen the same effect in both Ruby and JS maybe the takeaway should instead be that there is a group of devs who will always reach for a package first, not that a specific language has a problem. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 4 hours agorootparentand that group of devs tends to flock to certain ecosystems. I've never seen a .net project with 100+ dependencies, I've easily seen that multiple times for RoR and node. reply majormajor 3 hours agorootparentIn Javaland you can have a huge nested tree of dependencies but you often don't have a \"Gemfile.lock\" or such to list them all in a file in your repo... reply throwawayqqq11 25 minutes agoparentprevLibraries as pure functions where ever possible and a build system that does not only enforce this but warns you when an update introduces a new/changed syscall. Yes please! I know its not exactly low-dependency but at least lower attack surface. reply sweeter 11 hours agoparentprevThis is why I like Go and the stdlib. Its very much \"do it yourself\" unless we are talking about monumental libraries for very specific applications. Outside of that if we are talking about simple libraries that do one simple thing, its better to just roll your own using the stdlib. Almost all of the building blocks are there. On the other hand its really nice that any git repo can host a Go lib and anyone can use it from that url reply MrDresden 11 hours agorootparentNever used Go, but I much more prefer a proper stdlib that covers most base cases so that there isn't a need for rolling-your-own each time, or worse using a badly made/maintained bloated third party lib. Examples of excellent stdlibs in my opinion would be for instance Kotlin and Python. reply LamaOfRuin 10 hours agorootparentI think that's what they were saying (and what I would agree with). The Go std lib is very complete for important things, especially in the context of networked services. So the default is that you don't have to pull in many libraries for common needs. reply whstl 11 hours agoparentprevThe problem comes from two sides. First you have package makers that want to make this into a career, and the only way to generate buzz is by having thousands of them. So they focus on generating packages that depends on others created by them, and on trying to get their one or two useful packages into someone else's code. The second is people who believe that the only solution to problems involves including a new package, without caring about how many dependencies it has, or even if the actual problems is actually hard to solve. So instead of learning how to solve the problem, they must learn the API of some wrapper with 4 GitHub stars. reply dogcomplex 7 hours agoparentprevWhile \"add a black box complexity extremely resource intensive AI to sort out the dependency trees\" is somewhat of a tragic answer to the problem, I think it's the real one we're gonna get - and we'll still be better off than this current clusterfuck. Hopefully these will also spend the tedious hours pruning unnecessary packages, minimizing responsibilities of each, and overall organizing the environment in a sensible way, then caching that standalone so there's no LLM dependency - just an update checker/curator to call in when things go to shit. Honestly this is one of the worst problems of modern software and makes 50+% projects unusable. It seems like a very tedious yet solvable problem - perfect for the right LLM agent.

This person is probably the worst offender in terms of supply-chain problems and bloat in the NPM ecosystem. A terminal spinner (\"ora\") with 15 dependencies (including transitive) is not an example of good design. Inflating the numbers of downloads in your own packages is doing no good to the world of software. reply brnt 44 minutes agorootparentWhat you hope for is shallow dependency trees, not too branchy, but probably also not branchless (an indicator of vendoring). Larger projects will have and likely require depper trees through, but the branchiness should be relatively independent. I wonder if this has ever been formalized. reply whstl 18 minutes agorootparentWhat I hope for is for code that is actually auditable, and doesn't pull a lot of unused bloat just to pump up someone else's vanity metrics. This applies for large and small projects. Babel also doesn't need to do what it does: it pulls a couple hundreds of non-reusable sub-packages even though it's all written by the same people and maintained in the same monorepo. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentprevHonestly, I’ve often considered chunking all those libs into a single big one to eliminate 50% of my npm dependency chain. reply lelanthran 53 minutes agoprevSoftware cannot get leaner, because that takes time, skill and highly paid people, not just people gluing together examples from 12 different tech stacks into a frankensuite.

In some cases, especially due to some compliance (ISO27001/SOC2-3, Fedramp, etc.) companies implement a proper management of CVEs. It has become a standard practice (typically, this is part of the Enterprise subscription of the SAAS/product of choice). Having a service/lib/whatever that uses a crappy lib that doesn't get a CVE fixed in a specific timeframe can lead you to miss the SLA you define with your customers (e.g., \"we fix high risk CVEs in 90 days and critical in 30 days\", that kind of stuff). For such companies having a service like that which is probably not even core business can become really a cost, especially because Enterprise companies will push very hard on you to make those CVEs fixed. I have seen colleagues working over weekends just to have 1 single CVE because of 1 single company pushing us really hard to fix that stuff. It was a big contract, you don't want to lose it. So, yes: paying X$ to someone that promises you \"we take care of CVEs\", etc. can be a win.

I'm not suggesting that selling your soul to the SaaS vendors (disclaimer: I work for one) is the right solution. In fact some of them you're probably better setting fire to your data than trusting them (disclaimer: I work for one of those!). Example my now ex-girlfriend was distrusting of \"the cloud\", for rational reasons I will add thanks to a former Eastern Bloc childhood. However the alternative solution was hoping she wasn't going to lose the HP laptop she'd paid bottom dollar for. Some education later and she had peace of mind, at least on that front. What we have is a general lack of education and consideration of what the consequences of that lack of education are. The end game is that you either have to accept the risk, and I've seen many a tear there, educate yourself, and I've not seen much of that, or suck up to the SaaS and cloud vendors. It's a matter of personal responsibility and no one seems to have it so leaving that to the professionals (ha!) might be a less bad solution that trusting yourself. Education is the right answer though but hopeless.

There was a great deal of talk about making any changes or additions be transparent — system calls would seamlessly fulfill the same task, even if the code behind them changed, & additions would be supersets of what came before, allowing older code to compile &/or run/function without a hitch, while giving newer software more capabilities. This was supposed to make maintenance easier, regularize interfaces, & at the same time keep code lean since it would rely so much on system calls (external libraries were supposed to be avoided, &c., &c.). This dream quickly fell apart (remember DLLs?), & it seems that much package management & packaging has to do with making sure the right libraries are available. It makes sense that it would not have worked as was hoped, as mass software development was still essentially in its infancy. Here's my question: now that there has been a great deal of collective experience in these matters, is it the case that it has been learned that this dream is simply impossible to bring about in a sane fashion (codebases may simply not be moveable to such a system without unaffordable effort), or has there been enough experience with the current messy state of affairs to drive people toward a modern attempt at making this actually work? If we're wanting fast, lean, stable, secure software (& all four may not be possible at once), I'm not sure that the current situation is heading toward those ends. reply crq-yml 8 hours agoparentIt's iterative pressure to push features further down the stack. Early Unix did very little! Modern BSDs ship in a very \"complete\" state. The early Lisps put very little in the language, but Raku shoves every trivial thing that would go into an npm library into the language spec. The C language made you figure out how you wanted to build your code, while every new compiled language comes with some form of build tooling. There are certain things we are doing in this landscape that are pretty effective, but they are done outside of the \"you, the machine, and a greenfield project\" context that drove Wirth's endeavors. The problem tends to be that they come with certain monumental thresholds of \"big dependency\" like a database or browser engine, and if you don't like how the big dependency was made you end up unhappy. reply flenserboy 6 hours agorootparentThat makes sense.

The amount of code might be the same, but that doesn't guarantee that the level of risk is the same. A lot of bugs are introduced at interfaces -- the provider of an API makes a subtle change without realizing how it affects some of the API consumers -- and that's inherently more likely to occur if the two sides of the API are developed separately. In the FreeBSD world we've found that it's incredibly useful to develop the kernel and libc and system binaries together; all sorts of problems Linux trips over simply never happen in FreeBSD. reply estebank 5 hours agorootparentA really common thing in the Rust ecosystem is to write APIs that are impossible or at least hard to misuse. That cultural aspect plus the ownership system does help reduce those kind of problems. I've seen crates where there are \"mistakes\" in the API, lending a mutable borrow instead of returning an owned value, for example, that make them less useful than they could be otherwise, but I've seen fewer cases of bug prone APIs. reply josephg 6 hours agorootparentprevThis risk is much worse in C or C++ than rust because of the borrow checker.

One can easily see this if you consider safe code that sets an index and then calls into unsafe code but the index is out of range. The root cause is absolutely in the safe code. reply ptx 10 hours agorootparentIsn't that the idea that unsafe code can do unsafe things internally while exposing a safe interface? So in your example the bug would be in the unsafe code, which shouldn't have allowed the unsafety to leak into the safe code. reply BobbyTables2 10 hours agorootparentYes, but by that same logic, safe programs can also be written C. However, I do believe Rust gets a whole lot of things right. I sincerely hope that unnecessary use of unsafe code is avoided. reply jsheard 11 hours agorootparentprevThere has to be unsafe code for that to happen though, if you consume a crate which doesn't touch unsafe at all then it's only going to happen if you write the sloppy unsafe code which makes assumptions that don't actually hold. If you blindly pass indices from code you didn't write and haven't audited into Slice::get_unchecked() then that's on you, if you're not willing to do your due diligence then stick to the bounds checked version. That's what it's there for. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 4 hours agorootparentunsafe code should be sitting in a module protected by safe code. Which implies safe code can be the root cause of unsafety.

The worst kind is the vulerability that is a logic error, which no language catches for you, which can leave unskilled attackers accidentally breavhing your whole system.

The true smart solution would be to have some kind of system on chip that would send via hdmi the proper signal from a source fetched by a sort of curl but with streaming.

It doesn't help that modern operating systems have failed to evolve in order to provide a better ecosystem. And that's not even taking into consideration the barriers created by artificial platform segmentation enforced through copyright abuse. In general, platform owners are very resistant to working together. The biggest innovation in the OS space during the past decade which I'm aware of has been the proliferation of containers. We've given up on combating software complexity and decided that the best thing to do is throw everything into a giant opaque ball of software and ship that. Anyway, for all my ranting all this bloat has at least enabled a lot of people to ship code when they probably wouldn't have otherwise shipped anything at all.

Your phone would talk to the server via a LAN (in-house) or a VPN (remotely), decoupling the connectivity from the actual control. Heck, while we're at it, drop IP from the appliances entirely and use some low-bandwidth power line communication system (X10?) -- no need for an OS at all.

Many people, perhaps most, writing JavaScript professionally cannot do their jobs without advanced considerable assistance, fear (as in phobia) writing original software, and cannot communicate at a professional level. What would happen if things like Angular or React suddenly went away. Would these developers be able to write new applications. Likely not. What if a developer could no longer use jQuery or equivalent helper libraries? Could they continue to deliver work? Almost certainly not. When most of the work force is only interested in their own narcissism the industry has failed on multiple levels. This is experienced when the first, second, and third priorities are only in the developer’s own self interest such as needing things to be easy. That is why software is bloated, because when the self-interest of the developer is all that matters performance and efficiency become absurdly irrelevant. The solution to this problem is to set high standards. Not high compared to other professions but astonishingly high compared to software today. If current developers cannot achieve such lofty professional standards do not hire them as senior developers. It may mean it’s in the best interest for employers to train people off the street who are not yet corrupted by poor habits. Eventually the solution will become economic: what is cheaper for the employer. Will it be cheaper to employ large staffs that deliver bad products slowly in their own self-interest or start anew with well trained teams that deliver excellence rapidly at great training or certification expense.

Then when the ragefest about it broke out the broken function was standardized. Go for the longest time didn't have a round function, and the bug report where it was requested got a \"it's so simple just implement it yourself\" and it took commenters like 6 or 7 attempts to get it right. round()! (Thankfully, Go saw the light and eventually added it to the stdlib.) In many ways, quality engineers who know what they're doing and write good, high quality systems would go a long ways. But SWE companies are, AFAICT, penny wise and pound foolish in that department, and have traded paying devs for quality with devs dealing with low-quality systems for all of eternity. reply jauntywundrkind 9 hours agoprev [–] In 2025 this winge can finally die. Die hard. The size of software is such a rallying point for malcontents & grumblers. Endless belly-aching, back in my day software was all fast and hand coded in assembly, no, binary, by real men/women. Load times can be a bit bad, and yes 400MB app sizes so kind of suck but honestly, it'll swap out fine and if you have an even passible modern SSD, it'll swap right back in fine too in crazy fast speeds. In principle it's unpleasant, in practice, for most people this is not a real impact. But oh how it attracts aggression and disdain. The point about security is interesting because the stakes are so high. And oh my, we do see some epic disasters. What was the npm one with cyrptocoin wallets being drained recently? But you know? In general the number of occurences have been fantastically stunningly low; it's rarely an issue. There's some log4j shit where longstanding legacy unmaintained apps have some horrific vulnerability that no one is around to import the fix for. But generally? Most exploits are dealt with with amazing haste these days, at much shorter intervals than most dev's do uodates, such that most teams likely won't see impact. There's incredibly good tooling available to report dependencies & automatedly offer patches. The stakes are high but our defenses are astoundingly modern capable & fast acting. We are vulnerable, absolutely, but in practice where we are is amazing. The security footing I think is hella legit as a plea for lean software. Far more so than so many other persistent endless grumbles. I'm so weary that so many folks have a common place to get together and bellyache & moan, endlessly, again and again, about how bad software is, and how awful things are, when it's not. Shit is amazing. Our ability to stitch great shit together is amazing and having some extra code or parallel utility functions coded in just isn't really a great offense. Software has plenty of bad architectures underneath the surface, that make it low performance and bad. There's real hard problems about doing minimal amount of work when things change, figuring out what work to do, understanding what data structures and algorithms are helping and hurting. I want software dissenters, I want anger, but it feels like such low grade feed stock complaints that focus on such low & mostly-irrelevant factors that they can easily get together & breed disdain over. So, here we are in 2024, and this security stance seems like a super legit if improbable thing to be terrified about, an actual forcing function to care about the growth of software under layers. If only we had some kind of secure maybe cross-language hopefully capabilities-based sandboxed system for running code that we could use to run libraries safely in... Aoj wait, we do, it's called wasm, and wasi just shipped preview 2 with component-model, so we can make this happen. I'm excited that we can progress past this reason for conservative Fear Uncertainty and Doubt, by encapsulating the problem and containing it, without having to undergo some radical revolution where we completely remake software development in some undefined safe secure mysterious way where everyone starts all using the same code which we all agree is the exactly right code & nothing else is possible. People love to get together & feel smug that they have been in touch with the better halcyon universe where everything is great & only as it should have been, but no one has offered even the remotest suggestiom of how we get there. MS tried with years of .NET but even they had to constantly reinvent what batteries included meant. Who else will do better, make only perfect decisions, such that no one else ever need touch or address the topic again? This longong for some higher authority to make code perfect & simple as can be flies in the face of what should be exciting & compelling & powerful about the coding world to me; it's messiness brings amazing glory & possibility & we thresh towards better slowly & chaotically. What happens is amazing & I'm so tired of the positive of this world having no outlet, no rallying points, while the people who want to trash software can cand together so regularly so easily & so frequently. It's unfair that software conservatism has as much appeal as it does, and wasm stands to cut this reality-bias off at the kneecaps, thank the stars. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Three cases with the same ending — Reddit beats film industry again, won’t have to reveal pirates’ IP addresses Firms wanted seven years' worth of IP address logs on users who discussed piracy. Jon Brodkin - 2/9/2024, 6:41 PM Enlarge Getty ImagesNurPhoto reader comments 63 Movie companies have lost a third attempt to unmask Reddit users who posted comments discussing piracy. In an order on Wednesday, the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected movie copyright holders' demand for seven years' worth of \"IP address log information\" on six Reddit users. In a motion to compel that was filed last month, movie companies Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures argued that \"Reddit users do not have a recognized privacy interest in their IP addresses.\" But in Wednesday's ruling, US Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson said, \"The Court finds no reason to believe provision of an IP address is not unmasking subject to First Amendment scrutiny.\" Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures previously sued the Internet service provider Frontier Communications, alleging that it is liable for its users' copyright infringement. Seeking evidence for that case, the movie companies subpoenaed Reddit in an attempt to prove that Frontier has no meaningful policy for terminating repeat copyright infringers and that this lack of enforcement drew customers to Frontier's service. \"Reddit argues the Court should deny the motion because it is an unmasking subpoena, targeting a potential witness rather than a potential defendant, and is therefore subjected to First Amendment scrutiny,\" Hixson's order noted. Reddit also argued that the evidence sought by movie companies can be obtained instead from Frontier and from Frontier subscribers. Hixson's order, which was previously reported by Torrent Freak, said that courts use a \"higher standard for unmasking a non-party witness\" than for potential defendants because \"litigation can often continue without interfering with a non-party witness's First Amendment right to anonymity.\" Advertisement Reddit can protect First Amendment rights of users The ruling is similar to previous ones in which the same court denied movie-industry attempts to unmask Reddit users. The fact that movie companies only sought IP addresses instead of names this time around wasn't enough to sway the court. The previous cases are being called Reddit I and Reddit II. Voltage Holdings was one of the copyright holders involved in Reddit I, while both Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures were involved in Reddit II. Hixson referred to the prior cases in this week's ruling, saying the third is similar in part because the \"court adjudicating the copyright litigation has already ruled [the movie companies] can obtain identifying information from Frontier for IP addresses known to have pirated using Frontier's network.\" As in the previous cases, the movie companies \"cannot show that the information they seek here is unavailable from other sources,\" Hixson wrote. Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures cited Reddit posts in which users say that Frontier didn't terminate their Internet service despite sending many copyright infringement notices about torrent downloads. One of the users wrote, \"I got a total of 44 emails from frontier about downloading torrents and that it could terminate service. They haven't yet. And I kinda feel like if they didn't do it after 44 emails. That they won't… .\" The movie companies argued that getting these Reddit users' IP addresses is relevant and proportional to the needs of the case because the comments support the allegation \"that the ability to pirate content efficiently without any consequences is a draw for becoming a Frontier subscriber... and that Frontier does not have an effective policy for terminating repeat infringers.\" But Reddit has the right to refuse to provide that information, Hixson decided. \"The Ninth Circuit has recognized that Internet platforms can assert the First Amendment rights of their users, based on the close relationship between the platform and its users and the 'genuine obstacles' users face in asserting their rights to anonymity,\" Hixson wrote.

What is Reddit's involvement other than their website being used for this communication? reply saghm 13 hours agoparentI suspect the conversations went something like this: Film industry lawyer: Tell us everyone who pirated our movies. Frontier lawyer: We've told you everyone we know of. Film industry lawyer: What about those people on reddit bragging about getting away with it? Frontier lawyer: We don't have any way of knowing if those are actual customers, let alone if they're telling the truth. If you have a specific IP you want us to look into, we'd be happy to help. (later) Film industry lawyer: Give us the IPs of these users who made comments bragging about getting away with pirating. Reddit lawyer: No. Film industry lawyer: Okay, see you in court. reply Wowfunhappy 11 hours agorootparentI'm actually kind of surprised Reddit didn't just cooperate? As a company which frankly has been acting with particular contempt for users of late, how does Reddit profit from fighting this? reply bastawhiz 11 hours agorootparentOn the flip side, what's in it for them if they cooperate? There's no profit involved with procuring information for another for-profit entity that they have no business relationship with, and then likely having to show up for some other court battle to testify about the accuracy of the data. reply saghm 8 hours agorootparentNot to mention the fact that in recent memory, they've already had to contend with the threat of a mass exodus of users due to unhappiness with how the site was run. Whether or not it ended up making any sort of impact in the long run, I have to imagine that their management has no desire to risk that sort of controversy again. reply Wowfunhappy 11 hours agorootparentprev> On the flip side, what's in it for them if they cooperate? My thinking was, cooperating would mean they don't have to go to court, which costs money... > and then likely having to show up for some other court battle to testify about the accuracy of the data. ...I suppose that could potentially cancel out the savings. However, I would expect testifying to cost much less money than being sued! reply tcmart14 10 hours agorootparentOr if you do it once, then the film industry expects and requests for you to do it all the time, maybe? This is me just spit balling. If pulling this data costs m, then its m * number of request indefinitely. m is lower than the cost of a lawsuit over a sufficient number of requests. Where as, Reddit eats a lot of cost up front to try to prevent the film industry from racking up costs constantly requesting this information. And it perhaps bleed outside of the film industry. If they capitulate to film, then music might be next, followed by game studios, followed by software companies. reply bastawhiz 10 hours agorootparentprevIf you get sued and it turns out to be bullshit, there are potentially ways to recoup your legal costs. reply rPlayer6554 11 hours agorootparentprevPeople like their anonymity on Reddit. Every action reddit takes to make it less anonymous looks really bad. That kind of thing scares people and reddit already has some PR problems. reply jtriangle 10 hours agorootparentprevIt'd probably reveal how many of their users are actually bots, which would hurt their upcoming IPO valuation. reply DANmode 6 hours agorootparentprevGoodwill, for an easy \"fight\" for a well-funded org with legal people \"sitting around\" on retainer. Which they can subsequently burn on \"more important\" or more profitable user betrayals. reply kossTKR 11 hours agorootparentprevIf word spread that Reddit would name people writing specific comments about various \"controversial\" topics i think millions would flee? The entire spirit of Reddit is because of anonymity, from askreddit, to intimate questions, to political talk. Also there's lots of lying, fantasy, larping and fiction. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 10 hours agorootparentprevI think that you are unfairly extrapolating from a couple of high-profile decisions that upset, in particular, nerds. reply Wowfunhappy 9 hours agorootparentI think it was a bigger deal than that, but regardless: absent evidence to the contrary, my default assumption is that a for-profit company will prioritize profit at the expense of everything else. Recent events by Reddit merely deepen my conviction. reply VoidWhisperer 14 hours agoparentprevMy understanding is that the users in question were talking about piracy or committing piracy on reddit and the movie companies want to get the IPs of those users from reddit in order to prove that Frontier isnt terminating people committing piracy. Alternatively, depending on how large the list of users they requested IPs for from reddit is, it could be a fishing expedition to see if any of them happen to belong to frontier reply mox1 13 hours agorootparentThis is correct, the Reddit poster(s) in question were discussing how lax Frontier was about Copyright strikes. The movie company presumably wanted to have that person testify about said lax policy in court. reply imoverclocked 14 hours agorootparentprevIt would be interesting to know if an admission to pirating content on Reddit is actually admissible. I would think it falls under free speech. Eg: someone makes a parody of an old Monty Python song and states, “I’m a pirate and that’s ok.” Should this count in an age where the vast majority of legal notices in this genre are robo-lawyers? Should my internet connection be severed because a guest was bored and posted to Reddit while at my house? reply al_borland 13 hours agorootparentIANAL, but I think free speech is about being jailed for what you say. This is more about admitting to an action that allegedly performed. The speech isn't the problem, it's the action the speech is talking about. I think they'd have a hard time moving forward on that alone. They need some kind of proof, which is what I think they were trying to get. All they can prove is that the person said they got 44 emails, the person could be lying. There is no law against lying on an internet message board. reply thfuran 13 hours agorootparentprev>I would think it falls under free speech. Yes, admitting to committing a crime is not in and of itself illegal. It does, however, make it a lot more likely you'll be tried and convicted for the crime you admitted to committing. reply dylan604 11 hours agorootparentJust because the words came out of my mouth or from my finger tips typed into this little text area does not actually mean I did the thing I'm \"admitting\". I could be saying it for the clout. I could have said it but forgot the /s. I could be an actor performing the dialog. Where's the witness I actually typed it? Even if there is video, it's all fake news from an AI deep fake. Believe none of what your read or hear, and only half of what you see. Or some such. reply gryn 11 hours agorootparentyes, but now it makes it easier to go look for the evidence on you specifically for the crime you claimed to commit. you know, instead of fishing in the large. reply thfuran 11 hours agorootparentprevI'm not sure what your point is. Nobody (in the us) is shipping people straight to prison on the basis of public admissions of guilt. You still shouldn't publicly admit to a crime. reply dylan604 11 hours agorootparentJust pointing out how ridiculous some post on a forum being used as evidence sounds. reply thfuran 11 hours agorootparentThe most ridiculous part was where you suggested that witness testimony was authoritative. reply hsbauauvhabzb 10 hours agorootparentprevFor piracy yea, but what about something more extreme like murder? reply dylan604 5 hours agorootparentDepends on the murder. We’ve seen gang killings hyped and liked on socials, and cops not doing a lot with it. We’ve seen social live streaming of organized looting and not much being done with it. We’ve seen cops on video committing heinous acts and getting away with it. So why do we feel making shitposts on socials is going to do much? reply pessimizer 10 hours agorootparentprevNot very well. Of course it's evidence. You can't convict someone based on them walking into a police station and confessing to murder, either, but you can certainly arrest them or call them as a witness in a trial relating to that murder. reply naasking 13 hours agorootparentprev> It would be interesting to know if an admission to pirating content on Reddit is actually admissible. The problem here is tying the account to a real person. Technically anyone could be using that account, his daughter, brother, wife, etc., just like anyone could be behind the wheel of your car if it's used to commit a crime. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF 13 hours agorootparent> Technically anyone could be using that account Not just the account but the internet service as well. Even if they get the IP addresses for the reddit posts, and they're Frontier IPs, it's still possible that the person who wrote the post submitted it/logged in/created their account over a loved one's home network. reply k12sosse 11 hours agorootparentJust create an open wifi network and throttle it down to 1kbpm, plausible deniability! reply Drakim 14 hours agorootparentprevAt some point in my life I committed a crime. Here's to hoping that's not enough to have me subpoenaed. reply Vt71fcAqt7 14 hours agorootparentprevI think I get your point but being free speech and being an admission of a crime are not mutually exclusive. reply bithaze 11 hours agoparentprev> What is Reddit's involvement other than their website being used for this communication? I think that's it, which is why reddit is referred to as non-party in the motion. reply neilv 11 hours agoprevA recurring revenue opportunity for Reddit would be to forget about the old defender of online freedom image, and sell data. :) \"How much is it worth to your case, to know who the commenters on this thread are?\" \"What would you pay to filter hiring candidates for ideology, troublemaker tendencies, or bedroom kinks that bother your conservative Chairman?\" \"Your own actuaries can tell you how much money this individual vice data will save your insurance company, so let's split it.\" \"Making your astroturfing more effective, and getting full credit in your org for shifting perceptions, would be easier if you could crunch individual voting behavior.\" \"There's only so much censoring that bribed mods can do on the sub that keeps dumping on your brand.

To push the public and lawmakers to finally decide that corporate surveillance is evil. (Reddit still has positive karma balance, especially from earlier days, IMHO. There are many, many companies much more deserving of being made an example of.) reply wkat4242 6 hours agorootparentprevGDPR doesn't apply if they're really frontier customers. As they're not in the EU. reply bawolff 14 hours agoprev> Firms wanted seven years' worth of IP address logs on users who discussed piracy. Does that mean reddit stores ip addresses for 7 years? That seems excessive. reply Arrath 14 hours agoparentWhat the lawyers wanted may be very different from what reddit actually keeps. reply vdfs 13 hours agorootparentRight,I bet reddit hold data for more than 7 years reply mysteria 14 hours agoparentprevI suppose it's possible the poster's IP is stored in the post metadata itself, along with the date, username, and so forth. Don't know if that's how Reddit works but in that case it'll be retained forever. As for the reason for 7 years worth of data, I think that's because the firm wants to go back and search for infringing acitivity on all those IP addresses due to dynamic IP updates and so forth. If the user is still active on Reddit the more recent IP addresses probably are enough to identify him if a warrant is served to the ISP. The ISPs I know only retain a link from a dynamic IP to a subscriber for one to two years max. reply EasyMark 12 hours agorootparentYeah that's why it's good to start a new reddit account every year and delete the old one. As well as VPN, regularly changing mac address on your router etc. reply roygbiv2 4 hours agorootparentThe mac address is layer 2 and no one other than your ISP knows it. Changing it does nothing for your privacy since your ISP knows it anyway. reply Terr_ 8 hours agorootparentprevOr if you're like me, Reddit will helpfully shadowban everything you ever wrote on your decade-plus account, while simultaneously claiming you can't use the appeals page because the account is still in good standing. As a bonus, anything anybody ever wrote in response to me is gone too. reply forgotmypw17 14 hours agoparentprevI think it's basically for the entire account history.

If not for law enforcement, at least so they can track you better and sell the data. reply mondrian 11 hours agorootparentYeah that's true. You need the data from both the ISP and reddit, and correlate using timestamps from both sides. That's true of VPNs, too. If multiple people with the same external IP were browsing reddit around the same time, the argument in court would likely become about the accuracy of timestamps. reply wanderingmind 8 hours agoprevAs an aside can your ISP track torrents if you still use DNS over https or VPN services?

If you want to reveal who's who, you need to have a search warrant. reply imoverclocked 14 hours agoparentThis isn’t about identifying a particular user, it’s about showing that Frontier does nothing to quell piracy by its users and thus provides an incentive to pirates to use their network. reply BriggyDwiggs42 14 hours agorootparentWow i didnt realize frontier is so based reply favourable 14 hours agoparentprev> IP addr is not a person And most IPV4 addresses are vague and only give a coarse location of where you are, and they're typically shared among many others so an IP is not a guaranteed signal that it was 'you' who pirated stuff. reply declaredapple 14 hours agorootparent> And most IPV4 addresses are vague and only give a coarse location of where you are That's not true, you can request/compel Frontier to tell you what specific customer that IP was assigned to at a given time. > and they're typically shared among many others so an IP is not a guaranteed signal that it was 'you' who pirated stuff. Most residential ISPs in the states have 1 ipv4 (and possibly ipv6) assigned per customer and don't CGNAT, from my brief research Frontier doesn't seem to use CGNAT at least for residential internet. reply rpmisms 14 hours agorootparentThe FBI contacted me over a shitpost on Reddit using this exact process.

They were pirating on the clearnet without any obfuscation. Pretty dumb and easily the lowest hanging fruit for copyright enforcement. Using Tor for streaming or large downloads probably won’t result in great quality or quick speeds. Using Tor for browsing and seeding on private torrent trackers is also typically banned for security reasons. reply pharmakom 11 hours agorootparentWell they don’t need Reddit to see who is seeding. But posting to Reddit can easily be done through Tor or proxies. reply hypeatei 14 hours agoprevGood. Piracy is the result of poor delivery or poor pricing models.

It's a misalignment of incentives. Unless Reddit is exclusively associated with piracy and bad actors, most advertisers will probably ignore the bad press* and keep giving them money. * I'm not even sure it'd be bad press.

    "originBody": "Tech Industry Cryptocurrency Cryptomining Just 137 crypto miners use 2.3% of total U.S. power — government now requiring commercial miners to report energy consumption News By Aaron Klotz published 9 February 2024 The U.S government wants to crack down on the ballooning energy consumption of Bitcoin miners. Comments (78) (Image credit: Shutterstock) The U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) is now requiring large-scale commercial cryptocurrency mining operations to report their power consumption. This initiative is part of a larger effort to regulate and penalize cryptocurrency mining due to the exorbitant amount of energy the industry consumes yearly. For now, the EIA is only collecting data, but this new data should give birth to new regulations that will penalize miners in the future. This comes as the company has released a study (first reported on by Inside Climate News) suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand. “We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States...,” EIA administratior Joe DeCarolis said in a release in January. “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.” DeCarolis' words summarize that the United States will pay close attention to the environmental challenges cryptocurrency mining might be causing. We can surmise that the United States government specifically wants to crack down on mining operations that impact the reliability and sustainability of power in highly populated areas. Potentially leading to higher residential power costs and power shortage issues during peak hours. As of January 2024, the EIA has identified 137 cryptomining facilities. EIA Note: \"The representative size shown for a facility is based upon estimates contained in our bottom-up approach. Number in brackets represents the number of facilities.\" (Image credit: U.S. Energy Information Administration) The EIA found that crypto-mining operations in the United States has grown substantially over the past few years, to the point where all U.S-based crypto-mining operations consume 0.6% to 2.3% of the nation's entire electricity consumption alone. For comparison, the total U.S. Bitcoin mining industry consumes the annual power budget of Utah or West Virginia. The estimated power draw of Bitcoin mining worldwide is projected to be anywhere between 0.2% to 0.9% of global demand, equating to the same power draw as Greece or Australia by themselves. Bitcoin mining is very power-hungry in the United States specifically due to the exorbitant amount of mining that actually takes place within U.S borders. The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022. The incredible power demands of the Bitcoin industry are a result of the Bitcoin mining algorithm becoming more and more difficult every single year. Bitcoin today isn't what it was eight to ten years ago, where you could mine it on a single computer and net a decent profit. Nowadays, Bitcoin needs to be mined on hundreds of specialized mining devices (ASICs) to be gathered at all. The continuous difficulty of the Bitcoin algorithm, in turn, creates higher and higher power costs as the cryptocurrency gets harder to mine. We can expect this power phenomenon to become greater as Bitcoin grows in popularity. 2024 is expected to be one of the most eventful years in Bitcoin history, with the cryptocurrency expected to blow past its record $69,000 high sometime after its halving event in April (when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half) thanks to reduced mining profit and large-scale institutional adoption.

It kind of is! But honestly that's the price we pay for not having sound monetary systems. At this point BTC is, functionally, just an alternative asset that hedges against inflation. As governments print increasingly more money, and the amount of BTC stays the same, each BTC becomes worth more. It's very simple. The demand for such an asset is apparently quite high; high enough to spend up to 2.3% of total US energy. If the world operated on non-inflationary systems there would perhaps still be a small need for BTC, such as providing liberty in committing financial transactions, but I doubt it'd be nearly as big as it is today on that basis alone. reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> BTC is, functionally, just an alternative asset that hedges against inflation Bitcoin is a terrible inflation hedge.

That is the opposite of a hedge! It proves that Bitcoin is not valuable due to \"not having sound monetary systems.\" Bitcoin is obviously a speculative asset whose value goes up when inflation is low and people have money to spend on speculative assets.

Could you please refer me to a graph showing the relationship between BTC and inflation? Because inflation over the last 12 months is relatively low, at 3.4%, while BTC is very high, at $47,621. Then again, BTC hit a high of $65,000 back in November of 2021, when inflation rates were indeed high at 6.8%.

The adoption of fiat currency by many countries, from the 18th century onwards, made much larger variations in the supply of money possible. Since then, huge increases in the supply of paper money have occurred in a number of countries, producing hyperinflations – episodes of extreme inflation rates much greater than those observed during earlier periods of commodity money. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money reply pton_xd 16 hours agorootparentprev> No, the international monetary system is perfectly functional, as evidenced by the fact that it supports the global economy just fine. Obviously it is functional, I never said it wasn't! Inflationary systems have a lot of benefits -- they encourage consumption, erode the value of debt over time, etc. But there are downsides, too. Savings and purchasing power are destroyed over time. They encourage investment in hard assets like real estate and BTC to protect wealth. And so you get some waste, too. There is no free lunch. reply lottin 16 hours agorootparentThe international monetary system isn't a deflationary system per se. It can accommodate a variety of monetary policies, including deflationary policies. As far as bitcoin being a hard asset, this isn't entirely correct either. Not only does bitcoin not generate income, but it consumes income. You see, the bitcoin network is extremely expensive to maintain, and the owners of bitcoins are the ones who bear the cost. Either they pay with fees -unlikely-, or they'll pay by losing value in their investment -most likely.

(edit: while I still can, I'm going to jump in and repeat that I'm criticizing this as a bad article which isn't saying anything very meaningful on its own. Thanks everyone for doing the author's work for them and gathering more data. I won't be upset if it's proven that crypto is intrinsically bad for everything I love - except insofar as I believe it can't be stopped.) 1. There is no comparison made to the energy consumption of the traditional banking industry, which I am sure is not a particularly energy-efficient industry. 2. The title of the article is itself editorializing the content of the article and is speculative according to their own words. From TFA: \"[The EIA] released a study suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand.\" It could be less, much less, or much less, although I haven't read the actual report yet (I'm criticizing this article only), because \"suggesting\" could be doing a lot of heavy lifting 3. \"Just 137\" isn't meaningful AFAIK. Who cares if it's 100 or 10 or 10,000 miners? The point is the amount of crypto being mined. (The number of miners will always be in flux by design anyway.) And the answer to that, from TFA: \"The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022.\" So roughly ~2% of US power is generating over 1/3 of the world's Bitcoin. This is only obviously bad if you believe Bitcoin is a total waste of energy, which I don't, but I understand that some do. 4. Energy consumption is frankly not a phenomenon I give two shits about, as an environmentalist. Fossil fuel consumption is. From TFA: \"We intend to ... quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.\" Meaning this has not been done, and publishing scary warnings is premature. If Bitcoin mining ends up using a higher proportion of renewable energy than, say, traditional banking, it could be seen as a net good for crypto use to rise. reply acdha 17 hours agoparent> There is no comparison made to the energy consumption of the traditional banking industry, which I am sure is not a particularly energy-efficient industry. This is your first mistake: the traditional banking system does not have a security model predicated on the ability to waste power. Bitcoin does, and it’s dynamic so there’s no way to waste less power which isn’t explicitly ceding control. The second error is treat the two as comparable without recognizing that one of them is used daily by millions of people making billions of transactions, and the other has almost no real world adoption. That matters in two ways because it’s not just that bitcoin uses more power to do so much less but also that the real financial system has higher power draw for work in addition to processing transactions. For example, Visa can do on the order of tens of thousands of transactions per second versus Bitcoin’s 7 but if you are looking at how much power they use, the figures will include running a ton of anti-fraud and other support systems which Bitcoin is missing. reply quandrum 16 hours agorootparentThere's also the fact all the power draw of the traditional banking industry is also in the crypto and not accounted for in this analysis. Crypto still needs POS systems and accounts and large staffs in large offices and all the trappings of finance outside of mining. reply digging 16 hours agorootparentThat's an excellent point actually. In the current day, more-or-less every watt of crypto is actually on top of the traditional financial system and totally reliant on it. That's not intrinsic to cryptocurrency, but it is part of the reality we're living in, which is what I want people to be looking at. reply kkielhofner 12 hours agorootparentprevPrecisely. I don't know how people can argue crypto power consumption against the banking industry when you can drive down main street in any city and pass 15 bank branches and see ATMs every 100ft. Bank of America alone has 69m customers and real people have real needs - things like going to a branch occasionally, calling customer service, taking out cash, etc. Not only is BoA itself larger in terms of users than all of crypto (I've done the analysis, checked block explorers, etc) it's actually usable by real people in the real world for real activity that contributes to the real economy and actually provides value and utility other than pancake swapping your doodle coins for poodle coins. reply acdha 8 hours agorootparentThat comparison is also interesting because the same people who make those comparisons are also perpetually perplexed about why statistically nobody uses Bitcoin, and it’s like … BofA employs thousands of MBAs, they have McKinsey consultants, so you really think they’d have all of those employees and infrastructure cutting into their profit margins if their customers didn’t find those services useful? Focusing on the transaction mechanism is leaving out 95% of banking. reply digging 17 hours agorootparentprevI do admit that the comparison is not a strong one. It wasn't intended to be, honestly, it was just an easy example. My point was more that the data presented in the article aren't very useful on their own. Again, if you think all cryptocurrency has 0 value, then all usage is obviously bad. But the reality is that it has some value, and much of that value is in the form of scams (most types of coins, by number, are scams), and much of the value is just speculative investment, but it is a real thing that people spend real money on. Focusing on miners makes it seem like all the value of crypto comes directly from energy - but nobody would spend energy mining it if others wouldn't buy it. reply dmoy 15 hours agorootparent> My point was more that the data presented in the article aren't very useful on their own. Yea this is a constant issue in almost all journalism. Numbers are provided mostly without context. E g. \"$100k of drugs seized in bust\". But was that a single day's re-up? Does it meaningfully impact the local drug supply at all? --- In this case we can dig into numbers somewhat. Bitcoin.com claims the traditional banking sector uses about 2x as much energy. But cryptocurrency handles a tiny, tiny fraction of worldwide banking stuff, so if it was operating at the scale of e.g. 20,000 qps of credit card transactions, for example, it might have substantially higher energy use compared to now. reply patricius 16 hours agorootparentprevYour first mistake is assuming that the power used to secure the Bitcoin network is a waste. It is clearly not, since thousands of people believe it is worth paying for. The second error is implicitly assuming that the number of people Bitcoin serves is correlated with it’s power usage. You could serve the same number of people as the banking sector does now without increased power consumption when you bring layer 2 or 3 solutions into the picture. reply rspeele 16 hours agorootparentYour first point kind of makes it impossible to call anything a waste, right? Everything we do in society is paid for by somebody so it must all be worthwhile. For the second point, are you talking about Layer 2 solutions that track cryptocurrency in a centralized database, like an exchange, where most transactions happen? Basically just traditional banking but with crypto as the unit of account. Or are you talking about decentralized layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network? I don't think Lightning Network can scale to match what the banking sector does, even if you ignore all the services banks provide other than facilitating transactions. For example you could not pay the US workforce with Lightning Network because it would take several months worth of of blocks just to open a channel to each person, and quickly those channels would run out of inbound capacity and you'd need to open more on top of that, so the Layer 1 capacity still limits the ability to use LN at that scale. reply patricius 1 hour agorootparentMaybe Lightning Network will scale, maybe not. But VISA or Mastercard could build on top of Bitcoin and allow many more transactions than the base layer does. You would use the base layer for final settlements. Already now you can get a VISA/Mastercard and use that to spend Bitcoin. But of course, every layer on top of Bitcoin presents its own set of trade-offs in terms of trust and security. What constitutes waste is completely subjective. reply pcthrowaway 16 hours agorootparentprevMillions of people play in casinos, that doesn't mean the energy they use isn't a waste and overall negative for society. Bitcoin is like that times 1,000,000 when it comes to energy usage. The energy and resources expended mining for diamonds is wasteful also. reply patricius 1 hour agorootparentValue is subjective, so it is by definition wrong to say that something is objectively a waste. It depends on who you ask. reply acdha 16 hours agorootparentprev> Your first mistake is assuming that the power used to secure the Bitcoin network is a waste. It is clearly not, since thousands of people believe it is worth paying for. This is a logic error: securing a financial system is not waste but paying more than you need to is. If my bank secured my money by paying an army of dudes with guns to sit around watching cash and did transfers by putting a check on the corporate jet, I’d say that was wasteful, too. Similarly, the argument that the current system could be matched by L2 systems is both speculative and conceding defeat: even if that worked as well as the sales pitch claims it’d be using more power, and we know that there’s no plausible scenario where usage goes up while power consumption goes down. The argument that L2 systems is the answer is also directly undercutting your earlier marketing pitch. If the justification for the inefficiency is that it’s needed for security, telling people that they should switch to your I Can’t Believe It’s Not A Bank is either admitting that the security benefits are either not real or necessary, or that they can be provided more cost effectively. The only people who are committed to using Bitcoin are the people who’ve already bought in: everyone else is going to look for advantages relative to what they’re already using. It’s not just enough to handwave about how the system might at some point be less distant from parity, you need a serious plan for being better at something before you’ll see any significant adoption. Parity might seem like a far off goal, and it is, but it’s not enough to get most people to switch. reply patricius 1 hour agorootparentWhat you call inefficiency (I guess in terms of power consumption) is a misuse of the term in a world where value is subjective. It is efficient and necessary for the use case and value it provides. You can argue it is ineffecient compared to Proof of Stake for example, but Proof of Stake is a completely different system and has a completely different incentive structure. I’m saying also that L2 (and L3, … Ln) is a way to scale the number of users without increasing power consumption. Every time you add a layer, there are other trade-offs for the benefits gained. But at the base layer you still have the benefits of not having a central authority censoring and controlling exchange of an economic good. reply sp332 16 hours agorootparentprevWe know that the power is wasted because the results are just thrown away.

First, the vast majority of the around $100 it costs to process a BTC transaction comes not from explicit fees, but from (invisible) money supply increase (the mining reward).

Also, when talking about extra service payment networks like Visa offering, like anti fraud, gotta remember that at least part of problems this service solving is caused by the design of the network itself. And while it is not obviously energy hungry service, it is part of what everyone is paying 2-3% in credit card processing fees. I would love to see a solid comparison of traditional banking total cost vs Bitcoin (if it would replace traditional fi), but it is certainly not as simple as the above, if even possible... reply rspeele 16 hours agorootparent> Also, when talking about extra service payment networks like Visa offering, like anti fraud, gotta remember that at least part of problems this service solving is caused by the design of the network itself. And while it is not obviously energy hungry service, it is part of what everyone is paying 2-3% in credit card processing fees. The design of credit cards does suck for fraud. I go to a website to buy a product, I put in my card number, exp date, CVV, and it turns out that site was actually compromised and some attacker got my card info. Now I have to cancel it and get a new card. It would be way better if what I entered on that vendor's site was a one-time authorization code, not the full information with which the attacker can spend from my card at other places. Crypto is better in this regard since I never transmit my secret information to the vendor! But crypto is also worse, in that, if I do send a transaction to the wrong place (for example, because the vendor's website was compromised and told me the attacker's address to send to), I'm screwed. And if my electronic device is compromised and my private key stolen I'm really screwed. Ultimately even though crypto has a technically better design, since it also has no support department and no dispute resolution I'm at higher risk. I've never lost money from a stolen credit card. You're right that I pay for that in the 2-3% processing fees... but it's not like Bitcoin is feeless, either. reply binoct 9 hours agorootparentPayment authorization through credit cards can clearly be improved by providing one-time authorization codes using any number of techniques. Looking back to the theme of the article however, that improvement can be done _completely independently_ of the blockchain and mining ecosystems, with negligible impacts on the power consumption of the existing baking system. reply acdha 15 hours agorootparentprev> Also, when talking about extra service payment networks like Visa offering, like anti fraud, gotta remember that at least part of problems this service solving is caused by the design of the network itself. And while it is not obviously energy hungry service, it is part of what everyone is paying 2-3% in credit card processing fees. Oh, no argument there but that’s not the only part of fraud I’m thinking about. I’ve had a card stolen but it cost me exactly zero because their anti fraud system was able to detect that the person with the credential wasn’t buying the kinds of things I buy at places I normally shop and blocked it. That’s a LOT better than the countless stories of people making a mistake in where they sent cryptocurrency or losing control of their wallet, and not getting help other than people saying it was their fault. My point definitely isn’t that the current system is perfect but rather that what seems to happen a lot is that people focus on one technical problem like operating a ledger and forget the surroundings. I’d definitely like to see a detailed comparison, too, but my preferred solution to all of this would be an increasingly steep carbon tax to incentivize everyone to do better. reply jakupovic 13 hours agorootparentprev>This is your first mistake: the traditional banking system does not have a security model predicated on the ability to waste power. Bitcoin does, and it’s dynamic so there’s no way to waste less power which isn’t explicitly ceding control. This doesn't make sense. The power is used to secure the network. Your first mistake here is you must think of Bitcoin as useless and any use of power is a waste. Just to help you, if BTC was useless it would be worth $0 traditional banking dollars, as this is not the case your whole premise is a waste. reply mjburgess 17 hours agoparentprevThe \"security\" of btc cryptocurrency is proportional to how much energy it wastes; that's radically different than the banking system. The more billions it costs to run bitcoin, the more it costs to 51% attack it. If you can outwaste energy, you can hijack the system. It would be useful it some state, eg., russia or china, would just cut off networks and forge bitcoin network traffic -- and hence bring the whole thing down. Or, do a 51% attack by controlling 51% of the hashing power. The whole thing is a joke, one only tolerated by states because it's supports joke levels of economic transactions. Were any % of an economy to run on this, states would just seal the network in their borders and end the whole charade. reply wongarsu 16 hours agorootparent> The \"security\" of btc cryptocurrency is proportional to how much energy it wastes It's proportional to the amount of money it \"burns\", in the form of capital costs (miners) and electricity costs (for those miners).

Why would that bring the whole thing down? Countries that shut down internet don't seem to bring that whole thing down in any sense reply mjburgess 17 hours agorootparentCryptocurrencies are peer-to-peer systems. If you control the network they're on, you can do anything you like. Take the peer-to-peer traffic of the cryptocurrency network of any area, prevent it from getting outside that area (ie., just block it talking to IPs outside some range) -- then to that network, you can trivially control the total hashing power. So split any cryptocurrency network into small segements, then add your machine to that network with a false history, design the network to be small enough, and your machine will out-hash the rest, and so it's history will win. Rinse-and-repeat. It's trivial for any state to take down a cryptocurrency. There's nothing magic about it; it's an incredibly fragile system whose 'safety' relies on no one owning the network, and if that's the case, no one being able to russle-up huge amounts of electricity. In both cases, this is false for states. So any state, if it wishes, can really do anything it likes. The global bitcoin system is well within rearch of a hostile state 51%'ing it, even at the global level -- though the cost would be non-trivial. It would be trivial to do it in its own borders though. As any state, of course will, if you can ever go into a shop and buy somehting with it. At that point you're imperilling a state's ability to use monetary policy to manage its economy, and that's an existential security threat. So bye bye your monopoly money tokens. reply null0pointer 16 hours agorootparent> So split any cryptocurrency network into small segements, then add your machine to that network with a false history, design the network to be small enough, and your machine will out-hash the rest, and so it's history will win. Rinse-and-repeat. You cannot forge history, even with 100% of the hash power. Firstly, each transaction is cryptographically signed with the keys of the sender address. Secondly, each full node within the segmented network will have the full history. The only thing you can do is publish different blocks to the segmented network than the blocks the outside network has. You cannot create arbitrary transactions. You can only censor others’ transactions within the segmented network. Since the mining difficulty will not adjust instantaneously your segmented network will fall behind the outside network in block height unless you control more hashing power than everyone else mining Bitcoin on either network combined. So as soon as anyone in your segmented network re-establishes connection with the outside network (and they will, they could receive a physical hard drive with the blockchain on it and rebroadcast to segmented nodes) all your work is for nothing. You might say “yeah well I’ll publish an entire fake history that is MUCH longer than the outside network with lower difficulty so I can stay ahead”. Well, actually you can’t, because if you wanted vastly more blocks between Bitcoins inception and the present then the difficulty will necessarily be much higher because that’s how difficulty gets set, by how quickly blocks are produced. You would have to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm, creating a fork between your own malicious node(s) and the other nodes in your segmented network. Oh and by the way, you _still_ can’t create arbitrary transactions. > The global bitcoin system is well within rearch of a hostile state 51%'ing it I’ll believe it when I see it.

They honestly have a better chance outlawing it and imprisoning anyone who’s ever used it. First of all I don't think any state is currently motivated to do this. However, if I were a state agency trying to attack Bitcoin, I would start by creating my own mining pool, which of course would purport to be privately run. I would be the most efficient mining pool in the business, offering miners a slightly better cut than other mining pools since while most pool operators are trying to extract a low-margin profit, I'm willing to break even or, if necessary, run at a small loss. It would be ideally to gradually create several sock-puppet pools that appear to be in competition with one another, while in fact I control all of them. Even with competitive payouts, it may take several years to build up my pools reputation and gain a significant share of miners. And when I start having my pools mine blocks that I'm not actually submitting to the chain (to support my double spend), pretty soon miners will notice and switch. But I only need a couple hours to cause chaos, and I may benefit from miners confusedly switching to other pools that are also under my control. If I look at the regions where I have the most miners and time to the attack to occur overnight in those areas, I may succeed. And unlike trying to 51% the network myself by throwing hardware at the problem, I won't be left with worthless SHA256 hashing machines at the end of the attempt, nor will I have to pay for power. And I don't have to outmine the entire network -- I've enlisted half of it to be on my side. The only cost is the minimal pool operating expenses (not mining, just issuing work to miners, checking their work and arranging payouts), spread over how ever many years it takes me to gain dominance. reply rcxdude 14 hours agorootparentOr, skip the trouble of building such a pool and rubber-hose those who control the existing pools into doing what you want. reply mjburgess 16 hours agorootparentprevAll this depends on how many assumptions are in operation about what the state is doing to these networks, and the machines on them. In the end, it can turn all btc traffic off -- and there's no btc at all. Or it could take over the miners within its borders, which are heavily centralised, and run a different protocol. If you own the machines and own the network you can do anything you want. Anything at all. As far as assuming that the state hasnt taken control of the miners (unlikely, this is the easiest thing to do), by dropping communication, delaying it, observing it, etc. much can be done following the protocol, including replaying transactions etc. -- the future can be forged. There are so many assumptions about the realworld, that do not hold up, behind cryto protocols, they're laughable. Assuming that the system will follow the protocol is itself disconnected from reality, quite literally. The initial paper's realworld assumptions was that mining would be an at-home affair, ie., decentralised; everyone would run their own. And that networks were not own or controlled by centralised actors. Neither is true. Mininig is incredibly centralised, as is network control. This makes it trivial for a state to pull an off switch. Even talking about sophisticated denials of service, transaction replays, forging future transactions... all this takes place in a silly imagined scenario in which the state wants to hide what it's doing. If it didnt care, bang goes the whole thing. reply wongarsu 16 hours agorootparentprevYou would be able to control the part of the network you cut off, but if anyone smuggles in as much as a microSD card with the outside blockchain state and syncs it to their client, every client in the segment would see this longer chain (since the outside has more hash power than you) and recognize it as legitimate, undoing all your fraudulent transactions (along with a lot of legitimate ones that never reached the outside network) reply whatshisface 16 hours agorootparentprevThat's an elaborate and wasteful way to achieve the same results as banning crypto. reply lovich 17 hours agorootparentprevhttps://xkcd.com/538/ Countries have this neat tool called violence that tends to override all security whenever humans are a linchpin reply hk__2 17 hours agorootparent> Countries have this neat tool called violence that tends to override all security whenever humans are a linchpin That doesn’t work with distributed systems.

Critically, that can include your own transactions. You mine quietly, outpacing the regular network, creating your own longer chain. Perhaps you do this for an hour, several hours, or a day. The only transactions on this chain are those in which you send your own coins to yourself -- maybe plus some random transactions from the mempool you throw in to help cover your own tracks. Meanwhile you spend those same coins (UTXOs) on the \"honest\" chain. Once you are satisfied, you publish your longer chain. By the rules of the network the longest chain is the true one. Honest miners immediately begin building their blocks on top of your dishonest version of events. Since you are now working together with them, blocks are produced quickly. The honest chain dies. Chaos would ensue. Anybody who received coins on the dead chain can try to republish the transaction to the mempool and hope it gets mined again, so they get their money again. But if the sender is fast, they might realize they have a double-spend opportunity here, and submit a higher-fee transaction in which they sent those coins to themselves. It's a race. Of course, for your own UTXOs that were already spent in the dishonest chain, the race has already been won. Those double spends are successful. reply mjburgess 17 hours agorootparentprevif you split the network, you can add your own machines, that can rewrite the history arbitrarily from the future of that split.

Nope; that's not possible.

There is little usage for that power locally (it is in the middle of nowhere, frozen in the winters and otherwise wasteland surrounded by superfund sites thanks to the smelting). It also isn't like you can just plug in 115kv line into a 230kv line and call it a day. It would require new construction to send that power somewhere else, which is expensive and hard to justify over someone just paying for the power to stay right there.

Energy consumption/tx Bitcoin: 962.652745 kWh Ethereum: 0.011564 kWh Visa: 0.929304 kWh It's entirely possible some of these numbers are wrong or off so please check my math, but it looks like Ethereum is the most energy-efficient of the 3 on a per-transaction basis, maybe an order of magnitude better than Visa. Bitcoin on the other hand is 3 orders of magnitude worse than visa on a per-transaction basis. I suspect both Bitcoin and Ethereum also transact more value in USD per transaction (if you're willing to consider funny crypto money at spot prices) on average, than Visa, by virtue of them having a much higher transaction fee which is also borne by the address making the transaction. If you don't consider Ethereum transactions to be \"effective work\" than this isn't a relevant metric of course, but I'm curious how you're arriving at your figure. reply FabHK 5 hours agorootparent> curious how you're arriving at your figure Hi, sure. The nodes in the EVM do not collaborate to split the work, rather, they all perform (basically) the same work. So, you could instead run Ethereum with one node that connects to the net and receives transactions, processes them (around 20 per second - it's not exactly a lot of processing), puts them into blocks, and sends out the complete blocks. It would perform exactly the same as the current network, and would consume, say, 4 W (a Raspberry Pi, say). The one difference is that it would have to be trusted, which is the big no-no. But that's the effective work being done. But the validators burn around 1 MW (that lines up with your figure approximately) and are paid $5m a day to do that work. And 1 MW / 4 W is a factor of 250k, which I rounded up to 1m considering all the other activity around Ethereum, though feel free to round it down to 1e5. reply digging 16 hours agorootparentprevYou mean Proof of Stake.

That's my bias. 1. The banking industry is thousands of times more important that crypto for everyday Americans. It's what literally makes our entire economy run. Crypto is used for speculation. What you should be comparing bitcoin against is the energy it takes to list a few ETFs on an exchange, which is essentially the cost of a few hundred servers, aka nothing. Bitcoin is ungodly inefficient and will only become more inefficient. 2. \"It could be less, much less, or much less,\" This is a filler argument. Study says \"around\" a number, so you're arguing it could be a really broad definition of \"around\"? Not a serious take. 3. The absolute number matters because it's showing the economic activity is being concentrated in the pockets of just 137 entities. This is NOT a broad-base economic phenomenon that helps employ people in communities around the country, like say running gas stations (another polluting industry). If you're going to use 2% of the nation's electricity, you'd want the benefits spread across at least 2% of the population. Not 0.00002%. 4. Net energy consumption pulls from our current energy grid. Within a grid, if you use more clean electricity in one area, it'll pull more supply from dirtier sources elsewhere. Saying that bitcoin mining helps \"green\" the grid is a myth because you have to mine it 24/7/365, which means intermittent sources like wind and solar are at a big disadvantage. Battery storage tech is not there yet, thus gas plants and dirtier sources have to kick-in to keep up with 24/7 consumption. reply brvsft 16 hours agorootparentI disagree with your first point mainly because this is more of a symptom of what Americans want, not necessarily some sort of virtuous result of the banking industry. I'd also argue that it doesn't \"make our entire economy run.\" What makes the economy run is people going to work and performing work, producing goods and services. Banking is merely an aspect of that, and it's perhaps propped up into a bigger piece than it may need to be because people prefer being able to (or in some cases need to) access credit to buy stuff. I also somewhat disagree with (3) because it's ambiguous how many people constitute these mining facilities referenced in the article. You write it as though it means 137 individuals. But overall I only dislike crypto because it has become a space for charlatans and people who want to get rich quick.

There is no reality we live in now where crypto transacts faster, more cheaply, than our current financial infrastructure. 2. Even if the it’s something g much lower, like .5%, point 1 above doesn’t absolve crypto from its share of energy expense for comparatively little work. 3.

I guess it’s clear I think it IS a waste of energy. 4. Where do you think the lions share of energy generation to feed crypto mining comes from?

We can get a reasonable upper bound: the block reward is 6.25 BTC + fees (the blocks I saw tended to have around 0.5 BTC in fees), so let's be generous and say 7 BTC per block. 144 blocks per day are 52560 blocks or 368k BTC per year. Currently, they're worth 47k each, so $17.3B/year. The 91 TWh figure (from https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364) seems derived directly from a 240 TWh global power consumption multiplied by the assumed % of mining happening in the US, so since we're using global revenue, it only makes sense to use the global number, 240 TWh = 240e9 kWh. 17.3e9 USD / 240e9 kWh => 7.2 ct/kWh That's the absolute maximum that electricity could cost in order for mining to be profitable. That's making some very generous assumptions - I used the current price (annual high!) instead of the much lower average over the past months or year, and it completely ignores the very significant cost of the mining hardware. But given that 7.2 ct/kWh is roughly what industrial electricity costs in the US, and miners might be able to get power cheaper (since they can be more flexible than e.g. an aluminium plant that would suffer expensive damage if power is cut unexpectedly), it's not an entirely unreasonable number for an upper bound. Getting accurate numbers through mandatory reporting isn't the worst idea, if only to prevent such bullshit headlines. reply pcthrowaway 16 hours agorootparentIt's an \"estimate\" but if the mining operations of these 137 miners have known addresses (which I assume they have to for compliance), it's going to be accurate within 20%. The block reward is irrelevant, we just need to look at the hashrate of the network Basically, take the overall hashrate of the entire network which is determined from the block difficulty (this fluctuates and was likely higher when bitcoin was more valuable, though not necessarily), and assume all blocks are mined by operators running state of the art mining hardware (realistically 90-98% of blocks will be mined by people running hardware that's 80-100% of the maximum possible efficiency, and any miners running worse hardware will be consuming more energy, but we can pretend they're all on the best hardware) Using that, you can get the overall hashrate of the network. Once you have that, you can take the percentage of blocks mined by these 137 miners in a year. Again, be generous and assume they're all running state of the art hardware. If 10% of all blocks are mined by these 137 mining ops, guess what, they're using 10% of the total energy being inhaled by the network. reply josu 17 hours agoparentprev>re: 4 \"The results of this survey show that the members of the BMC and participants in the survey are currently utilizing electricity with a 63.1% sustainable power mix.\" https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/ The BMC is mostly composed of US miners. reply throw0101d 16 hours agoparentprev> Energy consumption is frankly not a phenomenon I give two shits about, as an environmentalist.

Now, the above argument is only relevant if we can prove that Blockchain transactions actually are a waste of energy, and you seem to attempt to argue against that as well, by asking for a comparison with the traditional banking system. I'm not sure that the traditional banking system add a whole uses less energy than Blockchain as a whole, but I AM sure that the traditional banking system handles several orders of magnitude more transactions than all Blockchains does combined, and absent any proof to the contrary, I'm assuming the traditional banking system is not using more than an order of magnitude more energy than Blockchain(since that would mean that traditional banks use around 23% of American energy, which is an absurd amount of energy) As long as Blockchain uses more energy per transaction than traditional banking, it's a waste of energy, relatively speaking.

Surprise! Now do porn consumption. reply KMag 14 hours agoparentprevFormer banker here. There's extremely little overlap between traditional banking and what cryptocurrency does. There's more overlap with what a credit card company does. Most of traditional banking is about financing, not about money transfer. The risk estimation and risk control are the tough parts of financing, and I don't see how on-chain computation is a good fit for that risk modeling. So, \"What's the energy cost of the combined Visa and Mastercard networks\" is a much better benchmark than \"What's the combined energy cost of the traditional banking system?\" One big energy use I optimized was daily risk calculation for exotic books. Say an Australian insurance company sold a bunch of life insurance in Japan. They want to cap their losses on $5 billion USD notional (maybe 2,500 policies, each for $2 million) over the next 30 years, and they want to cap their losses at $1.5 billion AUD. This extremely bespoke, not something the bank can offload to another entity, so the bank is pretty much stuck with this re-insurance on its books for the next 30 years. How much does the bank need to keep on-hand in case this goes sour? To answer that question, every day the bank needs to run Monte Carlo simulations to cover shifts in the Japanese life expectancy curve and shifts in the JPY/AUD exchange rate over the next 30 years. It turns out that for some of these exotic options contracts, just compute cost for calculating risk exposure over the lifetime of the trade can end up being a noticeable percentage of the profit from the trade. Sure, you could pull some of that simulation compute on-chain in smart contracts, but what does a DAO do when it has insufficient reserves to cover its outstanding obligations? I guess you need a diverse enough DAO so its risk exposures are sufficiently uncorrelated, but that means that it needs to do vastly more computation to calculate its current exposure every time someone asks the DAO to enter into an obligation. Either all miners need to redundantly run these calculations, or you push them off-chain. If you push the risk calculations off-chain, then you're back to the energy consumption being very different than the traditional banking system. reply FabHK 16 hours agoparentprevRe 1.

You could to a more energy-efficient Netflix, but you cannot do a more energy-efficient Bitcoin. reply greyface- 16 hours agorootparent> larger and larger usage of energy by design It's actually the opposite: its energy usage shrinks and shrinks, by design. Every 210,000 blocks (~4 years), the block reward (mining subsidy) drops in half. At the limit, it approaches zero, and the network can only afford to spend as much on energy as users pay in transaction fees. Admittedly, \"the limit\" is quite a few years off, and there's a big subsidy still. I'm surprised we haven't seen taxing authorities go after block rewards specifically - they're why miners are currently willing to spend 10~20x on energy vs what users pay them for transactions. reply RedNifre 15 hours agorootparentprevSure you can, what is called \"Proof of work\" in the context of Bitcoin is actually \"Proof of money lost\" in the form of paid electricity. If you taxed mining at 90%, you would also reduce mining and thus electricity consumption by 90%. (Ideally, this would be a global tax and not too high, since reducing mining too much would compromise security) reply acdha 16 hours agoparentprevBitcoin is designed to be inefficient: the network adjusts to use more power as it becomes available. None of the other things you mentioned have that mechanism where greater usage makes them need more power for everyone who was already there. The closest you might come is something like road traffic where the situation gets asymptomatically worse as more people start driving, but even that is much better than Bitcoin because people aren’t just driving because they can and will reduce their driving when traffic is unpleasant. Bitcoin is somewhat uniquely poorly-architected in a way which deters adoption but has also become a quasi-religious point preventing the design from being fixed. reply realreality 17 hours agoparentprev> Ok, Bitcoin bad. What about video games? Netflix? Porn? Yes, they're all bad. Markets are no substitute for morality.

Since the beginning of time there have always been a group of humans who would like the ability to not follow the rules set by whatever accounts for leadership in their group. Bitcoin isn't feeding some novel desire. And Bitcoin/crypto evangelists still havent grappled with the fact that if they ever actually succeed in becoming a real rival of fiat currencies then they are going to find out what state violence looks like when they continue not complying with regulations. Like do you really believe if Iran/North Korea/Russia converted over their entire economy to using bitcoin to escape US regulations, that you are going to be able to continue using it without any sort of reaction from the US? Or if Chinese citizens use it en masse to completely avoid government controls, that the Chinese government will just throw up their hands and say \"shucks\"? You can fill in that statement with any government and a group they intend to control and have the ability to exert violence on reply alchemist1e9 15 hours agorootparentOk let’s try it: > It takes both intellectual and emotional maturity to understand and accept the wisdom and power of free markets.

That is completely delusional reply alchemist1e9 9 hours agorootparentIt’s fascinating how history informs us about the evolution of state power and its reliance on violence to enforce compliance. Reflecting on the industrial age, we see how the permanence of factories and infrastructure bolstered the state’s capacity for coercion—a tool leveraged to an extreme in fostering ideologies like communism. The physical nature of wealth, exemplified by gold bars, presented an opportunity for straightforward confiscation. Contrast this with the digital age, where Bitcoin introduces a paradigm shift. The inefficacy of traditional state violence against digital assets is stark. The very concept of borders becomes almost anachronistic when considering the ease with which a Bitcoin wallet can be concealed and transported, unlike the gold coins of yore that families might have smuggled in loaves of bread. The suggestion that authoritarian regimes would willingly adopt Bitcoin is where the real absurdity lies. Such governments thrive on control and suppression, the antithesis of the free-market principles Bitcoin embodies. To imagine they would facilitate their own obsolescence by embracing a decentralized currency is to fundamentally misunderstand their nature. Your apprehension that state violence will quash Bitcoin’s rise underestimates the resilience and decentralization of digital currencies. As Bitcoin continues its trajectory, reshaping the financial landscape, it will not be the threat of violence that determines its fate but its inherent ability to provide an alternative to those governed by fiat’s limitations. Your perspective, while rooted in historical precedents of state power, may indeed lead to confusion as you witness the unfolding impact of Bitcoin and its challenge to conventional monetary systems. reply lovich 3 hours agorootparentCrypto enthusiasts have barely dealt with state violence. You are such a fraction of economic activity that you barely register on the radar of actual powers. Fuck with the money that states control in a manner where one with a military feels threatened by it, survive their reaction, and then ill believe you that crypto has managed to make violence obsolete. I am going to use a meme to make a flippant point here, but this is what crypto enthusiasts sound like when they say theyre overcoming fiat currencies and there is nothing countries can do to stop them https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/778/145/b6f... reply andrewheekin 16 hours agoprevThis article completely glosses over the hardest problem in the power industry - grid transmission constraints. What's a transmission constraint? Well, eventually the electrical resistance on high voltage power lines reaches a maximum threshold at which no more power can flow through the line, shoutout Ohm's Law :) I work in financial power derivatives, and there are entire trading desks devoted to \"congestion trading\" - ie the financial right to transmit power between grid locations with inherent transmission congestion. From the EIA map of mining operations, crypto mining tends to take place in remote areas where electricity is plentiful but hard to deliver to major load zones (cities) due to grid transmission constraints. On the whole, most crypto mining operations choose to operate in regions where the price of electricity is cheap (remote locations). Paradoxically, these operations running during off-peak times contributes to grid stability by smoothing the load curve and preventing expensive curtailment of alternative generation resources (think along the lines of a wind turbine needing t",

An Apple executive lobbied against a strong right-to-repair bill in Oregon Thursday, which is the first time the company has had an employee actively outline its stance on right to repair at an open hearing. Apple’s position in Oregon shows that despite supporting a weaker right to repair law in California, it still intends to control its own repair ecosystem. It also sets up a highly interesting fight in the state because Google has come out in favor of the same legislation Apple is opposing. “It is our belief that the bill’s current language around parts pairing will undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin in consumer devices,” John Perry, Apple’s principal secure repair architect, told the legislature. This is a quick about-face for the company, which after years of lobbying against right to repair, began to lobby for it in California last fall. The difference now is that Oregon's bill includes a critical provision that Google says it can easily comply with but that is core for Apple to maintain its dominance over the repair market.

No company anywhere close to this size cares about anything other than money. Apple cares about privacy because it is a differentiator in the market in which their biggest competitors are fundamentally data brokers. Apple would abandon prioritizing privacy the moment market conditions stop that from being a profitable position to have. reply rootusrootus 14 hours agoparent> Apple cares about privacy because it is a differentiator in the market As someone who prefers Apple products these days, I don't run into many people who blindly think that privacy is some kind of immutable characteristic of the corporation. We absolutely understand that it is a position they put themselves into because it attracts customers. It's important to their bottom line. > Apple would abandon prioritizing privacy the moment market conditions stop that from being a profitable position to have True, but I think the leaders at Apple are well aware of how risky abandoning such a core selling point would be for future sales. They have to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, much less actual privacy violations, or it'll tank their reputation. I think it unlikely they will conclude that selling the data is more valuable anytime soon. Luckily there are so many anti-Apple people constantly scrutinizing their every action for possible malfeasance, I expect we'll hear about it very quickly and loudly if/when it happens. A problem to worry about then. Right now, their competition is largely unconcerned with privacy already. reply hot_gril 15 hours agoparentprevI agree that Apple only cares about money. So do they dislike this law because it means people can repair and hold onto Apple hardware longer, because it compromises Apple's hardware security somehow, or because it adds some other cost to Apple? I don't imagine many are self-repairing, but there are independent repair shops too. reply advael 15 hours agorootparentBy preventing independent repair, Apple can indeed prevent you from holding on to your device longer by just deciding it's totaled with no one keeping them honest about it. It can also gouge you on parts and service even if it doesn't do that, as is true for any monopoly on any service. It also makes it harder for honest researchers to audit Apple's security claims, harder for independent hackers to modify devices they own, such as if they want to route around the incredibly high tax Apple imposes on developers for its hardware platforms, etc. The kind of control Apple wants to have comes with lots of profitable ways to exploit it. reply omikun 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause it makes it easier for people to disassemble stolen iphones and sell the parts if they can be reused. reply dathinab 14 hours agorootparentprevthey sell 1000+€ phones, tablets and computers many cases of very common damage to such devices is very much fixable, at least theoretically for a small fraction of the price they mainly care about you not repairing them any supposed \"compromised security\" could be handled with free user choice in form of a hardware lock-down mode (with appropriate warnings) but the huge majority of their users don't need nor care for that they provide no proper repair, only replacement of whole sometimes multiple components which given their design often means the whole motherboard, even if needed repairs can often be done with much much less cost their repair is also believed to systematically misclassify damage and needed repairs (i.e. it looks like it's structured with a focus on avoiding actual repairs). E.g. not just are there many cases of them stating that there was water damage without there being any sign of that they also use overly sensitive water intrusion sensors which frequently go off without any intrusion. Stories of them claiming other damage when the repair was e.g. just a faulty cable. they have done many steps to either make repair outright impossible or so cumbersome that they monetary make no sense (e.g. their \"repair program\") As far as I remember multiple PR campaigns which focused around fearmongering about \"evil independent repair shops\" have indirect ties with Apple. Indirect enough so that Apple can claim that had nothing to do with them. I.e. they in my opinion really don't want you to repair your devices, or worse upgrade them. Security in many (maybe not all) cases seems to play no role outside of being a good excuse. reply sangnoir 14 hours agorootparentprev> I don't imagine many are self-repairing, but there are independent repair shops too. Beyond repair shops, there is a healthy cottage industry with thousands of participants - maybe tens of thousands - who do repairs in their homes as a hobby, extra income or for friends and family. Buying and fixing broken second-hand doodads for resale can be a profitable hobby, and saves items from being consigned to trash early. Apple gets $0 from this aftermarket, and ends up competing with its own products from 2018. I don't think they are pleased about Oregon's bill, especially as we've hit the limits of Gordon's Laws. reply advael 15 hours agoparentprevI mean they do already sell much of the same telemetry data to their own data broker customers.

There is no actual vision other then short and longterm shareholder value. \"Founders\" like Musk and Jobs have a short window where they can move their companies in directions which matches their vision, but that closes quickly after the company goes public and their stock gets diluted enough so that they be ousted. reply karaterobot 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is sort of like saying every human cares about nothing than food and air. All companies require money to operate, as humans require food and air, but they can have other goals besides the acquisition of as much money as possible, in the shortest time horizon possible, damn the consequences. I would say that most do. And just as with most people, philosophy and literature and charity and invention go out the door when a human is starving to death or being waterboarded, most companies will put aside all their other goals when they have no money. But, to say that means humans don't do anything other than get food and breathe, or that companies don't do anything but get more money, is such a limited model as not to be of practical use.

Once they are running a company, it doesn't take long for this to matter less and less. Even in the early stages of a startup, the priority will shift quickly to whatever gets the next round of funding. In the case of a company that has become large, there is virtually zero chance that the wheel can be steered away from whatever the aggregate algorithm used to weigh the priorities of the shareholders and make a decision thinks will be profitable.

When real human beings - who can care about things - stand up and speak on behalf of a company, we're falling for a hell of a deception if we think their words represent anything solid. reply danans 15 hours agorootparentprev> Doesn't this describe every company, is there any company in a capitalist market would care about anything other than money? Sure. There are plenty of smaller companies whose goal is financial sustainability while also pursuing some other objective. It's just much harder to maintain that position when you have millions of investors expecting growth or increasing returns. reply sneak 15 hours agoparentprevApple doesn’t care about privacy or they wouldn’t have maintained the back door in the e2ee in iMessage. iMessage is not end to end encrypted because the endpoints escrow their keys in non-e2ee fashion to Apple. https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZK1CO/ Privacy is just a marketing bullet point for them and a brand differentiator.

One law firm specializes in this, and the story above has been the case in each of the five or six times it has been done. Yet they claim, with a straight face (and even have writers like Matt Levine carrying water for them) that really, truly, honestly, they're not doing this to avoid liability, they're doing it \"to make the process easier for the plaintiffs and streamline their legal efforts\".

It is cheap to be activist on social media but much harder to be one in the physical non-anonymous world where you stand to really risk something. reply dreamcompiler 15 hours agoprevFor any manufacturer, repairing products is expensive (i.e. it decreases profit). That incentivizes two behaviors: 1. Make the product as reliable as possible. 2. Make the product non-repairable. Every company also increases profit by selling more units, so when a company's only performance metrics come from Wall Street, well, here we are. The only solution in the absence of significant competition (which applies to Apple) is regulation. There need to be laws that mandate not only repairability but also that Apple absorb the now-externalized societal cost of all the e-waste their devices produce. reply hot_gril 15 hours agoparentiPhones have the longest usable lifespan of any smartphone. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentSure, but they are still nothing compared to other things. I still use a tractor from 1939 (mostly for parades, but it works for anything it could have done new). My stove is from the 1980s and it still works like new. Can you use a gen1 iphone - it would only be about 15 years old (2g phone networks are being dismantled, and may only be on frequency that were not even allocated to phones when that was built). If it breaks what can you repair on it to make it work again? Of course sometimes it isn't worth repairing. I had my 50 years old furnace repaired 2 years ago - but I was already saving to replace it as a modern one is so much more efficient (I also knew the city was putting in natural gas pipes, so I wanted to wait) reply AnthonyMouse 14 hours agorootparentYou don't have to go outside the industry, or even the company. Apple computers from the start of the company up to the early 21st century are often still functional to this day and most were modular and easy to repair. Likewise, you can install modern Linux kernels on PCs (and Macs) going back to something like the i486 from 1989, and even supported versions of Windows can be installed on PCs that are ~20 years old. The market for mobile phones is abnormally dysfunctional. reply hot_gril 13 hours agorootparentMobile phones are extremely small, feature-packed, and quickly-advancing compared to any of these things. Plenty of Android phonemakers have teased repairable phones, but the drawbacks don't make them worthwhile. I think the market has spoken. Apple deserves criticism for desktop PC repairability, though. At least in the past. There were several iterations of Mac mini or other desktops that they intentionally made harder to repairable with no gain. I don't even mean the T2 chips that at least have a semi-plausible excuse, I mean like soldering in the RAM or gluing together the body. Again the market has spoken; I think even the creative pro market went to Windows long ago. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThe rate of advancement of PCs in the 90s was faster than it is for mobile phones today and many of those devices can run modern software to this day. Moreover, in both cases the primary difference is that the CPUs get faster and you get more memory and storage for the same price, which is irrelevant for the people using their phones primarily to make phone calls and send text messages, because the older hardware could do that when it was new and can still do it now. Which would allow people who need only that to buy a used phone and give people who need more than that someone to sell their old phone to. Making a phone modular isn't that complicated -- they, in fact, used to do it. Many flip phones had replaceable batteries that the user could so easily remove that they made external chargers in case you wanted two batteries. The amount of space and weight required to put a processor in a socket of the type traditionally used in laptops is negligible, even for a phone, but would significantly lower the cost of repairs because a broken connector on the logic board wouldn't require you to replace the expensive SoC. The electronics in many modern phones are already layered to preserve space and the contact points between layers are a natural position for modular component boundaries. reply hot_gril 13 hours agorootparentRe 1990s PCs: If you're talking about the late 90s, not really. They standardized on x86(-64?) CPU talking to modular RAM and disk, in big boxes with plenty of room. Overall 30 years went by with basically the same standard because it was sufficient. Early 90s I'm honestly too young to talk about, but afaik both hardware and software were more unique and became obsolete more quickly, and today we're actually trending that way again. Re processor sockets etc: When is the last time you had to throw away the phone you use because of a bad CPU? Bad connector on logic board? The whole thing is a single solid piece now, it doesn't really fail. It's basically screen and battery, and both are actually not that hard to replace on iPhones. reply AnthonyMouse 12 hours agorootparent> overall 30 years went by with basically the same standard. That mobile phones lack any kind of meaningful standard is rather the problem, but the form factor hasn't significantly changed since the original iPhone. > When is the last time you had to throw away the phone you use because of a bad CPU? That's the point. The CPU doesn't go bad, but it's expensive, and right now if a kid snaps off the USB connector on your phone you may have to replace the entire logic board including the CPU. Likewise if you're attempting a repair of something else and you damage one of the tiny fragile internal connectors in the process. Then you need a new logic board, but that could be a $20 part instead of a $200 one if everything else wasn't soldered to it. > Bad connector on logic board, what connectors? The whole thing is a single solid piece now, it doesn't really fail. It's basically screen and battery, and both are actually not that hard to replace on iPhones. There are often separate connectors for not just the screen and battery but the camera(s), earpiece, antenna(s), and also stuff like this: https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Taptic_Engine As I said, there are already a lot of connectors in the thing. Adding two or three more wouldn't be a big deal, but would do a lot in terms of repair cost by separating the things most likely to break from the things with the highest cost. It would also give you the ability to do upgrades. Any kind of standard for attaching more memory or storage would significantly extend the practical life of most devices, because it's generally not the CPU that becomes too slow. reply hot_gril 12 hours agorootparentLack of standardization is the problem for repairability at least, but it has helped with progress. It's not like the government mandated a standard for desktop PCs, it just made sense for the industry. I'm not convinced that phone upgrades would work too well, due to incompatibilities. Except for storage. I think if the govt wants to be helpful here, mandating a microSD slot (at least an internal one) would improve longevity far more than the other things combined. reply AnthonyMouse 11 hours agorootparent> Lack of standardization is the problem for repairability at least, but it has helped with progress. What progress? How would having a standard memory or storage connector suitable to the form factor stifle progress? > It's not like the government mandated a standard for desktop PCs, it just made sense for the industry. It makes sense in any industry where there are a large number of companies that have to interoperate with each other. The big problem with phones is that there aren't a large number of companies -- the SoCs are pretty much all made by Qualcomm, Apple and Samsung and Apple and Samsung don't sell a lot of chips to third party OEMs. What they ought to do is break them up so there is some real competition in the market, or at least stop letting them buy up their competitors. But if that isn't going to happen then something else needs to happen, because the status quo is broken. > I'm not convinced that phone upgrades would work too well, due to incompatibilities. There is a new form factor for memory called CAMM, quite space efficient. Suppose there was a smaller version of that suitable for phones, all the phones used it, and then compatibility exists in the sense that every phone using DDR5 is compatible with every other phone using DDR5, but if your phone takes DDR6 then you need DDR6, also a standard, just a newer one. Why would this not work? It works for everything else. reply hot_gril 11 hours agorootparentStandard memory connector already makes memory-on-chip a no-go. And we're past that even, cause we have storage-on-chip, which is both faster and more secure (in the \"hardware security\" sense which is of course sketchy but still a thing). Even on desktops now. I had a pretty loaded cheesegrater Mac Pro and replaced it with an M1 Mac mini, less upgradable but such a nice machine anyway. I could believe the phone chipmaking status quo is broken or monopolized if I saw a lack of progress and price increases. Instead, we've been getting remarkably faster and more versatile phone hardware at a steady pace. And most consumers care about that, not about modular upgrades. There are a few smaller areas I feel like the manufacturers are pushing consumers rather than listening to them, like removing headphone jacks to sell BT earbuds. reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> Standard memory connector already makes memory-on-chip a no-go. No it doesn't. You put the memory on the chip and then you add more via the connector. The memory on the chip is faster but there's less of it. Cache hierarchies are useful. This is already a thing. All modern CPUs have SRAM caches integrated into them. Xeon Max has integrated HBM. It still has memory slots. > And we're past that even, cause we have storage-on-chip, which is both faster and more secure (in the \"hardware security\" sense which is of course sketchy but still a thing). This is in no real sense more secure. You can secure data on an untrusted storage device simply by encrypting it. It's also not obvious how this would be any faster. NVMe with four PCIe lanes is enough for some of the fastest desktop SSDs, and if you wanted more you could always add more lanes. A PCIe lane isn't that many pins. reply dathinab 14 hours agorootparentprevYes it a major part of their marked strategy. In the past iPhones living long enough to allow a second hand marked was a major part of how they where able to capture such a huge market share. Without that they would have struggled to establish themself to the degree they have due to being \"just for the wealthy\". Also one of their main selling points is the label of a \"super well build best of engineering\" product. People still associate longevity with that. With the world wide financial situation of most not wealthy people getting worse in recent years and iPhone having gotten even more expensive longevity has become an increasing important reason why non-wealthy people might still buy new iPhones, even if it's second hand still for a high price. BUT the more they make them long lived the more they want repair (or worse upgrade) to not make monetary sense for anyone. At the same time the more they gain from pretending they care about repair, and it's just because of user safety and similar that the price of it is so high and/or it not being possible. I mean a \"super well build best of engineering product\" should normally be repairable right? Also Apple engines are not their sales team and they care about trying to make an actual \"super well build best of engineering product\" often looking down intentional brittle products. reply worewood 14 hours agorootparentprevThat's what he/she meant by \"make the product as reliable as possible\". This, however, does not exempt them from the responsibility of the e-waste created by their non-repairability. reply hot_gril 13 hours agorootparentRepairability can come at a cost to longevity. Complicates the design and reduces the trustworthiness of used phones. reply newaccount74 12 hours agorootparentprevUntil it cracks after an accidental fall. Apple's repair prices are so high, that often it's cheaper to buy the same model used rather than have it repaired. This ensures that people throw phones away rather than repair them, which increases demand for new phones. reply hot_gril 10 hours agorootparentThere are lots of third-party screen repair shops. Except it seems like screens are a lot stronger than before, and back when they weren't, everyone I knew just used a cracked screen until the phone was outdated enough to replace. reply Eji1700 15 hours agoprevThis really shouldn't be a surprise.

His work has definitely changed my views about this issue to be very anti-Apple because of how few options they actually give consumers when the majority of fixes are downright trivial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVAmnV65_zw In one of his videos they mention how they're able to sometimes source parts and it's by workers sneaking broken boards out of the factory and if that isn't a depressing state of repairs I don't know what else could be worse. The bar is so low here, a law that just prohibited Apple from seizing genuine parts from 3rd party repair shops who salvage them from broken phones/laptops would already be an improvement. reply iszomer 15 hours agoparentWhat's worse is potentially using parts that may have once belonged to stolen Apple devices as there was a significant market for them in Shenzhen. Even Scotty/StrangeParts was able to build an iPhone from scratch with parts sourced from there. That may also be one of the contributing factors to why Apple began enforcing serialized parts in their product lineups but in my opinion, isn't anything new: we have such a system at my workplace that prevents components from being illicitly used or is blocked from being allowed onto a test flow because, this is \"what the [big] customer wants\". reply realusername 16 hours agoprevOf course they do, they support right to repair laws as long as they are useless for repairing anything. reply newaccount74 15 hours agoparentThey aren't against repair, they just want to make sure that they make a lot of money from repairs.

I think Apple is concerned with the user's experience. They don't want some random 3rd party component affecting the performance or functionality of the device, or some 3rd party's poor-repair job. Because if the repair job is crappy, and it only shows up down the road, the user blames Apple. Apple wants its users to connect positively with its products. This is why when you take your laptop into the store, they don't offer to just desolder the bad chip, and replace it. They don't want to take the time or money to train their store in doing these repairs. There's a lot that can go wrong and its easier to just make the policy to swap the entire component - the whole logic board. It's a lot quicker to do, it's a lot quicker to train, it's a lot lower risk in terms of chemical exposure, proper-ventilation, and materials disposal. If they take the entire bad motherboard, they can box them all up and ship them in bulk. reply realusername 15 hours agorootparentprev> They will let you repair your phone yourself, as long as you buy their overpriced parts.

Restricting the usage of inauthentic parts is one of the ways they accomplish this. It's wrong-headed of legislators to try to narrow the ecosystem, and restrict the axes along which companies can distinguish themselves. Fundamentally it should be the market that chooses, not legislators. If consumers want locked-down, appliance-style devices (and they seem to), why is that an invalid offering? If the thesis is that legislators know what consumers want better than consumers (or Apple) then I wholeheartedly disagree. reply anonymouskimmer 15 hours agoparentPeople know when they're buying NAPA generics instead of OEM parts when fixing their far more expensive cars. > It's wrong-headed of legislators to try to narrow the ecosystem, and restrict the axes along which companies can distinguish themselves.

We could after all let “the market” decide on whether private property is enforceable or allow “the market” to punish murderers. We don’t do that because we’ve found it doesn’t work that effectively (unless your goal is inefficiency and murder). Laws promote efficiency and progress by aligning incentives with market forces. Right to repair is a perfect example of such a low. It promotes autonomy and market competition. I find it confusing that anyone not profiting directly off the status quo would be against it. Regardless the people profiting off it are in the minority so hopefully the majority continues to push for the passage of more such laws. reply hot_gril 14 hours agorootparentIt's a phone or laptop repair in question, not someone's life or living. reply CharlesW 13 hours agorootparentprev> Well it’s quite a silly stance.

Really, why the surprise? reply buildbot 15 hours agoprev [–] A massive reason why I, a consumer of Apple products, continue to consume them, new or used, is that I can trust that a repair will be genuine, be calibrated, and be as close to new as possible. After many years of Android phones that broke and needed repair or replacement, I got tired of shitty refurbed devices among other things. A used iPhone is way more likely to be mostly still an iPhone than a used android phone. I do think right to repair is important. I think companies should be forced to produce and sell repair parts. I don’t think we want to force 3rd party compatibility. It’s different with a car IMO - a non OEM suspension component better meet whatever specification, there is liability(maybe?) if that fails. A cheap screen with 80% sRGB just looks bad, but won’t kill you. No manufacturer incentive to care about quality at all! reply switchbak 15 hours agoparentI think the framework laptop is evidence enough that a device can be engineered to make such repairs easy. To such a degree that you wouldn't need to trust the shady repair shack as much, you could do most things yourself much easier (if you desire). Cells phones are a little harder, but still doable. I think the low quality of Android has more to do with their typical price point, and just the strange culture around disposable low quality phones. In fact, much of this existed with older Mac's - I had swapped out the memory, fans, battery, etc of my old Macbooks. Nothing prevented me from ensuring I was getting OEM equipment, but I also had the choice to get different hardware if I desired. Which in my case was important: memory that cost 1/4 the price, an SSD at 2x the performance, etc. All that to say: I think we've already had a mix of user repairability (and/or) trustworthy parts for a long time. I think it worked well enough, and the move away from it screws people over (especially poorer folks). reply AnthonyMouse 15 hours agoparentprev> A used iPhone is way more likely to be mostly still an iPhone than a used android phone. What you want here is a way for the owner of the device to tell if the parts are OEM. That doesn't require prohibiting non-OEM parts, just putting a menu in the system to show if any are present, which you can check when buying a used device. You might even go so far as to put the name of the manufacturer in the menu, and then people might be fine with an iPhone replacement screen from Samsung but not one from Value To Be Filled In By Manufacturer, Inc. (This doesn't require any kind of technical registration system, just read the manufacturer name out of the device and display it; there are existing laws against trademark infringement.) > A cheap screen with 80% sRGB just looks bad, but won’t kill you.

Why do you need to take away a consumer's choice to buy a non-repairable device? For those consumers where repairability is important, there are options. reply newaccount74 12 hours agorootparentBecause that's obviously a fake choice.

Otherwise it's not really a meaningful choice. reply i_am_jl 15 hours agoparentprevI'm not understanding your point re: cars vs phones.

Right now if you swap two iphone motherboards just bought from the apple store, none of the two resulting iphones work properly despite both only having genuine parts reply kmeisthax 15 hours agoparentprevIn the case of parts pairing, we're not mandating compatibility with third-party parts, we're mandating compatibility with first-party parts. Parts pairing doesn't validate that you have a genuine part, it validates that the part in there is the one Apple says should be. The parts in an iPhone are effectively non-interchangeable, like we've gone back to 1765[0] or something. As for third-party parts, the reason why the repair market is flooded with 80% sRGB garbo screens is because Apple took the good screens off the market. Sure, you can buy a screen assembly from their weirdly debranded parts store, but that's deliberately designed to force you to buy components you don't need. Remember, a screen assembly also means replacing the front cameras, Face ID sensors, etc. If you want to buy just the LCD or OLED and put it into an existing assembly, which is the only way any of this shit makes financial sense to repair, sorry, you're not allowed to buy just that. The thing about manufacturer-branded repair services is that they're built like a McDonalds. Everything is designed so that they can hire the cheapest labor possible. That's why they have really expensive custom hotplates to remove iPhone glass, and why they'll charge you for a new Face ID sensor just because you need new screen glass. Component-level repair requires investing in your employees, which is the last thing Tim \"Ship Jobs To 'Jaina\" Cook would ever do. The reason why people like Louis Rossmann were able to beat the Genius Bar on price was not because he was buying cheap parts. It's because he was buying genuine[1] parts produced by companies breaking their exclusivity agreements with Apple, and then investing money into his employees to do the skilled fix.

    "originLink": "https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.0.0",
    "originBody": "honojs / hono Public Notifications Fork 304 Star 11.3k Code Issues 132 Pull requests 19 Discussions Actions Security Insights Releases v4.0.0 v4.0.0 Latest Latest Compare yusukebe released this v4.0.0 ca6f365 Going to full-stack. Hono v4.0.0 is out! This major update includes some breaking changes and the addition of three major features. Static Site Generation Client Components File-based Routing So Hono is going to full-stack. Let's take a look at the three features. 1. Static Site Generation We introduce SSG Helper. With it you can generate static pages of your Hono applications. To use this, create a separate file build.ts from the application and call the toSSG() function in it. import fs from 'node:fs/promises' import { toSSG } from 'hono/ssg' import app from './src/index' toSSG(app, fs) There are adapters for Bun and Deno, so you can write shorter for Bun, for example. import { toSSG } from 'hono/bun' import app from './src/index' toSSG(app) And, just run it. bun ./build.ts Then HTML is generated. $ ls static about.html index.html You can easily deploy this page to Cloudflare Pages, etc. $ wrangler pages deploy static With Vite We have created a plugin @hono/vite-ssg for Vite. By using this, you will be able to develop and build a static sites with just the vite command. The configuration is the following: import build from '@hono/vite-ssg' import devServer from '@hono/vite-dev-server' import { defineConfig } from 'vite' export default defineConfig({ plugins: [ build(), devServer({ entry: 'src/index.tsx' }) ] }) If you want to develope, just run the command: vite If you want to build, just run the command: vite build In combination with the deployment mentioned above to Cloudflare Pages, you can develop, SSG build, and deploy non-stop. And each of them is extremely fast (the video is 2x faster). 2. Client Components hono/jsx was originally designed to run server-side as an alternative to template engines such as Mustache. Server-side JSX is an interesting experiment, creating a new stack to combine with HTMX and Alpine.js. But that's not all. Now, hono/jsx runs on the client as well. We call it hono/jsx/dom or Client Components. The exact same code as React runs with Hono's JSX. import { useState } from 'hono/jsx' import { render } from 'hono/jsx/dom' function Counter() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0) return (Count: {count}setCount(count + 1)}>Increment) } function App() { return () } const root = document.getElementById('root') render(, root) The Hooks listed below are also implemented and you can create Client Components just like in React. useContext useEffect useState useCallback use startTransition useDeferredValue useMemo useLayoutEffect Memo isValidElement startViewTransition family In addition, the original APIs, startViewTransition family make the View Transition API easy to use. import { useState, startViewTransition } from 'hono/jsx' import { Style, css, keyframes } from 'hono/css' const fadeIn = keyframes` from { opacity: 0; } to { opacity: 1; } ` const App = () => { const [showTitleImage, setShowTitleImage] = useState(false) return ( startViewTransition(() => setShowTitleImage((state) => !state))}>Click!{!showTitleImage ? () : ()} ) } You can easily create the animation. Ultra-small The hono/jsx/dom is fast and ultra-small. It has a smaller JSX runtime dedicated to the DOM in addition to the common server and client ones. Just specify hono/jsx/dom instead of hono/jsx in tsconfig.json. \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\", \"jsxImportSource\": \"hono/jsx/dom\" The above counter example is 2.8KB with Brotli compression. In comparison, React is 47.3 KB for the same thing. 3. File-based Routing Last is File-based Routing. This is not included in the hono package, but is provided in a separate package. It is named HonoX. HonoX HonoX has the following features. File-based routing - You can create a large application like Next.js. Fast SSR - Rendering is ultra-fast thanks to Hono. BYOR - You can bring your own renderer, not only one using hono/jsx. Islands hydration - If you want interactions, create an island. JavaScript is hydrated only for it. Middleware - It works as Hono, so you can use a lot of Hono's middleware. You can try it now. One of create-hono's starter templates named \"x-base\" uses HonoX. For detailed usage, please see the following HonoX repository. https://github.com/honojs/honox The core is still tiny The addition of this feature has no impact on the core. \"Hello World\" in hono/tiny is still small, only 12KB minified.

    "commentBody": "Hono v4.0 (github.com/honojs)174 points by MrAlex94 22 hours agohidepastfavorite49 comments carstenhag 18 hours agoNowhere there's any explanation of what this is. Web standard? Fast? Workers? Ok, but what is it doing? How can it help me? The snippets subpage is empty. The examples have code directories with almost empty readmes. reply MrAlex94 18 hours agoparentSorry, should’ve probably added a text description. Hono is a JavaScript framework designed to run on (but not just) Edge runtimes. It’s nice due to it being very “lightweight”. It was mainly for server side functionality but this release adds more front end functionality, which I find quite welcome. Personally I have found this works well if you’re targeting those platforms. For example, I use it on Cloudflare Pages with Page Functions and it works a dream. I haven’t found it to be a write once target anywhere platform (for example, serving static files differs between platforms), but it makes it significantly less effort to migrate to a new platform if necessary, which is always nice. reply asplake 18 hours agoparentprevI agree that “fast, lightweight, web standards” isn’t much of a description but not too far down https://github.com/honojs/hono I did find this: > Hono … is a small, simple, and ultrafast web framework for the Edges. It works on any JavaScript runtime: Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, Bun, Vercel, AWS Lambda, Lambda@Edge, and Node.js. reply 16bytes 16 hours agoparentprevThank you. Even after spending 10 minutes reading, I still have only a vague idea of why this project exists. All of the code examples look like a slightly different syntax for express.js. So it's a server side javascript framework for handling HTTP requests? Since it targets multiple runtimes, I suppose it's \"express.js but without the node.js dependency?\". I feel like that's closer, but I'm still missing the \"why should I care?\" part. reply theultdev 14 hours agorootparentit's a much faster, leaner, express.js on the edge. you can't run traditional http servers in edge sandbox worker environments. frameworks like these target deno deploy, cloudflare workers, aws lambdas, etc. they are small to fit in worker 1mb~ limits and use browser apis instead of node apis to fit the env. bonus: sharing the same apis on the server and client also result in being able to share code client/server side. You'd only care if you were in the \"serverless\" field, and then you'd likely already know about Hono since it's linked in many documentations like Supabase, Cloudflare, Deno, etc. But you may not know about Hono because there are many options and some ways to be in serverless without seeing it yet and it's the newest framework I know of. (also my favorite so far other than raw deno) -- This particular release was linked since it's one update that turns it into a real framework like Next or Astro. They added 3 major features: - Static Site Generation - Client Components - File-based Routing Static site generation (SSG) would mean certain routes compile at build time and the worker won't compute them on the edge. Client components means they now support client side rendering (CSR), before Hono was only used for server side rendering (SSR). File-based routing is instead of coding your paths, the folder structure is used for routing, similar to Next which mimics how traditional http web serving works. -- This is important for users of Hono as it unlocks features that exist in larger frameworks while still staying extremely minimal and flexible. reply ggregoire 17 hours agoparentprevFrom the example it seems like it's to make HTTP APIs? You declare a route \"/\" and it returns the content \"Hello Hono!\" for this route. The word \"API\" appears twice on the landing page and github README, and the word \"web framework\" appears once on the github README. But indeed we shouldn't have to scrutinize all the sources of information to know what this is. Also \"web standard API\" doesn't really mean anything? Might just be because the authors are not native English speakers tho. I'd rewrite the main description to \"Hono: Fast, Lightweight, web framework to build APIs\" or something. See FastAPI landing page [1] for a reference: \"FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.\" I know immediately what this is. [1] https://fastapi.tiangolo.com reply deliriumchn 18 hours agoparentprevyeah, the text on their main landing page reads like a promo you see in a game; just a combination of fancy words lol \"Hono Fast, Lightweight, Web-standards Runs on any JavaScript runtime.\" reply theultdev 16 hours agorootparentfast = fast routing / throughput lightweight = small code size web standards = not node apis (fetch, not http.createClient, etc.) runs on any JS runtime = runs in deno/node/bun/workers/etc --- But yes the project is meant to be read by someone already in the field. The people who actually know how to use it. Yes it seems like a fancy combo of words if you don't know what they mean, but that's true for anything. reply jonahx 15 hours agorootparent> Yes it seems like a fancy combo of words if you don't know what they mean, but that's true for anything. This is untrue: it's possible to make things much more accessible than they are here. You write for an audience. This project could have written a description that works for \"most programmers with any background at all in web development.\" Instead they chose a much narrower audience. People are complaining about that choice. reply theultdev 14 hours agorootparentSure, and they can complain to their hearts desire. But it would be more fun to talk about the tech. 1. The OP is not the author of this project. 2. The project author did not know it was going to be directed at a more general audience. 3. They may have prepared the README for that if they knew. 4. Enjoy the tech and stop being so damn nitpicky HN So to end this, I explained the tech and reason why: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39318998 reply surprisetalk 21 hours agoprevI'm using Hono and Deno for https://flashcasts.com Hono + Postgres.js is getting pretty close to my ideal web stack. IMO, SSR websites is the best way to get projects out quickly: predictable \"builds\", minimal surface area, boring tech, etc. It helps that Hono has a very clean API :) reply xrd 20 hours agoparentAnother thread here mentioned SQLite. Can you say more about why/how you are using postgres.js? I use pocketbase a lot and am curious how your stack handles auth, login, etc? reply surprisetalk 20 hours agorootparentHere's two posts I wrote on how I do email tokens and async workers: • https://taylor.town/pg-email-token • https://taylor.town/pg-task Here's a condensed version of how I do login/signup: app.post(\"/signup\", async c => { const body = await c.req.parseBody(); const usr = { email: body.email.toString(), password: sql`crypt(${body.password.toString()}, gen_salt('bf', 8))`, } as Record; const [{ usr_id, email, token }] = await sql` with usr_ as (insert into usr ${sql(usr)} returning *) select usr_id, email, email_token(now(), email) as token from usr_ `; await sendVerificationEmail(email, token); await setSignedCookie(c, \"usr_id\", usr_id, cookieSecret); return c.redirect(\"/u\"); }); app.post(\"/login\", async c => { const { email, password } = await c.req.parseBody(); const [usr] = await sql` select *, password = crypt(${password.toString()}, password) AS is_password_correct from usr where email = ${email.toString()} `; if (!usr || !usr.is_password_correct) return c.html(Your password was incorrect.); if (!usr.email_verified_at) await sendVerificationEmail(usr.email, usr.token); await setSignedCookie(c, \"usr_id\", usr.usr_id, cookieSecret); return c.redirect(\"/u\"); }); reply xrd 19 hours agorootparentOK, I need to say more about this code snippet. I'm really fascinated by it. This is typescript, which is interesting because we have more confidence the JS \"works.\" But, it is also embedding SQL directly into your typescript. Isn't that a contradiction in code? I'm NOT suggesting you refactor to use an ORM or something! When I was an Android developer, I thought it was really fascinating to see how Room worked. Each SQL statement you created was actually compiled and validated at compile time not runtime, and it meant the SQL was sanity checked and sanitized. Nothing like that is happening here, right? You cannot validate this SQL at compile/build time? If not, aren't you YOLO riding the motorcycle but telling mom you are wearing your helmet? reply surprisetalk 19 hours agorootparent> Nothing like that is happening here, right? You cannot validate this SQL at compile/build time? If not, aren't you YOLO riding the motorcycle but telling mom you are wearing your helmet? Correct! It's a total pain haha. I loathe SQL, but it's the best tool for most modern web apps. All of flashcasts.com is 1800 lines. I'd guess 30% is HTML and 30% is SQL. The SQL does the vast majority of the heavy lifting if you think about moving bits over distances. So SQL is really important, but why don't I have any safeguards? Well, in my experience, the available safeguards are medicine more painful than the poison. For example, any of the queries in my app I can copy-and-paste into psql and start an interactive debugging session. Can't do that with ORMs. In my app, I dynamically aggregate and build all the podcast XML for every feed in a single Postgres query. It's super performant and surprisingly little SQL. Can't imagine doing that through an ORM. SQL queries will throw an error if they're not well formatted, so you just have to write a test suite that somehow hits every query exactly once. You can do this by separating out your SQL, or integration tests, or a handful of other methods, none of which are pleasant. Anyway, I'm tired of SQL, sol I'm working on an embedded query language in scrapscript. Stay tuned for details: [1] https://scrapscript.org reply paulryanrogers 14 hours agorootparentIsn't there a risk of SQL injection from user input? reply surprisetalk 14 hours agorootparentpostgres.js sanitizes inputs, but also provides a backdoor, so sql`select ${\"hello\"}, ${sql`world`}` becomes select $1, world [1] https://github.com/porsager/postgres reply DrDroop 19 hours agorootparentprevI also use postgres.js a lot, but most of the time I don't even bother with the typescript. If you develop using the JetBrain suite then you can have really good support for sql embedded in strings, it is aware of your schema and does syntax highlighting. reply xrd 19 hours agorootparentprevHa, Taylor, of course this is you doing cool things in cool outfits. I should have known. Thanks! My favorite truth in that site: \"Anyway, instead of learning biochem and spanish I went and built this stupid website.\" I don't know what you are talking about at all. reply LorenzoGood 18 hours agoparentprevI am taking the SAT soon, and I am going to try out your flashcards. Thanks! reply arminluschin 21 hours agoprevI only ever used hono as a simple convenience router for my cloudflare functions. This feels ambitious. I’m a bit skeptical if this is the right direction frankly, I hope it doesn’t make the framework too bloated. reply evnix 20 hours agoparentHave to agree on this one. As a current user of Hono, I'll just switch to a proper router. I don't want those SSR oddities and react like \"hooks\" sneak into our backend codebase. They have been a constant source of confusion, bugs and performance issues in our frontend app. Let me save you from typing the obligatory HN response: YoU DoNt HaVe tO UsE ThOsE reply kkielhofner 19 hours agoparentprevSame. IMO Hono + Workers seems to be somewhat of a hidden gem but this largely comes down to Workers, of course. The performance (and especially pricing) is pretty wild and combined with various bindings (R2, KV, D1, AI, etc) general Cloudflare stuff, free egress, etc it can provide significant advantages. That said looking at this I’m confused, to put it mildly, and I may start looking elsewhere. Back to itty-router? reply eddd-ddde 21 hours agoparentprevNot too long ago I discovered itty-router and since then it's the only thing I need for my APIs. It's extremely minimalist, I just create a context object and implement in it any functionality I need such as headers, error handling, anything. I even use it for \"CLIs\" that I then call with curlie. reply cosbgn 21 hours agoparentprevSame, I'll probably move to https://github.com/unjs/h3 since it's used anyway in Nuxt (which I use for other projects) reply lf-non 20 hours agoparentprevYeah, I like Hono, but it was surprising to see a react alternative from them. I am not sure why they are trying to compete with preact/atomico. reply drewbitt 15 hours agoparentprevDoesn't seem right to me either. Of note though, it has not bloated the core and you can continue using the backend portions the same as before. reply joshstrange 20 hours agoprevHono looks very cool but in my experience you can quickly run out space in your lambda (package size) when you bundle your whole application together verses having each endpoint be it’s own package. Am I wrong or have others experienced this as well? Just having 1 package (to deploy vs 1 per endpoint) would be super nice in a number of ways and you could take advantage of things like provisioned concurrency (something much more difficult to plan for when you have a lambda per endpoint). Maybe I’ll just branch my main project and see what happens as I move my code into a monolith with Hono but I’d love some feedback if others have experienced this and/or how they worked around it. I guess you could still have multiple Hono-based packages that handle segments of your backend (verses all in one), is this how people are managing it? reply bleeding 16 hours agoparentI think with Lambda there are a lot of downsides to either approach. When you build the Lambda as a monolith, you also give all the code executing from that monolith access to all the resources needed by every single route in the Lambda. When I was working with Lambda a lot, we had a lot of secrets that were only needed by a few routes, and which would have been very bad if someone misused those secrets from a different place. But if you have a sufficiently large enough API surface, doing one lambda per endpoint comes with a lot of pain as well. Packaging and deploying all of those artifacts can be very time consuming, especially if you have a naive approach that does a full rebuild/redeploy every time the pipeline runs. I think there's a happy medium where you group lambdas by resource type or domain, but even still it can be tricky to enforce \"least privileged access\" for those when the content of the lambdas is constantly being added to. Eventually there is creep in the IAM permissions available to those lambdas. I came up with a system that did incremental build/deploys for all of our lambdas based on the code changes since the last builds/deploys, but even so that came with some pain and definitely some hacks that I wouldn't do again (and relied on technologies it was difficult to get other people to engage with, like Bazel.) I also think Lambda (in particular of the FaaS options) is...not great for APIs, especially if you use a language with a long cold start time. reply joshstrange 16 hours agorootparent> But if you have a sufficiently large enough API surface, doing one lambda per endpoint comes with a lot of pain as well. Packaging and deploying all of those artifacts can be very time consuming, especially if you have a naive approach that does a full rebuild/redeploy every time the pipeline runs. Yeah, thankfully SST [0] does the heavy lifting for me. I've tried most of the solutions out there and SST was where I was the happiest. Right now I do 1 functions per endpoint. I structure my code like url paths mostly, 1 stack per final folder, so that the \"users\" folder maps to \"/users/*\" and inside I have get/getAll/create/update/delete files that map to GET X/id, GET X, POST X, POST X/id, DELETE/id. It works out well, it's easy to reason about, and deploys (a sizable a backend) in about 10min on GitHub Actions (which I'm going to swap out probably for something faster). I agree with the secrets/permissions aspect and I like that it's stupid-simple for me to attach secrets/permissions at a low level if I want. I use NodeJS and startup isn't horrible and once it's up the requests as very quick. For my needs, an the nature of the software I'm writing, lambda makes a ton of sense (mostly never used, but when it's used it's used heavily and needs to scale up high). [0] https://sst.dev reply bleeding 16 hours agorootparentNice, we evaluated their Seed product but didn't pull the trigger, which caused me to eventually roll our own. I'm pretty proud of what we ended up with but due to reasons we ended up with _hundreds_ of lambdas, for which a full re-build re-deploy took around 45m (Go lambdas). We used Go and the Serverless framework (ugh), and if I had to do it all over I would probably just use AWS SDK since it would make doing the \"diff\" to redeploy dead simple, since everything is just a binary to build. Your use case definitely makes sense for Lambda APIs though! I think my complaint is more directed at APIs that back frontends. We had a JVM lambda API there for a while that was horrificly slow startup unless you set provisioned concurrency, which gets expensive fast. reply joshstrange 16 hours agorootparentYeah, I totally understand and agree with your \"downsides\" for lambdas. My use case just happens to gel perfectly with them but it's not a \"one-size-fits-all\". I also looked at SEED and I would like to give them money but some of their methodology with SEED didn't fit with mine and since my deploys aren't horrible I left my system as-is. Also I understand they need to make money but I wish more tools geared towards serverless \"scaled to zero\". I'm happy to pay but my company has such bursty traffic that paying for a plan (on SEED or something like monitoring) that can handle our \"peak\" means burning money 70%-90% of the time while our app is scaled to zero but we still have to pay for tools around it. Some monitoring tools, like New Relic, are based on usage but both NR and DataDog have absolute shit serverless monitoring solutions and their docs are a dumpster fire (at least around serverless). It's also unfortunate that most serverless monitoring means adding ~$10 per account per month (in increased AWS costs) just for their data pipelines to scan CloudWatch logs. This again sucks since we have an AWS account per client but each client is only active for ~1mo every year so it can get expensive fast. reply toinbis 19 hours agoparentprevAm very curious about the same very question. \"I guess you could still have multiple Hono-based packages that handle segments of your backend\" -> I am thinking the same - if you hit bundle size problems, you can just split your app. I'd also love to see some benchmarks how bigger bundle size impacts the performance - i.e. 1 MB adds additional 1ms on average, or so... My platform of interest is mostly Cloudflare Workers. reply willsmith72 20 hours agoparentprevhow much space is too much? curious how much you've had hono apps use i've done a few express apps on lambda, just because it was a free way to host fun projects and i didnt want to use a custom framework/tech, and they never got above 25MB zipped. big, but not really close to the limit (i believe 50MB) reply joshstrange 19 hours agorootparentI’ve never used Hono, I’m just interested in it. I think the AWS Lambda limits are something like 50Mb compressed and maybe 200Mb uncompressed. I might be a little off, I’m on my phone right now. Prisma doesn’t help matters but right now I take that hit on every function package anyway. I might just need to try it one day (move my existing app to Hono to see if it would work). reply _heimdall 21 hours agoprevI've used deno + hono and a basic file-based router for a few projects now. The biggest win IMO is avoiding a build step, I hope HonoX and the hono project in general don't start walking down the same path as others, using Vite for a required build and bundle step. Astro already solves many of the problems HonoX will run into, if a build step with Vite is acceptable for you. What I personally really want is an easy way to deploy exactly what I have locally and keep my dependencies small enough that shipping it unbundled isn't a problem for your project. reply iainmerrick 20 hours agoparentHow does the \"basic file-based router\" work, out of interest? reply _heimdall 20 hours agorootparentIt was a pretty lazy one-off router, nothing too fancy. I use deno's file API to scan a `routes` directory and modified a copy of Astro's router to parse filenames and prioritize route matching patterns. API-wise its very similar to most other file-based routers, including HonoX. Each file exports `GET`, `POST`, etc functions to handle requests. reply reactordev 17 hours agoprevThis is awesome! The server-side, the page gen, the router, jsx on the backside, outstanding work! In webdev, I’ve been a huge fan of vite since it came out. Not having to wrangle configurations and bundlers and everything was very welcome. I wrapped it all up into a useful internal tool to play nice with our packages and splice together express+vite frontend. Then koa+vite. After playing with bun, I’m very keen on stack setups with convention over configuration (with config options) to just do the typescript thing, do esm, do it well. I’m going to give this a go this weekend and see if this can replace our setup.

    "originBody": "Image February 8, 2024 • Press Release WASHINGTON, D.C. — Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled the findings of their bipartisan investigation into five U.S. venture capital firms. The lawmakers found that these firms invested at least $3 billion in, and provided expertise and other benefits to, People's Republic of China (PRC) critical technology companies, including many aiding the Chinese military, surveillance state, or the CCP's genocide in Xinjiang. The five firms used as case studies in the investigation are GGV Capital, GSR Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, Sequoia Capital China, and Walden International. Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi uncovered that these firms funneled over $1.9 billion to AI companies that support China’s human rights abuses or military, and at least another $1.2 billion into the PRC’s semiconductor sector– including semiconductor companies that advance the CCP’s military, genocidal, and techno-totalitarian ambitions. The report also highlights other investments that may raise significant security or human rights concerns. In the report, the lawmakers write, “The Committee’s findings suggest that there are billions of dollars beyond those captured in this report that have flowed into PRC companies that support the PRC’s military, digital authoritarianism, and efforts to develop technological supremacy and undermine American technological leadership. The status quo is untenable. . . . Decades of investment—including funding, knowledge transfer, and other intangible benefits—from U.S. VCs have helped build and strengthen the PRC’s priority sectors.” Image In certain cases, the lawmakers even uncovered internal VC memorandums stating that Chinese investments were more attractive if the company supported the Chinese government's surveillance state or its strategy for technological supremacy, designed to weaken the United States. The lawmakers also lay out how, beyond dollars, these investments provide credibility and know-how to problematic PRC companies. After uncovering the billions of dollars and intangible benefits VC firms have provided these companies tied to the CCP’s military and human rights abuses, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi recommend the United States immediately: Restrict U.S. investment in entities sanctioned or red-flagged by the U.S. Government for ties to the PLA, or forced labor and genocide. Implement additional sectoral outbound investment restrictions in areas related to the PRC’s critical and emerging technologies, military capabilities, and human rights abuses, building upon those recently established through executive action for PRC AI, semiconductor, and quantum computing companies.

Background: In July 2023, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi launched investigations into GGV Capital, GSR Venters, Qualcomm Ventures and Walden international after publicly available investment data indicated the firms were among the leading U.S. VCs in the PRC’s AI sector.

The investor class argued that shutting down factories in the American Midwest (where almost none of the investors live, of course) and moving production to China would bring political liberalization to the nation. That's why the US didn't slam the door shut on China after Tienanmen Square with Bush 41, and why Bush 43 was supportive of China joining the WTO. Of course, they didn't liberalize, and now China's using its massive industrial base that Americans funded to increase its capabilities for a showdown with the US (and other Western nations) for global economic and political supremacy. Really, it was all BS from the start; investors just didn't want to pay working-class Americans anymore and couldn't have cared less about the political implications of the market forces they were unleashing. It's arguably treason. reply alephnerd 15 hours agoparent> why Bush 43 was supportive of China joining the WTO. First, It was Clinton, Bush 1, and Bush 2. Secondly, this was because of how (then much richer) Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, Turkiye, and Eastern Europe democratized in the 1980s-90s. With those priors, it made sense to assume that economic integration and growth leads to calls for democracy. The jury's still out on this btw - China's median income in the 2020s is still 33-50% that of Thailand's, Mexico's, Poland's, Serbia's, and Turkiye's in the 2020s and these countries are still in the process of democratizing. > didn't slam the door shut on China after Tienanmen Square PRC was sanctioned by the US and the west in the 1990s in the aftermath of the massacre. This was why ascension happened so late. People forget that before the 2000s, most foreign investors to China were mostly from South East Asia and Taiwan. Western countries didn't enter until the mid-2000s. reply lenerdenator 15 hours agorootparentCorrelation is not causation. There's been this idea that a shift towards market economics _caused_ the collapse of the authoritarian regimes in the countries you mentioned. It is simply _correlated_ with it. If there were causation, China would be an economic backwater to this day, and my iPhone would have been made in Romania. The fact is, a large plurality of those holding capital today is not in favor of a market economy. Markets are hard. You have to compete. You have to keep customers happy. You have to constantly find the next big thing. You stand to lose a lot because everything I just mentioned includes a lot of risk by nature. These holders of capital are in fact far more in line with feudalism. Feudalism merged holders of monetary and political power into one entity: all of the economic value and capital were held by lords, who also had the ability to use the force of the state to marshal means of production to make more economic value for them at the exclusion of those who wanted to compete with the lords, or peasants/serfs who wanted more of the value they produced. This is why many modern capital holders _love_ the People's Republic of China: they get to do what they want with the non-human means of production, and the CCP will use its authoritarian regime to make sure that the human means of production doesn't cause too much trouble. When Obama asked Steve Jobs why Apple didn't make the iPhone in the US, Jobs basically stated (and I'm paraphrasing here) that American producers wouldn't do whatever it took to make him happy. If he had a change he wanted on a piece of hardware, he could tell his suppliers to make it so immediately. There would be no dealing with labor unions, no dealing with environmental regulations, no dealing with health and safety. The CCP won't do that because these capital holders cut them in on the revenue at the expense of the society the CCP rules over. reply alephnerd 14 hours agorootparent> Correlation is not causation. 100% in agreement with you. Though by every single measure, China in 2023 hasn't reached the economic inflection point that Taiwan, South Korea, etc hit in the late 1980s-90s. The key commonality between those countries that became democracies and those that didn't was inequality and economic stagnation. Those that worked on rapidly decreasing inequality saw broad support for maintaining a Liberal instead of Illiberal Democracy (Eg. Taiwan, South Korean, Poland recently, etc) whereas those who saw economic stagnation after proto-democratization fell to Illiberal Democracy or Authoritarianism (Eg. Hungary, Russia, Turkiye, Thailand, etc). This is because of the \"devil you know\" fallacy that becomes justified if democracy or proto-democracy hasn't return any results. China is in a weird position where it's able to compete with Advanced Economies in certain fields, but by most standards is still a developing country. You can have Beijing have first world level standards, but Tibet have living standards comparable to the poorer states of India. > modern capital holders _love_ the People's Republic of China: they get to do what they want with the non-human means of production Then why move manufacturing to less authoritarian Mexico, India, Thailand, etc or equally authoritarian Vietnam?!?

Also, Thai B1/2 refusal rates are significantly lower than Chinese B1/2 rates (B1/2 is largely judged based on economic capacity) and Thailand doesn't even have an exit pass requirement. Also, Thai citizens can travel to SK and JP visa free but Chinese can't, which further proves the point. > prices seem lower in Bangkok than even a tier 3 city in China Because of housing. After the Housing Market crash happened in 1997 due to overbuilding, Thailand has a severe deflationary period similar to what China is facing today. Most Western FMCGs in ASEAN are also manufactured in Thailand and don't have a luxury tax (0% in Thailand versus 30-40% in China), which has helped keep prices low.

Especially considering US/PRC flights still have restored to full capacity. SK/JP VISA free travel seems like a strange indicator to back up assertion, also more factor of geopolitics. I'm guessing average middle class PRC traveller is a larger spender than average thai traveller, especially to SK/JP. Unless the assertion that without VISA there'd be more low income travellers from PRC, but that's something airline supply/demand will filter out.

Well, firstly, Chinese urbanization rates seem to be miscounted upwards, as Tsinghua noted [1] for 2019 and earlier data. The Chinese numbers are closer to 50-55%. Secondly, rural and urban incomes are starkly different in Thailand versus China, as both countries government released statistics have shown, and even Thailand's National and Local HDI statistics have proven.

You're a well read guy, but I find some of your use of data in this thread to be a little confusing. E: Tsinghua study is about reclassifying based on household registeration, rural registered working in urban does not have access to urban level of social support, so less people should be considered urban even though they contribute to urban agglomeration effects. Which is what we think about when we measure urbanization. But it's not about whether rural PRC has less QoL than rural thai. Which sure, household income and HDI measures as proxy. But then tack on all the redistribution mechanisms, i.e. social transfers in kind where state subsidizes take home income and see it in practice and I find it difficult to believe (from what I see travelling both places, granted anedotal) average Thai has better QoL on when PRC per is 80% larger and per capita accounts for redistributed resources that supplements disposable income. reply alephnerd 13 hours agorootparent2018 data doesn't explain the spike in 2022 data. > Maybe geopolitics changed between US/PRC since 2018? With worse geopolitics, you'd have fewer Chinese illegally overstaying their Visitor Visa (which by definition is illegal immigration). This is why there was a drop in H1/F1 category applications from China. There is no reason to overstay a visitor visa except undocumented work, especially since they are granted with 1-2 year blocks. If you had legal work status, you'd be granted a H1B/H2B. If you came for education, you'd be granted an F1. If you have a degree and a great lawyer, you'd be granted an O1. If you have millions of USD, you'd be granted an EB5 If you came for marriage, you would be granted a K1 reply maxglute 12 hours agorootparentYou have more PRC illegally entering US from south due to US reducing issuing VISAs to PRC by large amount in last few years, IIRC CNN said over 80%, from 1m+ to low 100,000. Combined with reduced flights, the incentive for those who want to enter/overstay in US increase. Conversely 2022 data doesn't explain why data before US-PRC relations collapsed were overstaying less than Thais.

But if you are on this forum, you probably live or lived in a T1 city working a high income white collar job in the booming Chinese tech industry. Most Chinese aren't. And this is where the difference comes in. Beijing and Tianjin are great QoL wise when you earn a high income, yet neighboring Hebei has been fairly impoverished for a long time. Not as bad as previously ofc. Yet much worse than Pathan Thani or Ayutthaya (the Thai equivalent of Hebei). Hell, if you travel to Isaan, the Thai version of Guizhou or Gansu, the difference between the two is stark. I have traveled thru Hebei, Beijing, etc in the late 2010s as I have traveled Isan, BKK, and Ayutthaya as well in Thailand. > HDI sure, rural PRC education probably shittier, health care access questionable, but household stuff and general development in urban/rural as proxy for income, PRC seems much better than Thailand So, ignoring the stats that calculate life for the average person, not the top 20-30%. reply maxglute 11 hours agorootparent>Which is a mark of desperation. There's a lot more PRC people so you would get more desperate people. Desperate people want to goto US. Desperate Thais without VISA drama just go and overstay, and they've historically overstayed more than PRC when US didn't crack down on PRC VISA. That's the control. Post VISA drama, the amount of PRC who are trying to sneak into US vs net drop in PRC who travel to US is drop in bucket, 30k wants to go, but 1M+ simply choose to forgo. Under previous control circumstances, PRC who wants to goto US and illegally overstay just... fly to US or Can and overstay, same method as Thais, but at less % than Thai. Hence it's geopolitics of VISA changes driving increased VISA changes. Because the people paying the snake heads also seem to be T2 / middle income tier, i.e. they have to be resourced to make the trip in the first place, and they have the opportunity to go because PRC influence in LATAM (triad) have setup good asylum schemes because US state sucker for PRC repression story.

Which leads to: > stats Stats for development, not stats for broad QoL, which HDI can be proxy indicator but doesn't capture full Qol reality, i.e. I replied with edit above, there's all sorts of additional social transfer / subsidies from central gov to PRC backwaters that supplement income and make QoL for your undereducated peasant/nongming better than disposable income would suggest. They have less HDI QoL but better actual QoL, which is what matters because padding their resumes with education that they're too old to make productive use of is dumb use or resources than just subsidize their income with modern infra, consumption and services.

On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy—making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength—but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason.” https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/articles/art... reply engineer_22 14 hours agorootparentWell here we are...

By saying you think aiding the enemies of the United States alone is sufficient you are disagreeing with the Supreme Court. If simply aiding the enemies of the United States is sufficient for a treason conviction then would everyone who goes on strike at a factory that makes something important to the US military (steel lets say) be committing treason? The Supreme Court and myself say its only treason if the strike was done out of adherence to a foreign power and not if done for other reasons (like better working conditions).

If you look at the history of the DJIA, it wasn't really until the 1980s that it began to consistently take off (https://www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historic...). That money previously went to a wider variety of outlets into American society, like taxes paid to the government or wages paid to workers. When Milton Friedman argued that companies exist solely to return value to shareholders, shareholders fought successfully to see the value diverted away from those outlets and towards them. If your consumers are workers who no longer see rising wages, and you want them to buy your stuff, you have to find cheaper ways to sell things, so the argument was made that the PRC would politically liberalize if the world made its products there. The alternative was to not have all of the money go back to shareholders, and that was, of course, unacceptable. reply satvikpendem 15 hours agorootparentWhy are you only looking at the DJIA?

You basically can't operate in China without somehow letting the CCP in on your affairs. A great example is the automotive industry: American car companies had to work with Chinese-based counterparts in joint ventures to have any operations in China prior to 2017. Microsoft had to let Chinese officials look over the Windows source code to get it approved for sale in PRC. Hollywood routinely modifies movie productions to appeal to Chinese censors and audiences, even at points in the production where the changes would impact the release outside of China (see the remake of Red Dawn).

Read Later Allison Li for Quanta Magazine By Steve Nadis Contributing Writer February 8, 2024 View PDF/Print Mode algorithmscomputer sciencecomputersdataAll topics Introduction About 70 years ago, an engineer at IBM named Hans Peter Luhn quietly changed the course of computer science. Luhn already held several patents, including one for a device that could measure a cloth’s thread count and another for a guide that determined what mixed drinks you could make from the ingredients in your kitchen. But in a 1953 internal IBM paper, he proposed a new technique for storing and retrieving information that is now built into just about all computational systems: the hash table. Hash tables are a major class of data structures. They offer an especially convenient method for accessing and altering information in massive databases. But this technology comes with an unavoidable trade-off. In a 1957 paper published in the IBM Journal of Research and Development, W. Wesley Peterson identified the main technical challenge that hash tables pose: They need to be fast, meaning that they can quickly retrieve the necessary information. But they also need to be compact, using as little memory as possible. These twin objectives are fundamentally at odds. Accessing and modifying a database can be done more quickly when the hash table has more memory; and operations become slower in hash tables that use less space. Ever since Peterson laid out this challenge, researchers have tried to find the best balance between time and space. Computer scientists have now mathematically proved that they have found the optimal trade-off. The solution came from a pair of recent papers that complemented each other. “These papers resolve the long-standing open question about the best possible space-time trade-offs, yielding deeply surprising results that I expect will have a significant impact for many years to come,” said Michael Mitzenmacher, a computer scientist at Harvard University who was not involved in either study. “I would definitely say it is a big deal,” added Rasmus Pagh, a computer scientist at the University of Copenhagen. “A lot of people have worked on this problem, trying to see how much you can squeeze space, while also having time-efficient operations. This is the one I would have loved to solve.” Making a Hash of It Hash tables are among the oldest, simplest, fastest and most widely used data structures today. They’re designed to perform three basic operations: insertions, which add new items to the database; queries, which access an item or check to see whether it exists; and deletions. A hash table can be ephemeral — existing only as long as a particular program runs — or it can be a permanent part of your computer’s operating system. A web browser such as Chrome or Safari may have multiple built-in hash tables intended to keep track of different kinds of data. Entries in a hash table are stored as pairs, with the item — the information itself — connected to a key that identifies the information. Plug a key into a hash table’s query algorithm, and it takes you directly to the item. This may not sound so extraordinary, but for enormous databases it can be a great time-saver.

Courtesy of IBM Corporation Introduction To take an extremely simplified example, consider the Oxford English Dictionary, which has definitions for more than 600,000 words. If a digital edition relies on a hash table, you can simply use a given word as a key and proceed straight to the definition. Without a hash table, the dictionary would likely rely on a much slower search mechanism, using a process of elimination to eventually converge on the requested definition. And while a hash table can find any word in a constant amount of time (usually a tiny fraction of a second), the search time for other methods can go up as the number of words in the dictionary increases. A hash table also offers another advantage: It can keep the dictionary dynamic, making it easy to insert new words and delete outdated ones. Researchers have spent decades building hash tables that attempt to maximize speed and minimize memory. In the 20th century, solutions tended to offer significant gains in just one aspect, time or space. Then in 2003, researchers showed that it was theoretically possible to make a major efficiency leap in both time and space simultaneously. It would take another two decades, however, for researchers to figure out the ideal balance between the two. The Data Shuffle The first major step toward that goal came in 2022 at a major computer science conference in Rome. There, a team proposed a hash table with new features that could deliver the best combination of time and space efficiency yet conceived. The first author of the paper (listed alphabetically) was Michael Bender of Stony Brook University, so it is commonly referred to as the Bender et al. hash table. While the team didn’t try to build a functioning hash table, they proved that it could, in principle, be constructed with the features they described. To evaluate the hash table they came up with, the group produced a trade-off curve — a graph that plots the time per operation (insertion or deletion) on one axis and the space taken up by memory on the other. But this graph defines space in a special way: Because of how they’re built, hash tables need more memory than just the bare minimum required to store a given set of items. Computer scientists call this extra space “wasted bits,” even though they’re not really wasted and are, to some extent, necessary. The space axis on a trade-off curve measures the number of wasted bits per key. By analyzing a trade-off curve, researchers can figure out the fastest time possible for a hash table that uses a given amount of space. They can also flip the question around to figure out the smallest possible space for a given operation time. Usually, a small change in one variable will lead to a small change in the other, said William Kuszmaul, a theoretical computer scientist at Harvard and a co-author of the 2022 paper. “If you double the time, perhaps you’ll halve the number of wasted bits per key.” But that’s not the case with the hash table they designed. “If you increase the time by a little bit, the wasted bits per key decrease exponentially,” Kuszmaul said. The trade-off curve was so steep, it was literally off the charts. William Kuszmaul helped design a hash table in 2022 that seemed incredibly efficient in both memory and speed. Rose Silver Introduction The team built their hash table in two parts. They had a primary data structure, in which the items are stored without any wasted bits at all, and a secondary data structure, which helps a query request find the item it’s looking for. While the group did not invent the notion of a secondary data structure, they did make a crucial discovery that made their hyperefficient hash table possible: The structure’s overall memory efficiency depends on how the primary structure arranges its stored items. The basic idea is that every item in the primary structure has preferred storage locations — a best location, a second-best one, a third best and so on. If an item is in its best spot, the number 1 is affixed to it, and that number is stored in the secondary data structure. In response to a query, the secondary structure provides just the number 1, which spells out the item’s exact location in the primary structure. If the item is in its 100th-best spot, the secondary data structure attaches the number 100. And because the system uses binary, it represents the number 100 as 1100100. It takes more memory, of course, to store the number 1100100 than 1 — the number assigned to an item when it’s in the best spot. Differences like that become significant if you’re storing, say, a million items. So the team realized that if you continually shift items in the primary data structure into their more preferred locations, you could significantly reduce the memory consumed by the secondary structure without having to increase query times. “Before this work, no one had realized you could further compress the data structure by moving information around,” Pagh said. “That was the big insight of the Bender paper.” The authors showed that their invention established a new upper bound for the most efficient hash tables, meaning that it was the best data structure yet devised in terms of both time and space efficiency. But the possibility remained that someone else might do even better. Bound to Succeed The next year, a team led by Huacheng Yu, a computer scientist at Princeton University, tried to improve the Bender team’s hash table. “We worked really hard and couldn’t do it,” said Renfei Zhou, a student at Tsinghua University in Beijing and a member of Yu’s team. “That’s when we suspected that their upper bound was [also] a lower bound” — the best that can possibly be achieved. “When the upper bound equals the lower bound, the game is over, and you have your answer.” No matter how clever you are, no hash table can do any better. Yu’s team employed a novel strategy to find out if that hunch was correct by calculating a lower bound from first principles. First, they reasoned that to perform an insertion or a deletion, a hash table — or, really, any data structure — must access the computer’s memory some number of times. If they could figure out the minimum number of times needed for a space-efficient hash table, they could multiply that by the time required per access (a constant), giving them a lower bound on the runtime. But if they didn’t know anything about the hash table (except that it was space-efficient), how could the researchers figure out the minimum number of times required to access the memory? They derived it purely from theory, using a seemingly unrelated field called the theory of communication complexity, which studies how many bits are required to convey information between two parties. Eventually, the team succeeded: They figured out how many times a data structure must access its memory per operation. Renfei Zhou was part of a team that proved the 2022 hash table was as efficient as any data structure could possibly be. Wei Yu Introduction This was their key achievement. They were then able to establish a lower bound on the runtime for any space-efficient hash table. And they saw that it matched the Bender hash table exactly. “We thought [at first] it could be improved,” Zhou said. “It turned out we were wrong.” That, in turn, meant that Peterson’s problem had finally been solved. Besides answering the decades-old question, Kuszmaul said, the amazing thing about the Yu proof is its generality. “Their lower bound applies to all possible data structures, including ones that have not been invented yet.” That means no method of data storage can ever beat the Bender hash table in terms of memory and speed. Hashing Into the Future Despite the new hash table’s unprecedented efficiency, no one is likely to try building it anytime soon. It’s just too complicated to construct. “An algorithm that is fast in theory is not necessarily fast in practice,” Zhou said. It’s not unusual for such gaps between theory and practice to persist for a long while, Kuszmaul said, because theorists tend to ignore constant factors. The time it takes to perform an operation is typically multiplied by a number, some constant whose exact value may be immaterial from a theoretical standpoint. “But in practice, constants really matter,” he said. “In the real world, a factor of 10 is a game ender.” Actual hash tables are still improving in material ways, even if they’re falling far short of the theoretical ideal. For example, a new hash table called IcebergHT, built by Bender, Kuszmaul and others, is far better than its predecessors. According to Kuszmaul, it’s twice as fast as the most space-efficient hash table available today, and it uses three times less space than the fastest hash table. Related: Researchers Approach New Speed Limit for Seminal Problem How Big Data Carried Graph Theory Into New Dimensions Matrix Multiplication Inches Closer to Mythic Goal Mitzenmacher hopes that the 2023 result may soon yield another kind of benefit: “Whenever you get a new lower bound — especially one that involves some new techniques — there is always hope that you could use them … for related problems.” There’s also the intellectual satisfaction that comes from knowing you have solved a difficult and long-standing problem, said the computer scientist Piotr Indyk of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “Once you’re sure that certain data structures cannot be improved upon, that can help focus the research effort.” Finally, data researchers can turn their attention away from Peterson’s challenge and focus on new problems in theoretical computer science, of which there is no shortage.

This result is really cool, and finds the asymptotic sweet spot for hash table memory usage. Often times, the first algorithm to establish an asymptotic limit is entirely too complicated and doesn't help at human scale. If the world collectively ignores such results, as many here seem inclined to do, that's the end of the story. But when somebody continues bashing their head into this wall, sometimes a really good algorithm falls out, which hits that asymptotic performance benefit at a human-useful scale. The thing I'm curious about (as I haven't had time to cozy up with the paper, and I'm about to run) is how they hit that runtime. What's the big idea?

You can see that in the Iceberg paper which describes how earlier constructions optimized for PMEM Hw did a bad job because they were built against simulated hardware. In practice you need to actually iterate with real designs. I doubt such designs will find practical uses (iceberg maybe but the pure math designs seem unlikely). reply opticfluorine 12 hours agorootparentprevIn 200 years this is going to be like when we discover yet another proof of Euler or Gauss, 20 years after a current mathematician arrived at the same result. reply TeMPOraL 11 hours agorootparentOr it could be like multipoint touch screens, early version of which were a solved problem in 1980s or earlier, and just needed compute power to catch up, which it did over subsequent decades.

I'm hoping because Quanta's explanation was approachable, but ultimately, wrong when I try applying it the following way: Theorists will spend an enormous amount of time developing algorithms that are O(kNlog(N)) that are impractical in practice because - K approximates infinity - It is well-known K approximates infinity. - It is not expected for K to decrease. reply hinkley 5 hours agorootparent> “But in practice, constants really matter,” he said. “In the real world, a factor of 10 is a game ender.” Working at a place who kept losing customers to a competitor whose software was less than 2x as fast as ours fundamentally changed how I view optimization and how I view constant overhead C. And crystalized once I saw how delivering steady gains milestone after milestone can buy a lot more goodwill than one fast and dirty optimization.

For everything else it matters. reply yalok 5 hours agoprevHash tables are nice & all, and it's very convenient to use them, BUT I really regret how they create propensity for junior developers to use them even in cases where they are not really needed and more memory-efficient (and perf too) data structure could be used. Anecdotally, in my recent year of interviewing new candidates, I keep asking this simple question: come up with the most efficient data structure to store highly sparse data (say vector), that will need to be access only sequentially. E.g., we have a 1M int32 values vector, and only 10K values are non-zero. 90% of the candidates suggest using the hash table (especially if they prefer to use Python for the interview). I then ask them to estimate (roughly) the size of the memory, required to store those 10K values. Some say they need 10KB (they struggle to convert int32 to the count of bytes as well ;( ). Some say 40KB (a bit better, but they forget about keys). Less than 20% arrive to 80KB. Very few suggest that it's something higher than 80KB... Most struggle to account for the pointers that inevitably should be there if values are not allocated in contiguous memory. Most forget about the hashmap itself. Fwiw, here's some primitive comparison of memory taken by Python's dict, list and numpy's array: 10000 values dict size: 500568 10000 values list size: 426516 10000 values array size: 80056 500KB/80KB - > 6x times overhead... reply iamflimflam1 2 hours agoparentThe trap with asking these kind of questions is that you have spent a long time thinking of your optimum solution and the arguments for and against it.

I didn't invent op's question, but an answer that it should be a list is obvious right after reading the question. The question is very similar to the most basic exercises from the very first lessons of any basic algorithmics course. If I was programming in python, I'd still probably use a hashmap because it's the quickest to implement. But once it shows to be a bottleneck in terms of speed or memory use, I'd switch to lists. reply yalok 5 hours agoparentprev(from https://python-fiddle.com/saved/lN9D7DOQl0bQ8sqnDA94?code=tr...) reply wenc 5 hours agorootparent> come up with the most efficient data structure to store highly sparse data (say vector), that will need to be access only sequentially. There's something even more efficient -- a sparse array. I worked in the sparse linear algebra space, and you can gain a lot from sparsity. Add this to your fiddle: from scipy.sparse import csc_array sp_array = csc_array(my_list, dtype=np.int32) print(SZ, \" values sparse array size: \", get_obj_size(sp_array)) And you'll get this result: 10000 values dict size: 501060 10000 values list size: 426620 10000 values array size: 80056 10000 values sparse array size: 80276 EDIT: looks like I was wrong -- I made a mistake in the code. The sparse structure is actually larger. Also in my earlier result of 280 bytes, the get_obj_size might be reading the metadata part of the data structure. 10k int32 objects (4 bytes) each will not compress to 280 bytes. But my point in general holds -- sparse structures are usually more efficient to work with than dense structures, especially when you have really large matrices. reply FabHK 4 hours agorootparentSorry, you have a sorted list of 10,000 Int32, so each of them needs around 32 bits, for a total of 40 KB.

Can anyone explain what does that even mean? Logarithm of combinations, as in \"log(U!/n!/(U-n)!)\"? reply jiggawatts 12 hours agoprevThis kind of thing is unfortunately not useful at any scale. Real computer systems have performance that varies due to memory locality and size. Locality because of things such as cache hierarchy and even the size of cache lines and memory pages. Size because of physical implementation: larger memories are physically bigger and hence further away. The speed of light makes access to larger memories inescapably slower. The best current hashtable implementations are all quite far from the purely theoretical computer science optimums, but are faster despite this because they take these factors into account. Back when CPUs were simple and had no virtual memory or caches, there was a good correspondence between theoretical CS algorithms and their real implementations. Now? Everything I see published in this space is basically pure maths with little or no practical utility. It’s still interesting, sure, but it’s a bit sad that the theorists have retreated into a virtual world to escape the messy details of our reality. reply dgacmu 6 hours agoparentThis is a bit pessimistic. Most STOC papers don't directly give an incredibly practical algorithm. But what they do give is insight, and that insight can often be used to improve the practical state of the art. And new bounds get you thinking; there's power in just knowing we can do better. It's like breaking the 4 minute mile -- a lot follows. From a personal perspective: I quite like some of the techniques they use in the STOC'22 paper, and I have some ideas about how to turn that into a practical improvement for some of my data structures, which _do_ take into account CPU and cache because I'm that kind of geek. (To save you some googling, I'm one of the co-creators of the cuckoo filter, and of the techniques that underlie many practical implementations of cuckoo hashing, particularly those with concurrent access, and some other stuff. A lot of what I do in practical data structures-meets-systems comes from seeing what's happening in theory and finding ways to apply it, even though in doing so I often give up on the optimality bounds, the insights that come from the theory folks are the basis of it.) Also, note that there are a few flavors of theory. A lot of US theory is quite on the math side of things, with a few exceptions (Mitz, quoted in the article, being one of them). But there's a very thriving applied algorithms community in the world, with a lot of energy in the area in both Europe and South America, and the stuff published in those venues -- again, often derived from or inspired by work such as this STOC paper -- is more immediately applicable. reply trentnelson 11 hours agoparentprevHey, if you're looking for a real-world pragmatic and performant implementation of a theoretically-cool algorithm, my https://github.com/tpn/perfecthash project might fit the bill. It's geared to generating perfect hash tables with the fastest possible lookup/index times (for 32-bit keys), for key sets in thelet’s say you have 10^18 items You won't. Not on a single node. > The technique is the valuable part as it adds to the mathematician tool kit of how to prove such results. Agreed. reply sylware 11 hours agoprevoptimal for which use cases? reply andrewp123 9 hours agoprev [–] In my opinion space limited solutions are not very interesting. Time complexity is always >= space complexity, so finding optimal time solutions is always more interesting. And we already knew the optimal time complexity. I appreciate a theoretical time vs space relation, but it doesn’t seem applicable to other areas. reply dkural 8 hours agoparentFor achieving speed, often you'd like to keep your hash table in RAM. Space limits result in speed trade-offs. This is very much a real-world concern when writing genome aligners. Hash-based mappers were at a disadvantage early on due to the memory constraints of most servers back around 2009-2012, thus the more efficient Burrows-Wheeler transform based algorithms became popular, partly due to significantly reduced RAM needs - one could now align genomes on a laptop! reply tdstein 5 hours agoparentprev [–] It’s a great thing that this report addresses both space and time! reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
