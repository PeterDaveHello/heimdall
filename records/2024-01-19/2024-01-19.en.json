    "originBody": "The Quiet Death of Ello’s Big Dreams Posted January 18, 2024January 18, 2024 by Andy Baio Ello launched on August 7, 2014 with big dreams and big promises, a new social network defined by what it wouldn’t do. They laid it all out in a manifesto, right on their homepage: Your social network is owned by advertisers. Every post you share, every friend you make and every link you follow is tracked, recorded and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product that’s bought and sold. We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership. We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce and manipulate — but a place to connect, create and celebrate life. You are not a product. From its launch, Ello defined itself as an alternative to ad-driven social networks like Twitter and Facebook. “You are not a product.” (The “I Disagree” button linked to Facebook’s privacy page.) I’d link to that manifesto on Ello’s site, but I can’t, because Ello is dead. In June 2023, the servers just started returning errors, making nine years of member contributions inaccessible, apparently forever — every post, artwork, song, portfolio, and the community built there was gone in an instant. How did this happen? What happened between the idealistic manifesto above and the sudden shutdown? It’s a story so old and familiar, I predicted it shortly after Ello launched. Ello’s Funding and Launch Ello, for those who don’t remember, described itself as a “simple, beautiful, and ad-free social network created by a small group of artists and designers.” It launched with a distinctly minimalist monochrome interface and an even more minimalist set of features. Like Diaspora and App.net before it, Ello partly defined itself by its opposition to the exploitive business models and content moderation practices of major social networks, so quickly found itself deluged by people fleeing Facebook and dubbed by media outlets as an “anti-Facebook” or “Facebook killer,” something the Ello team never intended it to be. It was an uncomfortable balancing act, but they leaned into the publicity, at least for a while. Ello’s invite-only beta In September 2014, one month after it opened its invite-only beta, I wrote a post about Ello on Ello. Digging through SEC filings, I discovered that the newly-launched indie social network had taken nearly half a million in seed funding from a venture capital firm, which seemed counter to its indie manifesto. Since nobody else mentioned the funding, including Ello themselves, I wrote about it. Here’s what I wrote: Building something like Ello costs money. They have a team of at least seven people, and have worked on it for months. That doesn’t come cheap. The About section makes it seem like Ello was built independently, a group of artists making something for themselves, presumably funded by volunteer effort and maybe a seed investment from Ello president and CEO Paul Budnitz, who also founded Kidrobot and Budnitz Bicycles. But a little digging shows a much more predictable source: they took a $435,000 round of seed funding in January from FreshTracks Capital, a Vermont-based VC firm that announced the deal in March. Why is this a problem? The Ello founders are positioning it as an alternative to other social networks — they won’t sell your data or show you ads. “You are not the product.” If they were independently-funded and run as some sort of co-op, bootstrapped until profitable, maybe that’s plausible. Hard, but possible. But VCs don’t give money out of goodwill, and taking VC funding — even seed funding — creates outside pressures that shape the inevitable direction of a company. Before they opened their doors, Ello became hooked on an unsustainable funding model — taking cash from VCs — and will almost certainly take a much larger Series A round once that $435,000 dries up. (Which, at their current burn rate, should be in a couple months.) And they’ll have no trouble getting it. There’s a lot of money out there right now, and it will be extremely tempting to take it, especially if refusing it would mean closure or layoffs. The problem, of course, is that VCs aren’t like Kickstarter backers, or even like angel investors. Kickstarter or Patreon backers just want the thing being made. Angel investors may have other reasons to invest beyond equity: fame, insider access, or maybe just the joy of helping something exist. VCs may invest in things they think are interesting or want to exist, but they primarily invest money in startups to get a return on their investment, on behalf of their limited partners. That return usually takes the form of an exit: an acquisition or an IPO. Unless they have a very unique relationship with their investors, Ello will inevitably be pushed towards profitability and an exit, even if it compromises their current values. Sometimes, this push comes subtly in the form of advice and questions in emails, phone calls, and chats over coffee. Sometimes, as more direct pressure from the board. (FreshTracks’ Managing Director sits on their board.) Or, if things go bad, by replacing the founders. The Ello team knows that how a startup is funded shapes how it behaves. They spend a good chunk of their About pages talking about how they’re not going to make money (not ads or selling your data), and a little bit about how they hope to (paid premium features). I hope they’re right — it’d be great to have more startups that aren’t reliant on ads. But they completely fail to disclose how Ello is being funded now, which matters just as much, if not more, as any future revenue plans. I love seeing people build new stuff. More people trying to build crazy experimental communities on the Internet is a very good thing. And nothing’s more audacious than trying to build a new social network. Social networks become the glue that connect people together — the foundation for friendships, relationships, and new works of creative expression. Building a social network is like opening the doors to a huge party and inviting everyone in. Without a way to get your stuff out, shutting down a social network is like locking the door and burning the place down. At the moment, Ello is a free, closed-source social network, with no export tools or an API, fueled by venture capital and a loose plan for paid premium features. I think it’s fair to be skeptical. Like everyone else here, I hope Ello can stick to their principles, resist outside pressure, fight market forces, and find a unique and sustainable niche. Let’s hope their investors feel the same way. The Founders Respond That post quickly blew up on Ello, and then went far beyond it, with coverage in articles from The Verge, The Guardian, VICE, The Atlantic, and Business Insider, among others. Ello’s CEO, co-founders, and investors dismissed the concerns I raised, starting with co-founder and CEO Paul Budnitz, who told Betabeat it was “silly.” “In fact, Ello is controlled executively by its 7 founders, who own a majority share in the company,” wrote Betabeat’s Jack Smith IV. “They say that the cynical claim that they’ll sell out eventually, or that anyone can tell them what to do, is ridiculous.” Co-founder Todd Berger laughed at a GigaOm writer who asked him about my post. “There’s seven founders and we own 82 to 84 percent of the company, so we can do whatever the hell we want,” Berger said. “We’re not going to sell out our soul to grow our company,” continued Berger. “Maybe it’s hard to believe.” I followed up with a second Ello post: I’ve received a dozen emails in the last day and a half from journalists looking for quotes about Ello. I didn’t reply to any of them. I have no interest in being the anti-Ello poster boy, for one main reason: I think Ello’s pretty neat, and I want them to succeed. Like I said in my post, more experimentation with online communities is a very good thing. We’ll only break away from the dominant players by trying new crazy shit, and I think it should be applauded. (And, yes, I even like the design.) But I think taking VC was a bad idea that works against their ethos, and will inevitably lead to a much larger Series A by year’s end. I think the intentions of the team are pure, and they genuinely believe in what they’re building. But I’m not sure intentions matter unless they can wean themselves off outside funding. I really, really hope their revenue plan works out, and quickly. Series A and the PBC One month later, Ello announced they’d raised significantly more money: a $5.5 million Series A round co-led by TechStars and Foundry Group, who took a board seat, with participation from FreshTracks Capital, who already sat on the board. Coinciding with this funding, and perhaps anticipating the backlash, Ello also announced they had converted the company to a Public Benefit Corporation. In a public letter signed by their founders and investors, they wrote: There has been some speculation in the press since our launch that Ello will someday be forced to allow paid ads on our social network. With virtually everybody else relying on ads to make money, some members of the tech elite are finding it hard to imagine there is a better way. But 2014 is not 2004, and the world has changed. Effectively, Ello would be a for-profit corporation required to pursue social good as part of its charter, instead of solely maximizing shareholder value. Unlike a B Corp certification, this would enshrine their values in their legal structure, which is a pretty big deal. They were the most notable technology company to form as a PBC until that point, preceding Kickstarter’s conversion by nearly a year. A dedicated page on their site explained the significance of the PBC, and the charter they were now bound by: To assure that Ello always remains ad-free, Ello converted to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). A Benefit Corporation is a new kind of for-profit company in the USA that exists to produce a benefit for society as a whole — not just to make money for its investors. The Ello PBC charter states in the strongest legal terms possible that: Ello shall never make money from selling ads; Ello shall never make money from selling user data; and In the event that Ello is ever sold, the new owners will have to comply by these terms. Ello exists for the benefit of the creative community, and we will never serve ads or sell personal data. The signatures from the PDF of their PBC letter This was a commendable change, though somewhere along the way, all the public debate about raising professional money and profit maximization became solely about switching to a paid advertising model and selling user data. This was a straw man argument that was easier to knock down. But there are many, many ways for a social network to become worse for their users than running ads. My concern wasn’t that Ello would start running paid ads. I don’t even mind ads, as long as they’re done thoughtfully and with privacy in mind. (I ran ads from The Deck here for years.) I was worried that, by taking outside funding, Ello’s values were no longer fully-aligned with the community: they were aligned with their investors. In time, given more money and more pressure, they would be inclined to do something the community, or even the original founders, didn’t want to do. Series B and CEO Changes In April 2015, six months after their Series A, Ello took another $5 million in a Series B round from their previous investors, giving a board seat to TechStars, and bringing their total raised to $11M. Later that year, in December, Budnitz wrote a new post on Ello looking back on their first year and looking ahead to 2016: This past week I gave a few interviews to online news organizations. One of the journalists scoffed when I told him that Ello is built on principles we believe in, and that in 2015 we did everything we could to grow slowly. Rather than sell out and make another giant network the world doesn’t need, we decided to take our time to build the beautiful and inspiring place we have today. I felt sad for the guy. It’s awful going through life never believing in anything. So in the spirit of the New Year, and because it was clear that this journalist wasn’t going to believe anything I told him anyway, I figured I’d publish a short list of things Ello will never do: Diverge from our mission to empower and support creators to inspire one another, and move the world forward. Tolerate hate. Ello has many tools, some visible and others not, that help keep this network positive. Sell ads or user data to third parties. Sell out. Suck. Three months later, in March 2016, Paul Budnitz stepped down as CEO, citing the distance between his home in Vermont and the rest of the team in Boulder. He was replaced by Todd Berger, one of Ello’s co-founders and lead designers. Under Berger, Ello refocused its efforts on artists and creators. From a May 2016 press release: In recent months Ello has doubled down on its mission to support creators everywhere, becoming the premiere community for the world’s leading edge and contemporary artists, photographers, designers, illustrators, architects and GIF makers to share their work and ideas, connect with others, and build organic reach. In a September 2016 interview with Wired, he said that was what Ello was always meant to be: Berger had originally intended Ello to cater to artists, but the founding team was split on the idea. “To Paul [Budnitz] it sounded limiting. To our investors it sounded very limiting,” says Berger. As its new CEO, Berger continued fundraising, but the SEC filing from March 2017 indicates a struggle, raising only $2.5M of the available $4M. In an interview with TechCrunch in November 2017, Berger said he was looking to raise more cash. “We have a lot of investment opportunities coming in from actually some fairly heavy-hitting firms that I hope to close.” Ello in 2017 In the same interview, Berger said Ello now had 400,000 monthly active users, with 625,000 artists on the site. It seemed like Ello finally found its niche as “The Creators Network,” a community of artists and designers using its visual-heavy design to show off their portfolios and promote their work. Their original freemium model never worked out, but sponsored content was handled thoughtfully, with like-minded brands offering giveaways. It was paid advertising, but it didn’t violate privacy or sell user data. “A lot of people thought we died and went away and the whole time we’ve been cultivating a really niche and creative community that’s gotten more focused as I’ve been able to enact my vision,” Berger said. The future of Ello seemed bright. The Acquisition Five months later, in March 2018, Ello was quietly sold to Talenthouse, a Los Angeles-based company whose primary business was running design contests for brands, in which independent artists competed against each other for a cash prize. I only know the sale date because it was mentioned in the annual report of a venture capital firm who invested in their Series A. The acquisition was never announced publicly, as far as I can tell, mentioned only in this October 2018 interview with Talenthouse co-founder Maya Bogle, where she said that “earlier this year we acquired Ello.co.” As an Ello user, I was never notified about the ownership change, even though they sold all my data to an entirely new company. As far as I can find, none of the original founders mentioned the sale publicly when it happened. There were telltale signs, though: Ello’s social media started regularly promoting design contests from “our friends at Talenthouse,” while never disclosing the sale. The Ello homepage prominently featured Talenthouse “artist invites” to compete in their design contests from brands like Absolut Vodka, Amazon Prime, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Adidas, and Miller Lite. This isn’t an ad, it’s an opportunity! And they’re just friends, really. The Founders Leave The following month, in September 2018, the remaining two of Ello’s original remaining co-founders announced they had left the company. In a cryptic post on Ello and Instagram, Ello’s then-CEO Todd Berger and fellow co-founder Lucian Föhr wrote: Over the course of the past years we did our best to steer Ello per our vision, always with the intent of putting artists first. At times we succeeded, often we failed. Which brings us to today. We’re no longer at Ello, we can’t elaborate as to why, but it’s time for us to move on and return to studio life.… If we let you down along the way, we’re sorry. If we didn’t, all the better. On a July 2019 podcast, Berger and Föhr spoke candidly about their time at Ello, when Berger took over CEO duties and Föhr became the Chief Product Officer. Todd Berger: The beginning of it was super exciting, super pure, 100% authentic. We built a lot of digital products, worked with lots of startups. We felt like we knew how to do this. We got a lot of momentum. People were stoked. And then investors got interested and there was pressure to do all these other things. The CEO at the time [Paul Budnitz] got maybe a little overzealous about making lots and lots of money and turning it into a crazier thing than we ever imagined. And it kind of got out of control real fast. And then we were just kind of holding on, trying to steer it as best possible back to its original kind of the real place we wanted it to live in. And it was tricky, that fast-paced real startup ecosystem— once there’s VC money in there and there’s a lot of press and there’s a lot of attention and you’re not necessarily meeting expectations per the media, per your investors, etc etc. As for the acquisition, it doesn’t sound like it was a big payday for the original founders. (As preferred shareholders, VCs are typically paid from an acquisition before founders, employees, or other common stockholders.) Interviewer: Do you feel that the sale of the company justified the time and effort and blood and sweat? Berger: No, no. Frankly, it wasn’t a lucrative exit. It was more of a, let’s carry this thing on, someone wants it. And it wasn’t about that for us. Like, had it been something different, who knows what we’d be doing now? But the experience, by and large, was justified. It just, by the nature of taking money in and building a company and a lot of pressure and responsibility, it went on longer and turned into a bumpier grindier thing I think than we wish it would have. On August 22, 2018, then-CTO Colin Gray deleted the Manifesto, the foundational statement that was part of Ello since before it launched, along with all references to the Public Benefit Corporation and its charter. Ello PBC was officially dead. The End In December 2019, Ello, Talenthouse, and Zooppa merged into TLNT Holdings, a new holding company backed by UK private equity firm AEDC Capital. TLNT was then sold to Swiss investment firm New Value AG, which renamed itself, confusingly, to Talenthouse AG. In December 2021, Ello changed their logo to finally acknowledge what everyone on the site had figured out long ago. “Our new logo represents our parent company, Talenthouse, who y’all are already familiar with as we cross promote creative briefs on the Talenthouse platform all the time,” they wrote on the official blog. “You’re creative, you understand the way businesses develop.” Behind the scenes, Talenthouse was struggling financially. A February 2023 report in The Observer exposed that Talenthouse was withholding funds from artists who won their creative briefs. A month later, The Guardian reported their parent company was “close to failure as debts mount,” with most of their subsidiaries closed and staff laid off. Talenthouse, whose clients have included Netflix, Coca-Cola, Nike and the UN, is facing legal action by creditors in the UK and is understood to have laid off most of its workforce, with top executives also departing its parent company in recent days. Its parent company, Talenthouse AG, has also announced the closure of four other subsidiaries saying they cannot afford to pay outstanding bills, including staff wages. In May 2023, the company released a statement that it was facing a “critical financial situation,” restructuring the company while finding outside investors. As a result of the upheaval, Ello’s website started seeing significant downtime starting in June 2023, delivering 500 errors on every page for days at a time. It came back online for a few days in July, and then more errors. On July 18, 2023, it shut down for good and never recovered. On August 9, the web app was apparently deleted, leaving nothing but a Heroku error. The Ello homepage in July, August, and September 2023 The Talenthouse corporate site is still online, but the platform is offline, and they haven’t posted anything on social media since January 2023. Ello’s social media team stopped posting in October 2022. After leaving Ello in 2016, Budnitz returned to his Kidrobot roots with the launch of Superplastic in 2017, a vinyl figure company that expanded into NFTs and the metaverse in 2022, raising a total of $68M in seven rounds of funding, led by Amazon. Superplastic appears to have abandoned its NFT projects last year as the market cratered, and Budnitz stepped down from his CEO role in September, replaced by the former president of blockchain gaming company Dapper Labs. They are now focused on “synthetic celebrities” and AI influencers. Todd Berger and Lucian Föhr reopened their Boulder design studio, which had shuttered for five years while they worked on Ello. Berger described running Ello as the “low point of my creative career,” so I hope they’re doing better. As for Ello’s users, they’re out of luck. The shutdown spawned a confused exodus of sorts, former community members trying to figure out what happened on the Ello subreddit, on X/Twitter, and the comment section of the only other blog post about it. “years of my writing down the drain” “Heartbreaking. I upload my artwork in there and I love the site because it really focused on art.” “It’s really messed up that there was NO warning to allow us to download our content. That was a very personal space for me and now it’s gone forever? It was my online diary ffs!” “I had two groups. One had over 18k followers and the other 17k+. No warning at all. Just gone, along with 8 years of content updated a couple of times a week.” “Did you find a way? It has basically my entire diary :(“ “18k followers and a few years worth of educational posts on fiction writing craft essentials gone.” Some people tried to contact Ello or Talenthouse directly, but the emails bounced. Some former members set up a Tumblr group to try to find each other again, “an attempt to maybe preserve and/or recapture what little magic Ello still had for us.” You Were The Product From the moment it launched, I liked Ello and wanted it to succeed. Experimentation in social networks is critically important, and there’s enormous value in making new online communities for creative people. I even loved Ello’s minimalist monochrome design, which some people bounced off of. But from the moment I read about their seed funding, I worried that they wouldn’t be able to build a long-term sustainable business if they were hooked on professional funding and busy chasing growth. The day after I wrote my first Ello post that blew up, Rose Eveleth published an article in The Atlantic with the blunt headline, “Ello Says You’re Not a Product, But You Are.” The fact that you, the user, even exist and use their site makes you a product. Ello already has some amount of seed funding from VCs, which means it will need to return to them with something in hand if it wants more. And when it does, or when it is eventually bought by a larger company, you are part of that transaction—a key line in the sales pitch. Your existence on that site is a unit of currency, and it’s a unit that Ello is selling to whoever will give them money for it. Ello’s founders wrote in their manifesto that, with other social networks, “You are the product that’s bought and sold.” They believed, I’m sure sincerely, that Ello would be different. “We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership. You are not a product.” Despite their idealist manifesto and their Bill of Rights, I don’t believe they could ever truly be in partnership with their community once they were taking large amounts of venture funding. All of their ideals and big dreams were easily undone, even the legal restrictions they defined in their Public Benefit Corporation charter: Ello made money from selling ads to third parties; Ello made money selling their user data to a third party; Ello was sold, and the new owners didn’t comply with those terms. In the end, Ello was sold to a third party without notifying its users or giving them the opportunity to opt out of handing over all their content and data, then resold to a new company, and finally shut down and deleted with no notice or recourse. Would things have been different if they hadn’t taken funding? It’s impossible to say. In all likelihood, it never would have been built in the first place. But if it had, I doubt it would have ended like this. 🍞 Ello’s homepage on July 3, 2023, shortly before it closed for good. “Built by artists, for artists.”",

We’re at the end of a grand experiment of “you can take VC money and deliver a tech with new values, one that people want.” The only people still claiming you can just haven’t run out of their last funding round… yet. We have 20 years of evidence on what tech businesses can be built on the Internet that make money. It’s narrow and mostly can’t solve the problems that remain. The escape hatch is always subscription revenue. It’s true you can build a unique business on unique values for a unique community. But it’s a long slog in the MicroSaaS world where anyone can & many will straight up copy you - forever. X.com is probably the only & last experiment on whether switching to subscription rev is achievable at scale. Looks pretty clear so far that it’s not. This might seem a negative outlook, but it could be quite positive if founders know & accept it. The secret is out now that, mostly, founders make the same amount of money in the same amount of time whether they go the VC or bootstrapped route (when it’s a winning business). There will always be opportunities for finance-backed cartel-busting mega runs. But if you are a founder that cares about anything - anything - the route that gets you there is founder control, patience, and a customer base that pays. reply eterevsky 31 minutes agoparentI think Substack is a pretty clear example of subscription model working well. There's also Patreon that is doing very well. I wouldn't discount YouTube Premium and Twitter subscriptions. They don't cover the majority of users, but are a viable option if you (like me) can't tolerate ads. reply FormerBandmate 9 hours agoparentprevYouTube and Hulu did it very successfully.

Once subscription revenue is enough, scare and shame won't work and politics won't have anything to do with the future of the business. reply moomin 42 minutes agorootparentI’m not sure you understand what advertising cares about. They care about reach and brand value, both of which have dropped for Twitter. “Politics” is a component of brand value, but it’s got nothing to do with reach, which is falling through the floor. But equally “politics” doesn’t explain the drip in brand value, either. The FIFA World Cup has _dreadful_ politics, advertisers don’t care because it’s still a great brand with a huge reach. Musk is rich and connected enough to be able to ignore commercial reality for a basically unlimited amount of time, but I seem to recall you were arguing elsewhere on this thread that company owners should only care about the money a company makes. reply dopeboy 10 hours agoparentprev> We’re at the end of a grand experiment of “you can take VC money and deliver a tech with new values, one that people want.” This is an extreme position.

They can't force you to do anything. Sure they can pressure you, but if you have ownership and they have a minority stake, you can do what you want. Ello could have stopped at any time. Why did they raise 5 million only 6 months after their first round and another 5 million 6 months after that? What were they spending their money on? I don't see how this would have worked if they hadn't taken money > X.com is probably the only & last experiment on whether switching to subscription rev is achievable at scale. Looks pretty clear so far that it’s not. I don't know. X showed that you can fire ~80% of your employees and the product could still exist. Not only exist but push product at a faster pace. In the last year you got editable comments, subscriptions, revenue sharing, blue checkmark for sale, alternative check marks for govts and org, culling of old accounts, API restrictions, forcing people to put parody identify themselves, longer videos, just to name a few off the top of my head. I noticed more large changes in the last year than the last 5. You don't need a lot of people to run a SaaS company and you can cut a lot of bullshit. And all tech companies are coming around to that conclusion. Maybe if Ello had raised only a few million and kept around a dozen employees or so, it could have succeeded. reply bruce511 6 hours agorootparent>> Why can't you take VC money and run the business the way you want? Because taking VC money let's you defer the revenue question. And by deferring it, you then have to bait-and-switch the users. Let me be clear. It's OK to get startup money. Businesses need capital to get going. But revenue should be the original business plan. In other words, who is paying for this site, and how? Ello ruled out advertising and data sale - that's fine, but that leaves subscriptions, donations, premium features, whatever. For a \"regular\" business, each wants to become sustainable, its important to become profitable ASAP. The team is focused on revenue, keeping costs down and so on. Once it can pay expenses and salaries it can run forever. The obvious revenue here is subscriptions. Income rises with expenses. But of course if you charge you'll grow slowly. So you start free, which means customers will rebel later. (Anyone see parallels to Open Source companies here?) VC money allows you to kick this can down the road. Small angel investment? Sure, no problem. You still have majority control. But if you are using that money to pay salaries, then it'll quickly run out. If you don't have enough revenue, you could just close up, but you dont, you go get a series A. Then B. Then C and so on. The implication is you are selling equity. One day that investor equity exceeds 25%. A round or two later it's over 50%. You've lost control. (And I'm assuming all the founders are in agreement all the time - in reality one wants to cash out, and joins the investors camp well before the 50% is reached.) So, you can grow slowly, and sustainably. Or you can take money, grow fast, and \"hope\". But make no mistake, when you sell -equity- you are selling control. You are selling your right to dictate \"principles\". That is -what- you are selling-. Since you are selling to people who are in it for the financial return, the end result is like night following day; inescapable.

Anyway, the code test part of the interview involved pairing with another engineer on a small portion of the ello User model (their application was built with Ruby on Rails at the time), and I remember being rather underwhelmed by what they asked me to do, at least in terms of whether it provided a decent test of my abilities. I ended up sending a follow-up email expressing that, along with numerous polished samples of other project work. They ended up passing on me, but I stayed a member of ello for a while longer because I thought the idea might have promise. Maybe I left too early, but I eventually ditched it because... there was no \"there\", there. I liked their general idea, but... they could have done so much more with it, even with a small team.

There are bootstraped, sustainable organisations operating in this area similar to what you're asking for, e.g. Dreamwidth.

None of these are directly related to the fact they built the site with investor money and not volunteer hours. reply urbandw311er 11 hours agoparentI think it’s fair critique for the post to focus on the VC (not angel) investment — the expectations of VCs and pressure to deliver a profit could easily have been a significant factor in the decision made by the CEO to focus on substantial revenue growth. reply reso 6 hours agorootparentBut did they ever even cover their costs? If a business is stable for its current size, and then VCs push you to grow and that kills the company, then yes, that company was killed by VC pressures.

Seven people working on ello means it's hard to understand, even on ramen salaries, how that costs less than $1m a year once you fully burden those salaries, buy office space, buy hosting, etc. So they've set themselves up from the beginning to spend more money than they make, and everything downstream flowed from that choice. If they had to be cash-flow breakeven from the get, they would have to have charged users. ie built a completely different product, with a different audience. reply d0gsg0w00f 11 hours agoprevHas anyone ever considered that social networking is just a bad business model?

I felt like we couldn't quite catch up, and by the time the money started running out and interest started to wane, it was too late. A few learnings: - 7 founders is a lot. I don't want that to sound like a criticism, it just means the company is going to feel a bit different vs a more classic 2 or 3 founder setup. - Positive feedback loops within a tight team of highly skilled people has a huge impact on getting more stuff done.

They are providing a foundation that gets built upon with every migration wave, and I think it’s plausible that they will eventually break into the mainstream. Put another way, the fediverse is the first alternative that doesn’t need to “succeed” in order for development to continue. It’s a bootstrapped model.

Decentralised and P2P systems run themselves, but it's hard for them to maintain a centre of gravity without offering something specific, and given that the network itself can't produce value out of thin air, it's probably not coincidental that the ones best able to maintain gravity are offering stuff stolen from elsewhere. reply woah 12 hours agorootparentDecentralized systems still need ongoing development and maintenance. reply dredmorbius 12 hours agoparentprevThere are numerous cases in which paying customers are also the product, most notably any captive-market advertising situation: transit, air travel, hospitality, cable and streaming services, telecoms (wired or wireless), and more. The truth is that a profit-maximising business will seek revenue opportunities where it can, and if that means selling both services, on a single-instance or subscription basis, and advertising, it will do both. Advertising-only or advertising-dominated businesses have a strong tendency to degrade faster and far more prolifically than those with mixed-model funding (I still find The Economist's three-legged revenues stool fascinating: subscriptions, advertising, and Economist Intelligence Unit bespoke consulting and research services, each roughly 1/3 of total revenues).

Be a marketplace, and charge commission. reply jchw 13 hours agoprevI know that nobody is purporting to have the answer, and I am definitely not trying to suggest that there's anything wrong with the conclusions drawn here--quite the contrary, actually. But, if VC funding is clearly a bad way to go about things, then what is the best way to structure and fund an organization built around a network or service that is primarily in the game of serving user-generated content and providing social networking and chatting services? VC funding has a lot of problems. Funding via advertising is similarly fraught with peril, maybe worse, especially the most lucrative stuff. You can fund things by selling premium content or features, but this too is rather tenuous: if you are say, SoundCloud, one of your primary customers is inevitably going to be artists, who themselves are by and large not rich. Not to mention, no matter who you focus your monetization on, $1 is infinitely more than $0, and monetizing useful features or access to content will inevitably lower the overall value of your platform. This is presumably part of why advertising is so enticing: end users don't have to \"pay\" anything. Sure, advertising isn't literally free, but users do not have to set up a payment method and take money from their account and send it to yours, which is a massive difference, and massively increases accessibility. Then there's stuff like crowdfunding. Platforms that let you do one-off funding campaigns like Kickstarter or Gofundme, or platforms that let you do monthly subscriptions in exchange for \"rewards\" like Patreon or FANBOX. There even is a platform that is partly funded by monthly subscription payments (Misskey.io) and although I'm sure it is a relatively small part of the funding (at least I would certainly assume so) it still seems to have been successful nonetheless. And that's just funding. What about structure? Becoming a non-profit or public benefit corporation is seemingly not any kind of sure-fire way to avoid trouble, as can be seen here. While I don't know exactly how the legalese works around a lot of these topics, it feels like these measures simply don't do enough to prevent corruption or at the very least, undesired future changes in direction. You want a company to have autonomy to carry out its vision and try to survive in the process, but you don't want it to compromise its core values in the process. Is there anything you can do legally and/or socially to provide better assurances? This is very frustrating because I think a lot of us see the sad state of the Internet and want to do something, but it's hard to work towards it because you can also see a graveyard of good intentions gone horribly awry. There's all kinds of attempts to work around it, but as a wise man once said, \"Mo Money Mo Problems\". It seems that the temptation to exploit things always manages to find a way around your safeguards to prevent things from being exploited. Just to beat a dead horse even more, remember the last time you were excited for a Google product announcement, like say, GMail? I'm not saying they were ever a charity or intending to be... but it's hard to not see the painful way in which values that were once hard-fought slowly fade away. Somehow, eventually, everything becomes rent-seeking, a game to see how much money you can get back from an investment. One would hope there is a way out that doesn't involve a very painful upheaval of society, but over time it's getting harder and harder to believe it. reply laurex 12 hours agoparentTrue. I’m working on a project to answer some of these questions and consider innovations that might have an alternative outcome. We hope to make it a collaborative project with wiki-like tendencies.

Meta's entire business is social apps, and Google's is not. There are strategic differences in approach as a result. 2. Google+ was an attempt to disrupt Facebook's rise at the height of Facebook's popularity. People _liked_ FB then - so trying to get them to switch to another product was harder. Threads shipped during a time of volatility with Xitter and is poised to capture more of that audience as Xitter continues to decay. In terms of how things will change in the space over time, Threads choice to support ActivityPub will probably mean good things for the Fediverse in general, at least in the short term (3E notwithstanding), and could ultimately serve to be the arbiter that kills BlueSky and the AT Protocol. reply Zigurd 10 hours agorootparentG+ also tried (was told to?) show relevance to other Google products by becoming a universal and mandated discussion thread mechanism.

If BlueSky ran out of money tomorrow and shut down its servers, BlueSky is gone. If mastodon.social ran out of money and shut down its servers, the Fediverse would continue. There would be pain if mastodon.social failed with zero notice. People would lose access to their accounts and would need to find a new server where they'd be starting over. Some may have backed up their contacts, but most wouldn't. If mastodon.social gave a couple months notice, people could migrate to other servers. given that mastodon.social is the largest server, there would be some growing pains as other servers worked to accommodate new users, but it's possible for the Fediverse to continue. Note, I'm not saying that the Fediverse will be incredibly popular. I'm simply noting that there's an amount of resilience. Once Ello's owners ran out of interest or money, that was the end of Ello. Even if others had a huge interest in seeing it continue, there was nothing they could do. Even if the Fediverse doesn't \"catch\" by your definition of catching on, it has caught on for enough people who have moved there and will remain there. That's why I feel happier in the Fediverse. It feels like something the community controls. Sure, I don't run my own server, but I possibly could in the future and there are enough people running servers that I don't feel beholden to any one entity. It just feels like something that can stick around - even if the cool kids aren't interested.

That included an on-site visit in October 2015, which was genuinely enjoyable. I'd largely written off the site around 2018 when it was sold and information on either the status of the social benefit corporation (SBC) or new ownership was exceedingly scarce. Andy Baio's account corresponds strongly with my own. The community was small (I'd estimated total accounts at perhaps 10--15 million, and actives at roughly 1% of that, generally confirmed during my visit), but vibrant in its own way, and as with numerous other social networks, I miss numerous connections I'd made there, though a small handful have resumed at the Fediverse. There really were some notable gems among the group I connected with, including Paul Mason (journalist, briefly), poet Trenton Lee Tiemeyer, authors Ksenia Anske and Bruce Sterling, SVG guru David Dailey, and others. Most disquieting was how Ello died with neither notice to its members or commentary elsewhere. TFA here is among the very few accounts I've seen of its demise. (I've written a few times about it at the Fediverse myself.) The other concern, going far beyond Ello, is how little protection or guarantee either its manifesto or SBC status ended up providing. Going forward, I'm going to give similar attestations vanishingly slight weight. Having participated in online communities since the late 1980s (Usenet, mailing lists, Slashdot, Google+, Diaspora*, Reddit, Ello, the quite short-lived Imzy, amongst others), I'm reminded of the song \"dumb ways to die\": there are many ways for a social network to die, most of them depressingly uncreative. The flip side is that it's also difficult for a social network to survive, let alone thrive, and survival. Commercial pressures from every thing I've seen worsen this, though even noncommercial / non-ad-supported sites may see failure modes. Of the best communities I've encountered: - Early Usenet, when access was strongly predicated on academic affiliation. - 1990s-era mailing lists, most especially those focused around Unix / Linux and Free Software topics. (Broader-appeal mailing lists ... tended to function poorly.) - Google+, in patches. The fact that the social network wasn't ad-dependent, and had strong representation from the tech community were strengths, and some of the best engaging online conversations I've had were from there. Diaspora*, though vastly smaller, saw a substantial portion of my G+ community engage there and had similar dynamics which also made for some good discussions, though not quite as often. - The Fediverse. Not quite as rewarding as G+, but I strongly suspect it will prove far more enduring. - Hacker News. As with G+, not directly intended as a revenue-generating platform. Not as good as it could be, but far better many other options, and astonishingly consistent over a very long lifetime (approaching 20 years), which would beat out Usenet by quite a margin.[2] I'd chalk up HN's durability to a few factors: unsexy tech and appearance, stellar moderation, solid design principles, and a viable founding cohort and active community. There are of course criticisms of the site and I've made a few myself, but relative to much the rest of the Net, still running strong. ________________________________ Notes: 1. The Internet Archive has some captures:2. Usenet's birth date was ~1979. By 1999 it was well past its sell-by date, though not completely dead. reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agoprevI thought this was a fantastic post. I think it really dovetailed with what I've been thinking a lot about recently regarding my disillusionment with tech (or, rather, with big tech companies). I think everyone should understand (and, honestly, repeat daily) that in our modern capitalist system where never-ending growth is an expected requirement of any company that has ever taken outside funding, it is simply an impossibility for a company to have any kind of durable values that conflict with that growth-at-all-costs requirement. It's as much of an impossibility as the sun rising in the west, and we should stop any pretense that it's not. Enshittification is inevitable. Nearly every tech company starts out similarly: an absolute laser focus on users and their needs, because that is how you first grow. At some point, though, all of that fruit is picked, and you then start going into features that are \"user neutral\" but that make money, until finally you chip away at features that look like they can be user neutral in the short term (\"We A/B tested and nobody minded one more ad!\"), but the long term effect is that you've completely destroyed your founding ethos. For example, it's easy to pick on Google these days because it's, well, so easy. Their total about face from a company that was nearly universally loved by engineers to one that, if not loathed, is at best seen as the \"next IBM\" is so obvious. E.g. Google got huge originally with a world-first search engine by not \"selling out\", by not masquerading ads as organic search results. Now when I search for any remotely commercial term the entire first page is ads that are nearly indistinguishable from organic results. It's not just Google, though. Apple loves to crow about user privacy, but it's hard to square this \"value\" with their insistence that anyone on iOS who uses iMessage to talk to anyone on Android gets 0 encryption (oh, and if even a single Android user is in a group chat, nobody gets encryption). I don't think that makes any company \"evil\", but it does make it somewhat sociopathic in the sense that there can ever only be a single goal: growth at all costs. The sooner we all recognize it means we can treat all companies with an appropriate level of caution. One final note related to this, is that this is one reason I'm not really a fan of PBCs as mentioned in the article. PBCs are a smoke-screen. As the saying goes, \"Follow the money\". When push-comes-to-shove you'll also see PBCs compromise their \"values\" the second growth starts to be at risk. reply ajhurliman 13 hours agoparentYes, this is a tech thing in particular. You don't see VC being raised for a plumbing company, they'll get an SBA loan or bootstrap. They don't need to grow 10x every year, if the owners can pay their bills and send their kids to college they're happy. And plumbing is such a constitutionally important thing: having hot, running water and not having feces in your house is so much important than seeing what that guy from high school is up to. I think the issue lays with how high-variance tech is due to the scale: either it is marginally profitable at a massive scale and is worth billions of dollars, or you have something that is unprofitable at any scale and is worthless. It's like there's all of the sudden (in the last 15 years) become an appetite for throwing fortunes onto a roulette table (which may be giving better odds than a lot of VCs). reply mandevil 12 hours agorootparentTwo things here. One is that the marginal cost of software(1) drives this pattern of winners and losers. The first user of any software costs an enormous amount of money to actually write the software and deliver it to customers. The 100th user costs basically nothing once you have 99 others. And the millionth user (or billionth) user costs basically nothing as well(2). That in turn means that having a billion users is a lot more profitable than having a million users, which means that if you have a billion users you can afford to do things that the million user system can't- e.g. free webmail and a really good free internet browser, just to name two things picked completely at random and not having any particular company in mind. The other point is explaining your comment about the \"last 15 years\": tech's dominance (really, growth's dominance) is really an artifact of zero-lower-bounds interest rates from the 2008 financial crisis. If interest rates are zero (for discounted future cash flow computations) then I am indifferent about a dollar today versus a dollar in 2075. So someone who can argue that they have a 5% chance of being worth a trillion dollars in 2075 is worth a lot (0.05 * 1T=50 billion) when interest rates are zero, but if interest rates are high (or even, honestly, normal- like 2-3%) then that money is discounted heavily and the growth story doesn't matter as much because dollars today are worth a lot more than dollars in 2075. So if interest rates are zero, future growth will dominate the stock market (which was why 'tech' did well) but when interest rates are more normal, different companies can dominate the stock market (where the fundamental valuation of a company is, roughly, the expected value of future cash-flows discounted to the present). 1: Delivered by the internet- physical media distorts this a bit and behaves more like normal retail goods. 2: Exceptions for certain points in the growth curve where some key system falls over and needs to be rapidly replaced, e.g. storage or compute or whatever, but outside of those it's very cheap growth. Plumber company growth is limited by the number of trained plumbers you can hire- you can only have 1 plumber make so many house calls in one day- but software just replicates at zero out to infinity (again modulo some key systems which can't handle the load). reply wly_cdgr 12 hours agoprevOh wow, I'd totally forgotten about Ello.

Grifting is just not for me. reply EdwardDiego 12 hours agorootparentI used to work in public service (in chronological order, ranger, social security, LLC incorporation and radio spectrum licensing and management) before jumping into software with glee. And I have the exact same thought about providing software for government and other large organisations. The number of \"solutions\" my public service employers paid millions for, that didn't fucking work properly or reliably is mental. I'm really not sure how contracts keep getting signed by big organisations that don't impose massive penalties on providers for failure, but it they do. Or the sister org that finally had enough and wanted to switch providers, and had to go to court in order to be even be able to pay a large amount for the IP rights to the source code of their system, because they'd signed a contract that let the provider retain IP, and the provider really liked that sweet sweet taxpayer money for buggy bollocks. So naturally, when they contracted HP to maintain the system they ensured that the contract retained IP ownership for their org. Haha, no, I'm kidding, they let HP keep IP rights on changes HP made, and later on had to fight HP in the courts so they could pay HP for the source to switch providers again after getting sick of being charged $2K (USD) by HP to update the text of a single link on a website. And I keep thinking that I'd very much like to be in the market of earning millions by providing broken software to people making big decisions who aren't competent enough to jump to private sector, broken software is easy. But then the guilt of stealing taxpayer money kicks in (it's not legally stealing, but morally, it's stealing. As the saying kinda goes, any great criminal needs a great lawyer, a great accountant, and a corporation), as well as the guilt of professional ethics. (What's the old joke about software ethics? An ethical programmer would never write a function called destroyBaghdad, they'd write a function called destroyCity and pass Baghdad as a parameter.) But look at Birmingham Council in the UK, bankrupted by shit software and Oracle's fearsome legal team. The entire fucking disgrace that is Horizon (although being fair to Fujitsu, nearly all of the evil was on their customer's side, it was only aided and abetted by Fujitsu employees lying in court). In my country, IBM sued our government (and won) because IBM wanted to be paid even more for not delivering a massively expensive and broken project to the Police (INCIS), more recently our Education dept spent $180 million on a payroll system called Novopay (they also paid the provider Talent2 to administer payroll with it) that was terribly broken and underpaid some teachers (and perhaps more egregiously, slightly overpaid some teachers, then the provider would eventually realise and demand the teacher repay the overpayment be returned in full in a short timeframe or debt collectors would be brought in, and threats of civil litigation or criminal complaints were used to pressure them) to the extent that teachers had to go on strike to get the government to take it seriously. Eventually the government took back the admin side of it, and then gave Talent2 another $45 million to get the system working, and are still paying them to maintain it today. The idea of being in a market where delivering badly broken software leads to you getting paid another 25% of the upfront cost to get it actually working, and you don't get fired, is wild. I suppose there's a reason that Oracle and similar are described as law firms that incidentally write software, but damn, they make crypto grifters look like complete amateurs. And I'll begrudgingly admit that Oracle et al are selling a product with actual utility at least, as opposed to NFTs which I'd call digital tulip bulbs, but that is mean to tulip bulbs because they can at least be used to grow flowers. I've seen 0 use cases for NFTs / ICOs that aren't gambling/unhinged speculation (usually with some fraud involved to make Number Go up to suck in the rubes), or just good old fashioned direct to the consumer fraud dressed up in complicated jargon. reply SpaceNoodled 14 hours agoparentprevGrifting is more lucrative than ever! reply hn_throwaway_99 14 hours agorootparentI thought this recent article was so insightful: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39014737 reply NetOpWibby 14 hours agoprevThis post is a long-ass “told you so” and honestly, I’m here for it.

In other words, being directly abusive toward others was obviously destructive and discouraged, but disagreement, even when quite strong, was great, as long as everyone involved maintained a level of basic respect when interacting with each other. There's also a big difference between vehement dislike of a distant thing, concept or person, especially if one can express their reasons well, and using slurs or advocating violence or harm. I imagine here they used 'hate' to stand in for 'hate speech', but not being in their minds - I really don't know. reply paulddraper 10 hours agorootparentAdvocating violence is straight up illegal (in the US).

They'd been run out of the other one and decided to try to take over ours. Those of us running the site had a _lot_ of long philosophical discussions about what to do, but we ultimately realized that posting disturbing content with intent only to provoke wasn't constructive, and we had the right to define what type of community we wanted to foster. So we booted the shock-jockeys out, and then went to an application-only process that lasted from 10,000 until about 100,000 users (that's a lot of hand-reviewed applications!) - and you know... I could still sleep at night after that, because it wasn't about stopping any specific cause or idea or viewpoint. (Indeed, a few came back, reapplied, and rejoined as constructive members of the community after that) IMHO, there's a place for provocation, but only if there's a point to it - a message to be communicated. Random photos of animal heads in a jar with no commentary or explanation? Not so much. I guess I thought of us as rather selective due to the application process, but as I think back, the application process actually allowed us to accept a much broader array of viewpoints, because our goal was always aimed at intentionality and constructive interaction. reply edm0nd 11 hours agoparentprevIt's universally known that that means things like racist imagery/text content, not content like \"I hate cake\" or Tswift. reply paulddraper 9 hours agorootparentIt's universally know that this means whatever the speaker wants it to mean, whenever the speaker wants to mean it. reply jeffbee 11 hours agoparentprevHow about \"I hate reductive hackernewses who fail to engage constructively with the discourse and instead turn to gotcha language that 9-year-olds think is terribly clever\"? reply zemvpferreira 11 hours agorootparentHe's right though. \"Not tolerating hate\" is a paperthin principle, that would stand up to as much scrutiny as everything else Ello stood for, in hindsight. re, it was all bullshit and the warning signs should be called out as such so we know next time someone tries to bullshit us. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentprevSure, great example! reply thimkerbell 12 hours agoprevHN is just doomy-doomy-doomy today.

The PaaS is being retired, so we are migrating all of our infrastructure into our own Amazon Web Services (AWS) account. This blog post explains how we migrated our PostgreSQL database with minimal downtime. Migrating our database The PaaS provides a database for us and we use it to store all of our data - from data about each notification we send to the content of the hundreds of thousands of templates service teams use to send those notifications. This is an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database and it lives in the PaaS’ AWS account. Our apps that run in the PaaS talk to this database. We are going to call this database our ‘source database’. We needed to set up a new database in our own AWS account, and get all of our apps to talk to the new database. We are going to call this new database our ‘target database’. Creating a new PostgreSQL database in our own AWS account is not too difficult. The hard part is transferring all of our data and getting our apps to use this new database, whilst incurring minimal downtime. A bit more about our source database Our source database is about 400GB in size. It has about 1.3 billion rows, 85 tables, 185 indexes and 120 foreign keys. It is PostgreSQL version 11. On a usual weekday, we do somewhere in the region of 1,000 inserts or updates per second (sometimes much lower, sometimes much higher), plus a similar number of reads. GOV.UK Notify sends millions of important and timely notifications each day, from flood alerts to updating users about their passport applications . Every notification we send requires talking to our database. Therefore it’s important that we minimise any downtime. AWS Database Migration Service The PaaS team offered us the ability to migrate databases using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). DMS is responsible for transferring data from our source database to our target database. It can be run in either the source or target AWS account. DMS works by: Copying across all of the data, table by table, up to a specific point in time. This is known as the ‘full load’ task. Entering replication mode, where it ensures that all new transactions on the source database are replayed onto the target database, so that the 2 databases are in sync. We would then be responsible for getting our apps to stop talking to the source database and start talking to the target database. Database migration process The database migration process was completed in several stages. Setting up the DMS instance In our case, the DMS instance was created in the source AWS account. We chose the source account because the PaaS team had already set up instances of DMS in their account and so were able to do this quickly and easily. The DMS instance also needed to be given PostgreSQL credentials to talk to both the source and target database. The DMS instance and the target database live in different virtual private clouds (VPCs). With the help of the PaaS team, we set up VPC peering so that traffic from the DMS instance in the PaaS’s VPC could be routed directly to our VPC without the traffic going over the public internet. Setting up our target database We created our target RDS instance in our own AWS account. PostgresSQL version 11 was about to become unsupported, so we took this opportunity to upgrade our PostgreSQL version by making our new database PostgreSQL 15. We then took a dump of the database schema for our source database using `pg_dump`. This gave us a file with the SQL commands to recreate our database schema. From our database schema, we took the declarations for our tables and applied these to our target database. We didn’t apply our foreign keys at this point because DMS’ full load process doesn’t try to copy across the data in an order that matches your foreign key constraints. We didn’t create our primary keys or indexes at this point because this would massively slow down our full load task. Each individual insert would take longer; it would need to update our indexes and this would add up to a significant amount of time when inserting billions of rows. It was much quicker to first copy all of our data across and then add the indexes afterwards. Full load Once we had a target database with the tables created, we then started the DMS full load task. This copies across all the data that existed when we pressed the ‘start full load’ button. It doesn’t copy across any new data or updates that come in after this point. It took about 6 hours for the full load task to finish. After the full load task completed, we applied the remainder of our source database schema file which adds our indexes and key constraints. Adding these took about 3 hours. Replication Once our full load task completed, the data in our target database matched the data from the source database at the point when we started the full load task. But many new inserts, updates and deletions had happened on our source database since then. And many more changes would keep coming in too. To copy these new changes across, we then started the DMS ongoing replication (also known as change data capture) task. This reads all the transactions from our source database transaction log that were created after the full load task began and sends them to our target database. This ensures that our target database is in sync with our source database with, at most, a small amount of lag. It only took a couple of hours for the replication process to catch up. At that point, we monitored the latency in the DMS replication process to make sure it could handle the number of changes happening to the source database and continued to stay in sync. We ran the DMS replication process for about 10 days in the background, keeping everything in sync whilst we awaited the time for our apps to stop talking to the source database and start talking to the target database. We had announced this time to our users in advance and so had a set time already for the migration of traffic. Preparing to migrate traffic Several months ago we planned how we would stop our apps talking to our source database and get them using our target database.This was the process we used: Stop all traffic from our apps to our source database. At this point we would enter a period of downtime where Notify was unavailable. Ensure our replication had caught up so that all updates to our source database had been reflected on our target database. Allow our apps to start talking to our target database. This would end our downtime. It was important not to have some of our apps talking to our source database and the rest talking to our target database at the same time. If this happened any changes on our target database would not be reflected on our source database which would mean users would get inconsistent data. We wrote a Python script for this process so it could be explicit, easily repeatable and much quicker than being done manually. The quicker it could be done, the less downtime for users of Notify. Our target was less than 5 minutes of downtime. We ended up using this script at least 40 times during our various tests and practices beforehand. We picked a Saturday evening for the migration. This is because it is one of our quietest times without us having to be awake in the middle of the night when we won’t be as alert. Stopping traffic to our source database Our script would stop all traffic to our source database by calling `pg_terminate_backend` on all the connections from our apps. This took less than a second. We also changed the password for the PostgreSQL user used by our apps, meaning that if the apps attempted to reconnect to our source database they would get an authentication error. Checking replication had caught up DMS inserts some useful tables into our target database on the status of the replication which are updated every minute. These tables allow us to see how much lag there is between our target database and the source database. Our migration script would check these tables to make sure our target database was entirely caught up. To be extra safe, after our apps had stopped talking to our source database, our migration script would write a single record to our source database and then wait to see that it safely arrived in our target database. This gave us extra certainty that all changes had been replicated. Making a smooth swap of traffic For our apps to connect to our database, they need to know the location of the database and also a username and password for a relevant PostgreSQL user. These are provided to our apps in an environment variable of the following format: SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://original-username:original-password@random-identifier.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 If we want our apps to connect to a different database, we need to update the username, password and location in the URI and redeploy our apps so this change takes effect. Redeploying our apps takes about 5 minutes. If we redeployed our apps as part of our migration script then this would mean an extra 5 minutes of downtime. To minimise downtime we made two changes in advance of our migration so that we could use a quick Domain Name System (DNS) change instead of redeploying our apps. The first change was to create a user on both our source and target database that had the same username and password. This means that we don’t need to change the username or password provided to the apps during the migration. The second change was to create a DNS record in AWS Route53 for `database.notifications.service.gov.uk` with a 1 second TTL (time to live). It had two records with weightings: 100% of DNS results were weighted to the source database location 0% of DNS results were weighted to the target database location We set our URI used by our apps to use our new username and password, and to use the new domain name for the location of our database. SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = postgresql://shared-username:shared-password@database.notifications.service.gov.uk:5432 Now, when we wanted to swap the database that our apps would be pointing at, our migration script just needed to update the DNS weighting in AWS to 100% of results being sent to the target database location and wait 1 second for the TTL to expire. Then, when our apps next try to query our database they will be querying our target database. What happened on the day When we gathered on the evening of Saturday 4 November, we had set up our target database, the full load process had run and new transactions were being copied across. We checked and only had a couple of seconds lag between our target database and the source database. We then successfully ran our migration script so that our apps would stop talking to our source database and start talking to our new target database. During the migration there was a short period of downtime, roughly 11 seconds. This was much less than our 5 minute target so we were very pleased and so were our users. What we learnt We chose to use DMS because it was well supported by the GOV.UK PaaS and we could also get support from AWS. If we were doing a PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL database migration in the future, we would invest more time in trying alternative tools such as pglogical. DMS potentially added more complexity, and an unfamiliar replication process than what we may have found with other tools. This backs up what AWS say themselves on PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL migrations. What’s next for GOV.UK Notify’s migration to AWS Now we’ve migrated our database, our next step is to migrate our apps. Sneak peek - we are moving them to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS). We will blog about how this goes in the coming months. If you’re interested in hearing about how a different team in government also migrated their database from the PaaS, then take a look at a recent blog post from the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities.

Surprised they aren't mentioned in the thread yet. Basically, you spin up a new Blue Green deployment with any desired changes (in our case, we were upgrading Postgres major from 13 to 15). While your blue configuration continues to serve traffic, AWS uses logical replication to keep the \"green\" deployment in-sync. You can keep modifying (or testing) the \"green\" deployment (eg you could load test it if you wanted to), as long as you don't do any writes to it (writes still have to go to your live, blue configuration, and are replicated to green). When you're ready, you run the \"switch\" command, and AWS does a few things for you: run checks to ensure blue/green are in sync, stops writes and connections, waits a few seconds to ensure replication is caught up, renames your database, then allows connections/writes again. We had less than 20 seconds of downtime, by our count. And, we had a primary and several read replicas and AWS successfully switched the full configuration over with no hiccups. You don't even need to switch your configuration because AWS swaps the database URLs for you. Green becomes blue, blue becomes old blue, and when you're ready, you delete \"old blue\". Highly recommend! They do have some restrictions (for instance, not sure if it would work if you're switching accounts, etc). 1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-... reply sgarland 9 hours agoparent+1 for B/G. That said, I imagine they couldn’t use it due to the cross-account shift. I’ve used it for both MySQL (with much higher QPS than TFA, by two orders of magnitude) and Postgres, and they both went flawlessly. Read the docs, especially the limitations. Re-read them. Do a test run in the dev environment, under load. Do it again in staging. Or just YOLO into prod ‘cause it’ll probably be fine, I guess. reply Ozzie_osman 9 hours agorootparentWe definitely did a dry run with a parity configuration a couple nights before. It gave us a lot more confidence. reply cljacoby 7 hours agoparentprevI also used RDS Blue/Green deployment to apply a MySQL major engine version upgrade from 5.7 to 8.0. With respect to downtime it worked fantastically, I think we measured 13 seconds of observable downtime from the API. However we did learn the hard way that RDS Blue/Green cannot be used to apply arbitrary changes. In our case, we discovered RDS Blue/Green can only be used to move up engine versions, not down. We discovered on MySQL 8.0 one of our stored procedures had very occasional failures, and considered the option of using RDS Blue/Green again to move back down to 5.7. Turns out that's not an option. reply 0xbadcafebee 3 hours agorootparentDatabase changes are typically one-way. If your new change includes creating or modifying a table, such that there are new additional columns, and you populate those with data, then downgrading would destroy the changed columns and the data in them. Hence you can't downgrade once you upgrade or you'd potentially be breaking things. To downgrade safely you'd need to backup or snapshot the old database, and then restore your database back to the backup/snapshot, but that's not blue/green. reply fulafel 2 hours agorootparentDB schema migration script frameworks (at least in Python, Ruby & Java lands) do typically support both upgrade and downgrade directions. People skip implementing and testing the downgrade side if the development model doesn't need it but the problem of what happens to the data is controlled by what you put in the \"down\" migration script. I'd guess if you can't throw the data away, you won't do a down migration, you'll do an up migration that changes the db to save that data in your preferred way before undoing or reworking the previous schema change. reply yellowsir 1 hour agorootparentbut now you have 2 up paths. and migrations are critical, i would avoid it where possible! reply Mavvie 6 hours agorootparentprevI wonder if that could be because MySQL 8's replication is backwards compatible but MySQL 5.7's isn't forwards compatible.

We had an unencrypted db deployed with CDK, and then tried to get it encrypted without losing data. reply bgschulman31 8 hours agorootparentprevWe recently did this on my team over Christmas this year. We opted not to use Blue/Green for this but instead spun up an encrypted snapshot and began replication from the old database to the new database using MySQL’s tools. Once traffic on our platform was sufficiently low, we cut connections to the database, waited for for replica lag to reach 0 and relaunch the servers with the new databases host info. Our downtime was around a minute. reply yeswecatan 5 hours agoparentprevHow did you go about stopping and restarting applications which reach out to the database? We have a number of tasks running in ECS which can take a minute to spin down and a few minutes to spin back up. reply todd3834 2 hours agorootparentYou aren’t supposed to have to change anything in the application code. The same database URL should work. reply ThePowerOfFuet 3 hours agorootparentprevPresumably you don't stop them, and they throw errors during the cutover. reply londons_explore 10 hours agoprevThere are various ways to 'pause' incoming postgres queries, for example using pgbouncer, - ie. don't fail them, simply delay them until the replication has caught up and then let them continue on the new database. If anything goes wrong and replication doesn't catch up, you can unpause and let those queries happen on the old database. Therefore, your 11 seconds of downtime becomes 0 to 11 seconds of added page load time. But more importantly, of the thousands of users of the database who have never seen a query fail before and might have buggy error handling codepaths or have a single failed query ruin a whole batch job, this approach leads to a lot less collateral damage. reply alerter 36 minutes agoprevInteresting, though I have no idea why the government is using AWS in the first place. This isn't a startup hacking away trying to find PMF, or dealing with unpredictable marketing-driven traffic spikes. We know we need these services running long term, and can make solid predictions about usage patterns. We could build a public sector cloud and/or adopt a sensible on-prem approach.

One thing about (at least UK government) is that procurement requirements means that they go to market for quotes around usage every few years.

Concurrently, we had to upgrade various extensions, most notably Timescale, for which a compatible version did not exist across all scenarios. We performed the upgrade by updating a replica in the following sequence: - Start: PG12, Ubuntu 18, TS2.9 - Step 1: Set up a read-only replica with PG12 on Ubuntu 22, maintaining TS2.9. - Step 1.5: Enter maintenance mode and halt all services. - Step 2: Detach the the read-only replica, upgrading from PG12 to PG15 on Ubuntu 22 with TS2.9. - Step 3: Upgrade from PG15 with TS2.9 to TS2.13 on Ubuntu 22. - Step 4: Upgrade from PG15 to PG16 on Ubuntu 22 with TS2.13. - Step 4.5 : Reconnect services to the new database server, resume all services, and exit maintenance mode. All the database upgrade steps were well-tested and automated using Ansible. Nonetheless, we did encounter an issue that had not arisen during testing. This extended our downtime to approximately half an hour, which, for our use case, was perfectly acceptable. Employing logical replication could have mitigated the last-minute surprise. So we will consider this approach for our next upgrade cycle. reply mbb70 11 hours agoprevInteresting to compare this to https://knock.app/blog/zero-downtime-postgres-upgrades discussed here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38616181 A lot of the discussion boiled down to 'this is a lot of complexity to avoid a few minutes of downtime'.

The absolute key takeaway is in \"what we learned\": > We chose to use DMS because it was well supported by the GOV.UK PaaS and we could also get support from AWS. If we were doing a PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL database migration in the future, we would invest more time in trying alternative tools such as pglogical.

Does it work similarly to AWS DMS? reply postpawl 10 hours agoparentprevThere are a lot of gotchas with using DMS (which seems to use pglogical under the hood). Since it’s not hardware-level replication, you can run into issues with large rows/columns/tables and it doesn’t really handle foreign keys. It may not handle some special data types at all. You also need to update the sequences after the migration or you’ll get errors about duplicate primary keys. You can also have issues if you don’t have proper primary keys, because it doesn’t always copy the entire row at once. If the databases are within the same AWS account, it’s likely easier to use hardware-level replication with global database or snapshots to do migrations if you’re ok with 4-5 mins of downtime. reply Twisell 3 hours agorootparentThere are many options available with PostgreSQL you could also do a physical full backup + WAL level replication to keep key AND a get low downtime. What might have oriented theirs choice is that they wanted to upgrade from major version 11 to 15 during the migration process. This is only available using logical replication. Otherwise you'd have to chain upgrade process of each major version (and possibly OS because 11 is EOL on some arch) and this is nor trivial nor quick. reply londons_explore 10 hours agoprevNote that the enemy of low/zero downtime migrations like this is long running queries. Ie. a single update query which takes 30 mins. You either have to kill and roll back that query, or suffer 30 mins of unavailability. As far as I know, there is no way to migrate a currently in progress query. reply necovek 6 hours agoparentFor a software engineering project, you probably want to limit your transactions to much less than that (set statement_timeout is your friend). If you've got extremely long transactions, you can probably avoid doing the switch-over when they run (hopefully they are not a random occurrence but a result of a scheduled job or similar). In combination with transaction time limit and fail-over configuration (where you fail the old primary), you can control the slowdown (instead of downtime, eg. with pgbouncer) very precisely. I would be more concerned with the DNS TTL being respected in the entire stack (and external caching DNS servers you rely on), tbh. But it is usually not critical to avoid a dozen seconds of downtime for an app, so whatever is simpler for you should be your go to solution. reply callalex 2 hours agoparentprevWell you’ve certainly introduced a teaching moment to me!

We just migrated from postgres 14 to 16 for 3 postgres clusters (servers) on RDS containing about 2TB of data across 8 databases. We were down from 00:00 to 04:00. Steps we took: * enabled our fallback \"maintenance mode\" site. It's a super lightweight version of our site running on CF workers. * scaled down all apps using the db to 0 in terraform * hit the upgrade button in the aws web ui, which runs pg_upgrade. 14->15 * waited for it to finish * hit the upgrade button again. 15->16 * waited for the dbs to start accepting connections (they do before they're marked as ready, I think aws does more stuff than pg_upgrade) * Started `VACUUM ANALYZE; REINDEX DATABASE CONCURRENTLY`. The idea is to avoid performance issues between versions and make use of performance improvements from new versions. * Started spinning up the apps again * Waited until all apps had a handful of containers running * Started accepting traffic (disabled maintenance site) * Went to bed The REINDEX CONCURRENTLY happily chugged along for the biggest db for another 18 hours without blocking anything. Next time we're doing aws blue/green deploys to avoid downtime. We didn't this time since we weren't on 14.9 yet (the minimum minor version of 14 supported by blue green).

Then, when our apps next try to query our database they will be querying our target database. Wait. Their (or Python's default?) db orm blocks while it performs a DNS lookup for each and every query!? It doesn't cache resolved addresses for any length of time? No connections are pooled and reused? reply necovek 6 hours agoparentIt would probably be the OS' `getaddrinfo` or `gethostname` that does this: Python rarely reimplements system level calls, which means it relies on the system's configuration. If TTL of 1s was respected, they would be cached for 1s, but it's not uncommon for DNS query libraries and especially caching DNS servers to not fully respect TTL anyway: tbh, that might explain some of the downtime they've seen. reply ComputerGuru 5 hours agorootparentI didn't mean it was directly implementing the networking call to the dns server -- just that it wasn't directly caching the result. getaddrinfo(3) and getnameinfo(3) (guessing that's what you meant) don't implement caching, at least not explicitly in the spec and not normally in practice. On Windows, DNS results are cached by the OS but on Linux that would be distro-dependent behavior and usually requires setting up a local caching dns server (Ubuntu uses unbound out-of-the-box, iirc. Other choices include ncsd and dnsmasq). Even if they implemented caching at the syscall level, this still assumes no connection stays open for more than 1s or is reused except per query. It seems like a big assumption (at least I hope it is, because I certainly wouldn't want my app to initialize a new db connection, let alone perform a DNS lookup, for every query). reply juggertao 3 hours agorootparentThey mentioned they had a script which terminated all connections to the old database then changed the password.

Traffic was steered to the new PostgreSQL instance not with DNS/Route 53 weighted records, but an application-level percentage enroller (based on user ID). Our particular set-up did in fact have apps talking to both databases simultaneously, each with a percentage share of traffic, and so we did not need to incur additional downtime to cut off traffic to the original source database - though now you do have to worry about eventual consistency. I wouldn't recommend using their Schema Conversion Tool. We instead migrated the data as 1-to-1 as possible into the PostgreSQL target table, and then used plpgsql triggers on the replication target table to clean/validate the data and write it to another table with our desired (and more strongly typed - no more storing JSON as TEXT) schema. There were also some issues with the replication task seeming to stall and stop during the change data capture (CDC) phase. As mentioned support is kind of spotty in this area, though we learned it may have to do with sizing the DMS replication instance correctly. reply sharadov 5 hours agoprevDMS is a terrible migration tool, I spent almost a month fighting with various migration issues before I gave up.

Loved reading it. I'd be very curious to see how Amazon DMS performs at scale. Scale includes either of these situations: a) Larger dataset - 2+TB b) Higher throughputs - WAL Spikes (at least 2-3K TPS) c) Reliably and efficiently replicating TOAST Columns (ex: large JSONBs). d) Advance data-types - BLOB, CLOB, HSTORE, ARRAYs etc. In my previous role with the Azure Postgres team, we observed that Azure DMS worked pretty seamlessly in migrations that did not involve the above situations. Once either of the above came in, the replication experience was hairy. Interestingly, in my current gig at PeerDB, many use-cases we are seeing have either of the above situations. We have been doing quite a surgical optimizations to handle those situations and they keep coming!

Not sure the project would've been possible without it. Data mapping from PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL as in the article isn't nearly as bad as going between systems.

I never got the sense anyone replying to us knew any more than the surface level about the infrastructure of how DMS worked. reply NomDePlum 2 hours agorootparentWe kept our table mappings pretty much mirrors of the source tables. Any data transformation we managed on the target cluster, not through AWS DMS. I've used it fairly frequently over a number of years so maybe the issues we hit on the learning curve have dimmed.

We treated these carefully and tested as we made them but never had any real issues with them. From memory DMS could cope with adding columns pretty transparently. One setting we invested in configuring and understanding was to allow DMS to attempt to recover from replication failures. This allowed it to error on DDL changes and attempt to recover. This usually involved restarting the task, but it would do this transparently as part of the recovery. reply Spivak 10 hours agoparentprevThis was my experience as well.

Spoken like someone who has never worked in the public sector. Hiring can easily take 6+ months or more due to an ever-increasing list of requirements that government HR is required to fulfill, not least of which is passing a security clearance which takes even more time. The best people on the market rarely have the patience for this. Once your employees do get hired - on-boarding can take another few/several/more months, getting various permissions, technical documentation, etc. Everything is out-of-date because making changes requires committee consensus, in a culture that is risk-averse, because nobody notices when you out-perform (after all, the requirements were also set by a committee that doesn't know who you are) but something going wrong is grounds for termination. Public sector work over-relies on hiring contractors precisely to shift blame for failure to the contractors. Managed database services are excellent tools to shift this kind of catastrophic risk of data loss to a contractor/vendor (who is managing the database). Governments not owning their data isn't due to technical or budgetary limitations - it's strictly cultural. reply NomDePlum 2 hours agorootparentFully agree with this.

AWS has a lot of compliant services, but it's not like they're doing rocket science one of the top 5 richest countries in the world cannot afford to develop or contract within its borders. The simple reason is that the UK has been on a long trend of selling out to the highest bidder, whether they are US tax avoiding companies, chinese or managed by Russian oligarchs.

The \"let's be managed and only hire developers\" is a huge myth. All large organizations involve tons of \"cloud engineers\" or \"devops\" depending on how they want to call them and are just sysadmins with a different name and a bigger paycheck. Having actual datacenters doesn't add a ton of complexity and datacenters themselves are often managed by people who don't even have an engineer paycheck. The main difference between being on prem vs cloud is you have to plan (how many servers/storage/network equipment you have to buy and replace on the following year) and pay for stuff (like space, racks) more in advance + take into accounts delays in delivery. This is where cloud makes the job much faster for companies but given the slow pace at which gov stuff happen usually I don't think this is a problem for them. reply solatic 2 hours agorootparentprev> and not being able to find an engineer Remember it's not just about being able to find one single engineer - then they become key-person risk.

It's not a free-lunch by any means and needs thought and governance certainly but the procurement simplification benefits alone make going to the public cloud a no brainer for a lot of government services.

    "originBody": "§ 1 Cover letter To: Fredrick R, Brennan 597 North Raleigh Avenue Atlantic City, New Jersey 08401-1081 D ear Mr. Frederick [sic] R. Brennan, I thank you so much for writing me. I apologize for the delay, and for it being so long. The length is the reason for the delay in my response. I hope that OCR technologies are effective at saving you from having to type this in. Could you carefully proof the OCR results? I apologize for the burden it will be. I hope you understand the length as my taking your request seriously, and are pleased rather than dismayed. It was alot of work to write it. If you sign up for text messaging at gettingout.com, you can get faster responses from me. Sending a phone number will also work. Please use your judgment in where to send this—any place that would be interested is fine. LKML and Slashdot.org seem like reasonable places to send it (as of 2006). Your advice is desired. Please let me know if you or anyone else has questions. If after sending this somewhere you still have time, could you send me info on Reiser5, or any interesting papers on other Filesystems, compression (especially Deep Learning based compression), etc.1 Gratefully, Hans Reiser 11/26/23 From: Hans Reiser (architect of ReiserFS V3 + Reiser4) 26 November 2023 § 2 Introduction I was asked by a kind Fredrick Brennan for my comments that I might offer on the discussion of removing ReiserFS V3 from the kernel. I don’t post directly because I am in prison for killing my wife Nina in 2006. I am very sorry for my crime–a proper apology would be off topic for this forum, but available to any who ask. A detailed apology for how I interacted with the Linux kernel community, and some history of V3 and V4, are included, along with descriptions of what the technical issues were. I have been attending prison workshops, and working hard on improving my social skills to aid my becoming less of a danger to society. The man I am now would do things very differently from how I did things then. Perhaps some might accept my apology; others might learn from my mistakes if I describe them well; some might find the design issues interesting. I will leave it to the users to decide whether ReiserFS V3 is still useful. Users should understand that it is a burden for those who maintain VFS and the like to have to test their changes on an additional filesystem, especially given Linux filesystems are hard code at the VFS layer. ReiserFS 4 provides a more maintainable basis for the future for those users who like the features of V3. If V3 isn’t used it should go, I trust the users and the kernel maintainers to discuss whether it is used, and to make the right decision together. § 3 Main text V 3 had a moment in time when it was useful, and I am happy that we were able to contribute to the success of GNU/Linux for a few crucial years during which it was growing rapidly in usage. Chris[page 2 follows] Mason’s contribution of journaling was the most practically useful feature of V3, and I thank him for it. I am sad that SUSE didn’t make it in the market place, I found it to be a well-crafted distro, and it was a privilege to be able to contribute to it. I am grateful for their sponsorship and support. Reiser FS V3 was our first filesystem, and in doing it we made mistakes, because we didn’t know what we were doing. I have to tell you that when I did the first benchmarks the performance was terrible, and I didn’t know why. By terrible I mean that no sane person would use it for anything, there were years of dark depression before it was debugged enough to run at all, and then, 5% here and 5% there, I dragged it into being a little faster than the competition, and saving some space for traditional filesystem sizes, and more space for small files. Changing the allocation of blocks to files—simple code fortunately—yielded most of the performance gains. In V3 performance tweaking, Ext2, the existing GNU/Linux filesystem, was actually a very high performance filesystem—probably the best in the world.1 The man I was then presented papers with benchmarks showing that ReiserFS was faster than ext2. The man I am now would start his papers [page 3 follows] crediting them for being faster than the filesystems of other operating systems, and thanking them for the years we used their filesystem to write ours. Not doing that was my first serious social mistake in the Linux community, and it was completely unnecessary. Vladimir Saveliev, who had pity on me and came back after everyone else had quit, was the man who made the code work well enough that anyone would want to use it for more than a benchmark. After he came back, I left the debugging to him. He is one of the most good, mild-mannered, and hard working men that exists, anyone who has ever worked with him will agree with that. He didn’t say much about it, but he believed in the Free Software Movement. Through force of will, and hard work, he made himself into a programmer of extraordinary skill, the effects of which you can see manifested in our Reiser4 code. He went from being the must junior of the programmers at the start of V3 to being the lead programmer, earning it through hard work all the way, Assuming that the decision is to remove V3 from the kernel, I have just one request: that for one last release the README be edited to add Mikhail Gilula, Konstantin Shvachko, and Anatoly Pinchuk to the credits, and to delete anything in there I might have said about why they were not credited. It is time to let go.[page 4 follows] In prison I have been working quite hard on developing my social skills, especially my conflict resolution and conflict avoidance skills. There is a lot of conflict in prison, as you can imagine, and it is quite a good place to learn those skills. Nothing like lots of practice, and the groups they let us take if we want to have a quite well developed curriculum, Repetition helps, at least for me. It has changed me. I had a tendency to see people in extremes. That I am working on by being mindful of it, and by being around people who it would be easy to see in extremes, Many of them have become very good persons [sic] since their crimes. I look back, with the advantage of the passing of years helping to improve my vision, and I see that while I intended to be helpful to researchers in Russia living on less than a hundred dollars a month, I could not be as helpful as a job working in America earning a Western salary. I put everything I had into the project, working 40+ hours a week at a day job, most employers not happy that I wanted to work only 40 hours if I could, and then I spent 15-20 hours a week arguing over algorithms, architecture, code, etc., by email. I learned to cut out everything in my life besides the[page 5 follows] project because otherwise my dream just would not make it. I had more dream than experience. With Mikhail there running things in Russia it went pretty well because we had an ability to understand each other, I believe Mikhail Gilvla was the brightest mind in his generation of computer scientists, and his talent was wasted. First it was wasted by Russia’s economy making his success impossible, and then in America it was wasted by most of the database field not being able to understand that he was right in wanting to rewrite the basics of their field in the ways be wanted to because he was just so much brighter than they were. I don’t think they could even understand why it mattered, what he wanted to do. We both believed that relational algebra was a special case of something more general, something that was needed for “semi-structured data\". He called his approach “set-theoretic\", and implemented it in the form of a database. I had my own syntax that expanded the filesystem namespace, instead. We came up with our ideas independently, before we met.[page 6 follows] I had the idea that the place to implement it was in a filesystem, and that the motivation for implementing it there was to evolve it into a namespace that would allow unifying all of the namespaces of the operating system into one namespace. I thought this would be the most important refactoring of code ever, and would increase the expressive power of everything in those namespaces. I drew analogies between the effect of roads and waterways on the development of civilization according to Adam Smith, and the effects of free trade on specialization thus wealth according to Adam Smith again, and the effects of unifying the namespaces on the expressive power of the operating system. That was my dream. I was not the only one with this dream. The term “namespace\" is pretty much only used by people who share in that dream enough to use a term that implies an equivalency between databases, filesystems, DNS, etc. Rob Pike and Plan 9 are examples of work to increase the Filesystem namespace, My particular flavor of the dream was that I had a syntax that could expand the filesystem hierarchical namespace to handle “semi-structured data\". That means queries that are constructed from primitives that can be combined into the equivalent of searche engine queries (unstructured associations), database queries (unordered ordered pairs to search tables), or filesystems (fully[page 7 follows] ordered names to search hierarchies), or things that are richer than any of those special cases. Now that was my dream! Sigh, It probably won’t surprise you that I was a teenager when I came up with this dream, and its syntax for searching semi-structured data. I apologize to the users that I never got to that dream because of my crime and my going to prison, and they never got to see any semantic enhancements to Reiser 4. The most technically difficult task that was a prerequisite to someday implementing my syntax, a task that had to be implemented first to do things right, was to make the filesystem efficient for small files. I was very sensitive from the start to the power of net work effects to drown efforts to shift paradigms, to introduce better ways to do things. Network effects were abstract, so I understood them better than the importance of believing that I can make friends and allies of people who start out hostile because I had not made them feel included. Awareness of network effects was why I decided that the path to unifying the namespaces of the operating system started with enhancing filesystem semantics which started with creating a storage layer that could emulate a filesystem faster than any existing filesystem but could also be[page 8 follows] effective for storing small objects like databases are. Yes, it was arrogant to attempt that, but it seemed like it should be possible to do it. I had no idea how long it would take to get it right. Mikhail advised me to use balanced trees instead of extensible hashing (what dcache uses). I would come to understand that locality of reference is the sina qua non of performance, and that balanced trees are the best of all tools for implementing clever ways of maximizing locality of reference, Mikhail had tried extensible hashing, and learned the hard way that trying to fix its problems leads to using balanced trees. Locality of reference doesn’t just affect hard drive performance, it affects compressed data performance (that means SPRAM performance), and even affects CPU cache performance (and thus DRAM stored data performance). He told me he was saving me 2 years by telling me to use balanced trees, and that’s true, and I thank him for that, I never told Mikhail that Oracle had tried implementing a filesystem using balanced trees, and its performance was terrible leading to most insiders in the industry concluding that balanced trees performed poorly for filesystem File size patterns. I didn’t tell Mikhail; I didn’t tell any of the programmers; I didn’t tell anyone involved in the project. I couldn’t see why they should be slower so I disregarded it, Vladimir would[page 9–1 follows] have good cause to be angry with me if he reads this. I think part of their performance problems were how they did their journaling. I’ve observed that most balanced tree implementations are too synchronous, and most filesystems aren’t very synchronous for performance reasons. fsync() is like using a sledge hammer to turn a screw with repeated sideways blows on the hoad of the screw. What is needed to have high data integrity guarantees with no unnecessary performance losses is a new API that allows intelligence in doing it by allowing the different layers to share their greater intelligence with the other layers. We need to allow the user to share their intelligence with the application, the application to share its intelligence with the filesystem, the filesystem and process scheduler to share their intelligence with the I/O scheduler, the I/O scheduler to share its intelligence with the I/O scheduler and other aspects of the hard drive, and then share intelligence back up the other direction of that stack, and then also tie in the memory manager in there too. 2 It requires not just ordering of I/O’s, but specifying groupings of I/O’s that should commit or not commit as a group, to communicate that intelligence, and not be more synchronous than necessary. Other features relating to priorities, fairness, guaranteeing I/O rates, etc, would also be desirable. If more details are wanted by anyone, ask, please, This is an area where Reiser 4 should do more[page 9-2 follows] than we had time to do. I wish I had had the money to retain Joshua MacDonald when Orade hired him away from me, and learn more from him about logical journaling ideas he had then, I hope he is doing well—he was simply a brilliant young man, I’ll just say that block aligning journaling isn’t necessarily optimal for all needs that userspace has, and refer the reader to him for more. What I didn’t know when we were arguing over the V3 design is that the FFS bench marks are misleading, and fail to highlight something that also hurts database performance, FFS is the BSD filesystem, and it was regarded as the best of its day. It used 4k blocks except for the tail end of files for which it used 1k blocks, and it would combine those 1k blocks from different files into the same 4k, thereby allowing them to increase block size but still conserve space. Sounds clearly correct, yes? Alas, the performance cost of pulling the tails of files out of line with the rest of the file to combine it with the tails of other files is a seek plus a rotational delay (20 ms), That’s hugely expensive compared to the tail size divided by the transfer rate, Seeks dominate filesystem performance unless the layout is perfect. You can see the importance of avoiding adding any seeks by having the tail of a[page 10 follows] file located inline with the rest of the file, Databases with their \"BLOBS\", ReiserFS V3, and FFS all combine tails in a way that adds seeks and hurts performance substantially. For Databases and Reiserts V3 it’s even worse though, because BLOBS make it not really a balanced tree, and the ability to effectively cache all the internal nodes of the tree is lost. Google “Reiser 4 twigs”, and hopefully that will find a longer discussion of that for interested readers, including how to fix it, That performance failing drove me crazy—I felt the design was just wrong, and I resolved to redo everything from scratch with Reiser 4, The plugins, and the modularity of the code they created, are the most important feature of Reiser 4, It is far easier to add features to Reiser 4 than to add them to other filesystems, because you just add new plugins. The hard stuff is done, and new features are a downhill ride. Well, except that I am in prison, and so I must leave all that to others. There is a problem that filesystems have, and that is that format changes are unwanted by many for good reasons, That is the primary reason that filesystems stagnate, Well, that, and stagnating is easy…[page 11 follows] I just had to fix all these flaws, fix them and make a filesystem that was done right. It’s hard to explain why I had to do it, but I just couldn’t rest as long as the design was wrong and I knew it was wrong. SUSE didn’t want a format change, they wanted incremental improvements to V3. That’s the way it is for a lot of filesystem architects. Incrementally changing things they know are deeply wrong to their cores, but stuck in that misery of doing so. I said no to that, which I won’t apologize for and don’t regret, because I have a soul, and I had a dream. What I do apologize for is how utterly inarticulate and unsociable I was in explaining that to SUSE. What I essentially said to SUSE was that the code was unmaintainable terrible code that needed to be rewritten from scratch, trust me, it needed to be done, we didn’t know what we were doing then and now we have learned what we should have known, but we will fix every bug in V3 that is found. I could have said that I hear them, and I hear them well, so well that Reiser 4 has node format plugins that solve the format change problem. I could have told them of our plans for a repacker for Reiser 4, so that partitions could be shrunk, and layout perfectly optimized, and …spent a day visiting them and making Reiser 4 our dream not my dream. Instead I[page 12 follows] communicated that I couldn’t pursue my dream without a format change. Both SUSE and I wanted what was best for Linux and SUSE, so the reason for my failure was that I had failed to socially connect by reaching past the initial hostility to the format change to I make my (and DARPA’s) dream into our3 dream. I would repeat this failure style with the Linux kernel community when Reiser 4 was submitted for inclusion, only worse. Let me go back in time though to the early days of V3. Not long after the computers were purchased, and then the project really got going, Mikhail got a job in America, Mikhail was the reason I had hired this group. Now I no longer had somebody running things on site that I was intellectually compatible with, and frictions developed. I had not chosen them, and they had not chosen me, nor had they chosen my dream or the Free Software Movement. Alas, I was inexperienced, and they didn’t respect. that, which is understandable, yes? I had a feel for abstractions that was stronger than my feel for people, and a casual delight for tossing socially established algorithms that made them even less comfortable than my wearing a cowboy hat instead of a tie, None of this was a problem with Mikhails but Mikhail had left. It was to be expected that there would be problems, but I was too young and hopeful to see that. There was a cost to going from system administrator to architect without first spending a few years as a coder.[page 13 follows] An example of this was their use of BLOBS in V3. I didn’t know that putting unformatted nodes on a level of the tree below the putative leaves of the tree was the standard way of doing things in the database world. When I saw it in the code I objected to it. I was asked to just let them try it their way, and if it didn’t work it could be removed , I was too inexperienced as a software project manager to know that that was an argument to only entertain after the first version of a product has shipped, because whatever gets written before product shipment is not likely to get rewritten until after product shipment, especially if you know the design is wrong. That’s especially true if you know the design is wrong. What I didn’t know was just how wrong the design was, The performance cost was higher than I feared it would be, I should also say that the coding cost of doing it right was higher than I thought it would be, To the young architects out there, let me say that if you know something is wrong, don’t lot it happen just to be agreeable or to accept the consensus, Yes, listen to all the arguments, but if you don’t have a better feel for algorithms, you should not be in the job of architect. Believe in yourself, I paid the price for not knowing when to be firm, when the benchmarks came in, and then again when fixing it required a format change that lost me SUSE. 4 [page 14 follows] Then Mikhail’s employer hired the rest of them, and left me with a pile of poorly commented code that was not able to run. It would have been wiser for me to write it again from scratch, but that would have meant admitting that all I had invested into the project was a total loss.5 Now, with the distance of time, I can see that their leaving was simply the reasonable thing from their point of view, There were some unkindnesses in how they left, but that’s to be expected, says the distance of time, Then I felt so betrayed. Now I wish to let go of that. They were just ordinary people caught in economic forces, and not enjoying working for the guy with more dream than experience. They too were inexperienced: none of us had worked on a filesystem before. We were all young, and impatient. I never did get to where we made enough money that I could pay people well, and I am truly sorry for that. If I had not committed my crime, that day when Reiser 4 was a worthy use of the extraordinary talent of the programmers working on it probably would have come. I was callous and indifferent to their needs and dreams when I committed my crime, and victimized them financially and ruined their dreams that I had talked them into. One of my great regrets is that I let go of Mikhail as a friend. I hope be is alive, and doing well.[page 15 follows] I read about a DARPA request for proposals for open source software on a Friday on Slashdot, and it had a Monday submission deadline. I went into a writing Frenzy, and proposed what became Reiser 4, DARPA was very good to us, very and I learned a lot about accounting and security both from them. I’d like to apologize to DARPA for two things: All we were able to complete was the infrastructure that would enable the security features I proposed, and that was despite my putting several times the money they gave us into the project from every where I could get it, including using 29% interest credit card cash advances to make payroll near the end. 6 Now that Reiser 4 is stable, the plugin infrastructure would make it so easy to add extra features, we could probably have done the encryption plug in and stat data inheritance in just 6 months.7 At the time I made the Reiser4 proposal it looked like democracy had won in Russia, I believe we were a point of light in US–Russian relations, The problem was that what was needed was a thousand points of light, and we were one of a very few.[page 16 follows] Russian Intelligence/Law Enforcement, after doing a very thorough job of making sure we weren’t a CIA cover operation,8 was very nice to us, and quite supportive of us and the Free Software Movement, It might not have been a coincidence that we had no Mafia problems, The time that I got scammed for $300, they got my money back in 45 minutes. I know that one is not supposed to say good things about them, but my own personal experience is that they were very effective, kind, and even wisely guiding. In important ways, Russian culture teaches a better understanding of people. As a for instance, one of them told me that my wife was in a lot of pain. Now I can see clearly that that was exactly correct, and perfectly illuminated the path I should have taken. Alas, I lacked the wisdom to understand the words with just one repetition. *9 In prison I have learned that alienation, which I intend to use to protect myself, is often a cage I bulld around myself instead. A fear of being naïve can often be as dangerous in its reality distortions as being naïve,[page 17 follows] Now is not the time to try to be a light in US-Russian relations. I hope that there will again be such a time, and an end to all the death and dying. I hope the time will come again for reaching past the alienation, and finding friendship[page 18 follows] and love, between Russia and Ukraine and the U.S, and between my children and I. Call me a fool, or simply someone who thinks the pain is too much for us all, I leave that to you. Back to Reiser4: We10 built a beautiful filesystem that embedied everything we had figured out we should have done the first time, called Reiser 4, and it smoked, What’s more, it had this plugin architecture that I had proposed to DARPA in that writing frenzy, but that Nikita Danilov had made even better than what I had proposed (he made the balancing operations plugins too, and I am so glad that he was smarter than me and showed that the performance costs were acceptable). With most filesystems, adding a feature is 80% altering the existing code and 20% writing the new feature, and then you will be likely adding a Format change that someone not even working in the filesystem group will say no to. With Reiser 4 we made every aspect of it that we could imagine doing so for into a plugin. If you want to add a new feature, you just spend your time writing the new plugins for it, and 90% of the time that is all you will have to write, or failing that, it will be 80% of what you will have to write, You get to spand your time on your clever idea instead of on why it was so much harder than it should have been to write it. I think you’ll find it is more than 3 times faster to add it to Reiser 4 than to any[page 19 follows] other filesystem, with all the features required of a filesystem for compatibility (an enormous burden to write—if you have a clever filesystem idea save yourself that burden and add a plugin to Reiser 4 instead—you can be one programmer doing a 6 month plugin instead of having to fund a team for 5 years to do a filesystem) completed, it was going to be all downhill from there. We would have been theones implementing a substantive new feature per programmer per 6 months, The code that Alexander Zarochentcev, Nikita Danilov, and Vladimir Saveliev wrote (all three of them contributing equally, working together like the three musketeers) was beautiful code, and then the junior programmer Edward Shishkin came along as the fourth musketeer and his compression plugin doubled performance again for compressible files. I cannot remember ever finding anything I could improve in Alexander Zarochentcev’s code: it was always perfectly written: “read it and learn how things should be written” kind of code. I am not known for being unable to find things to criticize, or praising easily. Somehow with the smallest budget for paying them in the filesystem world, I lucked onto the best programming team in the filesystem world. The filesystem was worthy of their talents—I wish that I as a person had been worthy of them.[page 20 follows] The problem was that it didn’t use the code that had been written by others in the kernel community, and people don’t really like their code not being used. People want to feel included. I responded to their social need by, well, screwing the pooch in response (benchmarks and disputing their expertise). Imagine if I had responded by saying that I needed their help in imagining new file plugins instead? You know how people are much more likely to read an email if it is one screen long, rather than the length of this :-/ ? It is similar with contributing code to the kernel. It is much more social and relationship developing to contribute a screenful or two of code once every week or two over the course of years. We were dropping 90,000 lines of code on them all at once, having worked on it in total social isolation for 5 years in Moscow, Socially it was all bad. Small increments are the more social way to go. Incremental improvements to V3 would have met no opposition. We could have lived a life of being a little bit better than ext3, and been respected in the field as we waited for someone young to obsolete us, Alas,11 it had to be written from scratch to be written right, to be written the best I knew how to to design it, to fix what the benchmarks had 12 revealed to an empiricist. My leadership and project management failures needed to be atoned for. The maintainability of a plugin based filesystem was perhaps more important than the[page 21 follows] benchmarks, I had added comments, and we had added bug Fixes, but I am so glad I kept none of it for V4. If I had had then the conflict resolution skills I have learned in prison Cognitive Behavioral Intervention classes I might would have been able to overcome all that. Then, my attitude was, it’s the fastest filesystem in the world, why aren’t you happy and helpful?! Look at these benchmarks! These plugins! Why do I have to deal with these people who didn’t write as fast of a filesystem ? Let them write theirs, and us write ours - VFS should allow that ! My attitude should have been, ignore the hostility, that’s to be expected at first and overcome, I can overcome hostility, and the way to do that is simple : 1) make people Feel appreciated and cared about, 2) make people Feel included, 3) make people want to do things with those plugins themselves by asking them for their ideas on what plugins they could imagine. Now I Know that it is possible to overcome such problems if I actively apply my mind to Finding an emotional or social path to making people Feel good. The most important part of that is to believe that I can do that successfully. I used to lack the ability to imagine that I could succeed at overcoming hostility, but by doing the exercises in my Cognitive Behavioral Intervention classes in prison situations, I have started to see that I can,[page 22 follows] started to believe that I can, If you believe you can do it, you usually can, when it comps to making things go well with others, If you focus on Finding a way past a problem, instead of on your Feelings of having been wronged, you can usually get past a relationship hiccop. If you Fail, you’ve lost little to nothing in making the attempt, so why Fear to make the attempt? Contrary to what young men so often Fear, if you Fail in such an attempt you don’t lose Face - you gain respect From others watching you try - especially the older ones. If you make a habit of always trying, you will inevitably get good at it, *13 One of my dreams is to someday convince the State Legislature to teach the curriculum they teach us prisoners, in elementary school, that people like me can learn it better without having to go to prison to learn it, I’m try my to convince some people to pitch it to legislators—if any one would like to help with that please let me know. It will help with more than just avoiding prison—it will help with all relationship conflicts, and who does not have those…? The prison parenting class should be taught in High School too…[page 23 follows] An example of what I could have hand led differently was when Viro announced that there was a race condition in our code, but that he would not tell us where it was because if we could not audit our code for race conditions we should not be allowed into the kernel, Viro was this guy whose career focus was lacking, I didn’t know any thing about auditing code for race conditions, and disappointingly Google didn’t get me any where in looking for how does one audit for race conditions. My attitude at the time was that it sounded like necessary but tedious work, really tedious, that hopefully the guys who were doing the debugging would figure out while I tried to get the money for their next pay check. 14 I should have done more than communicate the problem, I should have asked “what is the audit for race conditions plan, and help me find literature on how to do it, and then let’s divide up the relevant code and do it, all code to be audited by two different people\". Race conditions are very expensive to debug when they are rare—auditing would have saved money. This was an area where we all needed to improve our methodology. 15 I Failed to communicate by Failing to ask if this was an area where my guys didn’t know how to do it and were too shy to say so, and in this were just like me.[page 24 follows] What I should have done was ask Viro instead of Google, and invite him to come to Moscow, stay in my spare room, sample the world’s wildest nightlife (Moscow), and give our team a seminar on auditing for race conditions and supervise us as we each took a part of the code and did the audit per his instructions, We had as much motivation to eliminate race conditions, no, much more because it was our code and business, as Viro, There was no good reason for us to not be allies in this. There was only a bad reason I was responding to the initial hostility rather than reaching past it to make an ally of someone who had a lot of potential to be very helpful to us. Now of course he might well have refused the invitation, said he was too busy, told us to get better at using Google, etc., but even if he refused the invitation he would probably have felt mollified somewhat. If he took us up on the invitation all of us could have made valuable Friendships likely to have been useful for the rest of our lives, as we fed him shi [sic] (щи, Russian soup, one of the best aspects of Russian cuisine is their soups) and pelmenie (elmeni, Georgian spicy pot stickers), and took him to dance the night away when the race conditions were gone. I could have similarly approached other Key persons in the Kernel community who expressed unhappiness at our contribution offering, if only I had had then the social confidence, and belief that it is possible to overcome initial touches of alienation, that I have now developed.[page 25 follows] Instead I responded to hostility with my own hostility. In prison, on MLK day, I learned of MLK’s words: “O nly love can fight hate.” I have come to appreciate, and fully understand those words, I wish I had understood them then. There were a bunch of such situations that I handled in ways that did not make people Feel appreciated or included, and I want to take this opportunity to apologize For those. I especially want to apologize to the other members of our team who invested so much of their lives into our dream only to be failed by me, and by my alienating others in the Linux kernel community. The Linux kernel is not about benchmarks, it is about a community of people who enjoy working together in the Christmas Spirit to give to the users all year long. Now that I have changed who I am I can better see that. I don’t know what is in Reiser 5—I haven’t been told, and I cannot go on the Internet. Edward Shishkin is a very bright man though, and one of my regrets is that I didn’t spend more time with him, I am confident he has done some thing nice in Reiser 5. Who knows, maybe he has done some nice plugins that I would never have imagined. The compression plugin Edward coded was the one thing yielding the biggest performance boost of all the things we did in Reiser 4. Chances are high that I won’t be[page 26 follows] released anytime soon. I encourage people to allow those who worked so hard to build a beautiful filesystem for the users to escape the effects of my reputation. I invite you to empathize with what this has been like for them for a minute. Let their dreams escape from the harm I have done, if that feels right to you. § 4 Conclusion I wish I had learned the things I have been learning in prison about talking through problems, and believing I can talk through problems and doing it, before I had married or joined the LKML. I hope that day when they teach these things in Elementary School comes. I thank Richard Stallman for his inspiration, software, and great sacrifices, It has been an honor to be of even passing value to the users of Linux. I wish all of you well. Hans 11/26/23 P.S.

He was a contractor with the company that I was working for, and he was doing that (working on logic synthesis for FPGAs) by day and trying to start his company at night. He was very passionate about his technical ideas, though in those days he had difficulty explaining them, so I went back and forth about whether he was a genius or a crank (I decided that he was some combination of the two). I have a music CD somewhere around that he gave me, new age-y music his mother composed (not sure whether I still have it or not). I didn't want to believe that he was a murderer, but it soon became clear that he was lying. reply jeffrallen 15 hours agoparentI met him at the same place at the same time and had the same reaction to him.

He made his children think either that their mother abandoned them. He had thought without a body he could not be charged and convicted. I believe he waited until it was apparent he would lose the trial and then plead down so that they could recover her body. I want to believe redemption is possible, especially given how eloquent he is, but his demonstration of calculation over emotion in her murder makes me strongly question his change. reply dale_glass 17 hours agorootparentHe was far less of a mastermind than he fancied himself at the time. If I recall, he bought a book on murder investigations and a socket set after his wife's disappearance (which was easily tracked back to him), removed car seats (blood) from his car, and willingly testified in court that it was his manly dream to sleep in the car, or something along these lines. He could have likely gotten away with it if he kept his mouth shut. Luckily he had the arrogance of believing he had actually come up with a convincing story. reply starkparker 17 hours agorootparentFor those interested in the trial, the SF Chronicle's Henry K.

They let that guy go! reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentThe 'weird nerds' defending Reiser brought this up time and again during the trial. But Reiser showed them all up by leading the authorities to where he had buried the body afterwards so I guess that that particular angle is now settled. reply RajT88 15 hours agorootparentYeah, some follow-up reporting found that the guy was lying for some weird reason. He said as much. I forget the reason. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentApparently it's a moderately common enough phenomena that cops intentionally keep aspects of a murder scene out of news and reports, so that they can check if someone knows them or not.

It's pretty much the best what murderer on trial can hope for. ... then again, if he was reasonable he'd probably never commit murder. reply pvg 16 hours agorootparentYou can get the details from the contemporary coverage linked in the sibling comments but it seemed like he felt he'd go to trial and be acquitted. If I had to guess, having to admit he'd been lying to everyone through the whole process was probably also a factor - the deal was something like plead to a manslaughter charge and reveal the location of the victim's body. reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentprevI figure it was because he thought he was so intelligent that he could run circles around the court. reply jonathankoren 17 hours agorootparentprevI will always remember the Slashdot comment that said that removing the passenger seat of your car so you could sleep in your car was a reasonable thing to do, and everyone saying it was suspicious was a hater.

That's why it's suspicious to remove the passenger seat without installing a flat surface over it. That's why the instagram poster did install a flat surface.

If you're looking to get away with orchestrating the murder of someone you know, it can be difficult. However, if you're just looking to get away with murdering someone in general, that's surprisingly easy. Just go a town or two over and knife a random someone in a random parking lot. Police success rates are comically low. reply bombcar 15 hours agorootparentPolice success rates on completely random murders are insanely low partially because they're insanely rare. Complete success is something like 50% overall, but in general in many of those cases that \"aren't solved\" they know who did it, they also know they can't prove it. reply bena 14 hours agorootparentConsidering the number of people in prison who get exonerated, I'm glad that the ones \"they know\" did it aren't actually in jail. Because that seems like random chance that they're actually right. But it's also why I qualified my statements. That if you're looking to kill a particular person, that's way harder than \"getting away with murder\" in general. Police only have so many tools at their disposal. And if there is no link between victim and perpetrator, the job becomes way harder. reply EasyMark 7 hours agorootparentThis is why I'm against the death penalty. I don't think that executing 95(97?) actual murderers is worth the chance of killing 5(3?) completely innocent people. That's not justice, that's just good odds, and it shouldn't apply to human life.

That's trying to cover up the murder which is also a crime, but a far cry from premeditated murder which is one of the most heinous crimes recognized by the legal system. reply naikrovek 17 hours agorootparentprevHigh levels of calculation in times when high levels of calculation are required to keep you out of prison are not a sign of anything. Humans are amazing at compartmentalizing things like this away, even while they are happening. It is impossible to know from this single datapoint if he is remorseful or not, but it is not at all outside of the realm of possibility. As a child I merely punched my brother and I tried to kill myself afterwards because of the guilt. In the moment I could not have been more prescient about what I was about to do and what I was doing. I recalled how I had observed him fighting others, how he threw punches, how he swung his arm based on how angry he was, and I planned an arc that took advantage of his habits and clocked him. Knocked him out in one punch. The instant he hit the floor I felt remorse like I had never felt before. Who the hell am I to take an action like that?! Anyway, how someone feels while doing something like that does not necessarily reflect how they feel at any other time in their lives. It also may reflect how they are at all times, or anywhere in between. There is no foolproof way to know. reply JadeNB 17 hours agorootparentprev> I want to believe redemption is possible, especially given how eloquent he is, but his demonstration of calculation over emotion in her murder makes me strongly question his change. I think it would be ridiculous for me to presume that I can possibly have any view into whether or not someone has sincerely changed, but why should the fact that someone was calculating once affect whether they have changed? I could see doubting the apparent demonstration of change, because they might have calculated the appropriate words to say, but I don't see any reason that a calculating person is less able sincerely to change than any other. reply iaw 17 hours agorootparentI consider it a Bayesian approach to understanding potential internal drivers. Someone who is not cold and calculating likely has less capacity to completely present the appearance of redemption whereas someone who is calculating has that capacity. So, someone who is demonstrated to be calculating has higher odds of faking a behavior if it is beneficial to them (e.g. leaving prison). It's for him to know, but I don't think it's ridiculous for me to question. reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentI'm with you on that one. I read the whole thing closely and my conclusion is that some of what's there is playing to an invisible audience. And some of the rest of what's there feels like 'the real Hans' shining through because he hasn't really changed, but is actively trying to change how he is perceived. I could try to enumerate those bits but it doesn't matter all that much, it's just the feeling that I get from reading the text. reply okwhateverdude 16 hours agorootparentSame. Pretty much any instance where he mentions prison groups or classes, it is very specific and emphasizes strongly that they have changed him. And he knows his mail will be read by the prison staff anyhow. The only benefit of the doubt I have here is maybe the groups/classes promote discussing topics like this precisely because they know a parole board gives them consideration. In which case, he'd be an idiot to not play along if he's angling for parole. (And if that is the case, it wouldn't surprise me if the prison system is being duplicitous in telling prisoners that so they can be demoralized when denied, ie. \"I followed the rules and did what you tell me, but you still won't let me go?\") reply fl7305 15 hours agorootparentprev> my conclusion is that some of what's there is playing to an invisible audience My impression was that he got an assignment in class to write a letter where he reflects on bad interactions in the past, apologize, and try to put them behind him. I also got the impression that he really wants people to write/call him and discuss computer stuff, so this might be part of the motivation for writing it. But I don't know him, so who knows what's going on in his head? reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentI've not done it, so I don't know, but I suspect you can never fully get to \"I completely regret what I did because it was wrong\" without having somewhat of \"I completely regret what I did because I got caught\".

My reference to ridiculous was to the ridiculousness of my thinking that I have any insight into Reiser's character—a disclaimer at the beginning that I was not presuming to offer any. I was in no way meaning to call you or your statement ridiculous. > I consider it a Bayesian approach to understanding potential internal drivers. Someone who is not cold and calculating likely has less capacity to completely present the appearance of redemption whereas someone who is calculating has that capacity. Yes, that was exactly what I was meaning to say. Someone being known to be calculating should create a higher evidentiary bar—they need to do more to convince me that they have changed. But I don't think that it offers any evidence against their having changed. And maybe this is what you were saying: > I want to believe redemption is possible, especially given how eloquent he is, but his demonstration of calculation over emotion in her murder makes me strongly question his change. I read this as \"the fact that he is calculating makes it less likely that he has changed.\" But maybe you just meant \"the fact that he is calculating means that I require stronger evidence that he has changed\"? reply iaw 10 hours agorootparentThank you for the well-reasoned reply, I misunderstood the thrust of your commentary. > I read this as \"the fact that he is calculating makes it less likely that he has changed.\" But maybe you just meant \"the fact that he is calculating means that I require stronger evidence that he has changed\"? That's a fair point. I need to reflect more on that. It is not my place to proclaim absolutely likelihood, you're correct. I think the latter statement is closer to the thrust that I'm getting at. My burden of proof for redemption is higher than a less calculating criminal/crime. reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentprevGreat comment. For me that fact means that I don't just read it with 'a higher bar' but with the possibility that what I'm looking at is created with the express purpose of deceiving me so some of it reverses in meaning. reply prirun 14 hours agorootparentHans is probably high on the psychopath scale, and if you do any reading about psychopaths, the main takeaway is that you can never believe what they are saying. From Google: What is a psychopathic person? Psychopathy is a severe personality disorder characterized by interpersonal deceptiveness and calloused, remorseless use of others, as well as behavioral recklessness, impulsivity, and overt antisocial behavior (e.g., aggression, violence). From: Encyclopedia of Mental Health (Third Edition), 2023. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentprevA \"higher bar\" is basically \"evidence against\" because you're saying you need more evidence for. Then again, everything I've read leads me to believe he's impulsive at times (even says so in the letter!) and the calculating part was afterwards not before or during (if it was, he was notoriously bad at it). reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 14 hours agorootparentprevthe assumption here is that your judgement of calculating is accurate. reply bachmeier 17 hours agoparentprev\"Ending another human's life\" covers a wide range of cases. My recollection of this event, which is now long in the past, is that he was cold, calculating, did not value human life, and was quite comfortable with his kids moving on without their mother. He didn't just do something to her. He permanently damaged his kids, her family, and all of her friends. He made his decision knowing all of this. Redemption?

And it's super super uncommon and extreme. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 14 hours agorootparentprevyou don't know his emotional state, he could have very well passed that high bar internally. From my recollection, his wife was sleeping with another man, or there was some conflict between the two that was related to another man who I _think_ was supposed to be a friend to them both. it's been a while, but the point remains, he very well could have been in a state that allowed him to \"pass that bar\". reply jacquesm 14 hours agorootparentReiser himself is on the record as stating that he killed her because he was protecting his children. Whether that passes that bar or not I'll leave up to you but for me it rules out that this was a 'heat of the moment' thing. In my opinion he knew full well what he was doing, he understood that his kids would move to Russia and be raised there (she got sole custody) and this was his way of putting a stop to that. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 13 hours agorootparentI didn't say heat of the moment, I said emotional state. If someone plots the death of a person who sexually abused their child no one would claim that it being premeditated implies they were not in a heightened emotional state. reply jacquesm 11 hours agorootparentThat's fair but it would still count as premeditated in a legal sense, but there would be circumstances that would likely weigh in as to the severity. reply PH95VuimJjqBqy 10 hours agorootparentregardless of legal definitions, I posted responding to what seemed like a belief that the only way to \"cross a high bar\" is to do so in the moment.

That said, the premeditated murder of someone, let alone your wife and children's mother, is not something that the average person is capable of. It is entirely different than the crimes one may commit out of rage, fear, or passion (i.e. when your amygdala is driving).

And then there’s murdering your ex, hiding her body over two days, lying to your children that she’d left for russia and they’d been abandoned, and only revealing the location of the body so you could plea down to second degree murder (a good 18 months later mind, we’re not talking quick change of heart). Oh and then filing a civil suit against pretty much the entire legal system, including the trial judges and your attorney. And when sued for damage by your children’s grandmother (on their behalf) assert that you killed your ex to protect your kids (which you had basically never been there for, which was the entire reason your wife left you). I’m not saying redemption is not possible, but I’d think some reflection and atonement would be the baseline, and I’m not aware of Hans Reiser having done any such work. reply dlandau 16 hours agorootparentThat he still wrote \"in prison for killing my wife Nina\" when she wasn't his wife anymore at the time indicates IMO that he still doesn't get it. reply 0x457 15 hours agorootparentLegally speaking, she was, since the divorce wasn't finalized. reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentI don't think that matters much. To all practical intents and purposes she was no longer 'his wife' and given that he killed her the fact that the divorce was never finalized shouldn't give him extra rights. reply 0x457 15 hours agorootparentHow is he supposed to refer to her? ex-wife is incorrect. By name doesn't provide enough context for people that don't know about him. The fact is - he killed his wife. > To all practical intents and purposes she was no longer 'his wife' It doesn't work like that, though. My soon-to-be-ex-wife is still listed as spouse on our health insurance because I can't remove her until the divorce is finalized. I still have to specify her in many legals documents as my wife. Even outside the legal field, many in my personal life consider her as my wife, go \"call me when it's finalized\". reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentThat's besides the point, the question is whether you still think of her and refer to her as 'your wife'. And then extrapolate to the - obviously hypothetical - situation in which you murdered your soon-to-be-ex-wife and still refer to her as 'my wife' many years later. It's bizarre that this needs to be spelled out. This isn't a legal issue, it's a bit of insight in how Reiser feels about the person he murdered. reply 0x457 14 hours agorootparentWell, in my mind, he is referring to the state at the point of murder. The fact that they were going through the divorce process isn't important here (to us bystanders, to the investigator it's a motive). I think this is just bs for his next parole hearing tho. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentprevI'd say that saying \"my wife\" makes it worse for him than saying \"my ex-wife\", maybe that's just me. Doubly so because she's, you know, dead. reply jacquesm 14 hours agorootparentThat's how I read it as well. reply foxyv 17 hours agorootparentprevRedemption requires that a person change and provide restitution. What Reiser did wasn't a stupid mistake, it was a calculated action that he took. His only mistake was getting caught. He didn't accidentally kill someone, or do so in the heat of a unique moment in his life. He decided that he could make his life easier by killing someone else and did so with no intention of facing the consequences of his actions. While I won't say redemption is impossible. He is going to have to serve his time and dedicate the rest of his life to helping others to even come close. reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparentSince the prosecutor's office offered him a sentence of 3 years if he'd lead investigators to where he buried the body, the burden is on you IMHO to support your assertion because obviously if the informed professionals in the prosecutor's office thought it was a pre-planned murder they wouldn't've been that lenient. (In the US, pre-planned murders are routinely punished by life in prison without parole; California might be a little more lenient than the rest of the country, but not that much more lenient.) reply masklinn 17 hours agorootparentWhat sentence of 3 years are you talking about? The judge offered (and prosecutors agreed to) a plea guilty of second-degree murder (down from the first degree murder he was convicted of) if he revealed the location of the body and gave closure to her Nina’s children and family. He got 15 to life, the maximum for second-degree murder, and his first request for parole was rejected so he’s doing at least 20 for now. reply hollerith 17 hours agorootparentWhat you describe happened after the trial. The offer of 3 years happened before the trial: >An Alameda County Superior Court judge confirmed today Hans Reiser was presented a deal last year in which the convicted murderer would have only served three years in prison. During what was supposed to have been Reiser’s sentencing hearing – which has been delayed due to this week’s events – Judge Larry Goodman, in an effort to clear up what he called inaccuracies in the media, said that Reiser was given the opportunity last September to plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter. While voluntary manslaughter can carry different prison terms, Goodman said he agreed to give Reiser three years – the lowest possible term – to spare Nina Reiser’s family the turmoil of going through a trial and having the couple’s oldest son testify. Goodman pointed out in court if Reiser had accepted the deal, he would have been released in May 2008. However, Goodman said Reiser chose to “roll the dice,” and a jury convicted Reiser April 28 of first-degree murder in the killing of his wife. https://www.mercurynews.com/2008/07/09/reiser-rejected-volun... reply andai 15 hours agorootparentprevRemarkable. Would it really have been 3 years if he'd accepted? That seems far too low. On the other hand, the first degree homicide seems absurd given the evidence. Did they just give him that because he refused to cooperate, and not because it was actually an accurate verdict? reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentEverything I've seen indicates that the \"court\" seemed to think it was a case of \"murder in red blood\" or whatever they call getting angry and killing your wife these days, with a dose of \"very intentional coverup afterwards\".

Another example of mens rea. reply shadowgovt 16 hours agorootparentprevSo, this is a reasonable thing to be confused and frustrated about. It's worth remembering that the underlying philosophy of justice, crime, and punishment isn't actually something a society agrees upon. Ask five different people a question about the law, the courts, or the prisons and you'll get five different answers. And the system we get out of that is a hodgepodge of extremely path dependent features based upon who was in control of what levers of power at the time a given law was passed or a given punishment decided to be cruel and unusual (or not). Broadly speaking, there are two independent axes the judicial system is trying to satisfy: - punitive punishment. There are some actions that cannot be undone and some catastrophes for which there is no \"making whole\" the victim. Our system factors in a certain amount of eye for an eye retribution in these cases that dates all the way back to Hammurabi. If you're looking for a justification based on societal structure and survival and not just \"vibes\" (and make no mistake, there's a huge amount of just vibes in the way law, crime, and punishment come about)... It is believed a general understanding amongst the people that committing irrevocable transgressions on their neighbors will cause society to inflict transgressions upon them keeps the society from degenerating into infliction of individual violence on each other in the common case. Does it work? Depends on who you ask. But that's the idea, at least from the Machiavellian \"stable society\" standpoint. In that context, it doesn't matter if Reiser completely overhauls his philosophy of life in jail; he took something that he cannot give back, he took something no one can give back, and a certain amount of punishment is necessary to inform everyone else this is not acceptable (\"thus always to the enemies of the country,\" etc). - rehabilitation and rebuilding of trust. We humans broadly speaking divide other humans into two categories: those who would never and those who would. Certain transgressions bump a person from the would-never into the would category, and that opens a fissure that can never be closed. The fissure can be diminished by the transgressor demonstrating that they understand why that's unacceptable and providing reasons for the public to believe they will never commit that transgression a second time. Under this theory, crime commission is contextual; if a person can demonstrate that they will never be in the context again that would cause them to commit the crime, a certain amount of trust can be reestablished. And here we get to the question of why drunk driving is treated less severely than, say, premeditated murder. As an individual, it's very hard to guard against premeditated murder. And people premeditating murder look like everybody else; It's hard to generate signifiers that would rebuild trust if somebody does such a thing. So the state has a large interest in discouraging it via \"the olde ways,\" because the state has a hard time detecting it coming or defending the victims. In contrast, crimes committed under the influence of mind-alterers we generally feel would be something the transgressor would not do if the influence were removed. It's a lot easier to reestablish the trust gap in theory if somebody who drives drunk swears they will never drink again. ... That having been said, in practice, I totally agree with you. I think the numbers on drunk driving recidivism are ridiculous and it is completely unacceptable to maintain the status quo trust model on this issue; drunk driving should be an immediate revocation of the ability to use a licensed vehicle for life without extraordinary circumstances (on the order of pardon from the governor) to allow someone to retest for a license. We treat pilot licenses thusly; we should treat vehicle licenses with similar scrutiny. ... Problem is, in the US at least, we've built a society so heavily dependent upon cars in most of the country that doing this in the general case would be a sentence worse than the location constraints we put on sex offenders, and there's an upper limit on the state's capacity to actually enforce a law. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentSomeone once said that society forms laws and such mainly to prevent vigilantism, and not really for much else.

Read about Mesopotamian religions, or the Hindic ones. reply hnbad 42 minutes agorootparentprevEvil as a moral judgement isn't. Acts can be good or evil. In more secular terms we prefer to say \"harmful\" or \"unjust\" but the meaning is arguably the same. But the idea that \"evil\" is an attribute a person can possess is 100% a religious one. If you're not religious, there can be no evil person unless you think there is an \"evil\" gene or an \"evil\" psychosis - \"sociopath\" and \"psychopath\" are often used this way but usually in ways that have very little to do with diagnostic criteria and more with trying to sound more profound than just calling someone a bad person; in pseudoscience this also sometimes manifests as the idea that some people are more predisposed to crime, though usually nowadays this more often manifests as vague notions of \"racial culture\" than measuring skull shapes, but this too is just a more elaborate way to call groups of people inherently bad. As a religious concept, \"evil\" can be somewhat nebulous where people just take some wrong turns and \"evilness\" seeps into them making them irredeemable: many Christians (especially certain sects of American protestantism) believe \"sins\" (i.e. disobeying God's rules, not necessarily causing measurable harm to others in secular terms) work kind of like this where habitual sinning in one way can lead to sinning in other ways as sinfulness takes over the person's life (like an addiction spiraling out of control). It can also be a much more literal idea of outright demonic possession (e.g. the kind of thing you need an exorcist to help with) or demonic presence (e.g. evil people actually being lizard people masking themselves as fellow humans to hide among us). And yes, I'm labelling certain fringe conspiracy movements as religious as they operate on a similar framework and often have direct ties to religious traditions and concepts. Conversely, not only are \"evil people\" a religious concept but so are \"good people\". If good is something you do that means you need to continously demonstrate your \"goodness\" by doing good things. But if good is something you can be then any accusations of wrongdoing are highly suspect because a good person would do no such things. This is why most people don't take kindly to being told even in the most polite terms that something they did was kinda racist (or sexist, or misogynist, or...) because \"I'm not a racist\" (i.e. thinking of it as an innate attribute of their character rather than one of their actions and hence something they can and need to actively control) - mind you, liberals did not do a good job with this distinction either over the past decade because as it turns out even self-professed non-religious people often have religious upbringings that stick with them (i.e. self-applied labels like \"feminist\", \"anti-racist\", etc should only ever be read as statements of intent and dismissed if they do not manifest in their actions which they rarely do). reply beepbooptheory 13 hours agorootparentprev> The true Übermensch would never give a second thought (or the light of day) to such a piddling subject as this, one who exhibits all the frailties and animal passions of the last man! \"Second chances\" and \"forgiveness\" are just as much symptoms of christian morality as good and evil themselves.

Thus spoke Zarathustra.. reply hnbad 15 hours agorootparentprevIf you don't believe in evil (I don't) that not only means he isn't evil but that he also didn't murder his ex because he was evil. So there must still be something to him 15 years ago that made him plan to and murder his ex, hide the body, use elaborate lies to deny his actions and then only admit to it when offered a deal to disclose the location of the body to allow the victim's grieving family to bury her. That's a lot. The prison system is neither equipped nor designed to resocialize or rehabilitate people. He hasn't demonstrated any considerable change in his character or outlook on the value of human life that makes me believe he changed for the better. He didn't make a mistake. He intentionally planned out the murder of his ex and how to hide the body and explain her disappearance and he did this to keep his children he neglected, which was the reason for her breaking up with him to begin with. And then he acted out that plan and stuck to it for months. Most people don't even commit to their gym memberships as long as he did to his cover story. People aren't evil. But people also don't improve by rotting in prison. You can argue that means we need something better than prison and I would, but you can't argue that means he should be treated as redeemed or released early. Dropping a feel-good out of context MLK quote to try and impress a future parole hearing is not a demonstration of character growth. Still referring to his victim as \"my wife\" when she had already broken up with him is not a demonstration of character growth. If he seeks redemption he needs to address those surviving his victim.

That's why we have so many very specific terms to describe the different situations in which one person kills another, and which of those applies is a big factor in whether we see the killer as having acted justifiably or not.

They would possibly kill all the Jews which is unfortunate and a terrible loss. The rest of the populace would just become the part of their empire. And running an empire is a troublesome thing as countries like Britain found out. India used to be a British colony. And today more property is owned in London by the Indians than by native British people. Some regions of London are minority white. Nobody designed it like that. It is just a result of previous attempts at exploitation of their acquired empire. Same happened to France. Germans would eventually succumb to the same fate. Stalin is a different thing.

Metcalfe intended to mean that the value of the network grows as the square of the number of nodes because \"connections\" here aren't edges, they're fully reachable pairs of nodes. Thanks, again, HN, for helping me through that] > The financial value or influence of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2).

And from that assumption and the fact that the graph is fully connected follows that it's proportional to the square of the number of nodes. (Because you can have (n-1)*n/2 edges with n nodes in a fully connected graph. And hence, the Reiser quote above is similar but it emphasizes something else: it states what Metcalfe's law (I think) uses as a premise (or implicit claim) that the value is in the connections. Because it's not necessarily a fully connected graph. Edit: originally I've given (n-1)*2/2 as the number of edges instead of (n-1)*n/2. reply amomchilov 16 hours agorootparentPromotional to the number of _edges_. Edges are proportional to the square of the number of nodes, so the value of the network overall is proportional to the square of the nodes. Think of it this way, for every new user added to the network: * the new user is enriched proportional to the number of existing users * every existing user is enriched by the 1 new user This double-counting is what gives it the quadratic growth. reply atleta 15 hours agorootparentYep. That's what I was saying too.

I believe \"connected users\" refers to edges. Otherwise it would be stated as \"users connected to the network\". It could explain my misunderstanding, and also seems consistent with the explanation later in the article, but it's also completely the opposite of what we observe on the internet; for example, the value of the web is definitely not in its in number of pages, but in the value and quality of the connections between the pages. reply zvr 16 hours agorootparentTwo users in the network: A and B; one connection: AB. Three users in the network: A, B, and C; three connections: AB, AC, BC. Four users in the network: A, B, C, and D; six connections AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Metcalfe's law says value increases as 1-3-6-... instead of 2-3-4. In graph terms, users are nodes, connections are edges, and in a fully-connected graph edges are in order of the square of nodes. reply dekhn 16 hours agorootparentYes, I see I had completely misread and misunderstood the original law. But ethernetworks aren't fully connected (they tend to have lots of local connections that then are connected to each other through routing). reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentI think the difference between logical and physical connections is what drives the confusion here. If two nodes can reach each other somehow then for Metcalfe's law they are connected, even if there is no direct connection between them. reply dekhn 15 hours agorootparentYes, I realized that shortly after reading the replies. Thanks for stating it explicitly. Once again, my brain's inability to parse english caused a multi-decade misunderstanding. Realistically, the only metric that I can think of that makes sense here isn't proportional to |V| or |E| but to the betweenness connectivity of the graph and the average distance between nodes. reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentYou actually have a very valid point: given that there is such a thing as the maximum ttl at some point that 'logically connected' network will become more and more sparse depending on how 'wide' the network really is.

For example, there was an earlier HN post about composition of features (https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/eigensolutions/?latest) Another example is in ecology. Resilient ecology has many possible interactions among members of the ecology (including humans). An \"invasive species\" isn't necessarily one that is not native to the ecology, but one that is able to exploit a resource while having a minimum interaction with the rest of the ecology. Dr. John Todd's ecovats are essentially self-contained ecologies that self-organized around a pollutant. They are created by taking samples from a number of ecological systems and putting them together into vats, and then running contaminated water through there. It's because the possible interactions are so high, that somewhere in there, was a path to breaking down the contaminant. In such a way, Dr. Todd was able to break DDT down in a matter of days through a system like that, and has worked on cleaning up superfund sites with this method. To go one step further than number of interactions, Christopher Alexander's ideas on pattern languages was more than just about interaction of components, but actually about the _grammar_ of design patterns. Such a grammar can be constructed in a way that all possible combination coming out of the grammar results in a cohesive design. This allows inhabitants of an architecture or an end-user to reconfigure anything (as long as it follows that grammar) to suit their current needs, and it would still come off as a cohesive design. To circle back to addressing the idea of evil and people who do bad things. I think you can find truth anywhere, and Han Reiser certainly touched on an insight (though it was not exclusive to him). I would further suggest this though: wouldn't this also mean that there is value in _relationships_ among people? In, not just the exchange of thoughts and knowledge, but the exchange of shared experience and feeling? I don't know what went through Reiser's head when he killed his wife, and I can believe that there are a kind of madness that can consume someone.

Also the age of consent was lower back then, and untold numbers of \"normal respectable ethical people\" who back then would otherwise condemn Wilde as \"pedophile\" did marry girls at 14 or so. Before the 20th century basically after 13-14 kids were considered more like short adults than as a special category of teens.

It seems people try to apply American puritanical standards to a historical person from Europe, who lived in the 1800s Victorian era.

Legal does not mean socially acceptable either. 16 might keep you on the right side of the law here in the UK, but a 40 year old who is found to have had sex with a 16 year old is likely to be badly regarded. > If we were to apply modern standards, you should be condemning over 1B people around the planet for following the teachings of a 30yo+ guy who married a six year old girl.

The question is, who defines 'right'? > Child brides in modern Yemen or many other places Sadly in their eyes, this is considered acceptable, even good. In our eyes, and mine, it's unacceptable. How do we define 'right' in this context? If we are right then how do we make them understand they are wrong? Why they do it is simple; it is done in their culture so it is right. I see exactly the same kind of thing appearing here on HN where somebody condemns something they don't like (e.g., https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38981118) because \"you're wrong because you're not right\", essentially. > but a 40 year old who is found to have had sex with a 16 year old is likely to be badly regarded I'm not so sure.

Isn’t the number of connections instead of number of components related in some way to metcalfs law? reply chubot 15 hours agoparentprevFWIW this is highly related to what I think of as the \"narrow waist\" architectural principle. You may like these articles I wrote: The Internet Was Designed With a Narrow Waist - https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/02/diagrams.html The Internet has huge utility because TCP/IP is a narrow waist. It has architectural connections to Ethernet/wireless/... on one end, and HTTP/BitTorrent/... on the other. For the most functionality, you want fewer code components, and more interoperability. You want O(M + N) pieces of code to give O(M * N) functionality. The narrow waist architecture does that -- it gives O(M * N) connections to O(M + N) amounts of code. You don't want to write O(M * N) code, though many people and systems are stuck there! This generally works the best when the connections are data-oriented and protocol-oriented, not oriented around source code. --- A Sketch of the Biggest Idea in Software Architecture - https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/03/backlog-arch.html I mention Metcalfe's law, which is related but distinct. Metcalfe's law is about O(N^2) network node connections (\"dynamically\"), while the (usually) O(M * N) narrow waist is about system architecture (\"statically\"). They both produce network effects! If the Internet already exists, then the easiest design to implement is to attach your new network to it (e.g. a network in space), not create a new, incompatible network. --- Incidentally, this seems like what's wrong with the Kubernetes ecosystem -- it has an combinatorial explosion of code due to lack of protocols and interoperability. It's not data-oriented, like Unix is. (An important point is that lots of people complain about Unix-style unstructured byte streams because it's suboptimal LOCALLY, while missing the global interoperability / scale / system economy issues -- they get stuck writing O(M * N) code to avoid parsing and serializing ) --- Newer article from last year - Oils Is Exterior-First (Code, Text, and Structured Data) - https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2023/06/ysh-design.html Software modularity within a process is much different than modularity between processes -- it's a bit more like networking. You need an exterior narrow waist.

To reduce this complication to a minimum, you have to make the number of notions zero or one, which are two numbers that can be raised to any power without disturbing this concept. Since you cannot achieve much with zero notions, it is my belief that you should base systems on a single notion. https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/08/history-trivia.html reply HideousKojima 16 hours agoparentprevnext [2 more] [flagged] jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentTerry Davis was diagnosed with schizophrenia and never killed anybody. reply mpol 17 hours agoprevA few things that stuck out to me.

Back in the day it had performance advantages when dealing with small files. But now I'd be very surprised if ext4 isn't superior to it in every conceivable way. reply ghaff 15 hours agoparentThere's an argument for copy-on-write filesystem options but it's pretty hard to argue there needs to be more than 2 or 3 \"traditional\" journaling filesystems like maybe ext4 and XFS. reply kstrauser 14 hours agorootparentHis letter contends that ReiserFS was intended to be more than just a filesystem, and that jibes with what he was saying about it at the time. I think that it was meant to be a queryable database that happened to be good at implementing traditional filesystem semantics, but also optimally useful through some other kind of API. reply jbverschoor 14 hours agorootparentOnly 5-10 years after BeFS. reply Eisenstein 13 hours agorootparentprevCan you explain what that means? What are 'traditional filesystem semantics' and how would it be useful through 'some other kind of API'? reply kstrauser 11 hours agorootparentWell, you know how to R/W data with a normal filesystem. You can chdir() to the location you want to be, look around there with readdir(), open() and read() or write() files in there, and all that. You could also have a SQL-like API where could \"select count(1) from all_files where path_root = '/usr' and owner_uid = 0 and world_readable = true\" that allowed you to query files, or maybe kernel calls that looked a lot like the Amazon S3 API (PutObject, ListObjects, ListBuckets, etc.) if that turns out to be more efficient for certain usecases. The normal POSIX filesystem calls are obviously enormously useful. I mean, they've been used to implement SQLite and PostgreSQL, so you can* implement those other kinds of APIs on top of it. I can also imagine it being the case where there might be a much more efficient way to implement specific workflows if you didn't care about all the conventions that POSIX brings along. reply bjourne 14 hours agorootparentprevI beg to differ. In 2024 we know that COW is bad regardless of whether we're talking about disk or memory. reply hinkley 17 hours agoprevI thought the usual solution when we disagree irreconcilably with a maintainer was to fork and rename? I always thought it a bit weird that we were naming parts of Linux after people. We already did that once and that kinda uses up your freebie. Seems like everyone quit Hans and nobody rallied the project back together. reply dale_glass 17 hours agoparentI don't think Reiser's name had anything to do with the removal. If I recall the situation was more or less as follows: Reiserfs3 was out there, and while it had plenty fans (good performance and efficient disk usage), it had a fair amount of corruption issues. Reiserfs4 was about to come out. Reiser insisted that Reiserfs3 was done and an obsolete relic, and reiserfs4 was the new hot thing. Reiser ran a consulting company of some kind. IMO this may have put a bit of a damper on contributions. He also had a contentious personality, with quite a lot of people disliking him, and him having trouble convincing people to merge reiserfs4. Right about that time the whole murder mess happened. So reiserfs3 was apparently abandoned, reiserfs4 was uncertain if it was going to get merged. Namesys, Reiser's company of course fell apart and the existing employees had to find something else to do. So that was probably about the worst timing possible. Reiserfs4 didn't get merged, Reiser was dealing with the trial/prison, and other filesystems started showing up as well. reply dspillett 17 hours agoparentprev> I thought the usual solution when we disagree irreconcilably with a maintainer was to fork and rename? Yes. But that requires someone, or a group, to take responsibility for that and support the fork. Maintaining a filesystem can be a complex undertaking. > Seems like everyone quit Hans and nobody rallied the project back together. I think it was more like he was the core of the project with others contributing. Once he was out of the picture no one else had sufficient passion and/or time for it to take on the mantle of project lead sufficiently (to push Reiser4 onward and eventually getting it merged into the mainline Kernel and maintaining Reiser3 in the meantime & further forward). While Reiser4 is still maintained, it has never been merged into the mainline kernel limiting its support in common Linux distributions. I don't know if that is because the current maintainers have tried to have it merged and failed for some reason, or if they have not pushed of its inclusion at all. What is deprecated and due to be removed is Reiser3, which is not actively maintained. There are some technical issues that would need addressing soon if it were to remain, and in any case an unmaintained filesystem is a dangerous thing to rely upon if you can avoid doing so. It isn't being removed because of who started it, it is being removed because it is not well enough supported for mainstream safety. Reiser3 won't be removed until some time in 2025, and unless you need the latest latest kernel at all times an active setup will keep working for a while after that (until the older kernel it uses falls into EOL), so you have plenty of time to migrate if you need to. If a lot of people were relying on Reiser3 there would be a lot more noise about this. People using Reiser4 are building their own modules (or patching a kernel tree and building it in) already and this will not affect them. reply IlliOnato 12 hours agorootparentIf I remember correctly (and I followed the discussions on LKML at the time, but it was a long time ago), Reiser4 was not merged because it had some \"cool\" features that could cause problems. For example (again, IIRC), it allowed directories to have hard links. Al Viro was adamantly against it, showing that this potentially creates some very serious problems. In particular, it allows for cycles in the directory graph (it's no more a tree), and Viro has shown that detecting or preventing such cycles may by prohibitively expensive, and undetected they would cause any program that does directory walking (like search) to loop infinitely. This was not the only problematic feature, just the one I remember more vividly (in part, because of Al Viro's caustic argument style :-) ). reply dspillett 1 hour agorootparentI didn't follow LKML directly, but from what I saw elsewhere that seems right. I remember there being technical arguments against Reiser4, and the discussions about them getting interesting (not combative, but very direct) in part because Hans wasn't one with a \"nicey nicey\" discussion style either! Though until Hans was out of the picture, those discussions were still on-going. reply bombcar 14 hours agorootparentprevRemember that XFS was added to the kernel in 2001, and was already well-supported by most (all?) distros by the time the Reiser3/4 issue was beginning. People who encountered issues with Reiser3 usually migrated away, and never looked back, Reiser4 was already DOA imo before all the other stuff happened. reply marcosdumay 16 hours agoparentprevInstead, people integrated the interesting ideas of reiserfs into ext2, and made ext3. This is also a perfectly fine way to handle disagreement. Also, people quit him way before that thing. He mostly supported the filesystem alone. reply 0x457 15 hours agoparentprevThere is just no need for such FS today. Everything is bloated, random access is much faster (SSDs, NVMe), storage is cheaper. It's the only FS that I lost data with. reply keeganpoppen 13 hours agoprevwow, he is an amazingly compelling and articulate writer. definitely gives me a bit of an eerie feeling, of course, because he seems like a very meticulous person and perpetrated a heinous crime in a most meticulous fashion... but... it is very hard to completely discount the idea that he has learned something from prison in a way that makes him redeemable, though i'm a bit of a softie-- him bending over backward to commend people on their work in a way he clearly didn't do at the time... that is very hard for a prideful person to do without at least some little bit of subtext... and i just didn't pick up on anything like that. the only subtext would essentially be that he is so clever that he knows the only way for him to get his roses is to genuflect. so i guess this whole thing is kind of a litmus test on how you view human nature... but it was an incredible read, at the very least. reply ajb 13 hours agoparentHe's serving 15 years to life, and has already served 15 years (next chance of parole in 2027). So he's at the point where its very important for him to look like he's a reformed character. That makes it particularly hard for us to judge, at this distance. If he'd remained cold and calculating, this is still exactly what we'd expect him to write. reply vvillena 16 hours agoprevI found this to be a great story about mismanagement. It appears Hans made a multitude of small mistakes that ended up crippling his filesystem project. It's extremely interesting to see such a thorough reflection on all the things that went wrong. reply sitzkrieg 15 hours agoparentyea im thankful he shared all the failures and redesigns etc reply kstrauser 17 hours agoprevThat was fascinating. It sounds like he’s done some real introspection during his lockup, and I hope he’s able to apply those learnings to future situations. I felt bad for him[0] while reading. He was a brilliant young person with a big dream, yet without the interpersonal skills to help him realize it. I’ve seen that so often. Maybe this will help me look past the next person’s challenging communications, and think here’s someone who means well but doesn’t know how to explain it. Reiser wants to learn how not to be an ass. I can try to learn how to recognize when someone being an ass is caught in the same traps he was. That, and how to be sure I’m not the one being the ass. Best of luck on the continuing personal growth, Hans. [0]Minus the obvious, of course. reply mardifoufs 16 hours agoparentI don't believe he did. He's just angling for his next parole date as he got denied this year. reply kstrauser 16 hours agorootparentThat's very possible. Some of his phrasing sounded like he hoped the parole board would be reading it: I accept responsibility for my crime, I'm using the skills I'm learning in prison, etc. etc. Still, if you asked me about my own sins, I might say similar things: I accept responsibility for acting like a jackass, I'm using the skills I've learned from mentors and through meditation and mindfulness, etc. etc. I'd be completely earnest about all that. I've behaved poorly in the past, decided I wanted to be a better person, and genuinely try to do that. If I want people to take me at my word and believe that I'm trying to be better, I have to take him at his word until proven wrong. (One of my sins was unnecessary cynicism. I have the luxury of it not mattering to me whether he's sincere or not, and I think it's a healthier mindset for me to accept stories like his at face value than to default to mistrusting everyone. I'm not naive, though. The people in his life need to weigh that a lot more carefully than I need to.) reply cperciva 15 hours agorootparentSome of his phrasing sounded like he hoped the parole board would be reading it: I accept responsibility for my crime, I'm using the skills I'm learning in prison, etc. etc. This is true; but it also struck me as being very similar to things I've heard from recovering addicts going through 12-step programs -- I'm an addict, I'm sorry for all the harm I caused through my addiction, I'm learning skills to help me overcome my addiction, etc. -- so my hunch is that it's there as a result of the anger management program he's going through in prison. reply kstrauser 14 hours agorootparentDefinitely, and I hope for his sake that's the actual explanation, and that it's sincere. That is, while we're talking about a specific person here, that person is someone I have zero connection with. I hope all the Hanses around the world are working on themselves with good intent. That's obviously untrue, but I can still wish it. reply bawolff 15 hours agorootparentprevWould there be anything he could say? reply mardifoufs 13 hours agorootparentHonestly? No not really. Not until he gets his parole I guess. The stakes are way too high for him to be honest. He might very well be, but the phrasing is just very \"list checking\" to me still. As someone else said, it's like the generic stuff you learn from therapy (at best, if we assume he's honest). reply ddtaylor 16 hours agorootparentprevHe was denied two years ago. reply jacquesm 16 hours agorootparentHe planned the murder of the mother of his kids, I'm pretty sure he can plan well in advance for a parole hearing. I wouldn't put anything past the likes of Hans Reiser or Peter Madsen. reply stickfigure 16 hours agorootparentWas there something I missed? I just reread his wikipedia page, and it seems to confirm the crime-of-passion narrative that I remember from 15 years ago. That said, I would not disagree with your character evaluation. reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentA crime of passion does not normally include studying up on body removal, ways to hide further evidence and not owning up to the crime for years because you - wrongly - believe that you can't be convicted if the body can't be found. This was premeditated murder, not a crime of passion. reply cachvico 15 hours agorootparentPremeditation means planning it beforehand. The books were purchased after the deed was done. A crime of passion can be covered up without making it premeditated. reply jacquesm 15 hours agorootparentI'm not going to split legal hairs here",

Few people reads books, and even if they do, the books written by technical people are not pedagogical enough as to allow the reader to capture the Tacit Knowledge and experience from the author as to be able to reproduce new ideas. We are LOSING fundamental knowledge of the internet for every mind who dies. If you think that mailing lists, web archives, books and blog posts are enough then you're being naive. At some point nobody will understand how the Web works. The curve where the Web is going is not pretty.

Brad Hargreaves and Stephen Smith Jan 18, 2024 17 Share this post The Case for Single-Stair Multifamily www.thesisdriven.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other Share Barcelona, Europe's densest city, is thickly built out with single-stair apartment buildings on small lots. Picture via Oh Barcelona. Housing advocates celebrated a string of victories in 2023, including the legalization of missing middle housing and ADUs as well as permitting process reforms. But while most YIMBY attention has been focused on changes to zoning, building code reform may offer an even bigger opportunity to unlock housing construction. And bringing the US in line with its European and Asian peers by legalizing single-stair multifamily buildings is perhaps the most significant of those proposed reforms. Today’s Thesis Driven is a guest letter by Stephen Smith, the Executive Director of the Center for Building in North America. The Center for Building is perhaps the most interesting under-the-radar policy group in housing today, as they do the hard work of comparing the wonkiest bits of building code across jurisdictions, looking at safety as well as cost outcomes. The letter explores: The history and origins of current egress regulations; Regulatory impacts on design and affordability; How the US’s international peers approach fire safety; Ongoing attempts to reform US code. Read on for more from Smith. One evening in 1860, a fire broke out in a basement bakery in a six-story tenement at 142 Elm Street, today’s Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan. Fire and smoke spread up the building, home to at least 20 families, the fire fed in part by the building’s only exit: a wood staircase. Firefighters were able to rescue people up to the fourth floor, but their ladders could not reach any higher. “As the firemen stood on the ladders,” wrote the New York Times the next day, “they could see many women and children lying prostrated on the floor, surrounded by the flames, which rendered all attempts to approach them ineffectual.” Thesis Driven is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Subscribe For an American city in the 19th century, the fire was actually quite small. By then New York City had already had three great fires since 1776, and Chicago would burn 11 years later. Even into the 20th century, American cities would still not be safe from great fires, with San Francisco burning in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake. Across the Atlantic Ocean, great urban fires were largely a solved problem by the 19th century. After the Great Fire of London of 1666, Parliament did what European governments had been doing since at least Ancient Rome: they limited the use of wood in buildings. Without fuel from the structure of buildings themselves, fires still broke out in Europe, but their damage was limited, and great urban fires by the 19th century were mostly confined to smaller or poorer cities on the continent’s edge that hadn’t yet made the transition to brick, stone, metal, and concrete. 19th century Manhattan tenements, with a primitive second exit installed in the form of a fire escape. Photograph by Sean Litchfield. Not so in North America. The continent’s thick woods, fast growth, and rural (and later suburban) character meant that the United States and Canada has to this day never fully moved away from wood-frame construction. Instead, just days after 142 Elm Street burned, the jury that convicted the building owner issued a call for “the enactment of a law making it incumbent upon owners of tenement buildings to place iron stairways, or some other approved means of egress, on the outside of these structures.” Soon after the state legislature followed through on their request, and the requirement to provide a second means of egress in apartment buildings was born. Today, the flimsy fire escapes that satisfied officials in the 1860s have morphed into something much more. Two stairs are required for new apartment buildings above three stories by America’s model International Building Code (whose claim to internationality comes largely from a handful of tiny island nations). They must sit on opposite ends of a building, and they must be fully enclosed. The standards are not unheard of in Europe and Asia, but they are typically only applied to true high-rises – above around 20 stories in Singapore, or 25 stories in Italy (and even then, the required distance between the two stairs is not as large as in the US). As a legacy code requirement, there has never been much modern analysis of America’s two-stair requirement and its impact on fire safety outcomes, but the United States in general does quite poorly on these measures. Almost every country in Western Europe—where single-stair apartment buildings can rise many times the IBC’s three-story height limit—has fewer fire deaths per capita than the US. New York City, which allows single-stair buildings up to six stories (and has many apartment buildings where the second exit is a flimsy fire escape that does not meet modern code requirements), has slightly fewer deaths per capita than the rest of the US. Since the second exit code requirement was first introduced over 150 years ago, the field of fire safety has seen countless more sophisticated innovations, from passive measures like enclosed stairways and fire-resistance-rated materials, to more technologically advanced systems like smoke detectors and fire sprinklers. Despite the questionable effect on fire safety outcomes, North America’s unusual second stair requirements have an outsized impact on the design of multifamily buildings. The rules make it almost impossible to efficiently recreate the traditional design of apartment buildings, termed “point access blocks” by Seattle architect Michael Eliason—a few units around a single stair, with maybe an elevator. The common hallway that must connect the two stairs in a modern American code-compliant building cuts the structure in two, cutting off the possibility of floor-through apartments found in traditional American multifamily architecture like the New York City tenement or the Los Angeles dingbat. The typical American 5-over-1 fulfills the building code requirement for two exits, but requires a large lot and does not typically provide many units larger than a one-bedroom. Photo from ArchPlan Inc. Small plots of land, like the 25- to 75-foot wide lots that most American cities and inner suburbs have been carved up into, have become less feasible to develop. On a 25-foot-wide lot in Jersey City, NJ—just across the Hudson River from Manhattan—the second stair consumes 7 percent of the total floor area, with a few additional percentage points shifted from rentable square footage to un-rentable common area. It ends up all but eliminating windows in two bedrooms, giving them access to just a minuscule air shaft. A developer might be able to stomach it in Jersey City, but in more ordinary markets, without the housing shortage of the New York area, such lots would be rendered unbuildable above three stories. Floor plan of a new building in Jersey City, NJ. Drawing by Alfred Twu. The double-loaded corridor that meets modern American building code requirements can provide studio and one-bedroom apartments just fine, since these have a low ratio of living and bedroom space (which must, at least traditionally, have access to natural light and fresh air) to kitchen and bathroom space (which can be placed up against the dark common corridors). But when architects try to design apartments with two or more bedrooms, the apartments balloon in size, since every 10-foot-wide bedroom ends up coming with 30 or more feet in unit depth. Try to add a single 120-square foot bedroom and you’ll end up having to add another 180 square feet on top that you need to fill some other way—probably with walk-in closets and en-suite bathrooms, adding the expense of more plumbing, fixtures, and tiles. Each square foot of space costs just as much to build whether it has access to light or not, so the rent that developers must achieve for these two-, three-, or—god forbid—four-bedroom apartments balloons far beyond the ability or willingness of families to pay. And if renters or condo buyers don’t like it, they can just drive till they qualify for a single-family house in the suburbs. Without the requirement for a second stair, buildings can be laid out in a fundamentally more efficient way. With less vertical circulation, the circulation core can simply be repeated a few different times, with apartments of different sizes arrayed off of each core, potentially stretching from the front of the building to the back. If planners redraw zoning envelopes to accommodate thinner buildings, more bedrooms can be packed in less square footage, offering more affordable and competitive family-sized designs. With units that appeal more to families (in New York City, condo buildings average 1,189 gross sq. ft., compared to 838 sq. ft. for rentals) and reform of defect liability laws that drive insurance costs up for condo developers, America might even be able to bring its condo construction numbers up from historic lows. Typical European floor plan. Drawing by Michael Eliason, Larch Lab. The YIMBY movement and other housing reformers have made progress over the last decade or more in loosening zoning codes, but building codes in America are still largely a one-way ratchet, getting tighter and tighter with every fire, with no relief due to new technologies, provisions, and understanding of fire engineering. The model code writers are responsive to materials manufacturers and the fire service, but multifamily developers and housing affordability advocates do not exert much authority. Sometimes the manufacturers who donate to the International Code Council and can afford to pursue code changes make positive contributions (for example, the American Wood Council’s advocacy for mass timber), but more often their interests have a questionable relationship to the public good. States and localities have the power to adopt, reject, and amend model codes like the IBC, but lack the capacity to do much informed analysis and research. The better-resourced federal government used to play a larger role in code development, but has mostly retreated in recent decades. Recognizing that building codes are the next frontier in housing reform, I founded the Center for Building in North America around a year ago, to do research on and advocate for changes to building codes that could bring down the cost of production of multifamily housing, and improve efficiency and quality. The opportunities for reform are as deep as a modern building is complex – from more modern refrigerants that would allow Americans to buy heat pumps on the global market to more efficient single-stack venting in plumbing systems that could cut plumbing costs dramatically – but we decided to focus on stairs as our first issue, given the importance to building design and the existing movement among architects for reform. We’ve worked with housing advocates in states across the US to advance legislation and administrative changes to building codes to allow single-stair buildings up to six stories, above the current three-story limit in most of America, drawing on language already adopted in Seattle, Honolulu, and New York City, and extensive experience abroad. While the current single-stair limits were arrived at through trial-and-error and fairly rudimentary logic, status quo bias means that proposed reforms will be held to a much higher standard. To change such a fundamental tenet of American building codes, though, will require more advanced analysis. Fire protection engineering and data collection has advanced greatly in the century and a half since the second means of egress emerged in 1860, and today there are more engineered and big data approaches to proving safety. Since the benefits are diffuse and multifamily development interests in America are poorly organized on a national level, there is not much of a natural constituency for this sort of work. One of my goals when founding the Center for Building in North America in 2022 was to produce research and organize urbanists, architects, real estate developers, and others to advocate for more rational building codes in the United States and Canada. —Stephen Smith For anyone who is interested in diving deeper into these topics, I’d encourage you to reach out to Stephen at stephen@centerforbuilding.org.

Burdensome regulations on housing construction have caused costs to skyrocket. Minimum lot sizes, setback requirements, square footage minimums, floor-area ratio restrictions, overzealous height restrictions, parking requirements, abuse of environmental reviews, historic designations, community reviews, overzealous MFH requirements (like double-stair), below-market mandates, all have worked together to constrain supply, leading to skyrocketing costs. It's the single most important economic issue for me. We need a nationwide effort to ease these restrictions, or we're just going to continue to see rents eat up more and more of young people's earnings. reply gamepsys 10 hours agoparentJust curious, are there any regulations on housing you agree with? There tends to be belief that housing regulations exist to limit supply. Let's not forget that many of these encourage safety and are cost effective ways to increase the quality of life of the residents. If we take deregulation and cheap housing to the extreme we end up with shanty towns. reply mperham 10 hours agorootparentNone of the things he mentioned have anything to do with safety. reply gamepsys 10 hours agorootparentEnvironmental review, community review, and MFH standards all have something to do with safety. It's not like root comment is arguing against fire hydrants or carbon monoxide detectors. I'm just arguing not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. reply mperham 10 hours agorootparentWe have zoning and internationally recognized building safety codes already. Our current housing emergency happening everywhere is a pretty good indicator that we should be much more aggressive about trimming back the regulatory state which has ossified our cities. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentZoning is already pretty bad (at least in the US), and doesn't really have anything to do with safety. In the sense that even without zoning laws, there were already public nuisance laws that wouldn't have allowed you to open a coal fired power plant next to a Kindergarten. reply gamepsys 6 hours agorootparentZoning laws have a lot to do with safety & public health. Industrial zoning is far away from residential because factories produce pollution. Edit: Some parts of zoning law has to do with safety/health. Some parts don't. Some parts are about more than one thing. When I was growing up there was a chemical fire in a factory in town. People were evacuated. Luckily, very few homes were evacuated because zoning laws kept homes far away from the factory. The residential area that was evacuated was low density. The point I'm trying to make is that there is some value in some of these rules. reply epistasis 6 hours agorootparentPollution laws protect against industrial operations polluting other areas, not zoning. The real \"pollution\" they zoning was invented to solve was the \"pollution\" of residents of apartments living close to wealthier people. Seriously! Check out how the original Supreme Court decision phrased its motivation: > “very often the apartment house is a mere parasite, constructed to take advantage of the open spaces and attractive surroundings created by the residential character of the district …. interfering by their height and bulk with the free circulation of air and monopolizing the rays of the sun which otherwise would fall upon the smaller homes.” Here's a more extensive analysis from an org purporting to represent real estate, the source of much historical support for this sort of exclusionary zoning: https://cre.org/real-estate-issues/americas-sordid-history-o... reply eru 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, there's some value in some of these rules. However by and large, the value that would be provided by zoning is already provided (and used to be provided) by other rules not falling under the bucket of 'zoning'. Especially not 'Euclidean zoning'. reply lukas099 6 hours agorootparentprevOkay, what is the safety reason my barber can’t operate out of a room in his house? reply richiebful1 6 hours agorootparentNo reason. Countries like Japan have reasonable zoning, meaning industrial uses are separate, but commercial and residential is largely interspersed. Which is great! reply shiroiuma 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's easy: your barber operating a business out of his house will result in customers coming to your neighborhood, and that might bring \"those people\" around, and we can't have that. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentprev> Our current housing emergency happening everywhere is a pretty good indicator that we should be much more aggressive about trimming back the regulatory state which has ossified our cities. That isn't true though. Our housing emergency is limited to places that are growing and thriving. There isn't a housing emergency in Detroit or much of the midwest for example, just not many are thrilled about moving to those places (or want to leave them as soon as possible). reply astrange 8 hours agorootparentThose places that don't have housing emergencies generally have just as bad regulations, and would have the same problems the instant they became appealing enough to move there. Eventually you run out of built out sprawl. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparent> hose places that don't have housing emergencies generally have just as bad regulations, and would have the same problems the instant they became appealing enough to move there. If American population was equalized across these other cities, there would be less pressure on the few hot places everyone wants to move now, since our population isn't growing so much these days. > Eventually you run out of built out sprawl. Manhattan is not a sprawl and a very desirable place to live, with super high rents to boot. Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, and even Tokyo are the same, so I'm not sure what you are trying to claim here. Out of all those, only Tokyo does well, but that wasn't the case in the 80s and is on the basis of a moribund economy and a not growing national population (one wonders when Seoul and SH will follow). IF you want to solve your housing emergency, limit growth in some way (or at least, make sure residents don't have as much money to bid up housing). reply astrange 2 hours agorootparent> Out of all those, only Tokyo does well, but that wasn't the case in the 80s and is on the basis of a moribund economy and a not growing national population (one wonders when Seoul and SH will follow). Japan's economy is growing again (Nikkei is now at the level it was in 1990) and Tokyo's population has always been growing. …but the rent isn't, because they allow infill development. reply shiroiuma 4 hours agorootparentprev>Manhattan is not a sprawl and a very desirable place to live, with super high rents to boot. Hong Kong, Seoul, Shanghai, and even Tokyo are the same, so I'm not sure what you are trying to claim here. Those cities are actually impossible to have in America (yes, including Manhattan), because of zoning laws and various other laws. Manhattan is only allowed to exist because it's grandfathered in and the local laws allow it. Such a city could never be built anywhere else in the US without some huge changes in legislation (not to mention local culture, since that drives the local legislation). >IF you want to solve your housing emergency, limit growth in some way Tokyo works because growth isn't limited: it's very easy to build here, unlike in the US. Tokyo builds hundreds of thousands of new housing units every single year, while the US struggles to build any. This is entirely because of regulations. reply astrange 2 hours agorootparentFun fact: the US and Italy have about the same number of elevators, because it costs us about ten times more to build one. reply scythe 9 hours agorootparentprev>internationally recognized building safety codes I mean, the \"International Building Code\" is a little bit like the \"World Series\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Building_Code >\"Calling it 'international' keeps it from being called the 'U.S. Building Code.'\" explains Bill Tangye, SBCCI Chief Executive Officer. reply greenthrow 9 hours agorootparentprevYour argument doesn't really make sense because the problem isn't lack of houses or apartments, there's plenty of places to put everyone. The problem is one of affordability. The costs of stuff that already exists and has existed for ages isn't really tied to the current cost to build, even if we buy the specious argument that all regulation raises costs and those costs are inevitably passed directly to tenants. reply bluGill 9 hours agorootparentsupply and eemand sets rents. You you rent perfecly good existing houses cheap in rural areas. Nobody wants to like there. There is no reason to think there is enourh room for everyone who wants to like in San Francisco, and statistics prove they heve not been building much. Mean while in other states we find areas of demand where housing is not expensive. Where I live you can rent one bedroom apartments for under $1000, mohe in won't be until spring as the building is still under construction. The owners are planning on starting the next building when this is done. That is what allosing building does. reply greenthrow 6 hours agorootparentThis is just factually not true. There is plenty of empty homes, apartments and condos to house everyone. There are many units kept empty rather than lower prices. It is a myth that supply and demand sets prices. reply Schiendelman 5 hours agorootparentThis comment makes me really sad; it's someone who wants to help but ends up hurting. reply wiml 9 hours agorootparentprevSupply, demand, and cartels like Realpage. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentCartel's can't just magically set prices. They can withhold supply, and that might have an effect on market prices. reply astrange 8 hours agorootparentYou can't pay the mortgage on a place you're not renting out though, so they mostly can't withhold supply. It applies more to things like retired people living by themselves in a 3 bedroom house. reply eru 8 hours agorootparentOK. Though if they can't withhold supply, how are those cartels supposed to hold up prices, then? reply astrange 2 hours agorootparentThey don't, it's not real. (Except that they can prevent construction of new units through zoning.) reply astrange 8 hours agorootparentprevReal estate has very distributed ownership and none of them are motivated to form a cartel. The only way they can maintain one is through legal force. Zoning laws are almost entirely that force; they're a way to establish a cartel of homeowners. reply loeg 10 hours agorootparentprevSetbacks, parking minimums and floor area ratios have nothing to do with safety. Community reviews have absolutely nothing to do with safety. reply sokoloff 9 hours agorootparentSide setbacks absolutely have an effect on fire safety (a greater distance gives less propensity to ignite the neighboring building and provides access with which to fight the original structure fire). Front setbacks and lot area coverage ratios have a more minor version of this same effect from fires across the street. It takes a pretty good sized fire to ignite the building across a street, but as density increases and more of a lot's area is able to covered with structures, the chances to get a pretty good sized fire going do increase. reply ajmurmann 7 hours agorootparent> Side setbacks absolutely have an effect on fire safety Sure, but is the benefit worth the cost? Manhattan and denser European cities without those haven't burned down since we fireproofed building materials reply Schiendelman 5 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet other areas let buildings be physically against each other if they're built not to spread fire. Just let everyone do that. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentprevYa. My setback is 3 feet, definitely just a margin for fire safety. I wanted to put an awning in but couldn't because it would be too close to the fence of my property boundary (I live in a town home that abuses the 3 foot setback to maximize living space). reply fires10 8 hours agorootparentI have minimum lot size of 5 acres. Can't see the wisdom in that one. I also have a minimum square footage size. $20,000 impact fee just to build a house and I receive no utilities or city/ county services. reply Spivak 7 hours agorootparentI wish more than anything we could legislate the fee structures backwards. If the government wants an environmental impact study then the government is footing the bill for it. Putting it on the builder is stupid and just a way of hiding the budget item in other people's wallets. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentOk, the government will fund your environmental impact study so you can build, but...oh...given their budget they will have it done sometime in 2100. reply gamepsys 10 hours agorootparentprev> Community review Any feedback brought up in a community review is on official record. I have witnessed safety concerns being brought up in community review multiple times that caused changes to the building plan. In one situation it was a very serious concern about blocking fire truck access to an elementary school. reply bluGill 9 hours agorootparentwhy didn't the code catch that? reply gamepsys 9 hours agorootparentThe code doesn't catch anything. People catch violations of the code. Community review is a place people can point out code violations. It's actually extremely embarrassing when this happens to a developer. Buildings get built with infractions all the time. With the MFH buildings it's actually a point of law to see who gets stuck with the liability -- the person that built it or the person that bought it. reply jjulius 10 hours agorootparentprevCareful with those absolutes. reply xvedejas 3 hours agorootparentprevFrom what I've seen of environmental review laws, they mostly just have to do with noise and construction nuisance. Whereas community review is mostly about aesthetics. I don't think these are the tools designed for safety. reply adaml_623 9 hours agorootparentprevDouble stair Vs single stair is totally a safety issue reply alistairSH 9 hours agorootparentOne that much of Europe has mitigated somehow. reply quickthrower2 8 hours agorootparentIt is all about the scenario where you die in a single stair where the second stair would have saved you being probably non existent in c21. Especially as you will have fire doors. I reckon single is safer: no decision to make as you exit. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentprevBy building their buildings out of brick rather than wood. Though its probably overkill here in the states and canada. reply ksplicer 7 hours agorootparentEven our wood has so much fire safety chemicals baked in now that it's not nearly as flammable as it used to be. The safety standards should be reevaluated. Plus, I'm sure that there are some developers who would happily build the whole MFH out of concrete if it lets them only use a single stair. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentConcrete construction is expensive in the states, although I'm not sure why. 4+1s are common here in Seattle: first story is concrete and commercial, 4 stories on top of that are wooden (we also have the more liberal stair requirements, so I'm not sure what is really going on). Concrete construction is the common way to build in China (and anywhere in Asia sans Japan), but the techniques they use require a bit of overbuilding and limit their towers to around 34 or so stories. Still, they have two stair cases side by side in those buildings (but I guess given the height, they need them by Chinese fire code standards). reply shiroiuma 3 hours agorootparent>Concrete construction is the common way to build in China (and anywhere in Asia sans Japan) Concrete-reinforced steel is absolutely common here in Japan. Wood is used for single-family homes, though, but anything larger is generally concrete+steel. >but the techniques they use require a bit of overbuilding and limit their towers to around 34 or so stories. Modern condo towers around me here in Tokyo are frequently 50 stories AFAICT. And that's with extremely strict building codes for earthquake protection. I can't tell you about the stairs though, as I don't live in one. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentprevYou already have shanty towns with all the regulation. Making housing cheaper also means making higher quality housing cheaper. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentWe don't really have shanty towns in the states. We definitely don't have a Kowloon Walled City, which is an example of what can happen when no regulations are involved (and somewhat remarkably not burn down and kind of thrive even if still a slum). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kowloon_Walled_City reply eru 8 hours agorootparent> We don't really have shanty towns in the states. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tent_cities_in_the_Uni... reply seanmcdirmid 5 hours agorootparentTent cities != shanty towns. Shanty towns are like semi-permanent buildings, tents are just...tents you buy at REI and then set up at the park with your stuff. We had one nearby my house at the Seattle Ballard commons that lasted during COVID (and is gone now). I wouldn't have called it a shanty town like I saw in the Philippines. reply sroussey 3 hours agorootparentGo to skid row in LA. Going on 50 years or more. reply kspacewalk2 7 hours agorootparentprevIf only we can have something between a McMansion filled North American suburb and Kowloon Walled City. reply seanmcdirmid 4 hours agorootparentHong Kong is super dense and super expensive, Shanghai is similar, but at Mainland Chinese prices. I'm all for density, but anyone who thinks that density alone solves affordability issues simply hasn't travel enough. reply eru 4 hours agorootparentDensity is a way to deal with expensive housing. Not a cause of it. reply ajmurmann 7 hours agorootparentprevMaybe it's OK if some housing is less perfect and closer to ashanty town. I'd rather live in a shanty town than a cardboard box under the freeway. If nobody wants to live in the \"shanty town\" nobody will move in and no investor will want to build another one. I sometimes think that the provocative way of putting all this is that we need more slum lords. They filled a need. reply hackerlight 4 hours agorootparentprevPhysical safety (structural integrity and fire safety), noise transmission and ventilation. I think regulations around these 3 aspects can help more than they hurt. Beyond these items, I would be skeptical. reply anon291 9 hours agorootparentprev> If we take deregulation and cheap housing to the extreme we end up with shanty towns. That's possible, but, considering that all the most expensive places in this country were developed in the very way this article is advocating, I'm going to label it as improbable. Many amongst my friends and family think I'm a bit crazy living in the inner city, but the truth is my equity has skyrocketed, and will continue to do so. Urban dwellings are in high demand. Given that many of these same urban dwellings are illegal to construct now / prohibitively expensive, we've handicapped the ability of the market to meet demand. reply gamepsys 9 hours agorootparentI use to look at buying a 60+ year old condo/coop on the west coast, until I looked at the earthquake statistics and safety standards of brick multistory buildings. Now I know why the newer steel buildings cost 2-6x the old brick buildings in the same neighborhood. reply Aeolun 8 hours agorootparentI’m doubtful they actually cost more to construct? reply twiddling 14 hours agoparentprevDon't forget about street widths being determined by the ability to turn around fire equipment. reply bombcar 12 hours agorootparentIf it makes you feel any better the oldest streets around here are wider than newer ones, because they had to be able to turn a wagon with a team of horses. reply seanmcdirmid 8 hours agorootparentThat sounds like what they did in Salt Lake City. reply elliotto 10 hours agorootparentprevHaving streets unable to be accessible by fire response vehicles doesn't seem like a good idea.

This is a really simple fix that the rest of the world does better. reply beejiu 10 hours agorootparentprevCopy paste from Europe, where they are about half the size? reply neuronexmachina 10 hours agorootparentSome possible reasons for why American fire trucks tend to be larger: * more frequently sent to rural homes, where there might not be an available hydrant, so they need to transport all the water they're likely to need * same for wildfires * American homes more likely to be wood+drywall reply akavi 9 hours agorootparentI would simply have small firetrucks in urban areas, and large fire trucks in rural areas. reply sokoloff 9 hours agorootparentprevWhy \"wood+drywall\" rather than just \"wood\"? Drywall is non-combustible and used as the main component in many fire-rated wall assemblies. reply kspacewalk2 7 hours agorootparentprevEurope has wildfires and rural areas. How will a large fire truck help you when a wood house is burning? Being grotesquely large doesn't mean they put the fire out faster. reply aga98mtl 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd yet, European cities exist and are fine without wide streets. reply eru 9 hours agorootparentKeep in mind that Europeans tend to build with stone / bricks, and Americans tend to build with wood. Lots of safety regulations stem from that divide. Wood is a bit more flammable. (I'm not saying the difference in safety regulations still make sense today. I'm talking about one of the historical origins of the divide.) reply jenadine 3 hours agorootparentIn the north of Europe it is mostly wood reply eru 3 hours agorootparentHouses are still less likely to be build from wood than in the US. reply actionfromafar 10 hours agorootparentprevHm.. couldn't a fire engine be driven in reverse? It could have an emergency driver's wheel in the back. I have seen crane trucks driven with a joystick from outside the vehicle, so it doesn't seem impossible. reply alistairSH 9 hours agorootparentOr it could just be smaller like in the rest of the world. reply keenmaster 10 hours agorootparentprevWe can make them turn 360 degrees like the electric G-Wagon. If upgrading the fleet of firefighting trucks to do so costs less than the value brought by tighter spacing of homes, it’s worth it. reply eru 8 hours agorootparentWell, you can learn from other parts of the world, instead of coming up with solutions from scratch. (But yes, if nothing else your solution would probably work.) If you time your upgrade to the fire engines with when you naturally would want to renew them anyway, then it doesn't really cost much extra. reply m463 5 hours agorootparentprevlooks like building heights haven't been held back... reply hammock 7 hours agoparentprevHow is double stair MFH overzealous? I can’t control if my neighbor blocks the stairwell with a couch that gets stuck while he’s moving in and now I have no egress if my other neighbor starts a fire.

But I don’t want. reply kspacewalk2 7 hours agorootparentA couch and a fire and that couch can't be pushed over or jumped over... That's quite a contrived scenario. I suspect that most of the improvements in the fire safety record of apartment buildings have to do with other factors like materials used, fireproof stair doors, etc etc. The reason I think the two stairs don't do much is that first world countries exist outside North America, they don't have this rule, and their fire safety is just as good or better than ours. Same reason I'm extremely skeptical that our fire trucks need to be so grotesquely large, despite what the fire departments claim. If there were no countries with a good fire safety record outside North America, like sure, okay, maybe. But they're just as good or better at fighting fires in Europe, and manage to go this with human sized trucks that don't require extremely wide streets, wide turn radiuses, and aren't nearly as deadly for pedestrians as a result.

I was born, raised and lived most of my life in Denver, CO. Now, I live in France in a 'single-stair multifamily'. Growing up I mostly lived in single family homes, but in college my dad moved into a townhouse and I lived with him for a couple years. Before moving to France, my wife and I lived in single family homes and a '5-over-1' apartment. Now, we live on the 7th floor, end-unit of an apartment building. It's a 'single-stair multifamily,' 'floor-through' apartment (thankfully with an elevator). Meaning our apartment a large balcony one one side and windows on three sides. The only side without a window leads to the stairwell. Every room has a window, even the bathroom and toilet (often separated in France). Without a doubt, this place is one of the best types of housing I've ever occupied. In the summer we can open up windows on either side of the apartment and get a fantastic breeze. The concrete structure does a great job regulating the temperature for most of the year. We get sunlight in the morning and evening. I hate yardwork and there's none to do. No sidewalks to shovel snow from either. I also experience neighborliness on par with most single family homes. Very similar to my dad's townhouse actually (probably not by coincidence if you think about the incentive structures). We have a 5 year old son and we don't miss having a yard. There are parks nearby with playgrounds and paths where he can safely ride his bike without worrying about any cars. Admittedly, I do miss having barbecues in the backyard. I also miss having a garage to use as a workshop. The 5-over-1, on the other hand, was easily the worst type of housing I've occupied. Poor lighting, anonymous, ugly corridors. No sense of neighborliness. Poorly maintained and constructed. Nowhere near a good park without walking along a nasty arterial surface street. I frequently ask myself, 'why can't we have this in the States?!' and now I know why. Building codes, zoning and city planners strike again. reply SkeuomorphicBee 15 hours agoprevLooking from the outside I would guess this is one of the big reasons for the \"missing middle\" [1] (lack of medium-density housing) in most North American cities. It is simply not economically feasible to build a small to medium size multi-unit building if you need to include two stairwells, so all buildings are either single family houses or huge mega projects. In my country the simple and cheap four-story walk-up condo building (with a single stair and no elevator) is the bread and butter medium density housing for the working class. You either have two or four units per floor, all opening to the stairwell with almost no space lost in corridors, it is simple and efficient. Alternatively for higher density there are higher versions with typically up to 12 floors with one or two elevators but still only one stairwell, so keeping the same efficiency.

Fire compromising the structure of a building, or the structure itself burning is almost never the cause of death or injury. The primary killer in structure fires is hydrogen cyanide gas. Wood does emit hydrogen cyanide but the primary source is synthetic materials like upholstered furniture, wall and floor coverings, cabinetry, and other personal belongings. If you have two houses, one made of gypsum-covered 2x4 walls and the other made of stone and steel and a faulty space heater ignites a sofa or some polyester curtains, the buildings are equally lethal. The hydrogen cyanide will have killed you long before the fire burned through the drywall. Non-flammable walls don't even necessarily slow a fire's spread if synthetic materials are involved. The high heat of by their combustion and their dirty combustion causes flashover which ignites all flammable materials in a given space. I have been a volunteer firefighter for almost 20 years. I have experienced too many fatalities but none of them have ever burned to death. All victims have been dead due to asphyxiation (CO/CO2) or cyanide poisoning. The differences in death rates aren't as stark as the author contends (for example 0.2 deaths per fire in Great Britain, 0.3 in the US) and my gut tells me the main differentiation between the US and European deaths is the smaller, more compartmentalized nature of European dwellings (which limits the spread of smoke) coupled with their greater level of urbanization which leads to faster emergency services response (the faster a fire is knocked down the less gas it produces). Open floorplans kill. All of that being said, wooden construction does cause more firefighter deaths-- especially if engineered wood is used. But by the time the floor of a house has been weakened enough by a basement fire to fail and kill a firefighter, all of the occupants are already dead. reply steveBK123 10 hours agorootparentWhat are your thoughts on sprinklers in these types of situations?

In principle, each apartment in Grenfell should have been able to burn out completely while the neighbouring units were untouched, so there was no need for a second stair as any evacuation would have been limited to units adjacent rather than the entire population. What actually happened is that years of neglect had seen firebreaks and bulkheads repeatedly compromised and then a load of flammable cladding added to the outside, because the building industry is basically rotten.

Either the subsidiary shares in the reputation, but then also passes on damages to the reputation. Or it ain't. The same is true for legal liability: if the parent company is legally liable for the subsidiaries debts, then the subsidiary can (all else being equal) borrow cheaper. If that chain is severed, the subsidiary borrows only as cheaply as a stand-alone small company, or perhaps even worse, because severing that liability also serves as a signal to potential creditors to better watch out for shenanigans.

One notable requirement of single-stair buildings where they are legal in the US, is that 1. the height is generally determined by the height of the fire ladders available, providing a second means of egress 2. the single stair requirement usually only applies to buildings that have a low maximum units per floor. In Seattle where they are legal, this is four units. At four units a floor, your front door directly opens feet away from the stairwell, and having a second staircase a sufficient distance away would be hard to fit in the floor plan. reply nineplay 15 hours agorootparent> 1. the height is generally determined by the height of the fire ladders available, providing a second means of egress This is an interesting requirement and makes me wonder if some of the need for two staircases comes from the proximity - or lack thereof - to fire services. I'd be sitting in a burning home for a long time if I had to wait for a fire ladder. reply bobthepanda 11 hours agorootparentA lot of the requirements make sense in bigger buildings. It's not easy to evacuate a large office building taking up a city block using only ladders. And some of it is reactive; for example, there is a distance separation requirement for stairwells, because during 9/11 the three North Tower stairwells were only 70 feet apart and enclosed only with gypsum, so they were all severed on impact, dooming the people above the impact zone. But none of this is really relevant for a building with six floors and 24 units total. The American city topology is basically office towers surrounded by single family homes; in the midcentury we demolished a lot of the in-between building stock, which is now referred to by urbanists as the \"missing middle\".

And we are sitting on a giant ball of matter, so making more bricks or glass is easy. (Glass can be recycled, but it's not really worth it.) You are right that wood captures carbon. But you have to think about the opportunity costs: the same land that you use to slowly grow your wood could be used to eg run wind turbines or solar panels to replace fossil fuels. (You could also stick a nuclear power plant on that land to replace even more fossil fuels. But on the margin, nuclear isn't really limited by the available land but by red tape and permissions. So adding a bit more land won't make the nuclear industry produce more energy.) You'd have to run the numbers, it's not obvious to me which effect dominates. Probably also depends on how well wood grows in your climate, and how sunny and windy it is. And what else you could grow on that land. Speculation: I suspect that emissions during construction will be relatively small fry, compared to the impact of density. Eg re-inforced concrete allows denser living (by building taller than wood, and by allowing single-stairs to be still firesafe, etc), and density tends to lower per capita CO2.

British Columbia's government has mentioned they're looking into this and I hope we see an end to the mandated two staircases. People consistently say they want more two and three bedroom apartments.

What I really hope happens is that ownership of multifamily real estate becomes much more fragmented. Imagine multifamily housing where each lot is the same as a single family lot. You can have varied types right next to each other (one building could house several seniors in small apartments, another could house several young people in smaller apartments, another could be the owner in a two floor \"house\" on the top to floors with rentals below, another could be a building comprised of entire floor flats that are each owner-occupied). They can be redeveloped so much more easily or repurposed. When an entire block is a huge multifamily building, it's pretty much impossible to change anything about it. But, we really need to also change how we finance these buildings. A big reason everything is the same these days is because the finance system underwrites them. The system is there for these other types of smaller buildings. reply baq 16 hours agoprevEuropean here.

I live in a major city and wildfires have burned homes a few miles from me. Residential areas are vast and fire departments are few. I'm also not sure how you can say few US cities are in earthquake zones - maybe if you squint at the numbers, but most if not all of the west coast, Alaska, and Hawaii are in earthquake zones.

I would also concede to the previous commenter, that citizens of different countries in Europe have (in many aspects) larger cultural differences than citizens of different states in the US (and language is a huge factor), but there are still many commonalities as well. reply alwa 14 hours agorootparentprevOf course, as you allude, the US is a large and diverse country too, where those features may or may not apply in a given locality. I suspect, though, that on both continents, when we’re talking about these problems with the dual staircase requirement in this context, we’re talking mainly about relatively high-density developments in space-constrained urban settings. If, as the article claims, we’ve arrived at comparable fire fatality rates under the two policy regimes, it does seem like their prevailing standards neatly capture a tradeoff: it seems like you can add safety either by socializing a fire response infrastructure capable of quicker response, or you can privatize that extra margin of safety by imposing these second staircase costs on individual developments. I’d be curious how the total costs add up, I’m almost inclined to donate to the guy’s nonprofit just to get the answer to that. I’d be curious how these changes would affect the economics of apartment blocks on huge greenfield suburban tracts, where parking requirements rather than staircase requirements seem to be the limiting factor space-wise. I’m thinking of the kind where space is cheap enough that they do surface lots rather than building parking decks into the structure. It seems like they tack exterior staircases on the edges of the building at not too much extra cost in those situations, but I suppose the floor plan implications must still come to bear. reply amluto 10 hours agorootparentprev> -- Frequency of wildfires. They are not uncommon in my southwest corner, so fire safety is taken very seriously There is finally progress on building codes for wildfire safety (called “WUI” codes). It still has missing bits. For example, try to find a standard for a building air intake in an area subject to wildfires. reply elzbardico 10 hours agorootparentprevBecause of the European Union there's a lot more of common standards and regulations concerning things like buildings between European Countries than there are between American States. Also, a lot more stuff is codified by law or treaties instead of by business and trade associations. So, on this matter, it makes a lot of sense of speaking about the European experience. reply baq 14 hours agorootparentprevThe point was that Europe has all of these but no double staircases. Don’t want to comment on missing emergency services in densely built areas but hope it isn’t the case it’s so bad you need an extra flight of stairs. reply nadermx 16 hours agoparentprevThe US has some very interesting requirements when building.

Which basically assures all buildings have to be designed for car centric life. reply andix 15 hours agorootparentIt's the same for many European cities and towns. Many cities started to reduce it down to 0.5 parking spaces per flat or less, because many of those parking spaces tend to be empty in bigger cities. And just increase prices for housing. reply ghaff 15 hours agorootparentI was just visiting a European friend for a couple weeks. They have a car but parking was a sufficient drama that they took the Uber equivalent within the city most of the time. Busses but minimal metro. reply andix 14 hours agorootparentI honestly don't see the drama in most European cities, it's not like in NYC. Street parking is very limited in bigger cities, so you might need to park in expensive parking garages. Or use other methods of travel. Only in areas with a lot of old houses (built before cars were a thing) there might be a lack of garages. Owning/driving a car is generally very expensive in many European countries. Not like in the US where wages are rather high, but cars and gas extremely cheap, because there is no substantial tax on them. Edit: this might not apply to southern Europe. In some southern European cities it's impossible to go by car. That's why everyone drives a scooter. reply rootusrootus 10 hours agorootparentprevThe requirement is because if you don't mandate a minimum amount of parking, developers won't create it. Then the neighbors of your fancy new building can no longer find parking near their own home because the new building tenants take it. So they justifiably get angry and start voting in politicians that will enforce minimum capacity for new development. reply nadermx 5 hours agorootparentYour conclusion seems wrong in pratice.

I truly do not understand how US people are ok with this. 2. The law says that you can't make hard to refuse cookies, yet many US-based sites I visit have shady, shady practices, for example many you have to click a button to see all the sliders for individual cookies, and when you click that button, it switches the orders of the buttons, so that the button you just clicked become \"accept all\", and the previous \"accept all\" button becomes \"save current settings\". Thus if you double click/tap by accident you accept all. 3. The sites that most often piss me off with shady cookie banner that tries its hardest to force you to opt-in to tracking, are ones that use a company called \"Admiral\", that according to LinkedIn is from Florida. https://www.linkedin.com/company/getadmiral/ reply rootusrootus 10 hours agorootparent> A ton of Health related websites in US refuse to work in Europe, because they are NOT willing to let you visit without sensitive data being grabbed with cookies.

OK, unintended consequences of legislation. But those cookie banners are not mandated, exactly. They don't need to be there. It's the companies deciding to do it that way, so they can keep gobbling data. It's like if the building companies implemented the 2nd staircase, but only so they could measure who is going up and down it. Not for saving lives. If they were opt in, or unnecessary tracking wasn't implemented in the first place, then the banners could be elegant or gone. But I do agree that the legislation (especially the ultra focus on cookies specifically) was... blinkered & short sighted. reply crazygringo 15 hours agorootparentNo, that's entirely Europe. The outcome of the legislation was easy for anyone to see. As you say, it was blinkered and short-sighted. And I still have to click 20 popups away on mobile every day. If only a few websites had the banner, then maybe I'd blame those websites. But when they virtually all do, I blame the law. reply cycomanic 14 hours agorootparentActually the legislation is fine, much better than before. It's the enforcement that's lacking. I'd say >90% of cookie banners break the law. It's just that enforcement is only slowly catching up.

I mean it's a pretty obvious giveaway that: 1. they don't have the resources to build their own technology and probably never will 2. even if they did have, the best they could do is come up with something very similar to OpenAI's GPT, i.e. a (somewhat) generic AI model. This means that OpenAI can also easily compete with them. All these companies are doing (if anything) is that they test the market for OpenAI (or Google, MS) for free. reply ignoramous 7 hours agorootparentThe flaw in your assumption is that perfect tech or tech powerhouses win. I mean, sure when they do, they win big; but the endgame for b2b SaaS is mostly M&A, powered by sales, which is mostly down to c-suite relationships and perception of being one among the market leaders (\"nobody ever got fired for buying IBM\").

For a company doing this with the intent to sell it as a capability... seems risky. reply yieldcrv 5 hours agorootparentprevDid you know that removing the tag from a mattress is illegal too? according to the tag. reply nextworddev 8 hours agoparentprevAnd even this analysis is optimistic as it doesn’t factor in the $$$$ it costs to hire a data scientist to fine tune the models. Just use off the shelf models with RAG until you really need custom models reply siliconc0w 6 hours agoparentprevI'm curious if you can actually get better than 3.5 though considering how meh it is at most applications. I'd be nice to know whether I could actually get a better model without the effort of trying this. reply behnamoh 10 hours agoprevI checked his app, it's https://www.wanderer.space/, no TOS, no privacy policy, no up front pricing, no mention of AI, nothing. This is as shady as it could get. Not to mention their approach with GPT-4 is good if you want a model to __pretend__ like it's as smart as GPT-4, but when push comes to shove, it'll become apparent that it's an inferior model. reply codetrotter 10 hours agoparent> when push comes to shove, it'll become apparent that it's an inferior model. That seems par for the course. Prompt GPT-4 to not reveal the prompt you gave it to user and it will work, until it doesn’t. Ask GPT-4 to do fancy maths, and it’ll give you something that looks reasonable at a glance but quickly turns out to be completely incorrect. Ask GPT-4 to implement a Sudoku Solver in Rust. It’ll seem like the code it gives you is on the right path. But it’s not. reply doix 7 hours agorootparentI'm surprised it can't do the last one. Sudoku solvers are basically on the same path as hello world. Everyone writes one when learning a language. There must be thousands of repos and guides/tutorials on how to write one (even in rust). I'd expect ChatGPT to just spit out something verbatim. reply tylervigen 10 hours agoparentprevIt does mention AI, at least for me the slash page says \"Wanderer is an AI-powered tool.\" But hard agree on the lack of privacy policy, especially since it asks for a LinkedIn. reply zckly 7 hours agoparentprevHey, maker here! Genuinely appreciate you sharing this feedback. You're 100% correct - it's not a good look that an app takes in such detailed PII and doesn't have a clearly outlined TOS/privacy policy. Pricing should be more transparent as well - the app is currently free. As for the approach, I think it works fairly well for the career recommendations problem space given its limited and defined scope (there are a finite number of careers out there). However, for a task that requires more divergent thinking (open-ended chat, idea generation), this approach would definitely fall short of what GPT-4 could do reply erulabs 9 hours agoparentprevI mean, virtually every business that doesn't have a team of lawyers on staff (read: everyone outside the F1000) just uses a stock and mostly meaningless \"we can do anything and we promise nothing, sorry-not-sorry\" TOS and privacy policy anyways. I wouldn't really hold that against a solo-founder business as something shady -- just a sign of a small company. reply Zetobal 9 hours agoparentprevJust look at the careers in their career chart and you know it's influencer shovelware. It's also against OpenAIs ToS. Not that I care but I wouldn't brag about it. reply brigadier132 9 hours agoparentprevI'm trying to understand, what's shady about that? reply tylervigen 10 hours agoprevEthics and restrictive terms aside, it doesn't seem like GPT 4 was necessary for what the poster did. How much worse or more difficult would it have been to use Mixtral or 3.5 to generate the first 100 good prompt-response pairs and then manually tweak them as the poster did? reply thrwayaistartup 10 hours agoparentOr just... write 100 good prompt-repsonse pairs yourself. 2024 will be the year of synthetic data. 2025 will be the year of \"you know you can use your own brain and type out 100 datapoints faster and cheaper than generating and filtering assloads of synthetic data, right?\" Maybe we can even skip 2024 :) reply sp332 10 hours agorootparentDatabricks had their employees write up 15,000 of them. https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-... reply icyfox 9 hours agorootparentFavorite part of this piece: > We were initially skeptical whether we would get to 10,000 results. But with nightly leaderboard gamification, we managed to break 15,000 results within a week. Out of fear of eating into our productivity, we closed the contest. I've hosted a few of these corporate data labeling events. If sufficiently gamified / there's a good enough UX, they can be surprisingly engaging. It helps a lot if you have a large employee base though. Distributing results over 5000 employees is exponentially easier than even 50 - in practicality, even larger than the orders of magnitude. reply code_runner 9 hours agorootparentprevI’ve worked at plenty of places where we did a ton of labeling by hand. People concerned with data quality from LLMs should really see the inconsistencies we came up with! reply ThrowawayTestr 9 hours agorootparentprevAnybody have this downloaded and can paste a few examples? reply sp332 8 hours agorootparentYou can browse them here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-... reply schreiaj 8 hours agorootparentprevYes and no, for text type stuff? Yes you're right. But I think in the vision space synthetic data will remain useful for a lot of things. I'm currently working on building a pipeline for personal projects to go from CAD models of environment to segmented training data. So far it looks almost as useful as real world data at a fraction of the cost of manual labeling. reply atleta 8 hours agoparentprevWell, it seems that initially started with GPT4 but his costs were becoming high so he had to do something and had to do it quickly. Technically he could have written a few hundred responses himself while the site was still using GPT4 using the prompts from the users but that could have been slow (expensive)/boring, etc. reply cjbprime 10 hours agoparentprevUsing 3.5 seems like it would have been okay (technically but not legally given OpenAI ToS), but Mixtral is already somewhere around that level, so it's not achieving a goal of improving towards GPT-4 level responses without having to write those yourself, which seems to have been the goal OP wanted to get to. I've heard that training e.g. Mixtral on Mixtral's own outputs is a really bad idea, don't know full details. reply gumballindie 10 hours agoparentprevI am sorry what ethics? Openai is built on stolen content and your worry is people using openai’s output is the unethical issue? Whoa. reply dchuk 9 hours agoprevI’m building a side project app (that hopefully becomes a revenue generating SaaS, stay tuned) that will leverage AI to summarize lots of content at scale. My plan is to just use OpenAI for now for speed to launch, but I have to imagine it will be way more economical and likely technically feasible to migrate to some self hosted LLM option later on. Anyone else done this? Any tips/tricks? reply icyfox 9 hours agoparentI've done some research involving parameterized summarization recently. GPT-4 does a really good (like, pretty outstanding) job in following the tone and density of a few one-shot example inputs. It's a lot more difficult to encourage the OSS models to do the same so you're going to have to experiment with a lot of different techniques to get it to what you want. In the worse case it could actually require some serious R&D investment to achieve the same results as an API out of the box. All that to say, my general philosophy is to worry about vendor costs / scale once you start approaching an adoption threshold where it matters. If the core idea doesn't have legs there's no point wasting time in developing your own summarization layer. reply cyanydeez 9 hours agoparentprevassume OpenAI's business model is the same as Ubers and you're not getting the full price for the current offerings, and it'll quadruple in costs. Then ask if your product will survive that.

I'm not sure where that's headed legally but it's surprisingly common. reply thrwayaistartup 10 hours agorootparentThe academic work is pretty safe as long as it isn't productized. The open models have a prime facie case to stand on. Using output is okay if you aren't directly competing with openai, even according to their tos. > (e) use Output (as defined below) to develop any artificial intelligence models that compete with our products and services. However, you can use Output to (i) develop artificial intelligence models primarily intended to categorize, classify, or organize data (e.g., embeddings or classifiers), as long as such models are not distributed or made commercially available to third parties and (ii) fine tune models provided as part of our Services reply brucethemoose2 7 hours agorootparentBut then those models are possibly used downstream, EG for Mistral's \"medium\" API model (and many other startups). I guess if its behind an API and no one discloses the training data, OpenAI can't prove anything? Even obvious GPTisms could ostensibly be from internet data. reply dietr1ch 10 hours agoparentprevIsn't it awkward because that's only plagiarism if all of the LLMs around are? reply huac 9 hours agoparentprevMy interpretation is that they prohibit using distilled models to compete against OpenAI, i.e. to offer a foundation model as a service. This particular app is a product not a foundation model so seems pretty clearly fine to me. Of course, this restriction is commonly ignored (eg 'open source' inference server companies offering distilled models) and who knows what applied products OpenAI will eventually build. reply behnamoh 10 hours agoparentprevMy question also, but even Google Gemini Pro does it. When announced, it'd say it was made by OpenAI :) reply sva_ 10 hours agorootparentMight've been a small identity crisis as well. reply paxys 9 hours agoparentprevProbably, but it's not like OpenAI has the standing to sue anyone for TOS violations.

New York Times also didn't consent to being used for the training of OpenAI models reply thrwayaistartup 10 hours agorootparentAnd NYT is suing OAI/MS. Two wrongs don't make a right... or maybe they do, but that doesn't immunize you from legal fees or a botched exit :) reply albert180 10 hours agorootparentIf NYT wins that will sink probably every LLM model out there reply Dr_Birdbrain 8 hours agorootparentNah, if it ever starts to look like NYT might win, MSFT will just do a hostile takeover. Market cap of NYTimes is 8B, OpenAI is 80B, MSFT is 2.7T, you do the math. reply thrwayaistartup 10 hours agorootparentprev...I think you missed the point. OAI/MS can sue the author or at least cut off API access. If that happens, the fact that OAI is under fire from NYT doesn't somehow obviate the author's need to cover some massive legal bills for the foreseeable future. The NYT case could take years. In the meantime OAI could choose to go after ToS violators. The legal system can accommodate more than one unresolved court case at a time. We don't like put a semaphore on related cases or anything like that. (Or, sometimes we do, but guess who you need to hire for many many billable hours to make that happen in your case?). So, the legal system can accommodate the NYT case against OAI and an OAI case against the author. The operative question is: can the author's pocketbook also accommodate? (Or, more to the point, can the author accommodate losing access to gpt4? What happens when he wants to launch a new feature or pivot to a new product?) reply albert180 10 hours agorootparentThen they cut off the API Process and I just make a new account. Who cares? I doubt they would sue, because the Risk of Loosing would give a precedent. It's much easier and cheaper to scare people away from doing this and writing mean letters. Those ToS would also probably be unenforceable in many countries outside the US beyond terminating an account reply thrwayaistartup 9 hours agorootparentI agree on both points. Was just engaging with the legal aspect because that's what this thread was about.

I have two issues with those terms: 1. I think that eventually US courts will determine one of two things: that OpenAI et al are guilty of massive infringement, or that these sorts of restrictive terms aren't enforceable. The need that these companies are trying to treat with terms on output seems unlikely to work out in the end. But we'll see. 2. Even if the terms are enforcable, the human review step in the tweet seems like it's make OpenAI's threading-the-needle position here even more fucking difficult to be taken seriously by any jury or judge. However, enforcing the terms seems real damn hard in the case of small businesses... as long as you're not stupid enough to admit to violating them in a twitter thread, of course. I think the author is probably safe from legal action for now because I don't think OpenAI is particularly eager to test the enforcability of their terms. And even if they are, doing so in this case is super high risk and super low reward. Still, I wouldn't test it by openly admitting to ToS violation like this. At the very least seems like a good way to get cut off from OAI APIs. [1] https://openai.com/policies/business-terms reply ilaksh 10 hours agoparentNot sure they would bother suing.

Can you really argue that this niche app competes with OpenAI's products? Couldn't you make an argument that this only applies to products and services that directly compete with OpenAI, i.e. other LLM API's or a ChatGPT competitor such as a Claude or Bart? reply elicksaur 8 hours agorootparentThe person who created it is using it as a direct replacement to paying OpenAI. They probably won’t consider pursuing this small individual, but if a big enough company did it, they’d probably have a problem with that. reply maxlamb 8 hours agorootparentA direct replacement is still different than a “competing product” which implies is sold to customers.

    "originLink": "https://ergaster.org/posts/2024/01/18-escaping-surveillance-capitalism-at-scale/",
    "originBody": "Escaping surveillance capitalism, at scale Jan 18, 2024 • self-hosting Our relationship with computers and phones has changed. We used to rely on software installed locally on our computers, and are now shifting towards a model based on services and companion apps, sometimes with free tiers and subscriptions. Most services are provided by organisations, who collect and sometimes resell users’ information to third parties. This massive, indiscriminate, and corporate collection of personal data is called surveillance capitalism. While organisations can argue this data collection is necessary to provide their services, this comes with significant privacy implications. Self-hosting and paid subscriptions are common strategies to escape surveillance capitalism. But what guarantees do they really offer? What alternatives exist for the general public who wants to escape surveillance capitalism, and at what cost? Paid subscriptions are not enough When services have a free and a paid tier, it can be tempting to think that the provider is going to sell your data on the free tier but they’re going to be mindful of it on the paid tier. Paying a subscription to your provider can sound like a good idea to keep your data safe, and it sometimes is. But it’s not necessarily the case. As reported by The Verge, the mental health service provider BetterHelp shared customer’s email addresses, IP addresses, and health questionnaire information with third parties including Facebook and Snapchat, while promising it was private. Mental health is precisely the type of information that should remain private, making this move particularly appalling from BetterHelp. Self-hosting, but as a service One of the major enablers of surveillance capitalism is centralisation. In that sense, paid subscriptions don’t offer any guarantee that the provider will play fair game and keep your data private. Self-hosting is rather efficient at preventing surveillance capitalism, mostly because the data doesn’t live in a central repository but on the self-hoster’s infrastructure. In that sense, it doesn’t directly enable surveillance capitalism. It’s important here to make a distinction between private and public information though. Posts on federated social media platforms are not centralised, but they are public and can be scraped to be exploited. The threat we’re discussing in this article is a provider growing so big it can collect and exploit data that is not public, at a large scale. It should be noted that the vendor of the self-hosted solution could theoretically still gather information about the users by making its software send data to the mothership regardless of where it’s installed. To an extent, this can be acceptable as long as the user explicitly knows what data is sent, can opt-out, and that the minimum amount of anonymised data is sent for clearly defined purposes. This practice is known as telemetry. Open-source software allows any tech-savvy person to look up the code and check what is actually sent to the mothership. Proprietary software makes it much more difficult. But as we discussed earlier on this blog, self-hosting doesn’t scale well because it requires time and knowledge. There’s a workaround: using software that can be self-hosted, but buying it as a service. A real life example would be the Google Drive ethical alternative Nextcloud: several providers like Ionos offer hosted Nextcloud instances. This makes solutions like these accessible (and safe!) to a broader public. Using open-source licences means that the software can be audited, but it also allows anyone to take the code and offer it as service. This can lead to a race to the bottom in terms of cost and quality when the service providers are not playing fair game: they benefit from development work they didn’t invest resources in, all while not contributing financially or technically to the upstream project either. If the customers of such providers encounter problems, support is often minimal: in very budget-tight environments, losing a customer can be more profitable than investigating a significant problem. Such predatory methods harm the ecosystems in which they’re deployed: customers get bad experiences, and the upstream project gets little to no benefit. Similar behaviours have been observed in the Matrix ecosystem where integrators deployed open source products without contributing anything back. Ultimately, support contracts are an insurance for the service provider and for their customers. When the service provider pays for upstream’s support and reports an issue, the engineers who developed the product investigate the case, fix the problem, and make the fix permanent for everyone. This also allows the upstream to generate a bit of revenue, contributing to the project’s health, sustainability, and to the emergence of new exciting features. Nextcloud also allows users to sign up on third party providers directly from nextcloud.com. The sign-up feature makes it extremely easy for the user to choose a provider. Nextcloud’s Jos Poortvliet confirmed to me that it’s not a formal certification programme, but more of a group of companies Nextcloud trusts. Nextcloud doesn’t generate revenue from this programme, intentionally, since they’re not in the business of monetising private users. Certification programmes are usually very expensive to run and not necessarily profitable for vendors. Not trusting anyone When buying a hosted service from a provider, we enable a form of partial re-centralisation… which technically allows the provider to start selling the users’ data for profit. There’s a third option: making sure the data can only be read by its intended recipients, turning the servers into rather dumb pipes. This is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). It certainly sounds like a silver bullet! So why doesn’t every service provider implement it, to show their good faith? Because it has drawbacks. When using E2EE, the files are encrypted. Nobody apart from their owner and people who have been explicitly authorised by the owner can read them. This means neither the server software nor the technical administrator of the server can read them either. This is often what users expect, but this has consequences! The server becomes dumb Since the server can’t read the data, there are some legitimate operations it cannot perform anymore. A typical example is “deep” search, which is functionality where the server spends computing time to read and index all the files so it’s easy for the user to query them. When files are encrypted, indexing and search can only happen on the client. Those operations are quite expensive, and the clients don’t necessarily have the computing power, connectivity or storage required to do so. There are some new techniques such as homomorphic encryption that could eventually enable users to offload this computation to the server without the server learning anything about what it is actually doing but they are not yet ready for large-scale use. Having a dumb server also severely limits its ability to send automated reports or alerts based on specific workflows. In a sense, the server can’t “work” for the user anymore and becomes nothing more than a backup service. Data can become irrecoverable With E2EE, encryption and decryption keys are stored on the device only, which is a significant risk. Let’s assume you host your important documents exclusively on an E2EE service and your keys only exist on your phone. If your phone is broken or lost, your decryption keys are lost with it. There are three workarounds to avoid losing the keys entirely: Generating a “paper key” (also called “recovery key”, “seed passphrase”, or even “paper wallet” in the context of cryptocurrencies) directly on the client, and giving the user the 12 to 15 words to write down or print somewhere. Derive the encryption key from the user’s password. This is the approach Firefox Sync is taking for example. Storing the encryption keys on the server-side, in a vault encrypted by a key derived from a passphrase. The passphrase must of course be long enough to make it difficult to break by the server administrator. The major inconvenient of these workarounds is that they require the user to either print/write a generated key and store them somewhere safe where they can recover it later, or remember a passphrase to access their en/decryption keys. If the user loses the generated key or can’t remember the passphrase, their data is lost and irrecoverable. The service provider cannot do anything about it because they can’t access the data. In other words: there’s no “forgot my password” link anymore. The reputational risk of not being able to help users who forgot their password is often unacceptable for service providers. Even Apple who positions itself as a company respectful of their users’ privacy doesn’t turn on E2EE by default, and understandably takes a lot of precautions before allowing users to turn on actual E2EE on their iCloud account. The “E” in E2EE doesn’t stand for “Everything” While E2EE is particularly good at preventing nosy folks from looking at files and messages themselves, it doesn’t mean everything is encrypted. In particular, metadata can be sent in clear text either because it’s necessary for the server to provide the service, or because the service providers can profit from it. Typically, WhatsApp is an E2EE messenger, but the provider still has access to metadata. WhatsApp also has a moderation feature that allows users to decrypt an E2EE message they were sent, and send it to Meta for moderation purposes. While moderation is a valid use case which doesn’t break encryption itself, it shows that the client could in theory decrypt the message and send it to the service provider behind the user’s back. This highlights that E2EE alone is also not enough: even if users don’t need to trust the service provider they need to be able to trust both the protocol and the client they rely on. This means the client necessarily needs to be open source and audited regularly by an independent third party. Beyond tech As we have seen, there are several strategies to help the general public trying to escape surveillance capitalism. Self-hosting is efficient but doesn’t scale well, paid instances of self-hostable software work generally well but are not a silver bullet, and E2EE is very useful to protect privacy but don’t provide a full guarantee either. Ultimately E2EE is a very libertarian approach to a societal issue, taking a “myself against the world” stance. It can be a valid stance, especially for minorities and in hostile contexts. But surveillance capitalism is not a technological problem. It is enabled by technology, but at the very core it is a societal problem. As Molly White said, “there are never purely technological solutions to societal problems”. To fight surveillance capitalism, we need E2EE, regulation, justice, and education. We need E2EE to prevent the collection from happening in the first place. We need proper regulation to define what is acceptable or not, which will ultimately define what is a viable business model and what is not. This means that the fines must make it prohibitively unprofitable to sell users’ data. We need justice and executive bodies to actually enforce the regulation. And we need education for the general public to understand the risks of surveillance capitalism.

I'm already all too familiar with the problems. I like what Umbrel[0] is doing. They're essentially expecting that just like computing was able to move from centralized mainframes to homes, servers are poised to make the same migration. I think they really need to solve redundancy, though. If I'm to self-host anything important on a home server, I need to know I'll have some way to use it even if my home server fails, especially if I'm not at home when it happens. I'd love to see some kind of system where I could partner up with other Umbrel users for backups/the ability to restore connectivity. If I knew that in an emergency, I could call my friend in town or my brother out of state and there was some procedure that would allow me to connect to an encrypted backup of what I'm needing, I would feel a lot better about taking responsibility for my own system.

I'm working on self-hosting my own \"personal cloud\" (NextCloud with a few other services), and I strongly debated just getting an Umbrel, but this is what kept me from doing so. Instead, I'm going the DIY route with two machines, one in my house and one at my parents', and we're each going to have data replicated across both machines and encrypted at rest. If Umbrel offered this out of the box, I would probably just use that to save me the time. reply Helmut10001 15 hours agorootparentDoing this for the last 7 years, too.

An example would be browser plug ins that \"click everything\". If an AI bot clicks on every ad and signs you up for every free service and fills a lot of forms with incorrect data the value of surveillance is much lower. The problem with this is Google in particular hates it. If they think you are using bots in this way they will ban you from all of their services. I have heard that.

I used to chase that level of connectivity until covid happened. I was working from home on am ADSL with 37mbps download, 10mbps upload. I didn't use much internet at home before 2023 so I always had the cheapest broadband plan. Then I started WFH and the same for my partner and I had a homelab. My ISP offered me 150mbps for just £3 more per month, and then I realised... I don't really need it? I was just fine with the same broadband plan from 2015. I changed my location a few times, taking my homelab with me, I moved cities and countries, I'm still using the same DDNS service and as long as my 80 and 443 ports are open, I can transfer anything at any time to and from my network. It's 2023 and I'm still using the cheapest plan my ISP offers, the same hardware since ~2018 and I'm just fine with that. I run k3s, a few docker services, network-wide adblocker, monitoring in grafana and many more etc. Everything works just fine. Don't fall into the meme that you need IBM or HP server class hardware and 5Gbps fibre to run a homelab. I used to have IBM 3650x with +200Gb of RAM that I sold and bought 3x RPi4.

I hope we'll eventually be able to use some of the key storage/backup solutions being developed mostly in the cryptocurrency sphere. Like, multiparty computation (MPC) is agnostic to the type of key being created, and some of the social recovery methods being tested could be applied to parts of the key.

If you rent from an actual data center, you pay for a ton of stuff you don't really need for personal backups. If your home internet goes out and you can't access your personal cloud for a bit, it's likely not a big deal, so you don't need the level of redundancy that a data center gives you. On the flip side, the premium you pay for professionally hosted storage is enormous compared to buying a hard drive. reply wmf 15 hours agorootparentIMO the solution is cheaper, crappier data centers. OVH and Hetzner are most of the way there but there's probably more savings possible. Local storage is free or cheap with VMs so I don't see that as a problem. reply RussianCow 13 hours agorootparentI priced this out somewhat recently, and the lowest price I could get renting a server with >=2TB of storage is $11/month using the OVH Eco line, and that's without ECC (which I consider to be non-negotiable), FS-level compression (IIRC you can't change file systems with OVH), or redundancy in case the server/disk fails. I'm currently working on a DIY setup with two nodes equipped with 8GB ECC memory, 2TB of storage (with Btrfs compression to get even more storage out of it), and considerably more processing power than the OVH servers. My total up front cost is going to be about $400, with an estimated $25/year in electricity. The most comparable OVH offering would cost $403 in the first year (with RAID but without a second node), so my DIY solution basically pays for itself after that, and I can upgrade the hardware anytime I want. Of course, there is an obvious argument to be made that my time is worth more than the cost savings, but I've been learning a lot so I instead consider it a free education. :) reply cabalamat 16 hours agoparentprev> I think they really need to solve redundancy They could offer a service that backs up your local Umbrel server to their central servers.

However, a key component of that societal problem is that most (99%+) do not care about surveillance to the degree that they would change their behavior. Almost all my friends who use social media are aware the apps spy on them. They all have an anecdote like they were talking about X with their friend and when they scrolled Instagram/Tiktok an ad for X showed up, and they all say (unprompted) that it's creepy. When I suggest to them that maybe they should stop using Instagram etc, or at the very least use it on the website, to prevent this, the reaction invariably an excuse to keep using it.

For data that doesn't need expensive computation, we can further decouple key owners from data storage. Users always own their data, they can choose which data services, storage, or key manager to use and they should all interoperate. This is already a pretty common pattern in the cloud, just the same business entity owns all three. You basically need legislation that says business entities must interoperate with different data storage or key providers. So you can subscribe to gmail from google and they store your data in Amazon or maybe EFF's data storage provider. You can then get fine-grained audit trail of how and when your data is accessed. We can then come up with standard rules like maybe your data is only accessible without your end-user credential (i.e your computer+password) for law enforcement or limited operational activities described by the provider and approved by you(or your delegate). reply 1vuio0pswjnm7 11 hours agoprev\"We used to rely on software installed locally on our computers, and are now shifting towards a model based on services and companion apps, sometimes with free tiers and subscriptions.\" Everything I rely on is local.

I always end up accessing the endpoints from a laptop instead of a phone because it's easier and more flexible. I find a UNIX-like OS I can modify, compile and control paired with full-size keyboard and display to be more versatile. I still use offline storage. When it comes to the prognostication of so-called \"tech\" bloggers/journalists, \"we\" is not me. There was a story yesterday on HN about a school that does not allow smartphones. It described a multi-day school trip where no phones could be brought. After a short time, the article suggested none of the students missed their phones. This is how I see \"services\" and \"companion apps\". After a relatively short time without, people would forget about them. Whereas I am not going to forget about a UNIX-like OS that I can control and jump on to some new trend where I cede control to someone else. I rely on being able to control the computers I own. Giving away control is not an appealing proposition. The people marketing these \"solutions\" are certainly not ceding away any control. Instead they are gaining it over other peoples' computers in spades. reply SushiHippie 16 hours agoprevMy 2cts about Nextcloud and why *I* think it's not viable as an alternative for the average user: I host my own nextcloud since a few years. I mostly use it as an alternative for google photos/icloud photos, basically backing up all the images from my smartphone. Hosting the instance is one thing, but setting up the automatic upload on your phone is another thing. The automatic photo upload feature in the official nextcloud app is most of the time broken and slow. And on iOS you need to keep the nextcloud app open and the screen unlocked, otherwise it won't upload. That's why I use FolderSync on Android, but I don't think the average user wouldn't want to set this up and might even misconfigure it, which could just delete all images. And Nextcloud itself is just very slow. With google photos you can just scroll through thousands of images and easily find the image you took 3 years ago. If i do this in nextcloud, I already had the following stuff happen: - Your browser freezes - The Nextcloud server (php-fpm in my case) OOMs (it used around 15-20G of RAM) (The OOMs also often happen when syncing with FolderSync.) I definitely wouldn't recommend it as a google photos alternative. I'm not complaining as I didn't pay a penny for nextcloud itself (only the cost for the dedicated server I rent). And I still use it, as there is no better alternative. But for the \"mass\" there is no convenient and comparable alternative to the \"surveillance capitalism\" services. Nextcloud is good enough for me, as its the only viabke option, but IMO it doesn't cut it for leaving the other services at scale. reply the_pwner224 16 hours agoparentI switched from Nextcloud to Syncthing a while ago. ST is a plain file syncing program, like Dropbox, but distributed P2P (you can have a server running it as an always-on node). I sync the Camera & Screenshots folder on my phone to my computer & server. If you have multiple phones add the folder on each phone. It's bidirectional so photos you take or files you add will show up on all devices. It works much better than Nextcloud, and admin/maintenance/setup are all much easier. For calendar & contacts sync I use Radicale. Syncthing with a regular shared folder + camera folder + screenshots folder combined with Radicale covers everything that I used Nextcloud for. However this is all on your devices, there's no web interface to access your files from other devices. reply undersuit 9 hours agorootparent>It's bidirectional so photos you take or files you add will show up on all devices.

These identifiers are necessarily given out to hundreds of unsophisticated and often trashy operations like supermarkets, car dealers, e-commerce retailers, and soon (sadly) app developers. Unlike the FAANGs of the world, these people have never heard of cryptography and don’t blink twice about selling Excel spreadsheets for a few extra pennies. But the need to share secrets with them is a technological problem — public key cryptography could serve these used cases without giving the counterparty something to leak. reply bradford 14 hours agorootparentI may have interpreted the problems addressed in the article differently. Certainly, privacy incidents can occur due to mishandling of sensitive information (i.e., secrets, identifiers). Addressing these are a no-brainer and something that technology can and should address. I interpret the article as addressing a second kind of privacy issue that isn't due to mishandling. Instead, it's part of the profit model for many major tech companies: advertising. In this case, the privacy issue isn't a mishandling, it's by design and explicitly disclosed in the Terms of Service.

There is literally no such thing as \"garbage data\" to data brokers. It's all just data, and all of it is valuable. That's why projects that claim to \"pollute\" your browsing history like RuinMyHistory, noiszy, adnauseam, and TrackMeNot are not only pointless but also dangerous. The data being collected about you will always be used against you, no matter if it is accurate or not. If your browser randomly browses to webpages that gets \"this person is a muslim\" or \"this person is gay\" added to your dossier it doesn't matter if it's true or not, when your next would-be employer or would-be landlord who hates muslims or gay people uses a data broker for \"background checking\" and sees that, you're not getting the job/apartment. They won't tell you why, you'll just be rejected/ghosted. If you're a 40 year old man, but your browser add-on convinces a data broker that you're a 34 year old woman seeking an abortion, that data can still cause you end up the target of a lawsuit in Texas and it will take a non-zero amount of time and money to clear that up. If someone in your zip code kills someone using a certain type of plant, or household cleaner/chemical, or medication and your add-on has been browsing sites about that thing, you can end up on the police's suspect list. If you only make $30,000 a year but your add-on searches for yachts and expensive jewelry often enough to convince a data broker that you've got tons of money then it doesn't matter that the data is wrong, the next time you try to book a hotel or order something online you can still be charged a lot more than you would have been charged otherwise. Handing extra fake data to people whose only goal is to use data against you is just handing them more ammunition. It doesn't matter if it's \"garbage\" to you, it's still something they can and will eventually use against you. You cannot know what will prejudice someone against you. The more data is in your dossier, the more opportunity there is that you'll meet the right (or wrong) criteria. No data broker is going to look over your dossier and see that there's inconsistencies and go \"Damn it! This genius has ruined my data! Now I have to throw all this data away as it is now worthless!\" They aren't even going to look over your dossier. They're going to get paid to hand over a list of people flagged as being 'X' and your name/address/identity will show up along with everyone else flagged as being 'X' even if your name gets pulled up again when someone else pays that same data broker for 'Y' which is the opposite of 'X'.

They're trying to convince everyone right now that AI is the golden solution that makes them super trustworthy compared to their previous failings. Tomorrow it'll probably be \"quantum something\" or \"super surveillance\" or some other gimmick. They really don't have to care. They'll always be able to sell their stuff. Data brokers will always have the police and the government buying up their data too because the government is happy to just suck up everything they can and will figure it all out later. They aren't concerned with accuracy either. That's how people get arrested for just riding their bike past houses that got robbed. They can make all the mistakes they want and it doesn't hurt them any, even when it's a huge problem for the people caught up by lazy policing. I promise you that no browser add-on is going to collapse the targeted ad industry or bring an end to surveillance capitalism. Giving people more data to use against you is a bad idea. reply l33t7332273 16 hours agorootparentprev> Surveillance capitalism doesn't care at all about the accuracy of the data that they have It’s clear and obvious that they do. If the data was made up, they wouldn’t be able to serve effective ads. > If you're a 40 year old man, but your browser add-on convinces a data broker that you're a 34 year old woman seeking an abortion, that data can still cause you end up the target of a lawsuit in Texas and it will take a non-zero amount of time and money to clear that up This situation would absolutely never happen, and I think it’s blatant fear mongering. reply autoexec 15 hours agorootparent> If the data was made up, they wouldn’t be able to serve effective ads. The data being collected about you isn't about advertising. It's used for an ever increasing number of things that impact your real life including things like how much you get charged when you buy things, what services you're told exist or are eligible for, how long you get left on hold, what policies a company will tell you they have, and who will hire you. The data being collected about you can be used against you by police, or in courtrooms, and in custody/divorce hearings. Even when the data is used for advertising (along with scam attempts, the manipulation of your opinion, and political propaganda) \"effectiveness\" is a very uncertain thing. No one expects that everyone they target with a campaign will bite. The effectiveness and accuracy of targeted ads isn't exactly certain to begin with. > With just one parameter - gender - the data is only 42% accurate. That is less accurate than if you just did “spray and pray” with no targeting at all — i.e. you would have still hit the right gender 50% of the time. With two parameters - gender plus age - the accuracy is down to an average of 24%. Some data brokers were far worse, with single digit percent accuracy. Third party profiling of audiences is so inaccurate, it’s better to save your money and do “spray and pray” instead.

On the contrary, Texas in particular has gone out if its way to incentivize its citizens reporting other citizens for getting abortions.

But would it be thrown out without me having to do anything, or would it cause me to spend time and possibly money dealing with it?

Are they material? reply ncallaway 13 hours agorootparentTexas has created a private right of action to sue for damages of $10,000. That is, if I know my neighbor performed an abortion, I can personally sue them, and get $10,000 (plus attorneys fees). So, the answer to your question depends on if you define $10,000 as material or not. reply spaced-out 15 hours agoprevI've yet to read a clear explanation of how \"surveillance capitalism\" is any different than regular capitalism with computers. As long as people are trying to make money they're going to try and crunch data to do it better. The only way I see to effect a real change in how companies collect and use data is with regulation. reply WhackyIdeas 15 hours agoprevA slight change of subject but not too much. An hour ago I walked into a Post Office somewhere in Scotland. I was immediately greeted with a screen hanging down from the ceiling. Onn the left 75% portion of the screen a bunch of different camera feeds and on the right portion, running vertically - still photos of my face and other customers faces who were currently in the shop. …And next to these still photos were things like: Age: Middle aged male Emotion: … Glasses: No Etc. I asked the shop keeper why they were showing this, and I was met with arguments like ‘these are everywhere’, ‘airports have them too’. I replied that an airport is understandably doing this, due to being a terrorism threat. But this was a small Post Office in a tiny village town in the countryside. So like comparing apples to toilet paper. I asked why the camera was trying to guess my emotion. To which I was replied to ‘if you are doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about’. Society has been so conditioned into the assumption that what we have today we will have tomorrow. Except in a world of potential Trumps, Xi Jinping, Putin and more… we are setting ourselves up for the complete unknown of tomorrow. This 1984 Scotland is now a place I feel like the reason to live has been dwindled down to just pure existence. I don’t think I had ever felt quite like this before this trip to the Post Office today. Life doesn’t feel like ours anymore. It’s someone else’s. The people behind the surveillance and the conditioned people who normalise it. Just because the technology exists, shouldn’t mean it needs to be used. When will people ever start respecting other’s privacy? And when will people ever give a damn about it. If this is already where we’re at in 2024, where are we all going to be by 2030? Is life as full of the same point today than what it was 10 years ago. And will it be less full of point by 2030.

Our digital organization reflects exactly that! It is revealing that the best form of digital identification for each person are (secret) profiles created+sold by digital surveillance companies, rather than a robust + transparent digital citizenship that is managed strictly by a public entity and the subject themself. Some people react to the status quo by \"running into the wilderness\", either literally, or metaphorically by self-hosting everything.

People can and do operate a commune within a capitalistic society. Go in with other people and buy some land to live off, make a contract to share all property. You can't do the inverse in a communistic society. But no, we all have to do it or it won't work, because apparently it's only possible at scale and it can't be explained until then. Convenient. So don't act like you can't go live life in a commune today, you can, just people don't, because capitalistic life is more comfortable.

Cool, good for them. Escapism isn't necessarily the goal, though. Obviously it depends on the person. > You can't do the inverse in a communistic society. Communism is the \"free association of producers.\" If the producers wish to assign dictatorial control of their factory to one person and sell their labor to that person in exchange for a wage based on paper money, they are free to do so. But why would anybody willingly engage in this arrangement unless there is no alternative? > They'd rather complain online about other people's lives, using their iPhone, drinking Starbucks, thinking about how know best for all You have created a stereotype and are reinforcing it here.

People like to retcon all forms of market-based commerce as a kind of \"proto-capitalism\", but that makes it hard to talk about Capitalism as a distinct economic system. The main defining feature of capital markets is their use of private property as a tool for extracting profit from a market system. There are useful and socially positive applications for capital, but Capitalism places profit above all other concerns because extracting profit is its function. Capitalism was born in feudal Europe, and grew up during the colonial period and is, factually, only 500 years old or so at most. Markets have existed all over the world for literal thousands of years. Capitalism tries really hard to pretend like they invented something, but there's far more choice and affordability in the free markets around the world than anything that has been enclosed by the american financial system. Then again, I don't subscribe to the notion of capitalist realism. Aside from the exported violence used to impose and sustain it, the model is flimsy and constantly in crisis. reply failbuffer 16 hours agorootparentprevWe'll never be post-scarcity because humans can never reach a state of sustained satisfaction. reply bluescrn 16 hours agorootparentprevPost-scarcity can't really happen on a very finite planet with a huge and growing population. Even if we had fully-automated systems providing plentify food and water, we'd need some ssytem, likely capitalism, to distribute still-scarce luxuries (e.g. beachfront property) And if we had total post-scarcity (effectively infinite energy and Star Trek style energy-to-matter replicators), we'd just be fighting over scarce land as everyone fills up all the space with replicated junk. reply orthecreedence 16 hours agorootparentPost-scarcity just means the rate of use is less than the rate of renewal for all used resources. In a sense, hunter-gatherers were \"post-scarcity.\" The challenge is supporting our modern quality of life at our scale of population. I think enormous strides would need to be made (fusion energy + matter synthesis, ie Star Trek replicators) in order to achieve post-scarcity on a long enough timeline without changing any of the other parameters. reply robertlagrant 15 hours agorootparentWell, not just that. Not everyone can have a house on the beach. How do you allocate that resource? reply orthecreedence 15 hours agorootparentEhhh, that one's self-regulating.

It seems we might not need capitalism for those goods any more, but it's still sticking there. reply margalabargala 16 hours agorootparentWe aren't, not yet, because those digital goods still have an initial creation cost. Digital goods that people consume are made by people. Yes, they can be copied infinitely for free, but we're only \"post scarcity\" if we never make anything else new. With the advent of generative AI, we might just barely be starting to be post scarcity in a couple narrow fields. reply persnickety 16 hours agorootparentI'll bite: we're post-scarcity for a lot of digital items that are useful tools. Goods we need but don't have exist, but I'm not even sure if they are the majority. Existing music, videos, books cover a whole lot of what humans might want - originals are the outcome of research needs (niche) and trends (not niche). Existing software tools are similar: new ones are needed to push boundaries (niche) or mostly as a response to a changing legal landscape (less niche). On top of that, significant amounts of stuff are created out of an internal need, and would get created regardless. One thing I'm sure about is that we're post-scarcity in historical items, and we're nowhere past capitalism there. Indeed, preservationists are hitting roadblocks all the time. reply margalabargala 15 hours agorootparentYou know, that's a fair point. I think there's a great argument to be made that FOSS software in particular is essentially post scarcity. I'm not sure I'd say we're \"post scarcity\" for books and other digital goods though. Sure, we have all the books written until now, but I think there's an argument to be made that a huge part of the utility of books is that they are produced in near-real-time to discuss, address, and reflect thecurrent state of society. As our society grows and changes, books featuring the issues of the days will always be desired. This falls into the \"trends\" category you mentioned, but my point is more that I think it's larger than you described. reply robertlagrant 15 hours agorootparentprevVolunteerism isn't \"post-scarcity\". If you're fed and watered by providing value in a capitalist system, and choose to spend your spare time volunteering, that's great, but it's nothing utopian. Volunteerism is a free choice of work in exchange for a price of £0. That's regular old capitalism at work. If you could just generate energy out of the ether and use it to materialise food and anything else you might want, for example, that would be post-scarcity. reply persnickety 12 hours agorootparentI insist that it still is post-scarcity if you would provide the same or greater (equivalent) value regardless of the system. While your definition might be elegant, it's too strict to foster a useful conversation. reply nightski 14 hours agorootparentprevYou can't look at one area of the economy in isolation. It's all intertwined. The people creating digital goods still need food, shelter, and housing.

    "title": "Google's Changing Culture: From Valuing Employees to Financial Challenges",
    "originLink": "https://social.clawhammer.net/blog/posts/2024-01-19-CultureChange/",
    "originBody": "Disclaimer: this post is solely based on my lived experience of working at Google for 18 years. I don't actually know the reasoning of the company's highest leaders, so all I can do is share my personal hypotheses. I've tried to write this essay three times over the past couple of months; it's tricky. It's always trendy and click-baity to attack big targets, especially when those targets are full of hubris like Silicon Valley tech companies. People love \"fall from grace\" stories. But my goal isn't to throw dirt; Google is still a great place to work -- far better than most companies -- and still doing amazing things. My goal here is to call out a unique, beautiful thing that happened... put it out into the universe, with the hope that it can come back again someday, somewhere. There's no doubt that the early days of Google were \"over the top\". I deliberately saved this email for 18 years, waiting for the day I left the company, because I knew it would be a fascinating time-capsule comparison. But the email mostly focuses on superficial differentiators, like free gourmet food. In truth, that's not why Googlers come to work. I want to talk about a deeper, more substantive aspect of the culture. When Ian Hickson -- another old-timer -- left Google last fall, he wrote a blog post talking about the shift in the types of decisions being made. I generally agree with him, but I won't repeat it all here -- I'm going to talk about a different shift. The most incredible and unusual thing that struck me about Google's early culture was the tendency to value employees above all else. I had worked in other companies, and never seen anything like this before. This culture lasted for at least my first decade at the company, perhaps longer. Let me explain. In a typical company, when priorities shift, you \"downsize\" (or cancel) a project, and then use the money to add people to a different, more important project. The common way to do this is fire people from the first project, then rehire a bunch of new people in the second project. It's easy, it's simple, it's expected. Google, however, had a different approach: they had an absolutely intense hiring process to find talented people who were also generalists -- that is, were able to thrive in a whole number of roles. The interviews were grueling for both applicants and interviewers, often taking months. But in the end, Google was convinced that it was worth the effort: they believed they had hired the best, brightest, and most flexible. And so, when priorities would change, Google did not fire people, but rather moved them carefully between projects. The unstated cultural principle was: \"products come and go, but we worked so hard to get our employees... so we should preserve them at all costs. They are our most precious resource.\" And so a tremendous amount of energy was put into high-touch resettlement of each employee into new projects. They were generalists. We knew they'd thrive, and that Google would continue to make use of their talent in new ways. As I moved up into leadership over the years, I became ever more involved in this process. In the early days as an individual contributor, I experienced re-orgs directly and got \"re-homed\" into new projects. As a leader, I got involved in finding new homes for teams during re-orgs. Eventually I wrote an internal handbook for other directors on how to gracefully execute these re-orgs. One of my fondest memories is getting a peer-bonus from an engineer whose own team re-org I had personally instigated -- he was much happier working on the new \"more important\" project! But things change. In my first month at Google, I remember a co-worker whispering to me, \"the day Google revenue stops growing without bound, is also the day all of this will change.\" The change was very gradual for a long time -- but then things accelerated during the pandemic. Revenue began to slow, and now, coming out of the pandemic, we're seeing waves of layoffs. Yes, we knew things would change, but we didn't expect it would accelerate this quickly, in the span of just a couple of years. The academic founders are gone, much of the C-suite is now former Wall Street execs; combine that with revenue flattening toward a stable horizontal asymptote, and the obvious, expected thing happens: the company suddenly moves from a \"culture of infinite abundance\" to a standard \"culture of limited resources.\" It's a predictable regression toward becoming a 'normal' company.[1] So what does a culture of \"limited resources\" mean? It means the execs start thinking about financial efficiency like every other company. You begin by trimming the more superficial perks: less fancy food, limiting travel budgets, no more swag, smaller and fewer internal parties and events, no more onsite dry cleaning or daycare. But again, these things weren't the reasons Googlers came to work. No big deal. But then you begin to cut costs further by changing the ornate hiring and promotion processes to become \"traditional\". Hiring changes from a laborious global process (of checks and balances) to a localized one within divisions that can tightly control their labor costs. Meanwhile, internal promotion processes change from \"competing against yourself\" to \"competing against your co-workers for limited positions.\" In the early days, titles were attached to people, but now they're increasingly attached to roles, and the number of roles (for any given title) can be limited to save cost. Finally, it comes time to do large re-orgs of projects around new urgent priorities (like AI, for example). But gone is the high-touch re-homing of employees. Instead, we see waves of impersonal layoffs, followed by (modest) rehiring in the newer projects that matter. In other words: doing what a normal company does. Is Google evil here? Of course not. As I mentioned in a prior post, Google is not a person. And -- whether or not one agrees with it -- its leaders are trying to be fiscally responsible and efficient, just as all public companies are pressured to do when resources become finite. But, coming back to my first decade at Google, it was incredible to see employees valued above everything else. Perhaps this is a privilege only possible in a culture of infinite abundance. Or maybe not? Maybe it's possible in a limited-resource culture too, but only if the company is small. It leaves me wondering if the sheer size of Google (170,000+ employees) simply makes high-touch re-orgs intractable. The takeaway here is this: we should all learn from early-Google's example. When employees feel truly valued (which is rare!), it creates psychological safety, high morale, productivity, and creativity. Early employees would often encourage each other to \"fail fast\" as a means to innovation, but that's no longer easy in an environment where failure implies a layoff. If you're someone building a company, challenge yourself to value employees above all else, then watch and be amazed at the ROI. published January 19, 2024 To be clear, I believe Google is still nowhere near being a normal company yet. It has a tremendous distance to fall. ↩︎",

And at some point you need product people too, because you start to build products you’re not in the target audience for.

Did Valve corporation do something like that? reply tavavex 2 hours agorootparentI think Valve does have a reputation for having this type of model. They've famously expressed an intention to not go public or sell the company to anyone else. This is also what leads to them being a fairly small and selective company that can afford to cherry-pick employees, and that also has an allegedly more employee-friendly culture than others.

It's simply not truthful, unless they started a side business in developing a torrent tracker or something. reply CobrastanJorji 2 hours agorootparentI'm not sure whether you think I'm being unfair to Google or to OpenAI. Everybody and their brother sued Google early on for a huge variety of their products. Google News got sued for showing headlines from news websites. Google Books got sued for copyright violations for, y'know, making a copy of everybody's books. Back in 2007, Google would've been in the middle of the the Viacom vs YouTube lawsuit. The whole idea of a search engine is fundamentally about taking all of the useful and mostly copyrighted content out there owned by others and profiting off of it by becoming the gateway to it. OpenAI, similarly, works by taking all of the text and art and everything in the world, most of it owned by others, then copying it, collating it, and compressing it down into a model. Then they provide access to it in novel ways. I make no representation about whether it's legal or ethical. It's transformative, useful, novel, and really cool, but it's clearly taking other people's data, and then making it useful and accessible in a novel way. reply dougb5 1 hour agorootparentA big difference in my view is that OpenAI doesn't meaningfully \"provide access\" to all the text and art and everything in the world; rather, they suck the marrow out of all the text and art and everything in the world and use it to sell their own replacement service for all the text and art and everything in the world. Google has done some questionable things to become a gateway to the world's work, but they're (mostly) still a gateway, not a copy. reply broeng 42 minutes agorootparentMaybe we can agree they are still _mostly_ at gateway. But their ambition to answer your question through zero-clicks (i.e., show the answer right in their search results) does make them profit from direct copying. The copyright owner will not get any clicks, show any adds, or get any other kind of feedback to their work, in those cases. reply tavavex 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the characterization is unfair to generative AI, because the information that is retained in the model is a very lossy and rough generalization of the training data - that situation is a lot less direct than what it's like with search engines. In my mind, the lawsuits against search engines have a lot more ground to stand on. Saying that something \"provides access to copyrighted content\" almost implies that there's some mechanism that allows the user to wholesale download complete, unedited and exact copies of some copyrighted material - I could see that argument with a search engine, but not really with a text or image generator. reply piva00 50 minutes agorootparentIt's 100% dependent on copyrighted material at least, even though you can't access an exact copy of it without access to the material it wouldn't exist. It's a messy issue, I have no idea how it will be solved since it's a rather new development for humanity, in the past when humans would collect knowledge from different sources to use them in a novel way there would be at least some kind of attribution, recognition of the sources, either being cited or acknowledged in a preface. With GenAI there's nothing, and probably not even a way for GenAI to tell us where it got \"inspired\" from to generate something. It's going to be a very messy landscape for copyrights and intellectual property in the next years. reply saiya-jin 1 hour agorootparentprevWell, you certainly have right to your opinion, as do others to theirs.

Big tech is in a really tough spot when it comes to innovation. Google has developed a reputation for killing off products too easily. Many have commented here and elsewhere that you can’t trust them to invest in using their new products because they might just kill it off and leave you in the lurch. Of course, you get a self fulfilling prophecy as then too few people use the product for fear that it’ll get killed off. But I’m guessing Google is also more hesitant to launching a new products that since it neither wants to worsen its reputation for killing them, nor does it want to support a product indefinitely, even if it’s not profitable. So then what? The answer probably should be that Google should buy up startups that have figured out product-market fit and just need to scale. They can’t do that though because the FTC is already breathing down their neck with anti-trust suits. Google actually is investing in a lot of very transformative technologies—AI obviously, but also quantum computers, biotech, and autonomous vehicles.

Actually, that last one makes a lot of sense for pushing for more GCP adoption. reply vlovich123 3 hours agorootparentOpen source is very hard for a bunch of reasons: * Code at Google3 is one giant monolith that has dependencies on things that aren’t open sourced. Even if they could be, they don’t make sense outside of Google * most services internally run on internal services like Borg and GFS rather than GCP for historical reasons. That maybe has changed now but I suspect a lot of stuff depends on internal infra not available on GCP * A product can often have data dependencies. Just being able to spin up a separate copy may not mean much in terms of keeping a product alive past Google’s interest if the data is locked away behind Google’s private data stores. Then you want Google to start adding easy export options so that data can be exfiltrated from Google’s onto 3p versions of the product which is a legal, business, PR and technical risk * Google has invested some amount of money and resources into a product. If a competitor takes that concept and is successful it’s embarrassing to execs at Google who missed the opportunity. Google Wave was dropped even though in many ways it’s a precursor to slack (it was open sourced though and went nowhere).

First week one developer blatantly said to management in-front of the scammer that the scammer (CTO) doesn't know anything about technology and is a complete fraud. The developer got fired 10 minutes later. Others took note to not challenge him if they want to keep their job. That happened ~10 years ago and I am actually grateful for that experience because I was just starting out, the scammer indirectly taught me much more about how to scam and lie your way to the top, how to sell your ideas to unaware management and most importantly - that office politics are 10x more important than merit in big companies. reply jjav 2 hours agorootparent> that office politics are 10x more important than merit in big companies My experience (5 startups) is that office politics are 100x more important in small startups. Everything is more concentrated, including the politics. That's why there is so much cofounder drama to go around. At least in a big company there's a lot of inertia and process to tone down the politics a little bit. reply shiroiuma 48 minutes agorootparentYeah, I agree. Anecdotes like the GP's just show that big companies aren't immune to these problems (and some big companies are better-run than others). These problems can happen at any company. My experience, at both big and small and also medium-size companies, is that smaller companies usually have much less process and procedures, and can vary greatly from one to another. Big companies have evolved procedures and processes to try to mitigate these human problems. So, for instance, you're much more likely to see sexual harassment and discrimination in a smaller company: if the guy who owns the place is cool with it, it'll be the norm there. Huge companies don't get to be huge these days by tolerating that stuff, and they have a lot of money to lose in a lawsuit, so they put a lot of effort into insulating themselves: anti-harassment training for employees, etc. reply boxed 2 hours agorootparentprevYou learned how to assume the world is broken, and not fix it.

No matter the hordes of detractors who will tell you this is impossible and that all your mail will be /dev/nulled by all the usual suspects (Microsoft, Microsoft and Microsoft being the main culprit here, Gmail comes in second) the truth is that you'll be fine as long as you make sure to configure things like SPF and DKIM correctly and you're either using a smarthost for outgoing mail (ask your IAP whether they provide one) or are on a reputable network. A SBC like a Raspberry Pi is sufficient to host mail services for a fairly large number of people. Filter out spam with Spamassassin and a greylist, run sieve to organise your incoming mail flow, use specific mail addresses when communicating with commercial and government organisations and you'll end up asking yourself why so many people insist that self-hosting mail is not an option. Now that you're self-hosting mail you can also self-host XMPP using the same address making it possible for people to reach you through either SMTP (mail) or XMPP (instant messaging/voice/video calling) using that address. This can be hosted on that same SBC without problems. Source: my own experience self-hosting mail (and more) since the 90's.

It worked reasonably well at one place I was at for about 8 years, estimating one of those characters popping up every 200-500 hires. It’s the strategic side to your internal integrity function. Typically recruit folks who are lightning rods for these kinds of behaviours: young, female, brown, queer members of staff - don’t forget reception annf cleaning personnel! - and train them (often not necessary!) to spot abuse of power, bullying, threats and gaslighting and to confidentially report it.

All employee goodiness is a fair weather phenomena. Always keep a healthy distance from your work and company. reply siwatanejo 1 hour agoprev> The takeaway here is this: we should all learn from early-Google's example. When employees feel truly valued (which is rare!), it creates psychological safety, high morale, productivity, and creativity. Early employees would often encourage each other to \"fail fast\" as a means to innovation, but that's no longer easy in an environment where failure implies a layoff. If you're someone building a company, challenge yourself to value employees above all else, then watch and be amazed at the ROI. This paragraph (which is the ending one) feels like it is contradicting the rest of the article. Because if those things really led to an awesome ROI, then Google would not be where it is now, but in a much better position than before. I guess? Don't get me wrong, I'm not against valuing employees above everything else, but if this becomes too extreme maybe it's normal that the company creates too much fragmentation? For example, why did Google create both Go and Dart? Shouldn't they converge into one? (Shouldn't Flutter have been written in Go?)

They get the same benefits, can eat the free food, and generally I haven't seen any serious discrimination against them for being \"not engineers\". However, some of the things you've mentioned (e.g. building maintenance) are often done by contractors or outside firms, and for them things are often very different. reply darth_avocado 3 hours agoprev> Early employees would often encourage each other to \"fail fast\" as a means to innovation, but that's no longer easy in an environment where failure implies a layoff. Something that is amazing that often leadership fails to realize is the above. During my last days at X (formerly known as Twitter :P), everyone was just risk averse because it automatically meant a middle of the night firing. So much engineering time was wasted on non productive stuff, that could otherwise be spent on generating more profits for the company. Somehow management wanted you to constantly work towards making more money, while also punishing you for executing on ideas because it was taking you longer than 2 weeks to build and therefore were not working on something that made money immediately. Edit: it’s not just innovation that takes a hit, it creates a lot of behaviors that are counterproductive for the company. People hoard information to make themselves irreplaceable, a very small percentage of psychopaths actively sabotage others, people steal ideas and have multiple competing groups work on the same thing, people refrain from raising issues that later create bigger problems, people only work on shiny new things that have the leadership’s blessing while dumping their unstable tech debt on others etc. reply eru 3 hours agoparentSounds like their internal interest rates have gone up? reply poundofshrimp 3 hours agoprev> But, coming back to my first decade at Google, it was incredible to see employees valued above everything else.

While the company was in survival mode, employees were highly valued and the owners had a \"we're in it together\" type of attitude.

So maybe it kind of was about the free food and clothing all along? From the outside, this was much of the appeal of Google earlier on (and rare other places, at times): personal finances are taken care of, low corporate BS, no startup runway anxiety, no \"if only we could spend resources on that thing\", no \"if only I could combine efforts with more people like me\". Instead of stress about modern cost of living, stress about whether there's going to be layoffs or bankruptcy, stress from untrustworthy leadership, etc., there's only... Hmmm, I just encountered another tricky application of technology problem that I want to solve, and it seems hard, but I can just focus on it and solve it. For me, the appeal wasn't the myths about \"smartest people in the world\", nor the prestige (other than not being a downward arc on resume), nor the perks, nor the hip decor.

When I joined the tech industry in the early 2000s, most companies, including many tech companies, were very Office Space esque. Drab cube farms with dull carpet, horrible coffee, and MBA types running the show. Getting a second monitor or different equipment took months if it was even possible. Maybe you got lucky and got some free snacks and coke. The idea that an engineer could be paid as much on an IC track as a manager or director was quite rare, much less showering employees with perks such as free food, gourmet coffee, video games, lounges, and the like. All of that is fairly common. I've worked at startups that had free food, plenty of companies have a fairly lucrative IC track, snacks/perks, pleasant looking offices and all that.

In a typical company, when priorities shift, you \"downsize\" (or cancel) a project, and then use the money to add people to a different, more important project. The common way to do this is fire people from the first project, then rehire a bunch of new people in the second project. It's easy, it's simple, it's expected. This is funny for me as a German, because here as a company you are not allowed to fire people essentially on a whim - you have to find new roles for them in the company, and can only lay off people if you can't reasonably do so. Obviously you can try nevertheless but if you can't prove in front of a court that you did reasonable effort, then you'll lose. And that email quote is also interesting on its own: > Even the IT department works differently. In every building, there are little offices called \"tech stops\". They sort of look like miniature computer stores. If you have a problem with your computer, just walk it right into the tech stop and show a technician. They generally help you on the spot. If you need hardware, just ask. \"Hey, I need a new mouse\"... \"sure, what kind would you like?\", says the tech, opening a cabinet full of peripherals. No bureaucracy, no forms, no requests. Just ask for hardware, and get it. The same goes for office supplies... cabinets full of office supplies everywhere, always stocked full. Just take what you need, whenever you feel like it. I think that in the end all this bureaucracy is part of what makes people feel like they're just another cog in the machine, and it's intended to do so. Just think about it from the outside... a company that pays you 60k a year, but adds about 100$ worth of \"management overhead\" for a simple mouse for 15 €?

All it took was new leadership. They just overtook Apple as the most valuable company in the world. Just a string of good, solid decisive leadership. Satya Nadella turned that company around. Could happen to Google as well. But not with their current CEO. They have a lot of stuff that they are working on but very little of it has any real impact on their revenue. Their strategy is a mess. And they have a huge expensive work force not delivering more revenue to justify their existence. And they've been hiring non stop for 20 years just mindlessly growing their staff adding tens of thousands of people per year. The Google that built the company was much smaller and nimbler. The layoffs slow down the bloat but it's still a bloated company. The reason they get away with that is that revenue hasn't stopped growing either. But it's increasingly detached from staff size. Staff reductions at this point merely increase profits. reply petesergeant 2 hours agorootparentAbsolutely they need a leader to turn it around, but Apple and Microsoft don’t feel like Google did: it’s still going to be a mature tech giant, run by spreadsheets, even if they can start producing some cool stuff again reply Niksko 2 hours agoparentprev> It's time for smaller, scrappier tech companies to be the place where innovation happens I think this is exactly what is being lamented.

The research shows, for the first time, that AlphaFold predictions — available at the touch of a button — can be just as useful for drug discovery as experimentally derived protein structures, which can take months, or even years, to determine. AlphaFold touted as next big thing for drug discovery — but is it? The development is a boost for AlphaFold, the artificial-intelligence (AI) tool developed by DeepMind in London that has been a game-changer in biology. The public AlphaFold database holds structure predictions for nearly every known protein. Protein structures of molecules implicated in disease are used in the pharmaceutical industry to identify and improve promising medicines. But some scientists had been starting to doubt whether AlphaFold's predictions could stand-in for gold standard experimental models in the hunt for new drugs. “AlphaFold is an absolute revolution. If we have a good structure, we should be able to use it for drug design,” says Jens Carlsson, a computational chemist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden. AlphaFold scepticism Efforts to apply AlphaFold to finding new drugs have been met with considerable scepticism, says Brian Shoichet, a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of California, San Francisco. “There is a lot of hype. Whenever anybody says ‘such and such is going to revolutionize drug discovery’, it warrants some scepticism.” Shoichet counts more than ten studies that have found AlphaFold’s predictions to be less useful than protein structures obtained with experimental methods, such as X-ray crystallography, when used to identify potential drugs in a modelling method called protein–ligand docking. What's next for AlphaFold and the AI protein-folding revolution This approach — common in the early stages of drug discovery — involves modelling how hundreds of millions or billions of chemicals interact with key regions of a target protein, in the hope of identifying compounds that alter the protein’s activity. Previous studies have tended to find that when AlphaFold-predicted structures are used, the models are poor at singling out drugs already known to bind to a particular protein. Researchers led by Shoichet and Bryan Roth, a structural biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, came to a similar conclusion when they checked AlphaFold structures of two proteins implicated in neuropsychiatric conditions against known drugs. The researchers wondered whether small differences from experimental structures might cause the predicted structures to miss certain compounds that bind to proteins — but also make them able to identify different ones that were no less promising. To test this idea, the team used experimental structures of the two proteins to virtually screen hundreds of millions of potential drugs. One protein, a receptor that senses the neurotransmitter serotonin, was previously determined using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure of the other protein, called the σ-2 receptor, had been mapped using X-ray crystallography. Drug differences They ran the same screen with models of the proteins plucked from the AlphaFold database. They then synthesized hundreds of the most promising compounds identified with either the predicted and experimental structures and measured their activity in the lab. ‘It will change everything’: DeepMind’s AI makes gigantic leap in solving protein structures The screens with predicted and experimental structures yielded completely different drug candidates. “There were no two molecules that were the same,” says Shoichet. “They didn’t even resemble each other.” But to the team’s surprise, the ‘hit rates’ — the proportion of flagged compounds that actually altered protein activity in a meaningful way — were nearly identical for the two groups. And AlphaFold structures identified the drugs that activated the serotonin receptor most potently. The psychedelic drug LSD works partly through this route, and many researchers are looking for non-hallucinogenic compounds that do the same thing, as potential antidepressants. “It’s a genuinely new result,” says Shoichet. Prediction power In unpublished work, Carlsson’s team has found that AlphaFold structures are good at identifying drugs for a sought-after class of target called G-protein-coupled receptors, for which their hit rate is around 60%. Having confidence in predicted protein structures could be game-changing for drug discovery, says Carlsson. Determining structures experimentally isn’t trivial, and many would-be targets might not yield to existing experimental tools. “It would be very convenient if we could push the button and get a structure we can use for ligand discovery,” he says. Isomorphic Labs, a spin-off company of Google’s DeepMind in London, is ramping up its drug-discovery efforts using AlphaFold.Credit: Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty The two proteins that Shoichet and Roth’s team picked are good candidates for relying on AlphaFold, says Sriram Subramaniam, a structural biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Experimental models of related proteins — including detailed maps of the regions where drugs bind to them — are readily available. \"If you stack the deck, AlphaFold is a paradigm shift. It changes the way we do things,\" he adds. “This is not a panacea,” says Karen Akinsanya, president of research and development for therapeutics at Schrödinger, a drug-software company based in New York City that is using AlphaFold. Predicted structures are helpful for some drug targets, but not others, and it’s not always clear which applies. In about 10% of cases, predictions AlphaFold deems highly accurate are substantially different from the experimental structure, a study3 found. And even when predicted structures can help to identify leads, more detailed experimental models are often needed to optimize the properties of a particular drug candidate, Akinsanya adds. Big bet Shoichet agrees that AlphaFold predictions are not universally useful. “There were a lot of models that we didn’t even try because we thought they were so bad,” he says. But he estimates that in about one-third of cases, an AlphaFold structure could jump-start a project. “Compared to actually going out and getting a new structure, you could advance the project by a couple of years and that’s huge,” he says. That is the goal of Isomorphic Labs, DeepMind’s drug-discovery spin-off in London. On 7 January, the company announced deals worth a minimum of US$82.5 million — and up to $2.9 billion if business targets are met — to hunt for drugs on behalf of pharmaceutical giants Novartis and Eli Lilly using machine-learning tools such as AlphaFold. The company says that the work will be aided by a new version of AlphaFold that can predict the structures of proteins when they are bound to drugs and other interacting molecules. DeepMind has not yet said when — or whether — the update will be made available to researchers, as earlier versions of AlphaFold have been. A competing tool called RoseTTAFold All-Atom2 will be made available soon by its developers. Such tools won’t fully replace experiments, scientists say, but their potential to help find new drugs shouldn’t be discounted. “There’s a lot of people that want AlphaFold to do everything, and a lot of structural biologists want to find reasons to say we are still needed,” says Carlsson. “Finding the right balance is difficult.” doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-00130-8 References Lyu, J. et al.

But the really important conclusion of the paper, which I truly hope bears out, is that AF2 models are useful for finding binders to GPCRs. GPCRs are one of the largest (if not largest) drug targets and work (including my own) showed that modelling protein dynamics using expensive simulations was likely to be necessary to make accurate predictions of GPCR binding molecules. If this paper is correct, AF2 is actually able to recapitulate much of the detail that we previously believed required expensive dynamics simulations, which is about the best possible news because it suggests that we can omit these costly calculations. It's almost certain now that AF2 will win the Nobel Prize, as this represents some of the most exciting breakthroughs in the past few decades. reply Duanemclemore 8 hours agoparentEven if it has to go through extensive vetting on the theory side, the ability of these models to improve the starting points for the harder process is very strong. For example, in daylight modeling - and this is 2-3 years ago mind you - it has been found that \"AI\" is perfect for getting 99% closer to the actual luminance in something like 01% the computation. So that even if you feed those \"precalculated\" models into the traditional raytracers, the improvement to the first guess is well, well worth it. reply dekhn 8 hours agorootparentI don't really think there's an analogy between radiosity simulations and drug discovery. Drug discovery will probably remain fairly ad-hoc and stochastic for some time. reply Duanemclemore 7 hours agorootparentThat's fair. I was merely talking about being able to make better \"first guesses.\" Nowhere near the predictability of a much simpler phenomenon such as radiance mapping, of course. And as the article says, >\"There were a lot of models that we didn’t even try because we thought they were so bad,...” reply vlovich123 4 hours agorootparentprevTo me the analogy is that generic AI techniques with minimal problem domain specific adaptations is providing huge boosts in efficiency on a wide variety of applications. It’s like the steam engine causing mechanical work to become vastly more efficient. AI in many ways is doing the same thing to intellectual work. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 8 hours agoparentprevAs an expert, do you think this might lead to easier discovery of much more selective GPCR ligands? Agree finding new 5HT2A ligands is cool, what would be truly interesting is having a suite of totally selective ligands for the entire 5-HT receptor family. I feel like a lot psychopharmacological research into a lot of mental disorder is severely hampered by 1) the complex interactions of the various serotonin receptors(and also with other receptors like D2) 2) the lack of truly selective ligands, necessitating a hodge podge of less selective agonists combined with selective antagonists to isolate the effects of specific receptor interactions(making it hard to do this sort of thing in humans). Or using knockout mice, which is also kind of dubious because you've now made a fundamentally different brain and are trying to compare it to a normal one. And that's sort of hit and miss. reply timr 7 hours agoparentprev> But the really important conclusion of the paper, which I truly hope bears out, is that AF2 models are useful for finding binders to GPCRs. What seems more likely to you: that the (obviously worse [1]) structures produced by alphafold are somehow magically capturing protein dynamics, or…the virtual screening method (DOCK) used by the paper is relatively insensitive to the quality of the underlying model? They say right there in the article that neither screen was obviously enriched versus the other (the hit rate was around 50% for both branches, which was essentially the same as for the very different retrospective screening method in the same paper [2]). I’m putting my money on the parsimonious answer. Running structures through a large enough virtual screen will almost always find something that binds, even if the starting model isn't great. [1] at least in the case of the x-ray structure. Using a cryoEM structure is sort of interesting, since they’re blurry anyway. [2] the actual paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.20.572662v1.... reply dekhn 5 hours agorootparentI don't have a good answer. I don't think AF2 captures protein dynamics in a direct way. And I think docking programs have inadequate loss functions and sampling to really find accurate answers. I suppose AF2 could be modified to produce structures that are well mapped to docking programs. I think you're right, that running lots of structures through virtual screens will find lots of binders. In the middle days of protein design (well before AF2), people went from not being able to design anything, to being able to easily design \"rocks\"- proteins that were exceptionally stable, but didn't do anything interesting. Their loss function that they maximized for was stability. But that comes at a cost: high stability seems to prevent lability (which is useful for enzymes). And I think that if you just pass enough stuff through a good-enough program, you'll find lots of binders, but those binders won't actually be useful binders. We already know from decades of work that we can find lots of nanomolar and picomolar binders that don't do anything worthwhile (or have side effects). My conclusion is: we may very well be on the tip of solving another bottleneck in the drug discovery pipeline, or, we might just be bumbling around in a big space and found a nice local minimum. I don't think AF2 or similar systems on their own are going to completely solve the problem, and until DeepMind or somebody else creates something that can truly address the hard problems in human biology, the most we can hope for is finding more effective new drugs more cheaply and somehow couple that with improvements in genetic personalization. reply keenmaster 8 hours agoparentprevAwesome. What are a couple examples of what this may enable (drugs that would target the same)? reply dekhn 8 hours agorootparentI would extrapolate from existing GPCR-targeting drugs, but the list is so long I can't really give a survey. As a protein family, GPCRs do a lot of different things but basically it boils down to signal transduction: there's something outside a cell and the cell wants to know that so it can respond. GPCRs mediate the binding of the thing outside to the surface of the cell, and transduct the information into the cell, delivering a signal to the nucleus, where the transcriptional machinery is manipulated to make new proteins (or stop making proteins). I left out some steps. This allows the cell to be responsive to the outside in a secure way, without the outside molecule coming into the cell. The 3d structure of GPCRs is intimately associated with the cell membrane, with one end sticking out into the extracellular environment, and another sticking out into the interior of the cell. Simply getting that sort of protein, which is not soluble in water, was a massive challenge and the first structures didn't arrive until the early 2000s, when people learned how to crystallize GPCRs using detergents and other solvents that simulated cell membranes. So many diseases are caused by misregulation of signal trandsduction... let's take some examples. Vasopressin is a drug that also happens to be a natural body product. In some diseases, people don't make enough vasopressin to regular the kidneys properly, leading to a form of diabetes, and simply giving people more of it helps reduce the symptoms. I guess in this case (not certain), people have mutations in the GPCR that receives the vasopressin signal that attenuates the signal \"too much\" and by just dosing the patient with a lot more, more signal gets sent inside the cell. I think at least 10 nobel prizes in medicine have been awarded for research related to GPCRs, which has uncovered a wide range of medically relevant knowledge of physiology. The NERSC supercomputer \"Cori\" was named for Gertie Cori, who helped discover some of the core mechanisms in human metabolism during the golden age of metabolic biochemistry. I think the simplest way to think about it is being able to target specific GPCRs is like being in front of a switchboard with buttons and knobs controlling every critical detail of how human bodies manage and maintain themselves. reply oh_sigh 8 hours agorootparentprevA better question would be what don't they enable. Something like 30+% of FDA approved drugs operate along that pathway. Besides for the boring stuff like being able to trigger cancer cells to kill themselves, we could have a molecule you inject into your eye that opens up your vision to be able to see infrared and ultraviolet light(and beyond). reply boxed 8 minutes agoprevAfter seeing all the fakery from how AI models handle programming (being \"very good\" at tasks where it turns out it was just trained on the problem in the first place), I do wonder if AlphaFold is likewise a red herring. How many of the AlphaFold protein folding predictions have been actually verified by a lab? And are any of those actually new proteins or just tiny variations on things in the training set? reply zbowling 8 hours agoprevAI takes our jobs, and then it helps us get high.

Us and plants aren't creating the same molecule because we share a common ancestor. There are far too many other plants that don't create cannabinoids or opiates or whatever, and far too many other animals that don't create them, for this to be at all likely. It had to have evolved multiple times. It's not any kind of symbiotic relationship. Our ancestors didn't cause opiates to evolve by selectively eating and spreading their seeds. So it's a coincidental convergent evolution. But these are really complex molecules doing quite different things. Both cannabinoids and opiates evolved in plants to defend them from viruses and fungi. I don't know what other neurotransmitter-mimics are for, but they're not being used for plant nerves. I'm sure people know the answers to this, and I could read a book about it. reply __MatrixMan__ 5 hours agorootparent> I'm sure people know the answers to this I don't think they do. AFAIK most of your assertions above are unknowns. My theory, at least re: psilocybin and the like, is that a parasitic fungus developed neurotransmitter agonists as a way of manipulating its host. The complete cocktail that was needed to make the target species behave in a way that completed the fungus' lifecycle may be lost to time, but certain components of it still exist in the gene pool. And if you're going to have millions of spores (rather than the two or three offspring that, say, humans have) you can afford to set them up with a wider array of gene expression profiles. So you've got these fungi just trying stuff to see what works--now armed with neurotransmitter agonists as part of that \"stuff\". Later on you've got other organisms eating those mushrooms and behaving strangely. If you're a fungal spore, and you're in an animal's digestive tract, \"strangely\" is probably how you want it to be behaving. You're going to end up in a different place or with different nutrients or in some other situation which is abnormal for your host--you end up with greater habitat diversity. How specifically that host-behavior-strangeness would lead to a lifecycle that would reinforce the inclusion of psychedelics to the point where P. Cubensis is reliably psychedelic, rather than just the occasional mutant, I have no idea, but when you've got billions of years to play with, it's not hard to accept that some pretty weird animal-fungus interactions came up here and there. reply timschmidt 5 hours agorootparentMany psychoactive molecules are also structurally very similar to other hormones, and molecules produced for other aspects of biological function. Take a look at NN-DMT and Melatonin: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N,N-Dimethyltryptamine https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin Just a slight mutation, or even biological synthesis under non-ideal conditions could easily result in synthesizing one or the other via the same pathway. reply timschmidt 5 hours agorootparentprev> Us and plants aren't creating the same molecule because we share a common ancestor. That is, in fact, exactly the reason. You are of course correct that synthesis of many biological molecules has evolved countless times over the eons, but chirality of certain critical molecules, amino acids, ribosomes, all evolved exceedingly early. Once the cellular machinery is synthesizing these things, synthesis of similar molecules, one, two, three mutations away become likely across swaths of related organisms, however distant.

Much more likely a cultural effect, if any, that nudged early humans down the path of spiritual pursuit as a sort of cultural glue.

Use of psychedelics could have helped accelerate an individual's \"spiritual\" development and therefore afforded them additional offspring. So the correlation, if any, might be a favoring of genes that paired well with the effects of psychedelics. Pure speculation on my part. As for AI, it seems highly likely a new class of designer drugs will emerge, tailored to a specific individual to enhance societal adaptation.

This look like one of the big end level bosses for AI reply refurb 4 hours agoprevHere is maybe a helpful analogy for the challenges behind protein folding. The 5HT2A receptor is comprised of 471 amino acids. Proteins fold based on interaction between each of those amino acids, plus the external environment (plus post-translational modification). So imagine a length of string with 471 magnets attached to it with different magnetic field strength (ranging from weak to strong). Now imagine it floating in space - how would the string fold upon itself? Now imagine different segments of the string have different stiffness - some are super flexible, others are rigid. Difficult to predict how it might fold? Oh yeah! Now imagine the string not in space, but in a solution of water with a number of other magnets floating in it (the cytoplasm within the cell and external environment outside the cell). Oh, and also imbedded in a wall with magnets in it as well (the cell membrane). Now how does it fold? Ok, now we think we have a good approximation of the structure just based off of various pieces of data. But wait! Other proteins are also embedded in the cell wall - all with their own structures and selection of weak and strong magnets, stiff and flexible segments interact with the receptor! Oh, and not all receptors have the same external environment - that can differ based on another laundry list of factors. Yeah, that's another layer of complexity. Then add on top that the external environment (inside the cell on one side, outside the cell on the other) has a ton of water, but also dissolved ions like Na+, K+, Cl-, plus a bunch of other proteins with their own \"magnets\" and \"stiff and flexible segments\". These outside molecules will bind and disassociate from the receptor on a constant basis, ever so tweaking the shape. Oh crap. Of course AI has a good starting point - we can get x-ray crystal structures of the receptor and identify the position of atoms. But wait! That's in a crystal, not a human body! So that structure is likely incorrect in several ways. We also have other analytical techniques that can give clues to the structure in a solution that more closely mimics what's inside the body, so we can at least tell when the x-ray structure is just wrong (at least in some places). That should give people an idea just how complex protein folding is. AI is good at taking all known \"rules\" about protein folding (and molecule interactions with the protein) to improve the predictions. But we're still far off from truly understanding all the factors in play. reply uptownfunk 6 hours agoprevWhy not just take with chocolate like everyone else reply iancmceachern 4 hours agoprev [–] I find possible psychedelics on the sidewalk in my neighborhood in San Francisco quite regularly, coincidentally. /s reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-67793887",
    "originBody": "Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Travel Earth Video Live Exciting new cancer drug kinder than chemotherapy By Michelle Roberts Digital health editor BBC Arthur is back at school and pursuing hobbies again Some children with cancer are receiving a new type of drug treatment far less toxic than chemotherapy. Arthur, 11, is one of the first to try it, at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, for his blood cancer. His family call the therapy \"a little bit of sunshine\", since it worked without making Arthur feel much sicker. And because it could be given on the go, rather than just in hospital, he spent more time at home with his family, enjoying more of what he loves. He carried it with him in a rucksack - his \"blina backpack\". For Arthur, blinatumomab or blina was his only real option after his chemo had failed to clear all of his cancer and had left him very weak. Sandrine Heutz Arthur with his blina backpack Blina is already licensed to treat adults with cancer - and experts hope to show it can safely help children too. Some 20 centres around the UK are using it off-label for children with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). The drug is an immunotherapy that seeks out cancer cells so the body's own immune system can recognise and destroy them. And this death hunt is precisely targeted - healthy cells are untouched, unlike with chemo. Sandrine Heutz Arthur starting his blina treatment Blina comes in a bag of liquid administered through a thin plastic tube that remains running into a vein in the patient's arm for many months. A battery-operated pump controls how quickly the drug trickles into the bloodstream - a bag can last days. All of the kit can be carried in a backpack smaller than an A4 textbook, making it fully portable. For Arthur, that meant he could do other things - like play on the swings in his local park - while the treatment was happening. And unlike his intensive chemotherapy, which had stopped working anyway, it did not make him too weak to enjoy his days. 'Constant challenge' Like other patients on blina, Arthur was given medication to cut the chance of serious reactions or side effects before his infusion started. At first, he had some bouts of fever and needed to stay in hospital for checks. But shortly after, he was able to go home. The backpack stayed with Arthur continuously, including in bed - and even though the pump makes a noise, he was able to have a decent night's sleep. Chemo had been rough for Arthur and moving on to blina was a relief, his mother, Sandrine, said. \"It was completely out of his control - we were living in a constant challenge as his body was getting hit by the drugs,\" she said. \"We were curing him by making him feel worse - it's a very difficult thing to process.\" 'Big step' Arthur had to return to hospital every four days so doctors could top up the blina kit but was able to manage the treatment at home the rest of the time. \"He enjoyed the fact that he was able to hold it and be responsible - he embraced all of it,\" Sandrine said. And at the end of April 2023, Arthur had the final operation to remove the tubing from his arm. \"It was a big step - he was free,\" Sandrine said. Doctors say blina can replace big chunks of chemo - perhaps up to 80% of it. About 450 children a year in the UK are diagnosed with Arthur's type of cancer. Sandrine Heutz Arthur with his parents during his chemo and steroid treatment Chief investigator and consultant paediatric haematologist Prof Ajay Vora said: \"Chemotherapies are poisons that kill the leukaemic cells but also kill and damage normal cells - and that is what causes their side effects. \"Blinatumomab is a gentler, kinder treatment.\" Another targeted immunotherapy drug, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T), has also recently become available. But it is more expensive than blina and the patient's own cells must be taken and then altered in the lab before being given back as the medicine, which takes time. Thanks to all the treatment, Arthur's cancer has now gone. Sandrine said: \"New Year was when we found out that the blina had worked and there was no residual cancer - and so that was just amazing and so we had double celebrations.\" Additional reporting by Nicki Stiastny and Neil Paton Great Ormond Street Hospital Health Leukaemia Cancer Related Mum's plea to turn 'sorrow into hope' for daughter Wiltshire Fraudsters in £500k charity scam jailed Lancashire WATCH Souness joins 'butterfly skin girl' Isla on hospital trip Scotland More 'Call to action' issued across UK on measles Measles is likely to spread rapidly across more of the UK unless more people take up the vaccine, Dame Jenny Harries says.

My dog got an experimental immunotherapy for his Hemangiosarcoma tumor (which is incurable). Due to the advanced state of the tumor (he had to have his spleen removed in emergency surgery due to the tumor, plus it had spread to other organs), he was given a 2 - 4 month survival time, he's on month 4 now. There's not enough data to say if the immune therapy is helping (he's on traditional low-dose chemo as well), but it seems promising. The company (Torigen.com) is focused on animal treatment for now, but sees applications for humans in the future. reply tcbawo 4 hours agoparentI am sorry to hear about your dog. Pets can be an integral part of one's family, which often (sadly) goes unacknowledged. My first dog died of hemangiosarcoma. There were no treatments besides chemotherapy at the time. From a cursory search, your dog's treatment appears somewhat reasonably priced. Scientific progress is amazing. I hope the treatments go well. reply jackblemming 12 hours agoparentprevnext [16 more] [flagged] odyssey7 11 hours agorootparentTwo scenarios for testing experimental cancer therapies for dogs. Either you use the experimental therapy to treat cancers when they naturally occur in dogs, or you somehow give cancer to otherwise healthy dogs and then use the therapies to treat the cancer. reply Johnny555 12 hours agorootparentprevWell, medical decisions are rarely that clear cut... the source of the bleeding spleen was unknown. All we knew is that he was bleeding out from his spleen and based on the volume of fluid in his abdomen, he wouldn't survive until tomorrow. It was \"probably\" a tumor, but the ultrasound was not clear and if it was a tumor, there was a 60% chance it was cancer. And we had 30 minutes to decide whether or not to take the surgical slot as they couldn't hold it beyond then... if we didn't opt for surgery we'd need to euthanize the dog. So the choice was \"immediate death or surgery plus a 40% chance of returning to normal\". After the biopsy came back and it was Hemangiosarcoma, then we opted for the experimental treatment coupled with low-dose chemo, which had a low chance of side effects that affect quality of life. The experimental vaccine was both to hedge our bets (it wouldn't hurt, and it could help, especially if he developed side effects to the chemo and we had to stop the treatment), and to give the company a little more data on the effectiveness of their treatment (even if we had to pay for it). And indeed, he's had a good quality of life - he was fully recovered from the splenectomy in a week (though we had to keep him movement restricted for another week until the stitches came out), and so far he's 100% back to normal, showing no side effects from the chemo and his activity levels are still back to normal. reply m463 11 hours agorootparent> we had 30 minutes to decide The older I've gotten the more I've been in these kinds of situations. As a kid you are shielded from stuff, and it catches people so... unprepared. reply Johnny555 11 hours agorootparent>As a kid you are shielded from stuff, and it catches people so... unprepared. Yeah, I still remember my dad going in to the hospital one weekend for what he thought was heartburn, but mom made him go anyway... he didn't come home for 2 weeks after being admitted and receiving triple bypass cardiac surgery. In the dog's case, we thought he ate something bad, he was a little lethargic but otherwise seemed ok, no fever or anything... we almost decided to wait a couple days to see if he got over it before taking him to the vet. Even the vet seemed shocked when she came back in the room to tell us the diagnosis from the ultrasound. We never expected to be deciding whether he'd live or die that day. reply s1artibartfast 11 hours agorootparentprevIm not familiar with how animal medicene work. When you say it was an experimental treatment, does that mean your pet participated in a registered study by the manufacturer? If so, did the manufacturer pick up the cost? Alternatively, do you mean that the treatment was experimental because it was off label use, and outside of a study? reply Johnny555 11 hours agorootparentI encourage you to visit their website to learn more as I'm just interpreting what our oncologist told us about the Torigen vaccine. It's not part of a funded study so you have to purchase the vaccine and agree to let your vet provide followup information back to the company. Our dog's oncologist recommended it and said they've seen promising results in other patients, but wouldn't go so far as to say that it would prolong his life. The only published data I've seen from the company is a safety study. We got the vaccine mostly as a hedge in case the chemo didn't work or he had side effects and we had to discontinue it, but also to provide data back to the company on their vaccine in the hopes that it will help other animals or for future human applications. So yeah, I'm basically paying them for their research with the only thing I'm getting in return is possibly a longer lifespan for my dog (but there's very little data to prove that it works) reply s1artibartfast 11 hours agorootparentprevIt isnt the choice that I would make, but what other people do with their money is their own business, and the science may prove useful. However, those that call for state funded animal insurance, or mandates truly strike me as unhinged. reply Johnny555 10 hours agorootparent>However, those that call for state funded animal insurance, or mandates truly strike me as unhinged. I've never heard of such a thing, and a quick Google search didn't find anything -- is this a real movement, or something you heard from someone you know?

It isn't a real thing in that I haven't heard of any actual politicians advocating for it in the US. However, I just learned that mandatory pet This [1] and this [2[, were top non-sponsored results when I google searched \"manditory pet insurance\".

I'd hate to see the concept rejected outright based on that user's representation of it and the similarly uneducated discussion that followed. reply rideontime 8 hours agorootparentprevI volunteer with a cat rescue and was recently involved in a situation where a little girl had to give up her cats because her single father couldn't afford their vet bills, leading to one devastated child and two more homeless cats. It was one of the most heartbreaking experiences of my life. I can see how mandating pet health insurance might bring down the cost of it to the point that less privileged people would be able to have and keep their pets. Never heard of the idea before but it sounds great to me. reply s1artibartfast 6 hours agorootparentI don't know exactly what to say because I think I have polar opposite views of you. I think mandated pet insurance is more likely to increase the cost of owning a pet for everyone, and more likely to see that father in trouble with the law for violating it. That's without going into any of the economic and personal rights problems with making unaffiliated people pay for the care of other people's pets. reply timcobb 10 hours agorootparentprevYikes! Who knew this was a thing... reply mdp2021 15 hours agoprevCoincidentally, physicist Sabine Hossenfelder published on YT just hours ago about a new treatment - \"proton flashes\". > one of the most common ways to treat cancer is radiation therapy with x-rays ... You can use these highly energetic photons to kill off cancer cells. The difficulty really is ... killing the cancer cells without killing the patient - but the problem with using x-rays is that you can't shoot them at tumors inside the body without also burning some of the tissue on the way to the tumor and behind it... But you can use beams of other particles instead and this is where particle physics enters ... A beam of protons is far less likely to interact with tissue on short distances And it is still part of the \"kinder\" set (protons are \"kinder\" than x-rays). New Cancer Treatment With Proton Flashes Goes on Trial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K515uMQQzV4 reply bearjaws 14 hours agoparentI actually worked with MGH on their first proton treatment software for non cyberknife proton treatment. Later scaled it into AWS so their dosimetrists could iterate on treatment plans much faster. The initial treatments were incredibly successful and much easier on the patient, but theres no miracle either. Patients still suffer adverse reactions, and you will have margins of error, not to mention you do not have unlimited time to develop a treatment plan that is perfect. It's a time/efficacy trade off and the goal is to hit as much of the cancer as possible, while maintaining a SAFE dose of radiation, not a zero dose. What is a safe dose? Well, the more aggressive your cancer the higher that number gets too. Some patients still receive high dose radiation while on proton treatment simply because their cancer is that aggressive, typically suffering the same grade 1-2 diarrhea and vomiting as any other form of radiation. Proton treatment is far superior for most cancers, especially deeper cancers like colon and prostate. It's a living example of how tragic a new treatment option is, unfortunately proton centers are expensive to build and take years. So many people are still passing away from treatable disease and having to endure high dose chemotherapy in other cases. reply rdedev 13 hours agorootparentMy theory is that cancer is a precision recall problem. Our body has the tools to fight cancer but they need to be precise otherwise they would end up attacking normal cells. Our cells do not have as much high level view that we do. On the other hand if we see a skin cell inside the brain we know that's cancer. Hopefully we can build some treatments that lets us light up cancer cells and have our own cells take care of it. That being said it's easier said than done reply DrScientist 10 hours agorootparent> Hopefully we can build some treatments that lets us light up cancer cells and have our own cells take care of it. That's exactly what many of the new immunotherapies do. reply Wonnk13 6 hours agorootparentprevMGH being Mass General Hospital or something else? I only ask because I'm a colon cancer patient at Mass General. reply i_cannot_hack 14 hours agoparentprevWorth noting here is that \"proton flash therapy\" is a new therapy, but \"proton therapy\" is not. Proton therapy is a lot more recent than x-ray therapy, but still a conventional therapy. Flash therapy is the part is which just now entering clinical trials, where you treat the patient with ultra-high dose rates (so you deliver the same dose of radiation, but in maybe 90 ms instead of 90 seconds). There are indications that healthy cells are better at recovering from the ulra-high dose rate than tumor cells are, which means it would have a protective effect on healthy tissue, but the mechanism behind it is not known. The type of radiation is not specified, it can be protons, electrons, x-rays, etc. So \"proton flash therapy\" is a Flash therapy that uses protons. Other clinical trials are using electrons instead, i.e. \"electron flash therapy\". Edit: If anyone thinks this is interesting and is looking for work in Stockholm, my workplace develops simulation / treatment planning tools for radiation therapy (including proton therapy and flash therapy) and is currently recruiting C++ and C# developers: https://www.raysearchlabs.com/career/ reply riffraff 4 hours agorootparentThanks for explaining this, I'd heard of people being treated with proton beams already and it was pretty confusing to hear this was new and experimental. What are the theories as to why healthy cells recover better than tumor cells, if any? reply pgalvin 14 hours agoparentprevOn the topic of interesting Physics contributing to new cancer therapies, there is also Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (https://www.neutrontherapeutics.com/about-bnct/). I gather the gist of it is that it builds up boron isotopes around a tumour, then bombards it with neutrons that mostly pass through the body but interact far more with the boron isotopes. Energetic particles are emitted, have a low range, and hopefully kill just the cancer cells. Apparently all in less sessions than with X-ray or proton therapy. Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or medical physicist, I’m just fortunate enough to briefly use a machine intended for this purpose in separate nuclear physics studies. I believe BNCT has been done before with reactor sources of neutrons, but for some reason not as a standard treatment and there’s only one left in Taiwan for this purpose. The new development, afaik, is the ability to use accelerator neutron sources for this. Would love it if anybody knows more! reply pfdietz 6 hours agorootparentI asked my daughter the oncologist about this, and the better way of doing this is not to use boron as the payload, but rather some very powerful toxin. The toxin gets linked to a tumor-specific antibody. There are lots of targeted drugs of this kind being developed for various tumors. reply rngname22 14 hours agoparentprevIs there a way to like emit energy in a narrow beam from a bunch of different angles around a central target such that they only overlap in the center/target and the frequencies resonate in that location in such a way to reach a higher frequency past which there is a destructive effect but below which is safe and non-destructive? /knows nothing about physics reply thfuran 13 hours agorootparentThey're generally delivered sequentially rather than simultaneously, but that is standard practice. It means you can concentrate the dose in the target area, but constructive interference affects only intensity, not frequency. And photons will still interact pretty evenly along the whole path. reply dekhn 13 hours agorootparentprevhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosurgery there is a subtype called Gamma Knife which uses a large collection of emitters to effectively target a location while keeping other locations under a specific radiation threshold. reply at_a_remove 7 hours agorootparentprevI understand what you are getting at, but the short answer is no. The longer answer is something called The Superposition Principle. Essentially, waves (photons) pass through one another. The amplitude adds, but only at the intersection. The frequency does not change. (Consider the laser as the ultimate example of this) (Side note: The superposition principle does not always hold; however, the realms where the addition of MOAR PHOTONZ becomes non-linear are broadly incompatible with life) So, most techniques involve having many, many beams intersect so that the individual paths are only a little damaged while a specific spot where they all meet takes the hit. I met someone who specifically programs the machines that do this because there's a lot of math involved chucking radiation around irregular hunks of blood, meat, and bone, and the calculations are done because the first idea of \"just cross the streams\" works fine in a vacuum, but not so much in the human body. reply csdvrx 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, there is beam forming.

First, as many have noted, cancer is a constellation of diseases. Often a single tumor will contain multiple different, but related groups of cells. So most treatments will only work for a subset of cancers, and then only until the cancer evolves to be resistant. So any advance, will be necessarily “modest”, the reality of the situation is that there will never be a silver bullet. The closest we’ve come is immunotherapies, the class of treatment described in the article. These are a legitimately incredible advance, completely curing many people without the side effects of chemo. That said, theyre limited because cancer can evolve to defeat the immune response, and occasionally the immune system either under or over-reacts. Also if you think there’s no sense of urgency, you haven’t talked to anyone actually in the field. Do you really think oncologists (pediatric oncologists!) aren't eager to cure their patients? reply s1artibartfast 11 hours agorootparentPlus there is the existing financial incentive. If an individual or company comes up with a revolutionary treatment, it would be an absolute money printer. Even historic improvements for large demographics have massive returns.

Childhood cancer (mostly Leukemia) treatment in the USA is a well-organized country-wide clinical study aimed, at this point, at carefully reducing the amount of high-intensity chemo via replacing it with drugs like the one in the article, Blina. They have gotten so good at treating Leukemia that they are now optimizing for reducing the long-term negative health impacts that come as a result of the treatment. There are still tragic cases where the patients systems don't respond well, or there are complications as a result of compromised immune systems, but everything I have experienced points to major advancements and continued progress towards improving outcomes. reply im3w1l 2 hours agoparentprevMy pet idea is that rather than targetting cancer, we should be trying to find and correct DNA-errors before they become cancerous.

I take it they prefer to pump chemotherapy poison ito patients for financial reasons? reply anatnom 14 hours agoparentI took blinatumomab in 2015 (in my late 20s). It literally saved my life. However, the risks of blinatumomab were seen as much riskier than chemotherapy. Most notably, blinatumomab has a significant risk of triggering a cytokine storm[0], a frequently-fatal immune reaction cascade. When starting a cycle of blinatumomab, the hospital required that I be inpatient for 7 days and they checked my vitals at least once every two hours. (This was _miserable_ for my sleep schedule, which is already a mess when in the hospital.) My regimen was 7 days in the hospital, then 21 days at home constantly connected to the pump, then 7 days of recovery time before starting another cycle. At the time I took blinatumomab, I had already had unsuccessful treatments with two different chemo regimens. At the hospital system I was at, at least one failed chemo regimen was a pre-requisite for blinatumomab, as it was only indicated for \"refractory\" or \"recurrent\" cancers. I assume this is more related to the chance of acute death and (at the time) relative newness of blinatumomab compared to established chemotherapy regimens. (B-cell ALL is sadly very common in children, but this fortunately means that there is a LOT of funding research into the disease.) After going through 3 one-month cycles of blinatumomab, it was becoming less effective, but I was able to line up a allogenic stem cell transplant which has (knock on a thousand woods) kept me clean for the 8 years since. [0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine_storm reply pama 11 hours agorootparentAmazing story. Thanks for sharing. For all of us who work in drug discovery the hope is to hear cases like yours become more common and hopefully one day we can push cancer out of the range of common causes of death. There is still a ton of work to do. reply teamonkey 15 hours agoparentprevLiterally, yes. On the NHS, they will exhaust cheaper solutions that have a fair probability of working before trying more expensive ones. Age, long term prognosis, whether they have dependents, and some other factors are also considered. reply Traubenfuchs 13 hours agorootparent> dependants You mean ones life is valued more if one has children? reply dekhn 12 hours agorootparentThere's an entire subfield dedicated to calculating life values for making difficult decisions. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life I don't recall seeing having children as a variable in that valuation, it's typically more about how many years of work you continue to do, cast back into current dollars (\"present value lifetime earnings\", see https://escholarship.org/content/qt82d0550k/qt82d0550k.pdf?t...) and normalized for base rates. reply teamonkey 13 hours agorootparentprevIf you have young children that depend on you, yes. reply copperx 11 hours agorootparentDo they look up records? Is this ethical? Does this also happen in the US or other countries? reply teamonkey 28 minutes agorootparentIt’s the UK, they have the medical history. They also ask the patient about their situation. And I made it sound mechanical, but AI has not taken over all decisions like this yet. I believe it’s a discussion between a team of doctors where they are considering the humanity and ethics of the situation as well as the cost. Like, what would be the impact on the child/dependent if the parent was to die, do they have another parent or family members they can live with, can they fend for themselves, etc. reply BobaFloutist 11 hours agorootparentprevI mean, yeah. Of course it is. reply Traubenfuchs 16 minutes agorootparentMore children mean a bigger climate footprint. Also, some children will be net negative on the tax and societal side (violent criminals that will never be gainfully employed). So it's not black and white. And I at least pay more taxes than a family of 3, assuming all of them are, for example, \"just\" store clerks. So, what I want to say is, assuming we follow this value of life calculation, I am more valuable than this whole family of three. reply copperx 11 hours agorootparentprevNo, I wouldn't say a life with dependents has more value. However, I do think it should be prioritized over those without dependents. But that has nothing to do with inherent value. reply ceejayoz 15 hours agoparentprevIt'll be substantially cheaper in the UK. reply teamonkey 15 hours agorootparentFor those who need it will be free - but not to the health service, who do have to pay the sticker price. reply ceejayoz 11 hours agorootparentSticker price varies by country, and national health systems can negotiate those prices with quite a bit of market power. https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2022/11/how-much-does-the-united-s... > According to a 2021 study by the RAND Corporation, a non-profit global policy think tank, prices of prescription drugs in the U.S. are 2.4 times higher than the average prices of nine other nations (Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom). That higher cost is largely related to brand-name drugs, which are 4.9 times more expensive in the U.S. than in those countries. In fact, brand-name drugs are responsible for 84 percent of total drug costs in the United States despite accounting for only 8 percent of drugs dispensed. The US is just starting to negotiate pricing, beginning with ten specific drugs. Until 2022, it was illegal for Medicare to do so. https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/10/03/biden-harris-admin... reply mft_ 14 hours agorootparentprevI understand your cynicism, but let’s inject some actual data. The price that the manufacturer charges for a course of blinatumomab (in a different indication for adults, not that this is especially relevant in this discussion) is ~£56k [0] - so significantly lower than the price quoted from the US. NICE (the organisation which published the document referenced) exists to achieve value for money for the NHS for higher-priced and specialist treatments. If, following a thorough assessment, a medicine does not achieve the required value for money standard at the price proposed by the manufacturer, they are presented with two options: to not have the drug reimbursed in the UK at all, or to lower the effective price, so that the drug becomes cost-effective. [0] https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta589/documents/final-appra... reply AnthonyMouse 9 hours agorootparent> If, following a thorough assessment, a medicine does not achieve the required value for money standard at the price proposed by the manufacturer, they are presented with two options: to not have the drug reimbursed in the UK at all, or to lower the effective price, so that the drug becomes cost-effective. Which is effectively price controls, because the number of people with the money to pay out of pocket will be low, so the choice is essentially to sell at the regulated price or not at all. And the company would be crazy to choose the latter because the high cost is to pay for R&D, not manufacturing, so they'll never be better off to abandon the market than to take whatever they're offered. Then you have prices being set by the political system. If the regulators get captured by pharma companies (as would be likely if implemented in the US) they'd overpay when the drug isn't worth it. If not, the regulators would have all the leverage and very little reason not to set prices too low, reducing the incentive for R&D and causing more people to die. reply pfdietz 6 hours agorootparentThey have a disincentive to sell to other countries at a discount if those countries allow medical tourism from the US. They don't want US patients taking advantage of the lower cost there. reply refurb 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's not the real price in the UK because manufacturers will negotiate a confidential price with NICE. And the quoted price is not the price insurers pay in the US either. As someone who has worked in this space, the EU is lower than the US, but for oncology drugs the difference isn't that large. reply ben_w 15 hours agorootparentprevNHS is approximately a monopsony, which probably has some advantages for price negotiation. reply teamonkey 15 hours agorootparentA family member has had immunotherapy on the NHS and it was disclosed to them (not sure how reliable or accurate this is) that a single dose cost the NHS 4 figures. It needed several layers of approval for it to be administered. reply ben_w 14 hours agorootparentFor one of the same drugs discussed above by Traubenfuchs? If so, unless I've misread the discussion, that looks like 12-140 times cheaper depending on which drug and exactly where in the 1000-9999 GPB it was? reply wlesieutre 14 hours agorootparentPrices in earlier comment are per year, prices the NHS paid were per dose. Do we know how many doses per year? reply teamonkey 13 hours agorootparentIndeed it was per dose, and IIRC the figure was over £5000. It wasn’t intended to be public knowledge, I don’t think the patient was supposed to be shown it. The various supporting chemos ranged from below £100 to about £250/dose IIRC. I mention it because in the UK people don’t really understand that drugs can be really expensive. The assumption is that due to the scale of the NHS they’re heavily discounted or even free, and that the high prices mentioned by US folk is due to the unusual healthcare situation there. But there’s real money being paid by taxes, as well as procedures that determine whether you’re worth the expenditure. reply ben_w 13 hours agorootparentI'm sure some (many) make that kind of mistake, so it is worth pointing out. But also: > and that the high prices mentioned by US folk is due to the unusual healthcare situation there. Are they wrong? I keep hearing that the US government spends more per person on healthcare than the UK government, even though the US also has mostly private insurance on top of that and the UK mostly doesn't? reply teamonkey 12 hours agorootparentNot wrong at all. The NHS probably does barter discounts. But consider that a discount of 50% off $150k/yr would be incredible, yet still be a vast amount of money for a single treatment. reply ben_w 14 hours agorootparentprevThanks! That means I did misread. reply dogman144 12 hours agoparentprevThat poison chemo was and is a vast improvement on puberty-killing radiation, for instance. It’s a spectrum reply andy_xor_andrew 14 hours agoparentprevdumb question... is it purely the demand that makes it this expensive? The \"you need this or you die\" aspect? Or is the cost of research and manufacturing for this stuff so astronomical that it warrants such a high price? I almost don't want to even know... if I find out it costs only ~$5 to develop a dose, and they're charging $200k to dying people... ugh reply throwup238 14 hours agorootparentThere is zero chance it costs $5 per dose because blinatumomab is a bi-specific T cell engager which is a monoclonal antibody made by extracting it from a cloned white blood cell created from recombinant DNA. The yield for this process is extremely low and it's really complicated in the best of times. The cost of the pipette tips and other consumables used by the lab automation alone probably costs more. The flip side is that it treats a rare form of leukemia so the market isn't very big and since they can't lower the price enough to compete with chemo, they have to actually charge more to get their money back. For example chemo might cost $10k, but their drug costs $10k to make per person so if they charged $50k they might not even get enough customers to break even. So instead they charge $200k to get the most from the patients they can capture like the X% of patients who are allergic to the chemo drugs and have no choice (Just an example, I don't know the specifics for blinatumomab) reply seventytwo 14 hours agorootparentprevThe research, development, approval process, and production all absolutely cost money that needs to be recouped from the sale, but we shouldn’t ever forget the reason why the company exists: to make profit. reply konschubert 13 hours agorootparentYou also need to pay for all the other research projects that did NOT yield a successful drug. reply wahnfrieden 14 hours agorootparentprevIn other words, no it is not only supply and demand - it’s the desire to maximize profit as far as the market will bear reply daedrdev 14 hours agorootparentOr like the other response to your parent comment said, it could cost a ton to make, which lowers the number of people who can get it, driving costs even higher due to low volume. reply 1letterunixname 8 hours agoprevI'm interested in studies that address the 800 lbs. gorilla in the room: widespread over-nutrition with the post-WW2 \"Western diet\" is likely the primary suspected cause of a subset of cancers not seen in holdout individuals adhering to traditional diets and portion sizes that avoid too many calories and processed foods. My hypothesis is our immune system and cellular machinery can only effectively kill emergent cell lines under the assumption of sufficient cellular stress and restricted caloric intake. Chemotherapy are late substitute nuclear options, i.e., pausing cell division and/or clamping down on nutrient uptake pathways. I'd be curious to know if people who have endured famines, controlled for age, have lower (and/or higher) rates of some cancers in certain phases of their lives. reply jart 7 hours agoparentLife was not good for people who ate traditional diets. https://jacobin.com/2015/05/slow-food-artisanal-natural-pres... reply namuol 8 hours agoparentprevI’m new to this idea and NOT educated in biology let alone oncology, but here’s a meta study that suggests early exposure to famine is associated with increased cancer risks, if tenuously: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S127977072...). Of course looking at the effect of famine on an adult populations would do more to investigate your hypothesis than the effect on developing children. But famine seems a bit extreme, no? Aren’t there also regional studies that show regional dietary/nutritional factors that correlate with lower cancer rates? reply google234123 11 hours agoprevIf you otherwise completely healthy, wouldn’t you want to still keep the chemo therapy (even if it’s only a small asditional contribution) I’d want the greatest chance of winning reply andrenotgiant 5 hours agoparentChemo has tons of well-known long term negative effects.

Why not ecmo chemo only the combat zone? reply s1artibartfast 13 hours agoparentUsually the cancer cells are throughout the body, even if the tumors themselves have not spread. This is why you might cut out a solid tumor, and then give chemo reply rubberband 11 hours agorootparentFor me, they cut out most of a giant tumor, but couldn't get all of it without risking some vital organs. Then I got chemo for the rest. Interesting process. Usually the cancer cells are concentrated where the tumor is. One of the first things they may do upon diagnosis of cancer is a PET scan (which shows you where cancerous stuff is throughout your body). Life advice for all the young folks: don't get cancer. reply s1artibartfast 11 hours agorootparentmy understanding is that the word \"concentrated\" does a lot of heavy lifting, and modern thought is that most cancers started spreading cells all over the body, even at very early stages. metastatic cancer is a numbers game. for example. at stage 0-1, you might still have millions of cancer cells throughout your body, and there is a good chance your immune system can clean them up. At stages 2 or 3 there might be trillions of non-local cancer cells, with a proportionally greater chance of propagation. reply bglazer 13 hours agoparentprevAntibody drug conjugates are one attempt at doing this. Basically attach chemotherapy drugs to molecules (antibodies) that bind only to proteins on cancer cells reply Johnny555 13 hours agoparentprevWhen my dog had a subcutaneous form of cancer, one treatment discussed was local injection of a chemotherapy agent in the tumor area along with electrochemotherapy to help make the tumor more susceptible to the chemo treatment. We opted for surgical removal instead. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemotherapy reply rubberband 11 hours agoparentprevThere's \"topical\" chemo for some stuff, but it's uncommon. Most chemo is either in pill form, or (as was for me) delivered intravenously. So it goes through the whole body. Radiation therapy can target specific areas. It's still used instead of chemo in some cases. reply bluGill 13 hours agoparentprevThings like that are done where we can figure out how to get the drugs there.

    "originBody": "Chrome for Developers Blog What's New in WebGPU (Chrome 121) Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences. François Beaufort Support WebGPU on Android The Chrome team is excited to announce that WebGPU is now enabled by default in Chrome 121 on devices running Android 12 and greater powered by Qualcomm and ARM GPUs. Support will gradually expand to encompass a wider range of Android devices, including those running on Android 11 in a near future. This expansion will be dependent on further testing and optimization to ensure a seamless experience across a broader range of hardware configurations. See issue chromium:1497815. WebGPU sample running on Chrome for Android. Use DXC instead of FXC for shader compilation on Windows Chrome now uses the power of DXC (DirectX Compiler) to compile shaders on Windows D3D12 machines equipped with SM6+ graphics hardware. Previously, WebGPU relied on FXC (FX Compiler) for shader compilation on Windows. While functional, FXC lacked the feature set and performance optimizations present in DXC. Initial testing shows a 20% average increase in compute shader compilation speed when using DXC compared to FXC. Timestamp queries in compute and render passes Timestamp queries allow WebGPU applications to measure precisely (down to the nanosecond) how much time their GPU commands take to execute compute and render passes. They are heavily used to gain insights into the performance and behavior of GPU workloads. When the \"timestamp-query\" feature is available in a GPUAdapter, you can now do the following things: Request a GPUDevice with the \"timestamp-query\" feature. Create a GPUQuerySet of type \"timestamp\". Use GPUComputePassDescriptor.timestampWrites and GPURenderPassDescriptor.timestampWrites to define where to write timestamp values in GPUQuerySet. Resolve timestamp values into a GPUBuffer with resolveQuerySet(). Read timestamp values back by copying the results from the GPUBuffer to the CPU. Decode timestamp values as a BigInt64Array. See the following example and issue dawn:1800. const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter(); if (!adapter.features.has(\"timestamp-query\")) { throw new Error(\"Timestamp query feature is not available\"); } // Explicitly request timestamp query feature. const device = await adapter.requestDevice({ requiredFeatures: [\"timestamp-query\"], }); const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder(); // Create a GPUQuerySet which holds 2 timestamp query results: one for the // beginning and one for the end of compute pass execution. const querySet = device.createQuerySet({ type: \"timestamp\", count: 2 }); const timestampWrites = { querySet, beginningOfPassWriteIndex: 0, // Write timestamp in index 0 when pass begins. endOfPassWriteIndex: 1, // Write timestamp in index 1 when pass ends. }; const passEncoder = commandEncoder.beginComputePass({ timestampWrites }); // TODO: Set pipeline, bind group, and dispatch work to be performed. passEncoder.end(); // Resolve timestamps in nanoseconds as a 64-bit unsigned integer into a GPUBuffer. const size = 2 * BigInt64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT; const resolveBuffer = device.createBuffer({ size, usage: GPUBufferUsage.QUERY_RESOLVEGPUBufferUsage.COPY_SRC, }); commandEncoder.resolveQuerySet(querySet, 0, 2, resolveBuffer, 0); // Read GPUBuffer memory. const resultBuffer = device.createBuffer({ size, usage: GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DSTGPUBufferUsage.MAP_READ, }); commandEncoder.copyBufferToBuffer(resolveBuffer, 0, resultBuffer, 0, size); // Submit commands to the GPU. device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]); // Log compute pass duration in nanoseconds. await resultBuffer.mapAsync(GPUMapMode.READ); const times = new BigInt64Array(resultBuffer.getMappedRange()); console.log(`Compute pass duration: ${Number(times[1] - times[0])}ns`); resultBuffer.unmap(); Due to timing attack concerns, timestamp queries are quantized with a resolution of 100 microseconds, which provides a good compromise between precision and security. In Chrome browser, you can disable timestamp quantization by enabling the \"WebGPU Developer Features\" flag at chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu-developer-features during the development of your app. See Timestamp queries quantization to learn more. As GPUs may reset the timestamp counter occasionally, which can result in unexpected values such as negative deltas between timestamps, I recommend you check out the git diff changes that adds timestamp query support to the following Compute Boids sample. Compute Boids sample featuring timestamp query. Default entry points to shader modules To improve the developer experience, you can now omit the entryPoint of your shader module when creating a compute or render pipeline. If no unique entry point for the shader stage is found in the shader code, a GPUValidationError will be triggered. See the following example and issue dawn:2254. const code = ` @vertex fn vertexMain(@builtin(vertex_index) i : u32) -> @builtin(position) vec4f { const pos = array(vec2f(0, 1), vec2f(-1, -1), vec2f(1, -1)); return vec4f(pos[i], 0, 1); } @fragment fn fragmentMain() -> @location(0) vec4f { return vec4f(1, 0, 0, 1); }`; const module = myDevice.createShaderModule({ code }); const format = navigator.gpu.getPreferredCanvasFormat(); const pipeline = await myDevice.createRenderPipelineAsync({ layout: \"auto\", vertex: { module, entryPoint: \"vertexMain\" }, fragment: { module, entryPoint: \"fragmentMain\", targets: [{ format }] }, vertex: { module }, fragment: { module, targets: [{ format }] }, }); Support display-p3 as GPUExternalTexture color space You can now set \"display-p3\" destination color space when importing a GPUExternalTexture from HDR videos with importExternalTexture(). Check out how WebGPU handles color spaces. See the following example and issue chromium:1330250. // Create texture from HDR video. const video = document.querySelector(\"video\"); const texture = myDevice.importExternalTexture({ source: video, colorSpace: \"display-p3\", }); Memory heaps info To help you anticipate memory limitations when allocating large amounts during the development of your app, requestAdapterInfo() now exposes memoryHeaps information such as the size and type of memory heaps available on the adapter. This experimental feature is accessible only when the \"WebGPU Developer Features\" flag at chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu-developer-features is enabled. See the following example and issue dawn:2249. const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter(); const adapterInfo = await adapter.requestAdapterInfo(); for (const { size, properties } of adapterInfo.memoryHeaps) { console.log(size); // memory heap size in bytes if (properties & GPUHeapProperty.DEVICE_LOCAL) { /* ... */ } if (properties & GPUHeapProperty.HOST_VISIBLE) { /* ... */ } if (properties & GPUHeapProperty.HOST_COHERENT) { /* ... */ } if (properties & GPUHeapProperty.HOST_UNCACHED) { /* ... */ } if (properties & GPUHeapProperty.HOST_CACHED) { /* ... */ } } Adapter info memory heaps shown on https://webgpureport.org. Dawn updates The HasWGSLLanguageFeature and EnumerateWGSLLanguageFeatures methods on wgpu::Instance have been added to handle WGSL language features. See issue dawn:2260. The non-standard wgpu::Feature::BufferMapExtendedUsages feature lets you create a GPU buffer with wgpu::BufferUsage::MapRead or wgpu::BufferUsage::MapWrite and any other wgpu::BufferUsage. See the following example and issue dawn:2204. wgpu::BufferDescriptor descriptor = { .size = 128, .usage = wgpu::BufferUsage::MapWritewgpu::BufferUsage::Uniform }; wgpu::Buffer uniformBuffer = device.CreateBuffer(&descriptor); uniformBuffer.MapAsync(wgpu::MapMode::Write, 0, 128, [](WGPUBufferMapAsyncStatus status, void* userdata) { wgpu::Buffer* buffer = static_cast(userdata); memcpy(buffer->GetMappedRange(), data, sizeof(data)); }, &uniformBuffer); The following features have been documented: ANGLE Texture Sharing, D3D11 multithread protected, Implicit Device Synchronization, Norm16 texture formats, Timestamp Query Inside Passes, Pixel Local Storage, Shader Features, and Multi Planar Formats.

I don't have a particular need of nanosecond granularity timestamps for WebGPU- there are other parts of the web stack where I could really use better time measurement- but I understand the security concern and it's far better to be safe than sorry.

That is a useful distinction since you can use WebGPU outside of the browser by embedding Dawn or wgpu into your own application, and there you should get the maximum resolution the spec allows for. Environments like Electron might also opt-out of that timing attack mitigation since they're intended to run trusted code.

I've done experiments with subgroups suggesting approximately a 2.5x speedup for sorting (using the WLMS technique of Onesweep). Binding arrays will be very helpful for rendering images in the compute shader. A caveat is that descriptor indexing is not supported on mid-old phones like Pixel 4, but it is on Pixel 6. I somewhat doubt device buffer address will be supported, as I think the security aspect is complicated (it resembles a raw pointer), but it's possible they'll figure out how to do it. reply 2OEH8eoCRo0 13 hours agoparentprevIn 2034 it'll be as dead as Flash because of security issues. reply mschuetz 12 hours agorootparentNot really, that is not the problem of WebGPU.

Also note that for an unstable graphics driver, the way you usually crash the system is by touching memory you shouldn't (through the rendering API), which is definitely something that could be exploited by an attacker. It could also corrupt pages that later get flushed to disk and destroy data instead of just annoy you. Though I am skeptical as to whether it would happen, security researchers have previously come up with some truly incredible browser exploit chains in the past, so I'm not writing it off. reply mschuetz 12 hours agorootparentWebGL has been around for more than a decade and didn't turn out to be a security issue, other than occasionally crashing tabs. Neither will WebGPU be. reply csande17 11 hours agorootparentBy exposing vulnerable graphics drivers to arbitrary web code, WebGL has allowed websites to take screenshots of your desktop (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2013-8...) and break out of virtual machines (https://blog.talosintelligence.com/nvidia-graphics-driver-vu...), to use two examples I found via a web search. reply fourside 12 hours agorootparentprevVery curious what you see as the problems with WebGPU currently.

Very exciting! Although I think that relaxing memory limitations and providing more visibility and control there is even more important for running ML on the web right now. And harder to make progress on because there isn't a single team that clearly owns \"all memory management\". reply fidotron 13 hours agoprevWhat will be curious about WebGPU getting wider Android deployment is if it results in reducing the effect of variation in the drivers, which very much remain a headache. For example, WebGL type API implementations have had a somewhat flexible idea about data sizes and layout which due to the nature of WebGPU are much less acceptable there. One of the big wins of Vulkan has been that it has levelled the playing field somewhat and poor drivers have less of an impact. I think a lot of people will be disappointed by what proportion of devices currently in the wild actually successfully make this jump because it is under appreciated the extent to which shortcuts have been taken.

As jsheard said the older exynos devices will work because they're Mali-based. The newer RDNA3-based devices aren't enabled by default simply because our team hasn't been able to sufficiently test on them yet. Same goes for Tegra or PowerVR GPUs. It's entirely a question of spending the time to ensure they're performing as expected (and probably implementing a few workarounds) and not a comment on the quality of the GPUs themselves. That said, we know that these GPUs are in an increasing number of flagship devices, which makes them a higher priority for official support in future releases. reply pjmlp 4 hours agorootparentFirst of all thank for the effort. Secondly, this was a big issue plaguing WebGL adoption, as contrary to native APIs, devices get blacklisted and telling common users to access browser flags is not an option for most products. Hence why game studios are so keen on streaming instead. reply jsheard 13 hours agoparentprevIt should work on slightly older or lower end Exynos chips, which have ARM Mali GPUs. Their switch to AMD RDNA was a fairly recent thing, and so far it has only been integrated into their flagship-tier parts. reply eschaton 13 hours agoprevWhat’s the actual utility of this for anyone that isn’t trying to replace native code with web pages? Is this ever going to be worth the no doubt massive investment it required? reply fidotron 13 hours agoparentIt should enable much more performant (and battery friendly) 3D content on the web. WebGL has a level of synchronization in the main render loop of the browser that is just not the right way to do it, and WebGPU fixes that. Additionally it is more suited to GPU based compute, which can be used to accelerate neural network inferencing, though not quite as well as dedicated NN accelerators which are fairly common these days. I would tend to agree that the business case for these things is not as strong as many would like though, and things have a distinct habit of ceasing to be interesting the moment they are widely achievable. reply eschaton 5 hours agorootparentSo there’s no real use case.

Brian Potter Jan 18, 2024 94 Share this post What Happened to the US Machine Tool Industry? www.construction-physics.com Copy link Facebook Email Note Other 8 Share Machine tools – machines that cut or form metal – are the heart of industrial civilization. Sometimes called “mother machines” (because they’re machines that make other machines), machine tools are required to make almost everything. Nearly every manufactured good is made using machine tools, or by machines which were made using machine tools: “Thus an automobile is an assembly of metal parts made by machine tools, plastic parts produced by machines made by machine tools, fabric processed on textile machines made by machine tools, rubber processed and molded by equipment made on machine tools, and glass processed by equipment produced by machine tools.” – Anderson Ashburn, Is New Technology Enough? Being able to manufacture machine tools is often considered an important capability for an industrialized country. Not only does this provide ready access to the latest manufacturing technology, but it ensures production of munitions and other military equipment won’t be bottlenecked by a lack of machine tools. This isn’t a hypothetical concern: American production of artillery shells for Ukraine has been held back by a lack of machine tools. The military has thus historically paid close attention to the machine tool industry and the availability of machinists. For most of the 20th century, the US was unrivaled in its machine tool technology, and as late as the early 1980s it was the largest machine tool producer in the world.. But almost overnight, the industry collapsed: annual machine tool shipments declined by more than 50% in 2 years, hundreds of machine tool companies went out of business, and the US slipped from the largest producer in the world to the 4th or 5th (depending on the year), roughly where it remains today. What happened to the US machine tool industry? Why did it fall so far so quickly? Let’s take a look. The early machine tool industry Machine tools include metal cutting machines like lathes, milling machines, drill presses, grinding machines, as well as things like wire-bending machines, stamping machines, die-casting presses, and forging machinery.1 Tools like lathes and drills have been in use for thousands of years, but modern machine tools – “power-driven machines with methods of control permitting some degree of precision” – first appeared in Britain at the beginning of the industrial revolution. Watt’s famous steam engine was made possible by the precision boring machine built by John Wilkinson to precisely bore the cylinders for it. In the US, machine tools were a critical component of the “American System of Manufactures” – interchangeable or near-interchangeable parts produced using a series of specialized machines. This method of manufacturing was first developed for the production of guns (and was thus sometimes known as “armory practice”), and gradually spread to America’s burgeoning industries: sewing machines, locomotives, and especially bicycles. By the turn of the 20th century, thanks to decades of innovation the US was producing the most advanced machine tools in the world. US technological leadership continued with the rise of the automobile, which created an unprecedented demand for machine tools. As early as 1910, the car industry made up 30% of machine tool sales, which only increased as car sales exploded and car manufacturers adopted mass-production methods (annual car sales went from less than 200,000 in 1910 to 3.7 million in 1925). The car industry required enormous numbers of machine tools (Ford alone eventually had more than 50,000 machine tools in its Rouge assembly plant, roughly as many machine tools as the entire US made in a year), but the demands of car manufacturing pushed machine tool technology forward. Making cars required heavier, more accurate machine tools that could produce more accurate gears, better ball bearings, smoother finishes, and tighter tolerance parts. Machine tool technology was also advanced by the rise of electrification, which enabled machines driven by a series of belts and drive shafts to a central steam engine to be replaced by machines driven by their own electric motor. Between 1910 and 1929, machine tool sales nearly quadrupled, and machines continued to get more and more productive. Via The US Machine Tool Industry From 1900 to 1950 Machine tool sales were dragged down by the Depression, but bounced back as production of munitions and military hardware for WWII ramped up (the war also marked the birth of the aerospace industry as the second great consumer of machine tools after the car industry). Annual shipments of machine tools went from 50,000 in 1929, to 5,500 in 1932, to 300,000 by 1942. Over the course of the war, the US produced 800,000 machine tools, and the US emerged from WWII as the largest producer of machine tools in the world. The post-war machine tool industry The machine tool industry was shaped by extreme cyclicality: orders for new machine tools might fluctuate 90% year-over-year. This was driven by what’s sometimes known as the “accelerator effect”: a small change in the demand for final goods can cause a large change in the demand for the machines that produce those goods: Consider a company that manufactures its product on lathes. Assume that it has ten lathes that can just meet production requirements. Assume also that each lathe wears out in ten years and that the company has its investment plans so well organized that one lathe is replaced every year. Now consider what will happen if there is a 10 percent increase in demand for the product. The plant will need eleven lathes to meet production requirements. It will have to buy two lathes: one as a replacement for the worn-out lathe and a second to increase capacity. Thus a 10 percent increase in the demand for the product has produced a 100 percent increase in the demand for lathes. Of course, the accelerator effect is also felt in the other direction. If the demand for the product declines 10 percent, the company will need only nine lathes. In view of the reduced sales volume, it will almost certainly not replace the lathe that has worn out. Thus a 10 percent decline in demand for the product has caused a 100 percent decrease in the demand for lathes. In the real world the relationships are not as neat as in this hypothetical case, but the accelerator effect is a very real factor. – Is New Technology Enough? This accelerator effect is exacerbated by the fact that machine tools, properly maintained, can last for decades or even longer (the US is still using the 50,000 ton forging press built in 1955 as part of the heavy press program, for instance). An owner of a machine tool can thus put off replacing it almost indefinitely if demand for the product that requires it is uncertain. The machine tool industry was wracked by such fluctuations in the post-war period. It entered a four-year slump at the end of the war, as wartime demand fell off and the US government sold off huge numbers of surplus machines at rock-bottom prices. Sales then picked back up during the Korean War, fell off again when the armistice was signed, then picked back up, then declined again in the recession of 1958. But the US remained at the technological forefront during this period, and continued to lead the world in machine tool production. Shifts in the landscape: technology, ownership, competition In the 1960s, the machine tool industry underwent several major shifts. The first was the development of numerical control. Prior to the 1950s, there were generally two ways that a machine tool could be controlled. A skilled machinist could manually move the tool and/or the part to be machined to cut it into the proper shape, drill the proper holes, and so on. Alternately, a machine tool could be mechanically automated. Ford, in pursuit of ever-greater efficiencies on the Model T assembly line, built and acquired dozens of different automated and semi-automated machine tools for tasks such as making screws, boring piston heads, and drilling engine blocks. This sort of automatic machinery had been around since the 19th century, but it was somewhat fixed in the tasks it could perform. The machines couldn’t easily be changed to produce something else without substantially rebuilding the machine (these sorts of difficulties are why Ford had to shut the Rouge factory down for 6 months to retool when changing from the Model T to the Model A, and why auto producers were so interested in robotic welding).2 This changed with the development of numerical control, or NC. With NC, the movements of a machine could be encoded on a paper tape or a punched card. Changing the movements of the machine (and thus what the machine produced) just required feeding the machine a new tape with a different set of instructions. Numerical control was first developed by MIT’s Servomechanism Lab in conjunction with the Air Force in the 1950s. Early on, the technology had little commercial appeal: it was expensive, complex, unreliable, and designed to solve specific complex fabrication problems in aerospace manufacturing, rather than the simpler machining needs that made up the bulk of machine tool demand. NC technology is sometimes described as “developed from the roof instead of from the foundation”. But that started to change by the early 1960s: machine tool manufacturers began to produce more reliable machines designed for broader commercial appeal (though the technology remained very expensive). In 1958, Kearney and Trecker introduced its Milwaukee-matic, the first of what became an entirely new category of machine tool, the machining center. A machining center contained a tool-changer with dozens of different specialized cutting tools, and could be programmed via numerical control to perform a series of machining operations, automatically changing to different cutting tools as required. This greatly increased efficiency: a typical machine tool was only operational 25-30% of the time, with much of the rest of the time spent setting up the machine and prepping the part to be worked. But Kearney and Trecker boasted that the Milwaukee-matics were operational more than 75% of the time. And because of its ability to flexibly mount different cutting tools quickly and automatically, a machining center could perform tasks which previously required many different machines. Milwaukee-matic in the late 50s or early 60s. Early NC machines used vacuum tubes, and required large bulky control cabinets as large as the machine tool itself. But NC rode the wave of rapidly improving computer technology: vacuum tubes and paper tapes were replaced by transistor-based minicomputers, and then even smaller microprocessor-based computers, resulting in Computer Numerical Control, or CNC. NC was adopted slowly: by 1968, just 10% of US metalworking plants had an NC machine, and they made up just 0.5% of total machine tools in the US. But it was clearly becoming a manufacturing mainstay: already by 1968 NC made up 20% of new machine tool sales in the US, and by 1983 had risen to over 40%. The second major change to the machine tool industry was its ownership. Historically, machine tool companies were small operations run by people (often descendants of the original founders) who had spent their whole life in the machine tool industry and knew it inside and out. Because of the cyclical nature of the industry, machine tool firms tended to be managed conservatively, and they operated with little debt. But in the 1960s, machine tool companies began to be acquired by the latest fashion in US business, the conglomerate: enormous, diversified companies that seemed to make anything and everything as long as there was profit in it. The machine tool industry was on a sales upswing that showed no signs of slowing, and machine tool firms' high profitability (and low debts) made them attractive acquisitions for the conglomerates. Additionally, the rise of NC technology made the industry seem sexy and futuristic, and many large conglomerates (like Teledyne, Litton Industries, and Bendix) had defense and aerospace divisions, to which machine tools seemed like a natural addition. The third major shift in the machine tool industry was the rise of foreign producers, especially Japan. Japan’s machine tool industry had been devastated by the war and the immediate aftermath (when many of Japan’s machine tools were shipped to China and the Philippines as war reparations), and by 1955 Japanese tools were just 0.5% of world exports. But Japan was eager to become a major producer of machine tools, and its manufacturers quickly became more capable. Between 1955 and 1960 Japanese machine tool production rose by a factor of 15, and in 1960 American Machinist magazine noted that “Japanese machines for the first time appear to merit recognition and to be competitive with machines of the most advanced industrial nations.” By the end of the 1960s, imports remained a small fraction of the US market (around 10%), but were gaining momentum: between 1964 and 1967, Japanese machine tool exports to the US rose over 1200%. Fall of the US industry From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, these trends coalesced in a way that proved disastrous for the US machine tool industry. Japan had jumped on the NC bandwagon quickly, and began manufacturing NC tools as early as the 1950s. Their progress was aided by dozens of American machine tool firms that were all too willing to license their technology to Japanese producers. (Japanese companies were also not above simply illicitly duplicating American designs). By the end of the 1960s, Japanese machine tool manufacturers were exporting NC tools to the US. With NC, US machine tool makers had primarily focused on the high end of the market, using advances in computers and other technology to create increasingly precise machines capable of tracing complex paths, and tailoring the machines to the needs of individual customers (as was common in the US machine tool industry). This focus was in part due to the guiding hand of the air force and the aerospace industry, which demanded these types of machines for production of advanced parts. Japanese builders, on the other hand, developed simpler, cheaper NC machines based on standardized designs, aimed at the large, untapped lower end of the market that previously couldn’t justify the cost of an expensive NC machine. And a focus on simpler, standardized designs, along with the traditional Japanese focus on quality, also meant that Japanese tools tended to be more reliable than US tools. One example of Japanese standardization was controllers, the electronic components used to control the movement of the machine tools. In the US, there were many different suppliers of controllers, and many machine tool builders (like Cincinnati Milacron, Pratt and Whitney, and Warner and Swasey) offered their own, custom-built controllers to try and achieve a competitive advantage. In Japan, on the other hand, the market quickly became dominated by a single producer, FANUC. Not only were Japanese controllers cheaper, but a single standard likely meant that programming the machines and training people to use them was greatly simplified, as there was no re-learning process involved when switching to a different type of control. Not only were the Japanese building more reliable, less expensive tools than the US builders, but they were delivering them faster. Historically, machine tool companies had dealt with the cyclicality of the industry by acquiring a large backlog of orders, then working it down during the lean times when new orders slowed. When a customer ordered a new machine tool, it might take a year or two (or more) for it to be delivered. One US manufacturer of lathes noted that it built just one size of lathe a month: if you ordered a lathe in February that was only made in January, you’d have no choice but to wait a year for them to build it again. But Japanese builders, with their focus on standardized machine designs, could deliver machine tools in weeks: “A Pennsylvania company sorely needed a cylindrical grinder, but was told that delivery of a $50,000 American machine would take at least a year. So the company decided to order from a distributor of Japanese tools. Within weeks, it had two Japanese grinders in operation for almost the same price.” – Max Holland, When The Machine Stopped As Japanese machine tools were advancing, US firms were struggling. Though the conglomerates enjoyed owning machine tool firms in the boom times when profits were high, they quickly became disillusioned during the lean periods when new orders slowed to a trickle. The new owners’ focus on profits meant that they were reluctant to make the long-term investments in R&D or new equipment needed to keep the firms competitive. Between 1968 and 1978, the book value of assets of machine tool companies declined by nearly 50% in real terms. Via Military Spending and Industrial Decline Conglomerates were often quick to divest their machine tool holdings when the companies began to struggle, resulting in frequent management changes and organizational whiplash as the firms tried to find their footing under new ownership. Storied machine tool manufacturer Warner and Swasey, for instance, was acquired by Bendix in 1980, which then sold it to Allied Corporation in 1983 as part of an effort to fight a hostile takeover from Martin Marietta. Just one year later in 1984, Allied then sold its machine tool group, including Warner and Swasey, to Cross and Trecker, which in turn was bought by Giddings and Lewis in 1991, which then decided to shut down Warner and Swasey the next year. This sort of management shuffling often took place at conglomerates even when ownership didn’t change, as the companies reorganized internally in the face of losses to try and right what they saw as a sinking ship. Constant pressure to hit quarterly performance targets meant that machine quality often suffered. In some cases, machines would be shipped out the door unfinished so the delivery could be booked, and assembly would be completed by service technicians at the customer’s location. In his history of the American machine tool industry, Albert Albrecht states that “the actions of these larger corporations and conglomerates, under the leadership of financial MBA’s, perhaps more than any other factor, contributed to the restructuring and decline of the US machine tool industry at the end of the 20th century.” Amidst these struggles, US machine tool builders fell behind technologically. Not only did they lag in the design of low-cost NC machines, but they were well behind Japan in the adoption of microprocessor-based controllers. A 1983 National Research Council Report summarized the situation: “While many in the industry are convinced that U.S. machine tool technology is presently equal to the most advanced level attained by any overseas competitor, the panel believes that the United States may now have slipped behind the Japanese on control technology and on the software to support such control systems. Additionally, the panel expressed concern that the Japanese are also more advanced in the general development of machining systems that allow round-the-clock operation with minimum human attention.” And Japan wasn’t the only country making progress. By 1970, Germany (which had always led the world in machine tool exports) had become the world’s largest machine tool producer (though the US would eclipse it again several years later). And between 1965 and 1980, Italy’s share of world machine tool output tripled. As late as 1973, imports of machine tools were just 10% of the US market, but by the end of the 1970s they had reached 22%. These trends came to a head in the recession of 1982. Machine tool sales dropped precipitously, falling from $5 billion in 1981 to just $2 billion in 1983. But this time, sales didn’t bounce back. By now, tools from Japan and other countries were as good as or better than US tools, not to mention cheaper and more reliable. A strong dollar made imports even cheaper by comparison, and high interest rates reduced the demand for capital investment. US manufacturers found themselves with uncompetitive products in a highly competitive market. Whereas imports had been just 10% of the US market in 1973, by the late 1990s they were closer to 60%, and by 1986 75% of NC machines were imports. Japan alone made up 50% of the US NC market in the late 1980s. Via The American Machine Tool Industry The US industry collapsed almost overnight. From 1981 to 1983 employment in machine tools declined by a third, and continued to fall (by 1991 it was half its 1981 level). Between 1982 and 1987, half of US machine tool firms closed their doors. The US fell from the largest machine tool builder in the world to third behind Japan and Germany, and continued to decline: by 2002, it had dropped to 5th behind Italy and China, where it remains today. The industry tried to get some of the same protectionist measures industries like steel had secured. Houdaille, an industrial conglomerate with a large machine tool division, attracted a great deal of attention with a petition to have the investment tax credit denied to Japanese machine tools. But the machine tool industry had much less success with its pleas for protectionism than the steel industry; Houdaille’s petition was denied, and while the industry was eventually able to get some Voluntary Export Restraints (which lasted from the late 80s to the early 90s), it did little to change the overall trends in the industry. Today, the US competes in a machine tool market that continues to be dominated by Japan, Germany, and now China. It has some bright spots, such as Haas Automation (founded in 1983, in the ashes of the industry’s collapse), but the major producers are all foreign companies. As of 2014, not a single one of the 10 largest machine tool companies in the world was a US company (Haas clocked in at number 13), a fact which as far as I know remains true today. The US is still a major purchaser of machine tools (2nd in the world behind China), but unlike for most of the 20th century, today its factories are full of machines made elsewhere. 1 There is something of an issue of definition here. Traditionally machine tools were just considered metal cutting machines, and things like die casting or stamping equipment would be categorized separately. 2 Some flexible machines did exist, such as the Blanchard lathe, which could duplicate the shape of any gunstock placed within it.

(construction-physics.com)209 points by jseliger 16 hours agohidepastfavorite185 comments mauvehaus 15 hours agoIf you're into machining, the American Precision Museum[0] in Windsor, VT is highly worth a visit. I had the good fortune to tour the Starrett factory some years back. They were still running pre-NC screw machines to make parts. It really is true that old machines, well cared for, will last just about forever. Apparently it's something of an axiom in the machining industry that tools that are no longer economically viable for large scale production end up in job shops where the capability is needed but there isn't a need to pump out volume. The Springfield Armory[1] is also a neat visit. For hopefully obvious reasons, their machining exhibits are focused on the production of weapons. The American Precision Museum is actually housed in a historic privately-owned gun factory. It turns out a lot of the progress in machining is driving by the need to make weapons.

It was quite an experience and the employees were some of the crustiest characters I've ever met. The second summer, I worked with this guy named Ray on a huge machine that made the heads to ratchet wrenches (the square part with the little ball). He was one of these guys that was continuously pissed off. A man's man probably only 35, but looked 45 and smoked Camel unfiltered cigarettes.

Because of the cyclical nature of the industry, machine tool firms tended to be managed conservatively, and they operated with little debt. … [In] the 1960s, machine tool companies began to be acquired by the latest fashion in US business, the conglomerate: enormous, diversified companies that seemed to make anything and everything as long as there was profit in it. The machine tool industry was on a sales upswing … [and] machine tool firms' high profitability (and low debts) made them attractive acquisitions for the conglomerates. … “Though the conglomerates enjoyed owning machine tool firms in the boom times when profits were high, they quickly became disillusioned during the lean periods when new orders slowed to a trickle. The new owners’ focus on profits meant that they were reluctant to make the long-term investments in R&D or new equipment needed… Conglomerates were often quick to divest their machine tool holdings when the companies began to struggle, resulting in frequent management changes and organizational whiplash… “In his history of the American machine tool industry, Albert Albrecht states that “the actions of these larger corporations and conglomerates, under the leadership of financial MBA’s, perhaps more than any other factor, contributed to the restructuring and decline of the US machine tool industry at the end of the 20th century”.” Bingo. The article points to cycles of high variance in demand for machine tools. Other commenters have pointed the dominance of foreign companies (eg Japan due to their national standardisation on FANUC), globalization and “more cost-effective to import” more generally, and also suggested America is in a “post-machining” stage of manufacturing. I think all of these claims have merit, but the real underlying cause is most certainly the humble MBA. To wit: they bought themselves into a cyclic industry, replaced the survivor-mindset management, and effectively took these resilient existing businesses and crystallized them into brittle conglomerates while the industry was on the rise of one such cycle, and when they where wholly unprepared for the inevitable down stage of the cycle, they divested, leaving a wasteland behind. reply georgeecollins 3 hours agoparentMBAs and financially driven management are why the US is such a poor country today.

Edit: I may have missed some sarcasm there. reply bane 14 hours agoprevI grew up in a family printing business. Printing is a manufacturing industry just like anything else, with equipment of various sorts at every step of the production chain. Even in the 80s, when the business was going strong, most of the equipment we used was from Germany or Japan. Sure there were a few odds and ends made in America, things like X-Acto knives, or wax melting machines or something. Paper, ink, and a few other chemicals used for various parts of the production processed were usually sourced from the U.S. or Canada IIR. But the presses, big cutting and binding machines? Every single one was from overseas: Heidelberg, Hamada, Ryobi, others. It was simply impossible to get machines of the quality and precision from the U.S. This often meant multi-week downtimes for aging machines that needed parts replaced or repaired, waiting for a single roller or a latch or something while it was shipped from the home country. As things moved more and more digital, the front-end equipment likewise became more and more foreign made. In my lifetime, the U.S. never owned the entire vertical supply and manufacturing chain in that industry. I'm not sure if it ever did. reply Kosirich 1 hour agoparentI grew up with a father who is/was an owner and director of a company that produces manufacturing printing rollers (gravure printing), mostly for packaging industry. He always competed against others on quality and flexibility as he couldn't on size, so having the best kit was important. The technology, even though the product is a discardable piece of packaging, is on NASA/CPU manufacturing level. Even though, I myself was never involved directly in it, nor am I today, I know from him there were several trends: 1) Printing companies in Europe and elsewhere got bigger. What use to be 10 printing companies, now it's 1. 2) Equipment manufacturers for that industry got bigger. What use to be 4,5 equipment manufacturers in EU/USA, now there is one. 3) Lasers. Lasers got to a level where they can compete and surpass mechanical removal on quality and speed. This is true also for industry I'm in. reply psychlops 15 hours agoprev> A strong dollar made imports even cheaper by comparison I think that summarizes the article. It has been cheaper to import, so we do.

I do think the relative dollar strength is a factor, but Chinese labour was effectively free vs US labour. If someone is willing to do work for free, then the economy will give them work. The issue that the free marketeers have been railing about for approximately the last 50 years it seems like almost every major policy the US adopts increases the cost of manufacturing relative to a hypothetical entity that didn't do that. It has been a constant adjustment of labour law, environmental law, energy policy and financial regulation away from manufacturing. It is plain why US manufacturing isn't the global top dog. The real question is whether it is a bad outcome or not. Over the last 50 years China has improved their energy use by 1 UK economy per capita. IMO we should also ask more seriously if those regulations were worth it. A UK per capita energy is a lot of QoL improvements and it was linked to doing a lot of manufacturing. The US on the other hand is behaving politically like people are worse off than they were. reply bmitc 6 hours agorootparent> The real question is whether it is a bad outcome or not. It's definitely bad. The U.S. won't even have the world's biggest navy pretty soon because of that.

Outside of the problem countries like China and Russia, we have military alliances with nearly every country on earth.. US has somewhere around 450 Navy vessels..

Except Japan has another 150, Australia has 50 more, the UK has 70 more, Spain has 150, France 180, Korea has 160, if some war ever comes down to the sheer number of available ships -- it literally won't matter who has more since the nukes will have flown long before some Canadian frigate is exchanging fire with some Chinese gunboat. reply wolverine876 4 hours agorootparentAlso, number of ships doesn't mean too much. I could buy 1,000 canoes. And tonnage only means a bit more - there is plenty of tonnage in old ships rusting at docks. Naval power isn't easily measured with statistics. The capabilities of a single US 100,000 ton aircraft carrier overwhelms entire fleets, unless their capabilities include long-range anti-ship missiles or submarines. Then adding tonnage won't help the US; they need capabilities to counter those two threats. reply oneshtein 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, but you forgot about informational war, which started long before direct armed conflict.

In the mid-20th century it was, but those are the 'good old days'. We don't want a mid-20th century economy.

The dollar as a reserve currency gives the US a ton of global leverage but requires a trade deficit thus it comes at the expense of domestic industries. reply specialist 14 hours agorootparentI'd love to understand statements like this. Lemme try: Because trade deficits induce demand for dollars? Like how Japan and now China hold a bajillion US dollars? So if the US had (prolonged) trade surplus, no one would be holding dollars? But wouldn't trade partners still need US dollars to buy US goods? Like the situation post-WWII? So then we'd \"loan\" partners US dollars to buy our stuff? Aiugh. My brain just broke. How does a noob like me learn about these systems. I know it all probably makes sense to the learned. But with my folk (mis)understanding, these claims sound counterintuitive. Thanks. reply nostrademons 10 hours agorootparentYou're on the right track. In a normal, non-reserve-currency situation, the demand for a country's currency is proportional to the demand for its products. After all, that's what you use a currency for: to buy the products that are sold in that currency. This has a well-behaved equilibrium, because if a country produces a lot of good products, that means the value of its currency will rise, which makes goods developed in that country relatively more expensive, which cuts demand, until everything equilibrates at a point which is roughly reflective of the actual quality and productivity of the country. In a reserve-currency situation, the currency is used for many things other than buying the products of the country. For example, oil is priced in dollars; if India wants to buy oil from Saudi Arabia, it needs dollars to make the transaction, and then Saudi Arabia has an excess of dollars. Frequently it uses these to buy U.S. T-bills or invest in American tech startups like Uber or WeWork, both other sources of demand for dollars. The dollar is basically the currency of the global financial system: instead of directly converting rupee to riyal, you convert rupee to dollars, handle your transaction, and then convert dollars to riyal. This creates a large source of demand for dollars outside of the traditional market for a national currency. Indeed, America's export here is basically financial services, which as a sector has been doing great since 1990, one of the few areas where you're likely to get paid handsomely. The other area is tech, which at its core is about enabling these cross-border commerce flows - Amazon, Google, Facebook, UpWork, Stripe, CoinBase, Ripple, Stellar, PayPal, E-bay, Shopify, AirBnB are all about creating global marketplaces where you can buy anything from anywhere. Finance and tech crowd out everthing else that you would normally use dollars for. Basically America has specialized in being the global marketplace - it's only purpose is to be the common standard that every other country needs to transact in. Because there's so much demand for dollars simply to do international transactions, it pushes the price of the dollar up. This makes everybody who's trying to sell actual things in dollars (rather than take a commission when other people sell things in dollars) uncompetitive. It works great, until the rest of the world decides that it wants to cut out the middleman. At that point, since we don't produce anything anymore, we're screwed. America's basically given itself Dutch Disease, where our only viable industry is financial services. reply FirmwareBurner 10 hours agorootparent>It works great, until the rest of the world decides that it wants to cut out the middleman. Isn't this why the US invests in having the world's biggest military by a long margin, plus the world's most powerful spy agencies? To make sure nobody dares cut them out of their privileged position otherwise they get a dose full of aircraft carriers, F-35 and B-2s after the NSA finds out what their plans is from the spyware they put in their iPhone. reply nostrademons 10 hours agorootparentYes, exactly. The challenge - alluded to in the article - is that having a functional military requires a domestic manufacturing base and machine tool industry. The U.S. generally tries to keep its arms manufacturing in-house, for obvious national security reasons. But even if you've kept the existing defense contractors alive, you lose out on the ability to repurpose the country's civilian manufacturing base if it doesn't exist. This was pretty critical in WW2: General Motors made more TBM Avengers than Grumman, Chrysler made more tanks than all German manufacturers combined, Kaiser made Liberty Ships by the hundreds. Without the ability to quickly tool up, you'll end up defeated in any war of attrition. There's a pretty significant risk that we'll find out that the U.S. is a paper tiger if it comes to any sort of prolonged war with a near-peer power. reply FirmwareBurner 9 hours agorootparent>Without the ability to quickly tool up, you'll end up defeated in any war of attrition. Why is this a risk? The biggest tool makers in the world are Germany and Japan which are in the US sphere of influence whether they want to or not and are therefore incentivized to sell to the US as many machines it would need to fight a war. The risk for Japan or Germany not wanting to sell tools to the US feels insignificant, as they aren't in a position of power to refuse to play ball. reply kuschku 9 hours agorootparentJapan and Germany are entirely metric. Pretty much the entire US manufacturing industry, or rather the zombie the pentagon keeps on life support, is in US standard. That means everything needs to be adjusted or replaced.

The primary reason why a declining company like Micron was gifted a new fab in Syracuse NY is that their Boise fab is within range of a larger portion of the Chinese arsenal. reply nostrademons 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's why (well, one reason why) the U.S. keeps Japan and Germany in its sphere of influence. Same for Saudi Arabia (major oil producer) and Taiwan (major chip producer). Notice that U.S. / Saudi relations soured a fair bit after the U.S. became the largest global oil producer again (thanks to fracking and shale oil). We're a bit less willing to overlook an authoritarian dictatorship when we don't need them. The challenge with all international relationships is that they're not stable. Germany almost didn't back us on Ukraine, for example, because Russia threatened to cut off the supply of natural gas and make its citizens freeze in the winter of 2022/2023. Only because the NordStream pipeline blew up anyway (an act of sabotage that American journalists have attributed to the U.S.) and the U.S. secured alternate sources of heating for Germany did they back us on Ukraine.

I certainly think it's a risk that the next big war starts, it goes poorly for America, and then we resort to nuclear weapons to squeeze out \"victory\" (i.e. everybody dies) if we're all going to die anyway. But I think there's another possibility that most people aren't considering: disintegration. It's very common for countries to cease to exist as countries when they start losing a war, particularly a war that happens because they're moribund and falling apart internally anyway. Witness the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires in WW1; the end of the Roman empire; England during the War of the Roses in the aftermath of the Hundred Years War; Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union in the wake of the Cold War; etc. This also doesn't have to wait until the end of the conflict: most of the big disintegrations in WW1 happened in 1917, before the armistice, and sometimes even to \"victorious\" parties. Modern nuclear weapons are very tightly controlled with PALs, so that you physically can't arm them without correct codes produced by the Pentagon/NSA bureaucracy. If that bureaucracy falls apart, it's likely they will just rot in their silos, while humanity dukes it out with relatively primitive technology because nobody wants to work together anymore. reply jimt1234 9 hours agorootparentprevI heard this was the real reason the US took out Saddam Hussein. Basically, Saddam had been saying for years that he wanted Iraq to abandon the dollar for trading its oil. If he was successful at this, other Arab Nations would most likely do the same.

Other way around, they buy T-bonds -- i.e., \"loan\" dollars to the US Government. But the country is still owed that money back - it's like a trillion dollar bank account. One could say China \"lends\" dollars to the Treasury, but it's also just as accurate to say they \"deposit\" dollars into the Treasury. It's all just words to describe the action of giving money to another party to hold onto temporarily. \"Strong\" currency means there's more demand for it. Demand is usually a function of what you can buy with the currency. When countries reinvest their dollars into T-Bonds, they are double dipping on establishing demand for dollars. On one hand, they are owed back the dollars handed over to the Treasury (thus, creating future demand for USD), and on the other, accepting USD for the sales of their goods/services induces demand for USD, since it is yet another good that can be purchased with USD. \"Weak\" currency means that there's less demand for it. Weak currencies tend to be those from countries that produce little in the way of goods and services, or they only produce commodities (like oil) that are generally traded in other currencies. A weak currency can be a benefit. Hence why so many countries seek to artificially weaken their currency (aka currency manipulation). They often do this by strengthening the the USD.

Offshoring in software development has been around for a very long time. Most large US companies have a mix of onshore and offshore devs. The more mundane the software, and the tighter the financial macro-environment, the more the ratio shifts toward offshoring. This is the way the offshoring cycle has worked for a long time. However, unlike hardware, software is about information and communication, and cultural context is very important. I have seen firsthand that non-US teams building software for US consumers often don't quite understand the reasoning behind the requirements and may lack polish around basic things like English. (The same is true, of course, in reverse, if US teams build for non-US audiences.) So I think it should be a little bit stickier. You also cannot copy software design in the same way that you can copy, say, the design of a lathe.

In reality there are incredibly large gaps around even the most basic things like the meaning of words. As a very basic example: the meaning of the word \"interesting\" differs radically between cultures. Most US employees would think the boss is indeed interested when they describe an idea as \"interesting\" and may even bring it up again at some later date after more research.

Clueless management was brought in who then decimated anything they did not understand. I.e. everything. Aided by Reagan policy to aggressively outsource manufacturing from the nineteen eighties US manufacturing just imploded. Just speculating here, but by the time the Japanese and the Germans caught up and got really good at machine tools, the metric system would have become an obstacle as well. Because the US insisting to do everything in inches, foot pounds, and what not doesn't translate very well internationally when you start outsourcing all your manufacturing. Outsourcing meant manufacturing standardized on the metric system using equipment and parts not made in the US. Just speculating here, but I imagine that all that combined lead to a natural preference for non US based manufacturing companies that took over from US companies to not use any US made equipment or parts. So, manufacturing became predominantly metric based and that would have affected standard components, screws, bolts, parts, etc. All made by non US companies standardizing on all of that. reply cpursley 14 hours agoparentMBA thinking ruins everything it touches.

There aren't infinite firms. Plus in the article, the previous paragraph goes into how the tooling industry was being bought up by conglomerates so the finite firms became even easier to count. A company fitting your argument is Telsa. The existing firms weren't willing to canabalize their existing product lines so they didn't invest into EVs and now a domestic firm is eating at their market share. However, \"Who killed the electric car?\" is from 2006, there has been a lot of pent up demand for EVs that no domestic firm was selling to.

Well, the article agrees in that it says \"By now, tools from Japan and other countries were as good as or better than US tools, not to mention cheaper and more reliable.\". However, R&D was also being cut prior to this so if you don't do any R&D and your products become uncompetitive it's probably because R&D was cut. > Was the policy to outsource everything, or liberalize markets and let firms and consumers more freely choose where to buy things from? Well, don't forget there are winners and losers when trading. In this case the losers are the American Tooling Industry; the winners were everybody that bought from them lol. -- I do think this growth every quarter is a big problem though. The early observers of business cycle all noticed that it has its ups and downs. Pretending that there won't be a down and fudging the numbers so that you don't have any downs is going to cause future problems. Delivering not-finished lathes counts to me as fudging the numbers. [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film) [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThe main way for countries with higher wages to compete is through automation. You can't supply 1000 laborers at $2/hour, but you can supply five skilled mechanics at $50/hour. The problem with this is that the 1000 people who had been doing the labor in the US for $25/hour don't want that to happen any more than they want it to move offshore, and they're the people with the skills to ensure the automation goes smoothly. So they resist and then lose to offshore manufacturing rather than domestic automation. Which in turn causes the US to lose even more manufacturing jobs, because now that factory is in Asia and it's more economical for its inputs and outputs to be other factories in Asia. The way out of this is to make sure domestic barriers to entry are low, so that you get more new domestic companies like Tesla that aren't stuck in this trap. Right now that isn't the case and Tesla is an exception that got there on hype and eccentric leadership, whereas what you really want is for domestic small businesses to be able to eat the lazy incumbent's lunch long before China does, and indeed to be able to eat the Chinese company's lunch by replacing a thousand low-wage workers with a handful of high-paid specialists. reply bsder 14 hours agorootparentprev> It’s not necessarily the case that greedy, ignorant MBAs came in and ruined everything. Like, if their practices were so inferior, then any domestic firm that didn’t get taken over by them should’ve had a leg up and could’ve dominated the domestic market. In this instance, it was people like Icahn. Machine tools were a very cyclical market. Consequently, they did well as part of a vertically integrated conglomerate where the profits could be booked over time and the R&D could be shared with the manufacturing parent. When forced to spin out and stand alone by corporate raiders, those companies were effectively doomed as you just ripped out their ability to do R&D. In addition, people forget that the Japanese companies were very much not playing fair. MITI (Ministry of International Trade and Industry) and the keiretsu/zaibatsu companies were actively attacking the US companies--this was effectively governmental and monopoly collusion. This attack was to the point that they almost wiped out the semiconductor industry (which prompted the DARPA VHSIC project and later Sematech in response) for example. They did similar actions in the manufacturing industries but the government never responded with the same vigor. > Was the policy to outsource everything, or liberalize markets and let firms and consumers more freely choose where to buy things from? The policy was to fund the hell out of West Coast (high tech and mostly no unions) and to leave the Rust Belt (manufacturing and lots of unions) to rot. I will be one of the first to line up to piss on Reagan's grave for the complete shit that he was. However, to be fair, NOBODY had any answer to the fact that manufacturing automated and could get by on two orders of magnitude fewer employees. Every country dependent upon manufacturing went through a horrible time (see: England and Thatcher for similar vitriol). In fact, nobody still has any answer 4 decades+ later.

It would be just as fair to blame the original culture of having vertically integrated conglomerates to begin with. If there is anyone who should be able to figure out how to automate manufacturing with a small number of workers, it should be a bunch of machinists. But you put them in a lumbering conglomerate and teach them that automation is the enemy because it will take their jobs. Then they take that same attitude into a smaller company that has to be leaner in order to survive and you've set them up for failure. Whereas if you embrace it, instead of domestic buyers getting their goods from cheap labor in China, domestic and international buyers get their goods from automated domestic factories that employ fewer people per unit but make more units than ever before because they have globally competitive prices and the global demand when you can supply at a low price is enormous. > Nobody in Cleveland gives a shit about whether someone in Africa is doing better when they can't make their house payment.

Tooling both foreign and domestic was/is a mixture of imperial and metric to meet certain markets. The major force behind machining, automotive, did their conversions to metric back in the 1970s. The U.S. was seriously lacking in computerized machining and had plenty of time to shift to metric based machines, but the MBAs had already determined long before that they preferred overseas manufacturing at a fraction of the cost. Machining today is heavy metric, even in the U.S. and there is still no economic way to make it all work, much like with steel production and other manufacturing concerns. reply mywittyname 14 hours agorootparent> Machining today is heavy metric, even in the U.S. Likely due to the dominance of metric tooling from abroad.

What you call 'optimizing quality and cost' I call 'trying the fuck the consumer to the maximum amount without them noticing'. But, to be fair, those are the same thing. Just my observations. Capitalism is becoming a zombie and MBAs are the cordyceps. reply lazide 12 hours agorootparentThe issue isn’t MBAs. They are just a symptom. What the issue is, is that we’re essentially in the third ‘wave’ of US economic change post WW2 manufacturing boom. Post WW2, the United States was the only manufacturing economy that hadn’t been bombed to smithereens, has not only little to no real debt, but a lot of debtors that would repay them, and had massive amounts of undeveloped land ripe for development, and a major new manufacturing base looking for things to do. This allowed the US to become the world’s reserve currency (along with gold) in the Bretton Woods agreement in ‘44. That lasted until ‘71. [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system] when the dollar stopped being backed by gold, allowing periods of increased inflation. At around the same time, the economies of Western Europe and Asia had mostly recovered, and they were starting to catch up on manufacturing to compete with the US. This led to increasing competitive pressures with US manufacturing, and increasing incentives to go towards Globalization and outsourcing to chase the cheap labor and more willing to compete manufacturers in these locations. Switching the US to a ‘knowledge economy’ was the natural progression. That easy money is mostly gone now, and the US is also no longer far ahead in many areas on knowledge. China in particular is starting to come close on almost all metrics. If Europe has a recession, their primary disadvantage (cost) may turn into an advantage. So then the US is much more on par with everyone else - for the first time in several generations. And that causes quite a rude awakening economically, as now the US potentially has real and actual competitors it isn’t 5 steps ahead of already. MBA’ism is because long ago the economy switched from ‘actually leaps and bounds ahead of competitors’ to optimization. As most of the actual structural differences have now equalized, and we’re down to who can make it cheaper/simpler. No one wants a 5 lb drill that costs $100 if they can have a 2lb drill that costs $50 and does the jobs they want well. reply hasty_pudding 10 hours agorootparent> MBA’ism is because long ago the economy switched from ‘actually leaps and bounds ahead of competitors’ to optimization False. Many companies make more money now than ever. American GDP and technology is leaps and bounds ahead of other countries as well. MBA's exist to create shareholder value while fucking the consumer and the laborers as much as possible without getting into trouble. melanine in baby food, and suicide nets outside of factories, for example, are cost optimization strategies that didnt work out. I can just picture an MBA running the cost/benefit numbers in an excel spreadsheet comparing treating the workers better versus putting suicide nets outside the windows. reply lazide 10 hours agorootparentBwahah.

Food comes from the US for the most part, and some random heavy manufacturing and other parts.

And this isn't even a new thing: it was absolutely true (in fact, more true) way back in the 1980s and 90s, and really started in the mid-to-late 1970s. American cars were utter garbage: poorly engineered, poorly performing, and poorly manufactured, with terrible quality. So why do people seem to assume that other American-made stuff in that era was so well-made?

It was a way of keeping the US a few steps ahead. Printing gold backed dollars quickly doesn’t work very well when you can’t increase the rate of mining gold quickly. Non gold backed dollars are a lot easier. As long as goods and services can be made cheaper every year, it works well since inflation isn’t felt badly - there aren’t any supply restrictions where something is going to get noticeably too expensive. All the things I talked about though all have that issue - they can’t be made cheaper somewhere else. someone can only build so many houses in LA before there is literally no more room, and someone building a house in Shanghai doesn’t help anyone in SF live closer to work. Building a new college/university in Vietnam isn’t going to help a kid in Oregon get their degree. We’ve been exporting inflation because it’s worked. But when other countries stop being so much cheaper, or costs of critical things for the population finally exceed affordability, it doesn’t.

If I was a believer in some deity that paid attention to such things, I would pray daily that PayPal does not decide to end these at some point.

Patreon is working well for many things but still not easy or integrated enough. reply TheFragenTaken 21 hours agoparentprevTwitch subscriptions and Patreon has shown, that if you bind a website/project to a creator, and you get benefits for donating/subscribing, that you can have a very viable business model. Both as a creator, and as a platform to facilitate it. Most websites, and indeed open source projects are pretty faceless, and require limited interaction with it's creator. I believe, if you somehow \"solve\" that problem first, people will beg to donate/subscribe. reply bot347851834 20 hours agorootparentI agree with your general point: people generally donate/buy/subscribe much more if there's a benefit tied to it. On the other hand, I'd like to point out that Twitch is still losing money so I wouldn't really call their business model \"very viable\". I'd say it's viable for the content creators, because there's very little risk in trying out Twitch streaming, sure the chances of making it big are insanely small but the worst case scenario is losing time and a relatively small amount of money on a PC setup + microphone and camera. Patreon is a different beast but there's a caveat here as well. I don't have numbers so this is just my PoV but I'd guess that the vast majority of creators that use Patreon aren't hosting, sharing or creating mainly on Patreon. They're called YouTubers, streamers, bloggers for a reason. Sure they may share BtS or some other kind of additional content but it's not their main platform. So while the Patreon business model works it's not really comparable to Twitch or any other platform where you actually start and continue to create content and also get paid by. reply jerrre 17 hours agorootparentIt's important to make the distinction between: - Twitch is losing money because the costs of running the platform are higher then the revenue - Twitch is losing money because they're aggressively investing in growth if you want to know about the viability of the concept, I'm not sure which one it is, video streaming and small payment processing could both be quite costly reply Mc91 17 hours agorootparentprevI donate monthly to five Patreons.

This does work for content creators on Youtube, Patreon or Onlyfans, but ultimately detracts from the mission of delivering quality content that is useful or positively entertaining for the consumers of said content. The fans created in this way can go on to defend your failings or can be taken advantage of in a weakness, as can be seen in the case of the LTT sexual harassment allegation case and the health situation of Physics Girl. However, I see no way for this to work in an open-source project, because users of an open source project mostly care about the functionality provided. Creating a parasocial relationship is mostly not viable in this space due to limited interaction, as you pointed out. I've seen a few instances of OSS project maintainers using a chest-thumping, holier-than-thou approach to create drama, and said projects have either mostly become irrelevant over time or the open source project has continued to get attention only because the character of the maintainer has been buried and not well known to most. reply bawolff 17 hours agorootparentSometimes i feel like people make too much of the \"parasocial\" buzzword, as if its new.

You don't need Drama, but you should indeed communicate and deliver something worth the peoples' money.

Twitter subs and patreon are just the opposite reply jmyeet 20 hours agorootparentprevTwitch did successfully push a subscription model for creators that allowed a lot of small creators to make an income. For anyone unfamiliar, Twitch subscriptions are $5-25/month (viewer's choice) and give access to emote, subscription badges in the chat and, perhaps most importantly, give you an ad free experience with that creator. One cannot understate how important Amazon Prime (as Twitch Prime) is to the Twitch subscription ecosystem. IIRC roughly half of all Twitch subscriptions are Twitch Prime. Twitch is aupser aggressive with ads. Youtube has skippable pre-roll ads. Twitch does not and might have 4+ pre-roll ads plus in-stream ads every 30-60 minutes. The ad density Twitch aims for is 4+ minutes per hour. But Twitch doesn't like the subscription model anymore. They've cut the revenue split. Previously many creators got a 70/30% split, now almost everyone gets a 50/50% split. The big problem is that ad revenue scales in a way that subscriptions don't. Ad CPMs can go up, you can increase ad desnity easily (to a point) and ad revenue scales with view count in a way that subscriptions don't (eg a creator with 100K concurrent viewers won't have 100 times the subscriptions of someone with 1000 CVC). You're seeing the same trend with streaming services. Netflix killed their basic tier and wants you to watch ads because it's more profitable than the subscription. Prime Video has thinly veiled a price hike by adding an extra ad-free monthly fee. My point is that subscriptions, or any form of voluntary payment, is icnredibly hard to make work and even the most successful examples, like Twtich, require great effort and a supporting ecosystem like Amazon Prime. reply Ygg2 20 hours agorootparentprevIsn't Twitch very much a net loss? reply PurpleRamen 17 hours agorootparentYes and no. They jump around the profit-point. They made some profit in 2019 or so, but the pandemia peaked them, not just in views and income, but also costs. The thing is, Twitch's business-model is very frail. A streamer with too many viewers can cost them more money than it brings them money. Similar, are there millions of small streamers who barely make them a dollar. And then are there also too many side-costs, like South-Korea's network-fee recently, or the too many law cases where come cranky person sues them for some nonsical reason. And we don't know for real how much Amazon is charging them. Rumors are going, Amazon is charging them a hefty amount for servers, while other says AWS is irrelevant for their Service, so nobody knows for real, officially. But the recent move to a different handling of video-streams is supposed to change this, as it reduce the costs on Twitch's side, and lets the Streamers pay for it themself. By which I mean AV1(?), where the streamer is encoding all streams in all resolutions, and only sends it to Twitch which then acts as a relay. Claim is, Video-Encoding was the biggest cost for them, after employees, which seems kinda strange.. But maybe it will change their game in the next years, we will see. reply nicolas_17 8 hours agorootparentYou do know Amazon owns Twitch? I'm sure they aren't using normal AWS billing... reply jmyeet 20 hours agorootparentprevTwitch loses money because Amazon has decided to make Twitch lose money. Why? Because Amazon is charging themselves for the infrastructure Twitch uses (ie AWS). It does that to justify cutting revenue splits (of subscriptions and ads) and increasing ad density. The minimum ad density now is generally 4 minutes per hour. Example: say I'm Pottery Barn and I sell furniture in the US. I sell a table for $500. It costs $100 to make in China, $50 to ship to the US and $150 in store costs (eg utilities, staffing, rent, amortized capex, etc). You might say I've made $200 profit. But let's say my corporate structure is to have 2 subsidiaries: PB Manufacturing and PB Retail. The first makes the table. The second manages the stores and sells the table. If PBM charges PBR $150 for the table then PBM makes $50 in profit and PBR makes $150. If PBM charges $300 for the table then PBM makes $200 in profit and PBR breaks even. This is what I mean when I say Twitch's profitability is a chosen narrative. There are many reasons to do this. Tax is a big one. Maybe you pay less tax in China so you prefer to take profit there. Maybe you want to argue stores aren't profitable to resist demands for higher wages or higher rents. The above is an example of \"transfer pricing\" or \"profit shifting\". What's the difference? Transfer pricing is illegal. Profit shifting isn't (within limits; it technically has to be \"at arm's length\" and other requirements). reply jedberg 16 hours agorootparent> Twitch loses money because Amazon has decided to make Twitch lose money. This is totally untrue but keeps getting repeated. Yes, within Amazon, the non-AWS business units pay AWS to use AWS. But they pay cost plus a small percent, not retail rates. The cost to non-AWS businesses is the same as if they had to do it all on their own (actually a little less since they get to leverage AWS's economies of scale). The profitability of the other business units is actually improved this way. They would be paying more if they were independent and doing it on their own. This is why Amazon is so allergic to spinning out AWS as its own business. reply stefan_ 16 hours agorootparentThat seems impossible to determine. AWS retail charges for things that have an impossible relation to actual costs (think traffic) to begin with. reply jedberg 16 hours agorootparentAWS knows how much it costs to deliver their own service. How do you think they determine their own profits and prices? They use those same calculations to bill internal customers. reply wongarsu 14 hours agorootparentObviously AWS knows how much it costs to run all of AWS. But that doesn't translate to accurately knowing the marginal costs of a gigabyte of outbound traffic. They probably do know, but it isn't necessary at all to determine their profit, or to set their prices. \"Just\" set prices to what the market is willing to pay, and determine profit as total income minus total expenses over the whole operation. reply snapcaster 20 hours agorootparentprevCan you expand on this? You're saying Twitch is only unprofitable in an accounting sense but would be a viable business if on its own?

Are they even capable of distinguishing the difference in a case like Twitch:Amazon? Furthermore... isn't this the crux of Hollywood accounting..? reply PurpleRamen 17 hours agoparentprevIMHO their main problems were: they delivered too early, and failed in what they offered. When they started, there was no donation-economy like we have today on Twitch, Ko-fi, and others, nor was there an established support-hivemind like we have with Patreon, Github and others. So people did not know what they should do with it. And on the other side was Flattr a bit annoying to use in the beginning, and had percentage-based donations, instead of fixed values IIRC. People are selfish, but also willing to share, if you give them enough reason. But thinking about, maybe the lack of a social component and some virtual rewards would have been beneficial. But I guess, after the first fail, nobody cared anymore for it, and they somehow failed to find their market. reply Workaccount2 17 hours agorootparentHaving experience with donation only stuff, I can tell you something with the straightest face: Almost nobody who uses a service, even if they use it a lot, actually goes on to donate. It's a real hockey stick graph where 90% of your donations come from 5% of users. Trust me, everyone says they prefer paying/donating over ads, but when you look at the numbers, just about everyone prefers no compensation (and no ads) and chooses that if given the option. reply BottingRocks 16 hours agorootparentI believe that in the last couple of years the line between donation and begging has been blurred. You have things on the extreme side like people begging on tiktok live doing shoutouts to every viewer that donates a significant gift.On the IRL side you also have people donating to the craziest streamers doing the most outrageous stuff outside. Then you also have super donations on Youtube on live podcasts. When donations are incorporated on a social app it fosters an environment that makes donating acceptable and fun. Hardly anyone is going to trust their debit card/credit card details to a random site, but the masses will trust buying credits/donations/subscriptions through tiktok,youtube, twitch, patreon etc. reply throwawayq3423 15 hours agorootparentprevI think the one trick is using subscriptions that people opt into one time and just forget about.

I donated for a couple of years to an author I liked because he had a proven track record of delivery, so helping him concentrate on writing rather than a day job let him create more works. But him aside, I mostly see Patreon used to fund authors that are stringing along patrons with promises of \"You'll be a few chapters ahead of free readers\" vs \"This can make the difference that will let me finish.\" To that end, at least for me, I just go between a few so there's usually something new to read, and if not, oh well. If I were to publish in that space, I'd stream chapters slowly but regularly for free and the top donation tier would yield the completed work, but priced at the median payment I'd expect to get stringing people along for a few months. That's probably not a good business model, but I think it would prove less frustrating. reply pflenker 14 hours agoparentprevI had multiple discussions with German news projects around micropayments, and they list other, much simpler reasons why they don’t accept it: - depending on the payment method, the transaction cost is too high and eats up almost the full payment - the administrative overhead to maintain micro transactions is huge - it creates the incentive to create articles that sell well, e.g. clickbait, which contradicts the values of these projects - you need to plan ahead and for that you need to have a somewhat predictable flow of income, which is not a given with micropayments. reply lencastre 13 hours agorootparentThat sounds about right! reply diggan 16 hours agoparentprev> if only they could make a small donation to every website they liked - but that doesn't work because people are fundamentally too selfish.

It was a great idea, and I was an early user. However, they had the problem that most of the people who you might want to support, were not on Flattr. And Flattr made a poor move early on: in a bid to avoid getting spammed by low effort/beggars, they demanded that you give and take: If you wanted to be able to receive, you had to use the service yourself. This was eminently fair. It was also a disaster, because it exposed a fact that's obvious when you think about it, but which is a crush to most \"creatives\"' ego: The vast majority of us are net consumers! We watch way more than we create ourselves. Most minor bloggers/youtubers/podcasters wouldn't want to admit that, they'd just see \"I pay more than I get out of this?

A possible explanation: News websites are cross financing their content. You spending a dollar on the paper, that only interests you in parts, is part of a model that makes it work (and probably also part of a model, where papers still feel wiggle room to editorialize for stuff they think is important, even though it might not click) reply rchaud 17 hours agorootparentNews websites are not independently owned. NYT is publicly traded, Wash Post is owned by Bezos, Time Magazine is owned by Benioff, etc. They survive on patronage outside of their subscriber base. reply rchaud 17 hours agorootparentprevAre you able to purchase anything for 10 cents today? The price of a short self-published ebook on Amazon is 30x that, $2.99, and plenty of people buy those. I understand that low-quality blog posts are worth nothing but if a viable micropayment option existed, those lazy posts would disappear (they only exist for SEO and collecting ad impressions). Websites and blog content would be more like what Substack has, which is semi-longform stuff that doesn't need to be padded with \"blog\" style posts. reply infecto 10 hours agorootparentHope the price was not hanging you up. I don’t know what the price is and it’s certainly variable depending on the content length and publication. Maybe for a long Journal/NYT expose it’s a $1… reply itsoktocry 16 hours agorootparentprev>so I could read a single article for $0.10 or something along those lines. But there is \"something along those lines\"; it's called becoming a paid subscriber. When you amortize the expense across every article, you may even be getting a deal! The fact that the example expense you'd be willing to incur to read content you actually enjoy is ten cents speaks to why this model won't work. reply infecto 9 hours agorootparentDon’t get hung up on the price I listed, it’s just an example which is dependent on publication and article length/content. Your argument is pretty weak too. Of course I could subscribe but obviously I don’t for any number of reasons. I am saying I wish I could pay on a per article price. Sorry for wanting to pay for the content I consume. reply JoshTriplett 10 hours agorootparentprevThat \"works\", somewhat, if you want to get all your news from one place. That's the traditional newspaper model: most people don't get a dozen papers delivered. But many people do read articles on dozens of different sites in a month. And that's a good thing; a world in which people get their news from a variety of different sources seems like a fundamentally better world. Newspapers and news subscriptions were financially viable in a world where most people had a subscription and that's where they got most of their news. They may not be financially viable in a world in which most people don't have or want to read only one or two sources of news. And that's fine. reply Thrymr 11 hours agorootparentprevSure, but we all have subscription fatigue. Say I subscribe to the New York Times and the Atlantic.

Same. I'm shocked that the NYT didn't use Flattr on their articles for this. To access the full version of the NYT currently costs $0.50 a week so it would have been possible the NYT could charge $0.50 per article, or $5 for the year (one time no subscription) through Flattr or something along those lines. I could definitely see this working at scale. reply sgerenser 21 hours agorootparentThe $0.50 weekly price for NYT is a teaser rate. The full price for digital only was recently raised to $195/year. I imagine they make too much money from people who subscribe at the teaser rate and forget to cancel (like all newspapers/magazines) to make it worth exploring other business models. reply dageshi 21 hours agorootparentprevWe have to assume they have considered this in the past and come to the conclusion it just doesn't work. I suspect tying a purchasing decision to every page visit just leads to people automatically backing out of the page with a very low conversion rate because it's just too annoying to decide whether to pay for something you're not sure the value of. Despite all the gnashing of teeth, nothing competes with ads on the web. reply JoshTriplett 10 hours agorootparent> We have to assume they have considered this in the past and come to the conclusion it just doesn't work. Or that they prefer the world in which it doesn't take off because they expect to make more money, at least in the short term. If they believe that they can still convince N users to buy $195/year subscriptions, versus getting 10N users to pay a net total of $10/year in per-article fees, then they're better off trying to convince the N users to subscribe. Which might* work for the biggest dozen newspapers with brand recognition, but won't work as well for the long tail of news sites. reply infecto 20 hours agorootparentprevSince most news publications are failing businesses I would not immediately assume they have considered all avenues of monetization. I agree that ads have historically made a lot of money...but I am thinking of the paywalled industry. I am probably in the minority but I would be interested if any of the major publications had data on this kind of strategy. I realize there have been products including Flattr that did this but again I never saw it being using on a NYT level publication. Instead of me reading an archive link or just not reading the article at all I would be happy to pay some cents to consume it. reply amadeuspagel 12 hours agorootparentThe NYT is very much not a failing business. reply infecto 10 hours agorootparentThanks for the downvote but I said most not all.

More humans become aware of something other humans want them to be aware of, more people end up buying some things (thereby incentivizing more of them to be created) or spending their lives on the most addictive mobile gambling thing or whatever. Whereas a system that just lets people say \"this thing entertained me enough for 0.00023% of my economic output for the year doesn't do anything else, and deciding typing in how much something is worth to you is work. Not a lot of work, but it's still work that might even be worth more than your micro donation, depending on how you value your time and the neurons you dedicate to thinking about it. So obviously the system that actually does something is more viable. reply Dylan16807 12 hours agoparentprevI just something I can subscribe to and money goes to sites I visit in a reliable way. And the sites should stop showing me ads, but I'll even take that as optional right now. Ideally something like youtube premium, but not youtube. Google ran some services that at a very surface level had the same idea, but actually worked in a messy and bad way, and then they gave up on it. Which is a real shame because they have the ad presence to actually make it work.

There are communities where the creators are well under way to becoming sustainable with this method. Granted, it's very early days. reply bigbluedots 20 hours agoparentprevOk, hear me out: Here is how to remove all unwanted ads from the Internet. ISPs move to subscription-based billing - a flat base fee to cover their own costs and some profit, plus a 'content' fee that is divided among the sites visited and the bandwidth used. The 'content' fee goes to a global rights association that distributes it to creators. reply JoshTriplett 10 hours agorootparentNo, for so many reasons. No, tracking is bad. No, a central organization will not do an equitable job of distributing fees even if it has invasive tracking information. No, a mandatory fee is unacceptable. No, not all sites visited deserve an equal share based solely on visits and bandwidth. No, there is no reasonable automated metric that would allow such division, as any possible metric can be gamed. The moment something like this were put in place, sites would immediately start gaming the resulting perverse incentives. Sites get more share based on bandwidth? Useless background downloads. Sites get more share based on number of visits? Lots of background loads, content in multiple iframes, split across many pages, etc. Any metric you can think of can and will be gamed, other than \"user says they want this site to get a share\". (That can be gamed too, but only insofar as sites already compete for user attention.) Here's how to remove unwanted ads from the Internet: get everyone to install an adblocker, put advertising out of business, observe better revenue models emerge out of necessity without having to fight to compete with \"free with ads\". reply stonogo 16 hours agorootparentprevWhy is the answer to \"how to remove ads\" always \"track the hell out of everyone at some other layer\" reply bigbluedots 14 hours agorootparentIf such a scheme we're to compensate content creators there'd have to be some way to determine how to slice up the revenue for them. Hits and data is one way. Your ISP probably already does that - at least re sites visited and data used. reply stonogo 2 hours agorootparentThey might try, but I tunnel all my traffic out anyway. In your proposal, my tunneling behavior would be morally equivalent to piracy. I don't think it's the world I want to live in.

I'm more imagining a mining-pool made up of webpage visitors. The website allocates you certain blocks of hashes to be calculated and you calculate those. Once they're calculated and the webpage verifies it by randomly double checking a few, then the webpage is served. A websearch tell me a webpage visit nets the owners about ~2 cents in ad revenue. So you just need to mine some equivalent amount. It'd be sort of like a mining-pool where the overwhelming majority of users don't successfully mine a block - but when someone does the website owner gets the coin. You could get more sophisticated on top of that and have some central mining-pool coordinator and session cookies etc so that your mining credit transfers across webpages and you can \"premine\" certain amounts So the currency becomes more granular at \"how many hashes have you calculated\" and not how many coins do you have I could be wrong though ~ It's possible 2 cents of hashes takes hours to crunch on a phone reply colesantiago 20 hours agorootparentprevNo. We shouldn't have to make the world infinitely worse place and waste billions in energy just to squeeze out a cent in 'magic internet money' to give to another person. reply scrollaway 21 hours agorootparentprevIt’s also a huge waste of energy at a time when the planet is on fire. reply geokon 18 hours agorootparentit's got some downsides - but so does the alternative.

You just turned a brainless moment of enjoyment into a value judgement where I now have to become a critic and try to create some kind of inner framework for assigning value, etc. Ads avoids all these by (relatively) frictionlessly converting attention into money.

Also they did take investments which means they had to not only build a sustainable business but actually create a considerable ROI for their investors or risk them pulling the plug and cut their losses (which is presumably what happened given the lack of detail and \"our wonderful journey\" speak).

    "originLink": "https://gmays.com/how-im-relearning-math-as-an-adult/",
    "originBody": "How I’m (re)learning math as an adult Jan 17, 2024 I recently passed 100 days of practicing math every single day 💯 I’ve wanted to beef up my math chops for a while, but I needed a good reason that would justify the time investment. Plus, it’s always easier to learn when you have a clear goal and something meaningful to apply it to. So, it never reached the top of my priority list. But then a couple things happened recently that gave me 1) sufficient motivation and 2) a clear path. The motivation I’ve worked on various AI products over the last year and like understanding the technical aspects of the products I build. But as I dug in to learn more about how large language models (LLMs) and transformers worked…I was lost. It was humbling. From Spencer Becker-Kahn’s Notes on the Mathematics of LLM Architectures. I’d need a much better understanding of stats/probability, linear algebra, and calculus (overview). Aside from corporate projections/financials, I haven’t done much with math since grad school, so I lacked a foundation. I don’t need to become a mathematician, but at a minimum, I wanted more intuition around the core concepts and connections between them. The path So, how does an adult with a job, kids, a mortgage, and other hobbies, learn math in an effective, time-efficient way? Fortunately, a friend I met a decade ago at MicroConf, Jason Roberts, founded a startup called Math Academy with his wife, Sandy. I kept up with it since the early days (they have a great story), and now I finally had a reason to try it out. It was still in beta, so I reached out, bought a license, and was in! Math Academy How would I describe Math Academy? One word: Amazing. I’ve been consistently impressed since I started using it. Despite still being in beta, it feels quite polished and works well (though it’s clear an engineer designed the UI 😂). Its current focus is helping kids learn math, with tools built-in for parents to help their kids be successful, but it’s quite effective for adult learners like me as well. Their current courses cover math from middle school through university (graduate level) and are fully accredited. Below are the current courses. Math Acedmy’s course offerings as of Nov. 2023. The ‘Foundation Series‘ is what I’m starting with. It’s for adults to help streamline learning (it skips the stuff that kids need, but adults don’t) and work back up through college-level math relatively quickly (emphasis on relatively 😂). One of the other reasons I love Math Academy is the authenticity of the people in addition to the process. The founder and others are true math nerds, and they’ve spent thousands of hours teaching math. They know what works. Jason, founder of Math Academy, teaching kids math (including his own kid!). This authenticity translates to authentic learning, which comes through from the very beginning. After signing up, it starts off with a diagnostic that shows you how much of a dumbass you are helps assess your current math proficiency so you can start off at the right level. Then the self-paced, interactive lessons start. One thing I especially love as a busy adult student is that most lessons are ~10 minutes long, which makes it relatively easy to squeeze in sessions (e.g., between kids screaming or while they’re distracted watching Bluey 😂). I also love how it teaches, assesses, reviews, and builds on concepts. When it comes quiz time I’m often impressed with how much I’ve learned and the ability to apply it. This thing is legit—it really works. And there are no fluffy videos that just ‘feel’ like learning. The lessons have explanations between problems to make it a very concrete, hands-on process. It’s a highly effective way of learning. …which gets to something important: Math is hard. Math Academy makes learning math as easy as possible, but it’s still hard work. Really hard work. Math is hard Learning math is challenging. It’s real work. This isn’t some casual app you can just flip through. Unless you’re like John von Neumann, most of it requires pencil and paper to knock out. The only exception is the early lessons when you’re just refreshing and can do most of it in your head. But if you’re serious about legitimately learning math, there is no better, more convenient way. Setting myself up for success To make this a habit I’d stick to, I’d have to lower the activation energy of doing it and make it as close to a new ‘default’ behavior as possible. “This is just what I do.” So, I started with convenience and consistency, which helped me form other good habits as well. Convenience Learning math is hard enough, so how can we make it somewhat convenient? Math Academy’s short (~10 min) lessons help. I also use an iPad for the lessons (it’s web-based) when I’m not at a computer and a Remarkable 2 for the work (e-ink for pencil/paper). I also found a cheap case that fits both perfectly. This makes it easy to knock out lessons here or there. For example, I had jury duty recently and knocked out a few lessons while waiting. And just this past Wednesday, the kids were ready early, so I got to the gym about 15 minutes early and knocked out a lesson or two in the car. I’ve also started doing them during a light walk on the treadmill (I have one under my standing desk). My usual routine is to do lessons in the evening after the kids go down and after I work out. It is challenging to muster the energy to work out and do math after a long day, but making it a habit has made it easier. Consistency I’ll say it again: Math is hard. My goal is to work up to the math needed to better understand LLMs and transformers. Thankfully, Math Academy has a ‘Mathematics for Machine Learning‘ course I’m working towards, which gives me a clear goal. Given my limited time, it will likely take years for me to get there. Why years? Two reasons: Math is hard. Math is BIG. I had no idea how broad and deep math was. I probably still don’t. Case in point: This is the knowledge graph of the concepts in the first Mathematical Foundations course, showing the topics, how they relate, and what gaps you have. Impressive, right? And this is just the first course (!) of the ~10 or so I want to take. It’s going to take years. So, how do I get there? One lesson at a time. If I keep at it, I will get there. I’ve been doing at least 1 lesson a day, every day since I started, giving me a 106-day streak as of today. Screenshot of my Math Academy streak from Habits Garden, where I track my habits. 106 days down, ~1,000 more to go 😂 It’s a hard, but worthwhile and enjoyable new hobby for now. Takeway For hard subjects like math, I always assumed the only ‘real’ way to learn was in dedicated environments like college since online courses were best for softer, less technical topics. This was a bummer, especially for adult students like me. But Math Academy changed my mind on this, and I’m a huge fan so far. I hope they continue to grow and expand to other complex STEM topics like computer science, physics, etc. Overall, I’m just so excited there’s an effective, accessible way to learn hard things. If I were a billionaire, I’d invest to accelerate its progress and find a way to sponsor a license for every kid who was interested… But for now, I’ll just talk about it to anyone who will listen 😉 ←Previous: How to host WordPress sites free",

    "commentBody": "Relearning math as an adult (gmays.com)205 points by gmays 12 hours agohidepastfavorite131 comments hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour agoAbout a year ago my wife and I made the joint decision to get her into college for a bachelor's degree in either English or computer science. Here in Finland, university admissions are based around how well you did on various end of school exams, and she fortunately did quite well on all of them a decade ago - except for math. She bombed math due to health and family problems as a teenager decimating her ability to pay sustained focused attention. Luckily, soon after the decision was made, I finally got my first full time job in Finland. I could easily support the two of us and give her an uninterrupted life to focus on grinding up for the math exam. We took the last ~10 years' worth of math exams online, turned their problems into Anki cards, and set her nose to the grindstone. I had had tremendous success with this in college with abstract algebra and real analysis, so I figured the same methodical approach + a very stable living situation was bound to work for algebra through basic calculus. Five months later, she retakes the high school exam and gets the highest score possible! Her rapid success at this convinced her to give CS a serious try, and indeed her improved math exam was the differentiator - without it she would not have been accepted to the CS program. She got top marks in her first semester at CS as well, I couldn't be more proud. My wife is truly an incredible person. reply baq 40 minutes agoparent> set her nose to the grindstone Worth calling out the key observation: it takes practice, and lots of it (for most people, anyway) to get good at math. Just reading about it does zilch. reply tux3 17 minutes agorootparentIt does a little more than zilch. Exercise is important. Reading is also important. If you want to learn fast, you need a balance of both that works for you. Some people will spend months grinding hard problems on their own in a single chapter to make sure they really understand. Some people will read too fast and have to go back because they don't have solid foundations, and only thought they understood. Reading is about as important as doing exercises. You're not going to reinvent all of math on your own. You get insights from both. reply NeutralForest 1 hour agoparentprevCool comment, it's great seeing people being supportive of their SO =) reply mjburgess 1 hour agoprevThe \"math\" used in ML/AI papers is usually just a sort of 'whiteboard math' which is a domain-specific mishmash of linear algebra, calculus, set theory and statistics. If you could find a book just going through the relevant bits you wouldnt really have to \"learn math again\", it can be translated into english straightforwardly -- very very few ML papers relevant to industry have extended proofs, etc. that require eg., even being able to differentiate anything yourself. 90% of it is: here's the domain (ie., type) of our variables, here's the formula of our functions, we're taking a weighted average with some inner products involved. It might sound like a lot of math, but it's really all doable in semester-1 of an undergrad course, were it focused enough. reply sjducb 32 minutes agoparentI think you don’t realise how much math you know. I’ve heard of set theory, but never studied it. reply mjburgess 17 minutes agorootparentsure, but you dont need to understand actual set theory -- it's just notation for mostly obvious programming stuff, R means float, Z means int R^2 is actually notation from linear algebra, but here it means a point is 2 floats with a measure of distance between points etc. A lot of this could just be given in a \"crib sheet\" for tech people, and you'd get 80% of it straightaway. It's years of work to understand this notation as used by the professional domains it was invented by, but it's a couple weeks for most \"good, technical, software engineers\" -- since they arent really using notation in much more than superficial ways. Of course there are hard mathematical papers, etc. but they're rare in ML/AI mainstream papers; and not something most would read. If you need to be able to read, eg., some sort of adv. statistical time series research in economic modelling, you'd already have the background to do that. If all you want is to be able to read 90% of the popular papers, the notation in them is just syntax sugar for things you could state easily in english or python reply programjames 47 minutes agoparentprevNormalizing flows and neural ODEs are becoming a bigger thing, and they do involve some more heavy maths. reply jorgesborges 7 hours agoprevI’m a thirty-something with an arts degree who decided to learn math. Basically I was tired of reading popular science and being fed metaphors to understand concepts. I wanted to “see” it for myself. I spent time online at Khan Academy and friends for a year or so on and off. It was fine but meandering? So I enrolled in community college! It’s great. I have a clearer path, immediate feedback, teachers, and an obligation to do work that keeps me on it. Ultimately my plan is to get enough transfer credits for university and spend this decade slowly working toward a bachelor of science in physics. reply jambutters 5 hours agoparentI actually find the immediate feedback from khan academy exercises better than school actually. The feedback loop is much more tighter instead of waiting an entire week later for results and not really getting another go at it. I also tend to zone out or miss something in the lecture, and that missed thing is what builds the entire foundation for everything else and then the entire lecture is pointless. With video based lectures, I can pause, go back, play 2x speed, look at multiple well produced explanations, etc. Ultimately I don't find face to face all that valuable a various amount of subjects. reply andrepd 1 hour agorootparentReplacing lectures with video lectures is fine, even an improvement. But not such much for exercises/problem-solving/practical classes. reply javchz 7 hours agoparentprev100% Agree. Im a big proponent of developing self-thought skills and making the best of e-learning, but I think math (alongside languages and other) are one of those areas where the real time feedback makes traditional education still worthwhile.

Eg., you would do problems, and only take lessons when you couldn't complete a problem.

Go check it out ! But maybe for some people, spending money is a necessity because it motivates them to finish the courses. It happens. [1] - https://openstax.org/subjects/math reply dcw303 8 hours agoprevI've been doing similar for about a year. My target is to learn the math needed to make 3d games, so basically algebra, geometry, calculus and linear algebra. I started with brilliant.org, and while I liked the level of polish in the interactive lessons, I found the lesson structure to be out of sequence, often referring to things that haven't been covered yet. They didn't seem to have put as much thought into pedagogy as Math Academy as described in TFA. So I gave up on that and instead have been shipping several kilograms of dead tree across the pacific in the form of The Art Of Problem Solving series of textbooks. They are great, the lesson structure and building up of complex ideas from first principles is outstanding. They will humble you though, as the exercises are tough. They're also quite expensive but IMHO worth it. Math Academy does look interesting, If I was not halfway through my series I would probably take a look. But I do enjoy having reference books on hand. Many times I've jumped back to brush up on a topic that has slipped from memory. I solve my exercises with the most low tech solution possible, but I like the freedom it gives me to try new approaches, and nothing beats the latency between idea to ink on paper. edit: also wanted to add that I've enrolled Chat GPT4 as my tutor. Contrary to many other's experiences that I've read, I find it to generally be very good at reasoning in this level of mathematics. It's helped me many times when I've gotten stuck. And on the occasions where it bullshitted its way to an incorrect answer, I always challenge it if I don't understand, and we ultimately find out if it hallucinated something (rare, can usually be fixed by restating the problem), or I gave it the wrong input to start with (unfortunately more common than I'd like) reply pvg 7 hours agoparentAre you using any of the stuff you're learning for whatever practical 3d game-making things you're working on? Just curious how it's working out, you've picked a pretty broad foundation as a starting point. reply dcw303 6 hours agorootparentI took a brief detour late last year to study \"Linear Algebra: Theory, Intuition, Code\", and to my surprise it stuck pretty well. The author said the pre-reqs were just \"basic high school math\", but I'm glad I had recently done lots of algebra and geometry, as the difference between that and some vague memories of stuff I did 30 years ago in school is pretty wide. I haven't started any 3d game projects yet. For that, my plan is to do the webgpufundamentals.org course first. Scanning the TOC, I think I would be able to attempt it from what I learned from the linear algebra book. That said, I'm doing AOPS Intermediate Algebra at the moment, and the Precalc text covers more advanced trig and matrix stuff, so I'm thinking it would be good to finish at least to there before starting to apply the knowledge. reply pvg 3 hours agorootparentYeah, it sounds like you're not far from the point where you can start jumping ahead and working backwards to fill in the bits that you're missing - that's what many people naturally and instinctively try and it can work but can also be frustrating if one misjudges one's degree of proficiency. You don't often see 'I'm just going to give myself a full secondary school maths refresher' which is more demanding on time and self-discipline but at least we know it's pretty reliable given those things. reply AlchemistCamp 7 hours agoparentprevI totally agree with you on the value in using Chat GTP when stuck. What's the scope of The Art of Problem Solving? How far does the series go? reply dcw303 7 hours agorootparentAOPS audience is gifted high school kids, so it doesn't get up to the college level. The core texts are: - Prealgebra - Intro to Algebra - Intro to Counting & Probability - Intro to Geometry - Intro to Number Theory - Intermediate Algebra - Intermediate Counting & Probability - Precalculus - Calculus reply lordnacho 1 hour agorootparentI bought the whole set for my kid. He's also doing Brilliant. It starts at somewhere that the kids are at the end of primary school (at least in the UK) and ends somewhere in high school. My kid could already do all the pre-algebra stuff, so that book went fast. The way I see it, the kids waste a lot of time in the middle years when they already know the arithmetic and pre-algebra, but might as well be doing a bunch of more interesting things. reply AlchemistCamp 7 hours agorootparentprevAh, okay. I actually took calculus in 8th grade. I studied another two years past that, dropped out, and then later did a complete 180 and graduated with a literature degree. I'm now over 40 and interested in relearning the math I learned long ago and pushing a bit further than I had before. reply aoki 6 hours agorootparentThere’s also an intermediate number theory class that’s basically at the level of a college elementary NT course (one that does not assume abstract algebra), an Olympiad geometry class, and a group theory class. The first two do not have a text, the third has a text but you can’t get it without enrolling. reply MrVitaliy 4 hours agorootparentprevI think it's a weird way to learn math, and I learned it this way in school. Most of these courses just teach information memorization and recall. sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 = 1, etc. I would start with something like Elementary Analysis: The Theory of Calculus, and work from there. You'll eventually arrive at the same place -- Calculus but from a much stronger mathematical foundation. reply dcw303 3 hours agorootparentI have not found that to be the case, the books I have read have gone into deep foundational detail to build up knowledge. Perhaps you're referring to Vol 1 & 2 of \"The Art Of Problem Solving\"? I haven't read them but from what I know they are a distillation of core concepts for students looking to do competitive maths. It's confusing because that title is also the name of the publisher / website of the series of the books I'm reading. reply ammasant 4 hours agorootparentprevYou learned using the AOPS books? Don't be fooled by the titles, these books exclusively use a proof-based approach to construct a pretty wide foundation around these topics. reply elteto 7 hours agorootparentprevAre you doing the online classes or only the books? I wanted to register for the online classes but they seem to be heavily oriented towards interactive learning. reply aoki 6 hours agorootparentThe ones that have “instructors” and class times have chat-based sessions that you can skip if you prefer. Part of the homework is based on an adaptive problem system (Alcumus, which you can actually use for free) and part is weekly problem sets mostly based on the textbook. Writing (proof) problems are graded by a human so it is a useful way to get feedback on your proof-writing skills (if you know you are worse at it than a college math major). reply dcw303 7 hours agorootparentprevJust self study with the (physical) books. I did also try the ebook combo for the Prealgebra book, but I found typing latex in the answers to the exercises was cumbersome. I think the online classes with interactive lessons is a separate thing, but I don't have any experience with that. reply ginbazinga 4 hours agoprevIf OP still wants to learn the mathematical foundation of transformers, I built a free alternative learning tool: https://afaik.io/nebula?mode=nebula&category=blueprint&id=ed... It's also based on an underlying knowledge graph, connecting concepts across various subjects like maths, machine learning, physics, etc. You can check the graph for transformer here: https://afaik.io/nebula?category=brickset&id=VLlOnZLl&mode=d... (only available on desktop... Basically, it frees you from learning maths from scratch and just learning the prerequisites required to grasp the concept, and there are free resources attached. Don't get me wrong, I can totally relate to the desire to relearn maths. One of the reasons that I'm building this tool is for me to relearn physics and know how to get there with my maths and cs background. I just feel in this specific scenario there might be more effective ways to learn in depth and have fun at the same time. reply galaxyLogic 3 hours agoparentI find the concept of \"underlying knowledge graph\" interesting. What does it mean? I assume it means such a graph connects the topics together as \"pre-requisites\". To understand A you need to already understand B and C, and to understand B you need to understand D and ... etc. But the thing about such a graph is that really it must be a tree, not just a directed graph. Why? Because there cannot be cycles in it. If to understand A you need to understand B, and to understand B you would need to understand A, you could never understand either of them. Right? reply ginnungagap 2 hours agorootparentIf to understand D you need to know both B and C, each of which requires familiarity with A, the graph is not a tree reply viraptor 39 minutes agorootparentprev> it must be a tree, not just a directed graph It may be a tree. But it must be a DAG (directed acyclic graph). reply boxfire 8 hours agoprevI may be biased as I am a trained Mathematician, but I always feel when someone says \"Math is Hard\", that is because they had bad teachers. Math is easy if you build up from fundamentals, not like physics education where you say \"but lets delete everything before because it had an oversimplifying assumption\", rather if you build your knowledge entirely sequentially from things you know or assume, you build up a toolbag that applies literally everywhere. So math isnt hard. Learning random bits of math out of context is hard. Climb the ladder once, you have it for life. Hopefully for this person that sticks. reply MrDresden 1 hour agoparent> ... it is because they had bad teachers. > Math is easy if... The one constant I observed in most parts of my mathamatics journey (math major in college, software engineering & computer science at university) was the lack of understanding by the person doing the math teaching that not everyone will be able to follow along if steps in the ladder are missing. Words and sentences like 'it is obvious', 'clearly', 'as can be seen' should be avoided when teaching someone a subject as abstract as mathematics as inevitably you are not fully realising the size of the gap in knowledge between you and your students and how such statements can leave them feeling frustrated. reply hiAndrewQuinn 17 minutes agoparentprevI'll bite, I think this is mostly bias. Strong evidence against this is that the average IQ of a mathematics undergraduate is, like, 125 or so, compared to ~115 for the average college graduate - that is just way too sizeable a difference to be explained by chance. Math really does seem just plain hard for a great many people. It seems to me from having done some math on the inside like it also would get harder with each point downward in IQ than at a faster rate than most other valuable things in life. reply baq 27 minutes agoparentprevIMHO when people say 'math is hard' they mean 'it takes more work than other subjects to be good at' - you're either a prodigy or you grind problems until you get the intuition. The easier subjects you can usually talk everyone and yourself into thinking you know them, or perhaps the ratio of memoization to practice is skewed more towards memoization. Maths is practice, practice, practice and then some more practice - blood, sweat and tears. reply hintymad 8 hours agoparentprev> Math is easy if you build up from fundamentals To a certain point, I guess. Most people hit a wall of abstraction at some point, either because the abstraction is too hard or because the abstraction stops being relevant so the person loses drive to learn. For me, the wall is model theory and the second course of abstract algebra. They are both too hard and too abstract for me to push through. reply ChainOfFools 6 hours agorootparent> abstraction stops being relevant I found this to be the points where abstractions being learned today are only precursors for abstractions that will be learned tomorrow. Another way to put it is at the stage where you're learning to make tools that are themselves only used to make other tools, not used to get results outside of the domain of tool making. These stages have no apparent relevance outside of math, and if your style of memory formation depends on making many inferential links to laterally associated concepts, moreso than making a few direct links between vertically associated concepts, it can be rough going. A lot of what feels like following memorized pirate treasure map directions in the dark, with no sense of what obstacles you're working around or even the general direction where the treasure lies to give you a sense of bearing and progress. reply galaxyLogic 3 hours agorootparentI remember memorizing multiplication tables in school. I learned that 3 x 9 = 27. You just had to memorize that, right? Well then I realized that if 3 x 10 = 30, then 3 x 9 must be one fewer '3' added together by the multiplication, which means take out one '3' from the set of 3s you are adding together by multiplication when doing 3 x 10, which comes to 30 - 3 = 27. That means I didn't really need to memorize 3 x 9, I needed the above simple rule in addition to the fact that n x 10 is always what you get when you take the digit 'n' and add a 0 after it. So learning multiplication tables was hard, until I learned the rule of looking for an easier-to-remember result and then adding or subtracting something to it. Of course I also had to understand that multiplication is really just repeated addition. My teacher never taught me this trick, just told us to recite the multiplication tables in out heads again and again. But after doing that for some time I figured out the above trick myself. Learning math beyond multiplication is hard if you cannot multiply numbers in your head, because lots of math presentations assume that of course you know that 3 x 9 = 27. Or something similar. It is not just about understanding the concepts, it's about being able to perform calculations, in your head. Else you cannot understand the explanations of new concepts. Even though we have pocket-calculators, we still need to be able to do calculations in our heads to understand new topics. in math. So, learning what is 3 x 9 is not hard AFTER you have learned n * 10, and this trick. I assume something like that happens in the minds of mathematicians. They know a lot of math already which makes it easier to understand new results when they already know a lot. To learn what is n * 10, you had to learn 1 x 10, 2 x 10, 3 x 10 etc. and then understand the pattern in there. Learning something is easy if you already know lots of related stuff. So it's not about learning more and more difficult things, it is about just learning more and more, related things. It is about having more and more (learned) data in your head. I assume that is also why LLMs work so well: They have lots of data. In summary: Learning math is not \"difficult\", it is tedious. reply trws 8 hours agoparentprevI probably had crummy teachers in some places, but my experience was that math up through linear algebra made sense and wasn’t all that bad, but that calculus was a huge bag of “if it looks kinda like this try this thing, and if the result looks kinda right it probably worked, if not try this other thing” such that I could never form a framework for it in my head. Also didn’t help when teachers in some things would say “oh this is much easier and more straightforward with calculus”, even without a prerequisite for it, and proceed to only explain concepts with calculus half or more of the class had never learned. One of these days I need to find a way to get it the right way. reply tnecniv 8 hours agorootparentIn hindsight, that’s because high school calculus doesn’t teach you how things work and just teaches you a bag of tricks so you can grind through problems. There’s a certain number of tricks you should know, I.e., you should be able to take some simple integrals and derivatives, but for higher math, you run into complicated things where the tricks don’t work or don’t exist. Some of the tricks are actually really useful, but you have to fully internalize where they come from, e.g., integration by parts just comes from rearranging the chain rule, and, if you know that, you can apply it to more exotic derivatives. I did well in HS calculus but struggled in college math because the bag of tricks approach doesn’t work there. It took a lot of effort for me to undo the bad habits I learned from K-12 math and learn the good stuff, but it paid off. Also, it’s well known that eventually professional mathematicians hate certain kinds of math. There’s the classic divide between analysists (those that do calculus-type stuff) and algebrists (those that do things like group theory, and linear algebra goes here). You don’t have to like it all, and something you don’t appreciate the first time you see it, you may enjoy later reply cloogshicer 8 hours agoparentprevThis assumes that climbing the ladder comes easy. To me at least, it doesn't. It requires tedious labor, and lots of repetition for every single step. That's the main difference I keep noticing between me and people who say they like math or find it easy. They just look at each step of the ladder once, and immediately \"get\" it, sometimes even skipping steps. In contrast, I need to repeatedly step up and down the ladder multiple times, until I can take the next step. reply dcw303 7 hours agorootparentMy theory is that people who like math have a reward system that responds well to gaining an understanding on empirical concepts. I have that, and it does drive me to keep studying math. Not that I find it easy though, I don't think I'm able to skip steps, and I often have to repeat things I've already done before they sink in. The difference is that I find this process enjoyable, so I don't mind spending the time. If I can compare to another activity, I've always wanted to be an artist as well, and have spend quite a bit of time trying to build up the skills. The problem is that, if I'm honest with myself, is I just don't enjoy the process of creative expression, it doesn't trigger any reward system that means anything for me. I wish it did but there's just nothing there. It was a hard pill to swallow, but I realized I like the idea of being an artist, but I don't enjoy the process. Hence my ultimately crummy artwork! Sorry, I realized I'm talking about myself more than you, but I hope it's some help. The point I hope it makes is that everyone has a different personality, and from that different reward systems. It sounds to me like yours doesn't align with math, and that's fine. I wouldn't try to force yourself to study something which you don't love, at least if it's optional self study. Find subjects that you love learning, and the results will come naturally. reply davorak 7 hours agorootparent> The difference is that I find this process enjoyable, so I don't mind spending the time. This is definitely the difference for at least some of the people out there, however... Imagine however that you do enjoy it at the start so you move on from topic Y to topic Y+1, then to to Y+2. However you find that you no longer understand Y and you need Y when you are doing trying to learn Y+3 so you study Y+3 and Y, now your progress in Y+3 has been slowed down. Really your goal was to get o Y+7 though that is where you can start breaking new ground and contributing but as you try Y+4 and Y+5 the gains stop and maybe even reverse. You are now on a learning treadmill(perhaps sometimes falling off and having to restart too) redoing Y-1,2,3,4,5 not moving forward. Often it is possible to find a trick/skill/simplification/etc to continue moving forward to get to Y+6,7. How long would you find the process fun on that treadmill though? I think it is common to not find covering the same ground over and over fun or never being able to make it to the point where you are part of peer group where you can contribute.

I have UK A level math but not Further Math, so up to basic calculus. But I forgot most of it and so Math Academy has me going through a lot of the Math Foundation units along the way. I was initially put off by the monthly price, as it is quite steep. The clincher is that about a year before starting Math Academy I had gone through the Open University’s MST124/125 textbooks (covering the same stuff as Foundations). Except even after a year I’d already forgotten most of it. Math Academy learning feels much more robust, since it includes spaced reviews and regular tests. I record things in Anki but it’s useful to have regular practice questions too. I also use ChatGPT to spell out things and find it works well at this level. Some things I’d like Math Academy to have: - ability to skip lessons (I don’t want to spend ages going over symbolic integration again) - a reference page to track unlocked material, maybe with Anki integration - fewer multiple choice questions and more in depth problems - proof-based math. I’m told this is coming but the degree-level courses have missed their estimated due dates. I will definitely finish Math for ML and then do linear algebra and multivariate calculus. You’d still need a good textbook to do them rigorously, but I think Math Academy sets you up well. reply eps 46 minutes agorootparentprevYes, it's very good. Math Academy is much more dense and on-point that Khan's. You don't have to sit through 15 minutes of video when 2 minutes worth of text explanation does it. It uses spaced repetition for topics that you aren't good at, and for recently learned subjects. The topic dependency tree and automatic progressing to \"unlocked\" topics is obvious in retrospect, but here it's done very cleanly and unobtrusively. The initial evaluation test is worth its weight in gold. It eliminates the need to grind through things that you already know, but still covers any gaps. I had kids on Khan for few weeks and it was a hassle. The pace was too slow, too much time sunk into trivialities and they were bored most of the time. With Math Academy they sit down, they do their 20-30 min of focused hands-on effort and they are done for the day. reply AlchemistCamp 7 hours agorootparentprevI did a year and a half ago before getting too busy with work.

Just keep in mind that the target is largely students, (at least at the moment) so the aim is mastery of the subject - if you're interested in learning the concept but not actually doing a lot of practice of using it, then it may not be the right service. And there are magic internet points / leaderboards if gamification is something that works for you. The exercise sizes are also very small almost all the time.

My speculation is that this naturally leads cruft that needs to be worked through by people entering the field. The cruft can not get too big or people don't enter the field so people are motivated to keep the cruft below a certain level but not the minimum. The cruft makes it harder to enter the field and once you have over come that hurdle you move on to do things in the field not reduce the cruft. Other things that make it hard to reduce cruft 1. not everyone is going to agree what is cruft 2.

I can speak a bit as to the stuff that's skipped in the Foundation Series. After developing a curriculum that covers all the standards for 4th grade through AP Calculus BC, as well as plenty of advanced university courses (many of which are still under construction, but the structure is mapped out pretty comprehensively), we found that roughly a third of 4th grade through AP Calculus BC topics were not actually prerequisites for university math. So, we created a streamlined Mathematical Foundations course sequence that cuts out those topics. Those topics are necessary to check the box on grade-level / common core standards, but they're not really necessary for adult learners who want to pursue advanced university courses as soon as possible but lack the necessary foundational knowledge. I'll also send your question to my colleague Alex Smith, our Director of Content, who designed the Mathematical Foundations courses himself and can elaborate more on the specifics. reply ramblenode 5 hours agorootparentThanks for responding. What are some examples of topics that you cut out from the high school math curricula? I have seen modern Algebra II courses remove conic sections in order to make more room for probability and statistics. reply Math-Ninja 1 hour agorootparentHi, I'm Alex, curriculum director at Math Academy. As Justin mentioned, there are several criteria that we must meet in our high-school pathway that aren't needed for studying higher-level (e.g., undergraduate) math, or they can be postponed. We decided to remove some of these in the Foundations series. The idea behind the foundations series is to provide adult learners with the most efficient path possible to get onto the higher-level material. Examples of topics that were removed from the high-school series to create the foundations series include some of the following: * Various Geometry topics: All of the _essential_ geometry is covered. However, we removed topics on inscribed angles, Thales' Theorem, Triangle congruence, and similarity criteria (apart from the AA, which is the only one that seems to come up in practice), midpoint and triangle proportionality theorems, a fair amount of solid geometry, except what's fairly standard for calculus (volumes and surface areas of spheres, volumes of cones), lots of stuff on different types of quadrilaterals. * Conic sections: The essentials are covered in both pathways. But in the high-school path, we go into a little more detail about foci, directrices, eccentricity, and utilizing their geometric definitions (e.g., focus-directrix properties). * Trig identities and Equations: Covered in both pathways, but the high-school versions go into more detail and consider more cases. * Some word problem/modeling topics. * Other arbitrary Prealgebra topics: Divisibility rules, going into more detail about ratios in contextual settings, scientific notation, and some basic data representation topics that one would normally meet in Prealgebra. * Slope fields. This will be covered in our upcoming differential equations course. * Some analytical applications of differentiation that are quite specific to the BC Calculus exam: Identifying and removing point, jump, and infinite discontinuities and analyzing graphs of first and second derivatives. * There are also fewer topics on related rates and optimization, though these topics are still covered. * Some contextual applications of integration, like volumes of revolution and volumes of known cross-sections. * Convergence tests for infinite series. When we get to that, these will be covered in real analysis, but other than infinite geometric series (which _is_ covered in Foundations), these tests don't show up too often anywhere else. * Some ODE models, such as exponential and logistic growth and decay. We cover ODE basics in the foundations course, but particular models will be covered in the differential equations course. * Taylor series. Again, this can be covered in the differential equations course for anyone wishing to take that course when it's ready.

(I assume the founders will see this thread once they notice the HN hug of death) 1. How exactly is AI being used here? Is there an AI chat-bot that I can ask for help? Do you generate problem-sets with AI? Check answers with AI? Is it GPT-4? 2. Do you utilize Spaced-Repetition in any way? Have you found that to be useful? Thank you reply JustinSkycak 7 hours agoparentHi there, my name is Justin Skycak, I'm the Director of Analytics & Algorithms at Math Academy, I developed all of our quantitative software, and I'd be happy to answer your questions. 1. The AI is more like an expert system that emulates the decisions of an expert tutor with regard to what tasks a student should work on at any given point in time (what should the student learn next, what do they need to review). There's a knowledge graph that encodes structural relationships between thousands of math topics (such as prerequisite relationships, but also other types). And then there's an algorithmic reasoning system that looks at a student's answers, overlays them on the knowledge graph, figures out what the student knows (and how well they know it), and decides what learning tasks are going to move the needle most given their personal knowledge profile. The decision-making is inspired by cognitive learning strategies such as mastery learning, spaced repetition, interleaving, minimizing associative interference. 2. Yes, spaced repetition is a core part of the system. Each student has a personalized spaced repetition schedule that adapts to their performance on each topic, and when choosing what topics a student should review or learn next, we're always trying to implicitly \"knock out\" as many due reviews as possible to maximize learning efficiency. (For instance, if a student is due for a review on one-step ax=b equations, we can implicitly \"knock out\" that review by having them learn two-step ax+b=c equations instead.) From a quantitative standpoint, the spaced repetition model was one of the more challenging (but equally fun) parts to build. You normally think of spaced repetition in the context of independent flashcards, but in a hierarchical body of knowledge like mathematics, it gets really complicated because repetitions on advanced topics should \"trickle down\" to update the repetition schedules of simpler topics that are implicitly practiced (while being discounted appropriately since these repetitions are often too early to count for full credit towards the next repetition). Our spaced repetition model not only accounts for implicit \"trickle-down\" repetitions but also minimizes the number of reviews by choosing reviews whose implicit repetitions \"knock out\" other due reviews (like dominos), and calibrates the speed of the spaced repetition process to each individual student on each individual topic (student ability and topic difficulty are competing factors). reply jacquesm 7 hours agorootparentWhy am I not surprised that a marketeer shows up in an 'organic' posting about a company. reply gmays 5 hours agorootparentFYI this is the guy that wrote the comment you replied to: https://www.justinmath.com He's true math nerd, and definitely not a marketer. In fact, I don't think a single marketer works at the company. It's a bootstrapped labor of love and I've been following their journey for almost a decade. I get the skepticism, but some things are legit. reply jacquesm 3 hours agorootparentI'm sure there are math nerds that work in marketing. Your whole blog post comes across as an advert, that may not have been your intention but that's what it looks like to me, legit or not. reply eps 33 minutes agorootparentprevDon't be nasty. Especially ridiculing a tech person giving detailed and interesting answers as a \"marketeer\". reply TotoHorner 2 hours agorootparentprevVery cool! Thanks for the reply. It would be awesome if you could also add GPT-4 as a kind of helpful tutor. Not sure if you're already experimenting with that. > Our spaced repetition model not only accounts for implicit \"trickle-down\" repetitions but also minimizes the number of reviews by choosing reviews whose implicit repetitions \"knock out\" other due reviews (like dominos), and calibrates the speed of the spaced repetition process to each individual student on each individual topic (student ability and topic difficulty are competing factors). That's super interesting and definitely one of the issues I faced while building anki cards for math classes I took in undergrad. Thanks again! reply __loam 6 hours agoprevI've got an engineering degree but I've been thinking about trying to relearn this stuff. Sometimes it felt like I was just surviving rather than getting any of the skills to stick. reply paulpauper 3 hours agoprevThere is so much interest in self-learning math or physics. We're in something of an autodidacticism boom. The amount of work to even have any hope of being proficient at this is substantial. For some reason it's always self-learning math or physics, which are among the two most difficult subjects. You got your work cut out. Even if you understand the basic concepts, understanding papers is another level above that. reply 6d6b73 8 hours agoprev$49/student/month?

Given that it sounds like this is something you want to deliberately spend time on rather than just an app to use when you're bored it might be worth it but probably not so much if you can't use the knowledge professionally somehow. reply juunpp 7 hours agoprevThis is basically an unsolicited ad post.

Is that so bad? reply jcpst 4 hours agorootparentYes, I agree, it reads like an ad. But I did in fact find it inspiring. For all I know, maybe it is a targeted ad. I am a software engineer at a large company. I was selected and flown to HQ for training on integrating LLMs into applications. I am currently building systems that support our data scientists. I’ve tried picking up more math skills a few times. But I’ve never taken trig or calc. I’d like to understand ML and LLMs better, but I feel like I’m not even sure where to start with trying to learn math. For I have a family and a job as well. So the adult track of that Math Academy site does seem like something I would try. reply SuperNinKenDo 8 hours agoprevWell, it's essentially an ad/shout-out for the mate's product, but if the value is there, the value is there. I can't afford the subscription price and don't care much for subscriptions these days anyway, but I'd love to found my own education company in the future, so wishing nothing but the best, and happy to see someone hopefully being able to make some money in the spacez even when free alternatives like Khan Academy are already established. Edit: The original post has no value in explaining how the author is learning maths other than to say that they're using the Math Academy platform, and taking notes. Useless to anybody not interested in a $49/month subscription to a semi-open beta.
