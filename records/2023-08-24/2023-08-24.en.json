GANs are way faster than diffusion models because they generate the image in a single forward pass and their true latent space encoding makes editing a breeze.(And if you&#x27;re wondering how it can look so good when &#x27;everyone knows GANs don&#x27;t work because they&#x27;re too unstable&#x27;, a widespread myth, repeated by many DL researchers who ought to know better, GANs can scale to high-quality realistic images on billion-image scale datasets, and become more, not less, stable with scale, like many things in deep reinforcement learning. See for example BigGAN on JFT-300m https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1809.11096.pdf#page=8&org=deepmind , GigaGAN https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2303.05511 , Projected GAN https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2111.01007 , StyleGAN-XL https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2202.00273 , or Tensorfork&#x27;s chaos runs https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gwern.net&#x2F;gan#tensorfork-chaos-runs . &#x27;Computing is a pop culture&#x27;...) reply dragonwriter 16 hours agoparent> If you&#x27;re wondering how it&#x27;s so fast and cheap and they can generate variants so easilyI assume its cheap because they are burning money to build a business, its not fast at all, and the quality... sucks.> And if you&#x27;re wondering how it can look so goodI’m not.I&#x27;m wondering why they’re trying to get people to use something worse than using a decent photorealistic SD1.5-based checkpoint with some basic prompt templating.Not saying GANs can&#x27;t be awesome, just that this site isn&#x27;t what I’d use to make that case. reply mrguyorama 14 hours agorootparentLooking at the poses, it feels optimized for generating porn, but one example someone showed had a child&#x27;s face (good god please don&#x27;t let your \"AI\" system generate child anything if you want to sell it for porn purposes), and another user noted that their attempt error&#x27;d out because it \"detected nudity\", even though other users get given a nude model by default. reply dotancohen 14 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t know if the thing in the crotch is a penis or a scrotum, but it is definitely NSFW:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;images.generated.photos&#x2F;0wV1dBnZ15hGneEfqfZT7SdEIill...My prompt was simply \"Standing in front of a rocket.\". reply notmeanywhere 6 hours agorootparentI had one generate a fully nude, spread eagle male model w&#x2F; a very vivid vagina when I typed in \"on couch\".

We had better quality 3-4 years ago. reply bravura 8 hours agoparentprevHi gwern, asking earnestly and without snark about this:\"And if you&#x27;re wondering how it can look so good when &#x27;everyone knows GANs don&#x27;t work because they&#x27;re too unstable&#x27;, a widespread myth, repeated by many DL researchers who ought to know better, GANs can scale to high-quality realistic images on billion-image scale datasets, and become more, not less, stable with scale, like many things in deep reinforcement learning.\"My interpretation from how this is written is that you are saying: \"Researchers say that GANs are unstable at inference time.\" Is that the correct reading? If so, where have you seen this sentiment? More commonly I&#x27;ve heard that people criticize GANs at inference time for mode collapse and monotony (which comes from training), not instability.Or are you saying that researchers say GANs are unstable during training, which is a common criticism. Don&#x27;t you feel this is the case? A lot of different tricks are used for getting generators that are roughly balanced with more powerful discriminators so that the adversarial game is balanced, like TTUR and encodec&#x27;s weight balancer etc. In this case, are you saying that GAN training is as straightforward as diffusion training?In my experience, GAN training involves an unholy number of heuristics and best-practices are still quite murky.I am eager to hear your response.[edit: my experience with GANs and diffusion models isn&#x27;t about taking image problems with existing working models and scaling or refining them, but about applying GANs and diffusion models to different domains (audio) and on novel problems with different kinds of conditioning. I would love to see more controlled experiments comparing weak and sophisticated generative backbones as the experimental control and varying the training regime across different GAN + diffusion flavors.] reply nbardy 17 hours agoparentprevYou’re overstating the simplicity of a scaling a GAN well.GigaGAN is the best quality out of those and requires 7 loss functions and is incredibly complicated.Sure GANs can scale, but Diffusion models are drastically easier to scale. reply gwern 15 hours agorootparentNo, I&#x27;m not. BigGAN did fine on scaling up to JFT-300M with basically no changes beyond model size and a simple architecture. This is also what we were observing, even with a buggy BigGAN implementation. GigaGAN is the best quality, but that&#x27;s mostly because it&#x27;s also the biggest; as Table 1 shows most of the gains come from various kinds of additional scaling. (And this is moving the goalposts from the usual assertion that \"GANs can&#x27;t scale\" to \"they&#x27;re harder to scale\"; note the self-fulfilling nature of such assertions. Considering how there is next to no GAN scaling research, these results are remarkable and show how much low-hanging fruit there is.)Diffusion models are only &#x27;drastically easier to scale&#x27; because researchers have spent the past 3 years researching pretty much nothing but diffusion models, discovering all sorts of subtle issues with them and how to make them scale, which is why it took them so long to become SOTA, and why massive architectural sweeps like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;abs&#x2F;2206.00364#nvidia were necessary to discover what makes them &#x27;easier to scale&#x27;. If this level of brute force and moon math is &#x27;easy&#x27;, lord save us from any architecture which is &#x27;hard&#x27;! reply GaggiX 13 hours agorootparentResearchers have spent several years try to even create a GAN that can fit well a distribution made of aligned faces (resulted into StyleGAN1&#x2F;2); with a simple unet with e-objective and cosine schedule you can fit much complex distributions, still using one loss: L1&#x2F;L2.Reading your comments make me feel like that you believe that just every researchers (even extremely smart dude like Karras) just switch to diffusion models because they are idiots, they should have instead focus on GANs and today we will have GANs that are as powerful or more than the diffusion models we have today and also work one step; this is just a weird delusion. Diffusion models are just simply much easier to train (just a L1&#x2F;L2 loss in most cases), write (for example your buggy BigGAN implementation), they usually work out-of-box on different resolutions and aspect ratios, you can just finetune them if you want to create an inpainting model; and for what is right now you just need much less compute to reach a good image coherency or maybe just reaching a coherence that as not been achieved by GAN models; like I would be curious even on a small scale experiment what a GAN (with ~55M parameters) would be able to perform after a 1-day&#x2F;2-day GPU time of training on Icon645 dataset, because my diffusion model I can assure is much better than I could have imagine while being trivial to implement (I just implemented a Unet as I remember one, nothing rigorous and of course no architecture sweep). reply sillysaurusx 10 hours agorootparentThere are so many holes in this, but to pick just one:> for example your buggy BigGAN implementationThe bug was that the batchnorm gamma was initialized to zero instead of one, so all the model params were being multiplied by zero instead of one. Literally any model that uses batchnorm is susceptible to this bug, and it certainly has nothing to do with GANs.I think it’s too easy to spout dogma, and calling gwern delusional is something I’ve learned from experience will prove foolish as t approaches infinity. reply GaggiX 9 hours agorootparentIt has to do with GANs as the added complexity makes the model more difficult to debug, the other day a friend of mine had a problem with the normalization layers of his diffusion model, it was fixed almost immediately, if something goes wrong you have less to worry about.Also no I don&#x27;t take \"he is gwern\" as an argument ahah reply sillysaurusx 7 hours agorootparentBookmarking this for when time proves you wrong after a couple years. I’ll drop by to say hello. reply ShamelessC 13 hours agorootparentprev> Diffusion models are only &#x27;drastically easier to scale&#x27; because researchers have spent the past 3 years researching pretty much nothing but diffusion modelsThis is what tends to happen when you find a superior method.GAN’s are fine, they have plenty of promise for tasks requiring rapid inference. But diffusion models beat GANs on robustness and image quality every time. reply GaggiX 16 hours agoparentprev>they&#x27;re too unstable&#x27;, a widespread myth>See for example BigGANI remember when you try training a BigGAN model on anime images, the quality was bad. Now look at this example, one single GPU, 1.5M images with a diffusion model: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@enryu9000&#x2F;anifusion-diffusion-models-for... ,the difference in quality is absurd, you can say this or that is not true but the quality speak for itself, obtaining good quality on complex distribution is much easier with a diffusion model than a GAN.For example in the case of the site linked they have conditioned the model on poses because you&#x27;re not going to get anything close to be coherent without them with a simple StyleGAN as they say they&#x27;re using. reply gwern 15 hours agorootparent> I remember when you try training a BigGAN model on anime images, the quality was badBecause there was a bug in the code, in a part unrelated to the GAN itself.> the difference in quality is absurdYes, it does help to train on anime with code that isn&#x27;t buggy. (BTW, Skylion was getting good results with GANs on anime similarly restricted to centered figures like those samples, he just refuses to ever publish anything.) reply GaggiX 14 hours agorootparentSo you believe that without the bug you would be able to come close to the quality of the diffusion model I have linked? I&#x27;m not even asking about using the same compute (1 GPU for ~1 month) but if you just believe BigGAN can come close to that in general.Also the bug is probably related to the added complexity of training a GAN model in comparison to a diffusion model. reply Tyr42 16 hours agorootparentprevBroken link? reply GaggiX 16 hours agorootparentFixed thx reply syntaxing 17 hours agoparentprev> everyone knows GANs don&#x27;t work because they&#x27;re too unstableIs that a wide spread myth? I thought it’s widely accepted that GAN is really good generating these artificial pictures (it’s what started DeepFake after all) when you know your model’s “button”. Similar to how this uses GAN since they have a model “boundary condition”. While humans are diverse, we have a set of repeatable features (two legs, two arms, etc). Diffusion models are great because you can control the latent space with something way more generic, like text hence why it’s been so much more mainstream.Edit: actually I might be misremembering, I think Deepfake used VAEs? reply gwern 15 hours agorootparentIt is very widespread. You will see people in this very thread dismissing GANs as fundamentally failed, and hotly objecting to any kind of parity, even if they have to fall back to &#x27;well ok GANs do scale, but they&#x27;re more complicated&#x27;. I also have some representative quotes in my linked draft essay from various papers & DL Twitter discussions. (Another way to put it would be: when was the last time you saw someone besides me asserting that GANs can scale to high-quality general images and are not dramatically inferior to diffusion? I rest my case.) reply ShamelessC 8 hours agorootparent> Another way to put it would be: when was the last time you saw someone besides me asserting that GANs can scale to high-quality general images and are not dramatically inferior to diffusion? I rest my case.Get off of Twitter, maybe? I don&#x27;t know but I have seen a ton of work done on large scale GANs. The incentives are pretty fucking obvious - they are faster to use. Of _course_ people want them to work for the same usecases as diffusion.Maybe they will someday! But they aren&#x27;t currently. You&#x27;re referencing a zeitgeist that I am not familiar with and therefore come across overly defensive. reply ShamelessC 13 hours agorootparentprevSounds very important to you that you don’t have to change the premise of your essay or ever admit you’re wrong. No one is dismissive of GAN’s here without justification. They’re fine. They don’t beat diffusion, but they’re fine.You come across as severely, _severely_ biased and reactionary. replysebzim4500 13 hours agoparentprev>And if you&#x27;re wondering how it can look so goodI don&#x27;t think anyone is wondering this, especially if they are used to playing with diffusion models. reply brucethemoose2 18 hours agoparentprevThere was a whole community around ESRGAN img2img finetuning kinda like Stable Diffusion LORA community... albeit a much, much smaller one. reply motoboi 18 hours agoparentprevWhat I’m really wondering is how can this be free.

But still, I find this incredibly frightening. These are only going to get better. Does anyone doubt that in a couple years time (if that) we&#x27;ll be able to put the image of any known public person into whatever generated photo we want, which would be indistinguishable from reality?

Unless there were some reason to believe that further improvement isn&#x27;t possible, as you say, it is likely to become indistinguishable from reality in the relatively near future. reply mmh0000 15 hours agoparentprevWe&#x27;re basically there right now betweem Deepnude[1] and Photoshop.[1] (NSFW, seriously.) https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepnude.cc&#x2F; reply CDSlice 9 hours agorootparent> The most powerful image deepfake AI ever created.

It’s a pure fiction. But it still bothers me. reply CDSlice 9 hours agorootparentIt is fiction yes, but if it is lifelike enough does the difference matter? Even without the ick factor of making porn of someone without their consent, it would be so easy to destroy someone&#x27;s career or relationship by making these deepfakes and then spreading them around. Especially once the tech gets more life-like and loses the current AI gen tells.And the same would apply to doing this the old fashioned way in Photoshop, however you have to admit that taking it from \"need special software and experience in using that software\" to \"just upload their image to a website and get back their AI generated nudes\" is a huge change in how accessible this is. reply jfoster 8 hours agorootparentPotentially the opposite. It may become more difficult to use such images to harm someone&#x27;s career or relationship. Perhaps nothing is believable in the future. reply HPMOR 7 hours agorootparentI’d like to believe that this is the future. Already with the rise of digitally native relationships nudes have become commonplace (even Jeff Bezos has sent some).

Should every URL be doxxable? reply hnbad 2 hours agorootparentDoxxing refers to private individuals not companies and organizations.In Germany for example every commercial website (which is defined very broadly and applies to most websites) is by law required to have an imprint listing the person&#x2F;org responsible for the website and how to contact them (an e-mail address is not good enoguh). This means you can go to any German business website and get the full address, EU VAT ID and registration number of that company.Under the GDPR more broadly (which also affects foreign companies offering services to EU residents) every company is required by law to have a privacy policy and that policy must include whom to contact for concerns and requests regarding personal data of the user&#x2F;visitor and who (which legal entity) processes and stores the data.This is the opposite of doxxing. It protects private individuals by making transparent to them who they are interfacing with and who holds their data.

When the rulings do come, they’re going to be complex (not that copyright law isn’t already complex). As prompting and working with AIs slowly becomes its own art and skill, it will become clear that works need protection. We’ve had “intelligent” filters and tools in Photoshop for decades, this is just the next step in that evolution.The only real problem here is that the original creators of the art that these AIs were trained on didn’t consent to this type of use and aren’t getting any kind of attribution or payment.

The case doesn&#x27;t examine an argument that things can be copyrighted when a human is involved either by filtering the output or even just by developing the algorithm involved and thus the human is the artist and the AI is just a tool. I think what&#x27;s clear is that legally AI can&#x27;t itself create a copy righted work just like a camera can&#x27;t be listed as the author of a work, but it&#x27;s not clear if a human using AI as a tool either through prompting or filtering counts as a creative act under copyright or if AI generated creations count as derivative works of the models weights. reply EMIRELADERO 18 hours agorootparentprev> Additionally, even if there&#x27;s no copyright, the terms of service may still apply separately (see OpenAI disallowing training a competitor model on output from OpenAI models)Aren&#x27;t contract clauses that relate to the distribution of material preempted by the copyright act? reply tzs 16 hours agorootparentNo. However contract clauses only apply to people who are actually parties to the contract.For example you and I could enter into a contract for me to use AI to generate something that is not copyrightable from data you provide and give you a copy of that thing. There would in general be no legal problem if the contract included restrictions on what you could do with that thing, including restrictions on distributing it.Part of the quid pro quo of a contract can be one party giving up a right to do something that they would normally have a right to do.Now suppose the contract did allow you to make and distribute copies as part of your product. Someone else starts making copies of those copies you distributed and distributing those copies.There is no contract between me and that person, so I would not be able to stop them.

It&#x27;s possible for there to be interactions in some cases, but the Copyright Act wouldn&#x27;t generally preempt contract terms. (Its closer to the other way around, in that—to the extent copyright rights exist that could otherwise be enforced—a relevant contract will generally limit enforcement and recover to breach of contract rather than bare copyright action.) reply basch 18 hours agorootparentprevA copyright is a government granted monopoly.

I really appreciate it. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ interviewing.io Open menu How to sabotage your salary negotiation efforts before you even start By Aline LernerPublished: August 23, 2023 Note: If you’d like a practical primer on negotiation, read my previous post on negotiation first — it tells you exactly what to say in a bunch of situations. This post is longer and more academic, but of course I include some practical tips and teach you what to say in a few situations, as well. At interviewing.io, we’ve coached hundreds of people through salary negotiation. We’re good at it — our average user gets $50k more in cash, and we have a 94% success rate. Having done this a lot, we’ve seen our users make the same two mistakes, over and over, BEFORE they start working with us. These mistakes are costly and make it harder for us to do our jobs. Our advice is applicable to everyone, but I wrote this post primarily to share with interviewing.io’s user base, so that future clients of our negotiation service don’t shoot themselves in the foot. These are the two things you must avoid. Both involve how you talk to recruiters at the start of your job search, way before there’s an offer: Revealing information too early in the game Negotiating before you’re ready In this post, I’ll explain why these two mistakes routinely sabotage salary negotiation efforts and what to say to recruiters instead. In a nutshell, if you can just be in “passive information gathering” mode (more on that later) for most of your recruiter interactions, you’ll be golden. It’s hard to not to share info about your job search with your recruiter, especially as you build more rapport with them, but we’ll tell you exactly what to say instead. Before we get into all of that, I want to go over two foundational things about negotiation. Recruiters are not your friend, and they don't work for you. What negotiation is and what it’s not Recruiters are not your friend, and they don’t work for you “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.” -Upton Sinclair I used to be a recruiter. I ran my own agency, and I also worked in-house before starting interviewing.io. That means that I’ve had to struggle with the tangled incentive structure that comes with being a recruiter (see the section called “You should write down your principles”). There’s always a tension — recruiters are, by and large, good human beings who genuinely want to help their candidates, but they also have an employer they’re beholden to, as well as a comp/bonus structure that rewards certain behaviors, some of which run counter to candidates’ best interests. There’s some distinction between in-house recruiters and third-party recruiters (recruiters who work for an agency that does placement, rather than a specific company that’s hiring engineers). Third party recruiters My general policy with third-party recruiters is to not tell them ANYTHING and to always deal directly with the companies they introduce you, once you establish a point of contact there. You should assume that anything you tell your recruiter is going to get back to every company you’re working with. Why? Because their primary objective is to place your butt in the seat of one of the companies they’re working with, and they will do whatever they need to do to make the deal happen. Often, those things will run counter to your interests. A big misconception that many candidates labor under is the idea that because third-party recruiters get paid every time they make a placement, their interests are fundamentally aligned. At a high level, this is kind of true, but once you dig into the details you'll see a lot of nuance. A recruiter, depending on market conditions, gets anywhere from 8%-25% of the candidate’s base salary when they make a placement. In the current climate, it’s around 10%. However, that cut is going to the recruiting agency as a whole rather than to the individual recruiter — you will almost always end up working with large agencies rather than a sole-proprietor shop where the owner gets to take all of it home. Let's say that you get an offer with a base salary of $150,000. You talk to your third-party recruiter and tell them that you would like more money. The recruiter may go to the hiring manager and try to advocate for you, but they're not going to push very hard because the incremental difference in their cut is going to be pretty small and to them the thing that matters most is getting butts in seats. After all, they're evaluated on the number of hires they make, first and foremost, independent of comp. Understanding that, let's do the math anyway. Say that they’re able to risk closing the deal and get you $165k. Before, the agency would have gotten paid $15k. Now the agency gets paid $16.5k. That incremental $1.5k isn’t worth risking a deal over (even a few thousand dollars would not justify jeopardizing the deal). On top of that, the individual recruiter is only going to maybe get a few hundred dollars total from that increase. So for them the difference really isn’t worth it. Third party recruiters are incentivized to get the deal done, not to risk the deal by negotiating hard for you. Moreover, because they’re incentivized to get the deal done, you should assume that your recruiter will share anything you share with them with the company or companies they’ve introduced you to. If you tell them that a company is your first choice and that you’re tempted to accept, they will likely share that with the company and may even recommend that they not raise your comp, since you’re already so enthusiastic. If you share that you’re not very interested in a company, and the recruiter has other candidates they’re presenting, they will prioritize those candidates’ experience over yours and will possibly tell the company not to invest in you as hard. In-house recruiters What about in-house recruiters? In-house recruiters may or may not get a bonus for hires that happen on their watch; it depends on the company. But if they do, that bonus is generally NOT tied to your compensation, and in some cases, they may get a bigger bonus if they’re able to negotiate you down. At big companies, in particular, in-house recruiters follow a playbook. They’re trained to make offers within specific bands, and they’re trained to mobilize such that they don’t lose candidates to other big companies — if you wave a Facebook counteroffer in front of Google, they will act. If you tell them you’re interviewing at a startup, they will not, because they know that startups don’t pay as much. They’re actually evaluated on how well they follow the playbook. Because of that, there is no reason to assume that their incentives align with yours. They’re incentivized, first and foremost, to follow the rules their head of department sets for them. This is true for how they evaluate candidates, who they let through, and how they read resumes. And it’s definitely true for how they negotiate. If you’re interested in peeking behind the curtain on how recruiters think, I interviewed three of the best ones in the industry recently. You can watch that below: I’ll close this section the way I began it. Recruiters want to help, and many are rooting for their candidates. But they’re also operating inside a box, and that box isn’t set up to put your interests first. What negotiation is and what it’s not Probably because of bad books and airplane magazine ads (for those of you old enough to remember those), people often think that negotiation is all about saying the right thing, or how firm your handshake is, or any other amount of silly nonsense. The reality is that negotiation is all about preparation and leverage. Preparation and leverage means doing the work to make sure that you have multiple offers, that all your offers come in at the same time, and that you don’t tip your hand too early. Laying this foundation is 80% of the work. You’ll need to slow some companies down, speed some companies up, and hold off questions from recruiters until you’re ready to negotiate, and not before. If you do this right, the actual negotiation part will be easy and almost a foregone conclusion. Is it possible to negotiate when you don’t have multiple offers and when you haven’t done the foundational work? Sure, it is, and we’ve sometimes had success with our users doing that. But it’s much harder, and the ceiling on how much more money you can get is lower. With all that out the way, let’s talk about how the two biggest mistakes people make and how to not make them! Mistake #1: Revealing information before you’re ready to negotiate You’ve probably never been arrested, but if you’re like me, you’ve watched a lot of police procedurals on TV. You know the bit where they read the suspect their Miranda rights? They start like this: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law… Talking to recruiters is exactly the same, and one of the biggest mistakes we see our users make is sharing information too early. This is generally the only mistake we can’t walk back — once you share information, you can’t undo it, and sharing information actually has no upside, only downside. When you’re ready to negotiate, you’re doing so deliberately because you already know the state of the world, and you’re choosing to reveal the parts that set you up for success. Before that, you’re just revealing stuff that can be used against you. Specifically, do not share with recruiters anything about your salary history (though it’s illegal in many states to ask this directly, there are indirect ways of asking, and many still do), your salary expectations, where else you’re interviewing, and how far along in the process you are with other companies. In short, don’t share any information about money or other interviews. The main question recruiters ask up front about money is: “What are your compensation expectations?” They claim that it’s because they want to make sure that you’re not so far off in your expectations that interviewing with that company would be a waste of time. This is a nonsense reason — very few companies pay so much below market that it would be a nonstarter. Those companies know who they are, and they know to give you a heads up that they pay below market. Moreover, with the recent advent of companies sharing salary bands, you’ll have some idea if they're grossly below market before you interview. The real reason recruiters ask about compensation expectations is so that they can use it against you later in negotiations. As such, if you answer this question with a number, you set an artificial ceiling on your offer. Do not even utter a single number to a recruiter until you’re ready to bargain. Do not go on levels.fyi and comment on the ranges listed for your level, even if you’re currently underpaid and an average offer from them would be life changing. Do not say a number first — ever. You can see exactly what to say when you get asked about compensation expectations in the section called “How to handle recruiter calls” below. The most obvious way to lose leverage is revealing information about money. The other way to lose leverage is by sharing information about where else you’re interviewing. If you share this information, you risk prematurely scaring off smaller companies because they don’t think they can win in a bidding war with FAANG. You also risk cornering yourself into a situation where the company knows your options are limited, and they might be inclined to lowball you as a result. Finally, you risk getting an exploding offer to try to force you to make a decision before you’re ready. Below are some examples that I hope will drive these points home. Example #1: You’re interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups Let’s say that you’re currently interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups (let’s call them A and B). You’re at the onsite stage with Google, you’re doing technical phone screens at both startups, and you’re just doing your first recruiter call with Meta. This is actually a very strong position to be in! Of course, your Meta recruiter asks you about your comp expectations and where else you’re interviewing. If you reveal your comp expectations, it will be hard to walk them back: Let’s say that you currently work at a startup and make $150k in cash with some amount of equity. You go to levels.fyi or a similar site and look up Facebook’s salary bands for the role you’re targeting. Let’s say those bands for total comp are $250k-$350k. Hell, that’s way more cash than you’re making now, so you decide to share that range, thinking that if those are their bands already, it does no harm. That’s reasonable, except that let’s say Google ends up making you an offer, and it’s $400k (we’ve seen this scenario happen to a bunch of our users). Now you have to walk back what you said, in which case your recruiter will invariably ask why. And now you have to reveal, before you’re ready, that you have a Google offer, which means you’ll probably end up revealing that it’s for $400k. Now you’ve set an artificial ceiling for your Facebook counteroffer to be $400k as well, when in reality that ceiling may have been closer to $450k or even $500k. If you reveal that you’re at the onsite stage with Google and talking to some startups, here's what will happen: Your recruiter will do the math and start asking you in a few weeks if you got to team matching. Now Meta knows that Google is the only possible offer on the table that they should be worried about. They (and other big companies) don’t take startup offers nearly as seriously because equity is monopoly money 'til it’s not… and even if you don’t reveal the cash portion of your comp, they’ll assume it’s smaller than what they’re offering. If you didn’t pass the onsite, it’s going to be hard to not share that when you’re persistently asked about it, unless you lie (which I absolutely do not condone). Now you’ve lost leverage because Meta knows that you cannot possibly have any other big tech company offers. If you DO perform well in your Google onsite, that’s great, but team matching can take a while (yes, I know Google is changing their process such that you’re now interviewing for a specific team at the outset, but the broader point still stands). So now if Meta is about to make you an offer, they can set an artificially fast expiration date to run out the clock. Though you started in a strong position with multiple interviews, including at companies that are known to pay well, you’ve now weakened that position by sharing details. Here’s another thing that could happen in this scenario. Let’s say that it’s the same set of companies as above, but this time you’re talking to the recruiter from startup A. The recruiter asks you where else you’re interviewing. If you mention that you’re interviewing at both Google and Meta, they might get spooked. I’ve seen this happen a bunch. Dropping FAANG names can be a good power move, or it can shoot you in the foot, and which it’ll be really depends on the situation. Many small startups view FAANG candidates as risky because they know they can’t compete on comp and are worried that you’re going to walk the moment that you get a FAANG offer. This may or may not be true (not everyone is motivated just by comp!), but it’s not to your advantage to reveal it. YOU should be in control of if and when we play the FAANG card. Example #2: You’re interviewing at one company and are also up for a promotion Here’s a different example. Let’s say that you work at a startup, and you’re up for a promotion soon. You figured it’d make sense to see what’s out there as well, so you’ve started interviewing with another startup. Your recruiter asks you in your first call about where else you’re interviewing and what your comp expectations are. You may be tempted to mention that you’re up for a promotion because that feels like it’ll give you leverage — if you get a promotion, the startup will have to work harder to entice you to leave, after all. Not so fast! If you mention that you’re up for a promotion: Your recruiter will start checking in consistently on whether you got it. Promotions always take longer than you think, and the increase in your comp may not be what you expect. At some point, if you haven’t gotten it yet, the recruiter will assume it’s not coming, and then you actually lose leverage because they know that you’re going to be more likely to walk. If you mention that you’re not interviewing anywhere else, that’s just a giveaway that you have no leverage: Promotion or not, many of our users assume that they have leverage because, “I don’t have to leave my job, so my current job is leverage.” That’s not true, though — even in this climate, and definitely in a hiring boom, an engineer having another job is table stakes. Almost every candidate you’re competing with will be currently employed. So even if having a job gives you a little bit of leverage, it gets canceled out when everyone has the same exact thing. The details may differ in your case, but the fundamental mechanics are the same. When you reveal information before you know what hand you’ve been dealt, it can only hurt you. I’m struggling to think of a scenario where revealing something has been beneficial. I suppose the one exception to revealing information is this: Sometimes it can be useful to give your recruiter a rough estimate for when you’ll be collecting offers, e.g., “I’ve just started interviewing. I expect to get through all my interviews and onsites in the next 6 weeks and start collecting offers 2 months from now. Does that timeline work for you?” This technique can be helpful for aligning expectations up front and then keeping recruiters off your back, as they won’t need to chronically text you to make sure you haven’t taken another offer yet (we’ll talk more about texting with recruiters in the next section). But note that even in this example, we’re not actually revealing any information about where you’re interviewing, how long it’s taking, or compensation. You’re just setting a timeline based on hypotheticals without giving out any details that can be used against you later. When you share the actual timeline you’re working with, you no longer control the timing of your job search, and a huge part of negotiation is controlling timing so you can make all your offers come in at the same time. Mistake #2: Premature negotiation “Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes!” -Unknown officer at the Battle of Bunker Hill Just like not revealing information too early, you also want to avoid negotiating too early. They’re two sides of the same coin. Think of it like a hand of cards. At the beginning, you have no idea what you’re going to draw. The longer you wait to negotiate, assuming you’ve timed things correctly, the more information you have. Then, when you’re ready to negotiate, you can look at your hand and selectively share information that puts you in the strongest position. For instance, if you have a high base salary from one company, a great equity package from a public company, and a signing bonus from a third company, you can strategically share those portions of the offers without sharing the weaker parts. Each negotiation is different, and it’s hard to give catch-all advice, but that’s generally the situation you should set yourself up to be in. With that in mind, I’m a firm believer in negotiating when you’re ready and not before. Until you know what else is on the table, it’s really hard to 1) have the bravado that comes with actually having multiple offers (this is possible to fake, but trust me, it’s hard) and 2) negotiate effectively — you will never know as well as your recruiter what salary bands are like, what market comp is, and so on. They do this all day. This may be your first or fifth time doing it, but there’s massive experience and information asymmetry. There are two ways to combat this power imbalance: have as many of your interactions be asynchronous as possible (we discussed that earlier) and do everything you can to negotiate when you’re at the point of maximum information, and not before. Daniel Biales, one of our former negotiation clients, explained the latter really well. When I received a low offer, my first inclination was to start the negotiating process. Aline helped me to realize that this was not the best course of action. The problem with this approach is that I wanted to start negotiating before receiving my highest offer. If I negotiated an increase then, I would have had to renegotiate when I received the higher offer. This will cause negotiating fatigue for you and the company. They will be less likely to negotiate a second time because they don’t know how many times you will ask them for more. First, focus on strategies to draw out your decision. Then, when you have all your offers, start negotiating. There may be a couple of back and forth communications, but they will be over a short time span rather than drawn out. Example #1 revisited: You're interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups Let’s review our first example again. Imagine that you’re interviewing at Google, Meta, and two startups, A and B, just like before. Startup A makes you an offer: $160k base, 0.1% of the company in options over four years, no signing bonus. You react to it and say that you were hoping for a signing bonus. The recruiter comes back with a $10k signing bonus quickly and pressures you to make a decision, saying that they have other candidates waiting. By starting to negotiate, you accelerated their timeline, and this is going to make it hard to go back and ask for more signing bonus. You try to stall, and then a few days later, Google makes you an offer that includes a $25k signing bonus. You’re still excited about the startup for reasons other than compensation, but now you have to go back to them and say that you actually got a $25k signing bonus at Google. They are unlikely to move again. So, don’t negotiate until you’re ready. It’s hard to walk things back. That doesn’t mean it’s not possible to negotiate in stages and gradually start bringing up all your offers. In my experience, however, this is a much more difficult maneuver, takes way more experience, is much more stressful for the candidate, and often ends up with the same results as laying a solid foundation and just negotiating once at the end. So what do you say when you get asked pointed questions by your recruiter about your comp expectations or where you’re interviewing? And how do you delay negotiation until you’re ready? How to handle recruiter calls: “passive information gathering” mode and exactly what to say Until you’re ready to negotiate, your default mode should be “passive information gathering.” This means that you listen rather than talk. I coach all of our negotiation clients to be in this mode when they get on a call with a recruiter. Be polite and gracious to a fault. If it’s an offer call, thank them for the work they did to put your offer together and for advocating for you. If it’s earlier in the process, thank them for their help so far. Express genuine enthusiasm. If it’s an early call, express excitement about the company or the interview process if there’s something idiosyncratically cool about it. If it’s an offer call, express excitement for the team, the projects, the hiring manager, whatever it is. And be genuine. Every offer will have something exciting about it. If the recruiter is making an offer, do not react to what you’re being told beyond expressing enthusiasm. Say that you need some time to process and/or talk to your {family, partner, spouse}. Why should you not react? Because recruiters do this a lot, and you don’t. Negotiating on the phone on the fly is really hard. You’re going to need time to think, and you need a way to level the playing field. Email is the great leveler in these interactions because it’s asynchronous, and it gives you time to think and plan. No one is realistically expecting you to react to major life decisions on the fly! Use email (not phone when possible and DEFINITELY not texts) to interact with recruiters. You will have to get on the phone eventually, of course, but you never have to text – if they text you, just wait a few hours to respond, and then respond over email (you can always say that you don’t have notifications enabled during work hours). The casual nature of texting lulls you into a false sense of security. Moreover, the fact that texts interrupt you from something else puts you at a disadvantage — when you get interrupted, your instinct is to quickly respond to make the interruption go away. But knee-jerk responses are rarely the right ones, and you’ll find yourself giving away information you shouldn’t have. If a recruiter asks you pointed questions about comp expectations or where else you’re interviewing, refer to the section called “Exactly what to say” right below! Exactly what to say In all the snippets below, you’ll notice that they end with the same sentence: I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. This is deliberate, and it’s there because it’s disarming. Fundamentally, recruiters ask you all of these questions because they don’t want to lose out on you and have you go to another company. If you can speak to that worry head-on, there’s not much they can say back. For questions about comp expectations at the beginning of the process: At this point, I don’t feel equipped to throw out a number because I’d like to find out more about the opportunity first – right now, I simply don’t have the data to be able to say something concrete. If you end up making me an offer, I would be more than happy to iterate on it if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. For questions about comp expectations at the end of the process: It sounds like there’s an offer coming, and I’m really excited about it. I’m not sure exactly what number I’m looking for, but if you’d be able to share what an offer package might look like, then I will gladly iterate on it with you if needed and figure out something that works. I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the beginning of the process: I’m currently speaking with a few other companies and am at various stages with them. I’ll let you know if I get to the point where I have an exploding offer, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. For questions about where else you’re interviewing at the end of the process: I’m wrapping things up with a few companies and in process with a few more. I promise to keep you in the loop, and I promise not to accept other offers until I have a chance to discuss them with you. Conclusion I said it in the beginning, and I’ll say it again. Negotiation isn’t about saying the right thing. It’s about laying a foundation: not revealing anything until you’re ready to negotiate, not negotiating too early, and making sure that you’ve set yourself up to have multiple offers. Then, once those offers come in, you swoop in with sharp precision, negotiate once (possibly with just your top choice company), and be done with it. If you’ve set yourself up for success, done the foundational work, and haven’t made the mistakes in this post, the negotiation will feel like a foregone conclusion.

And that is - always be ready to walk out. This mostly means able, not just willing. Never put yourself in a position where you are cornered and have no way out. This is where \"fuck you money\" comes in, usually. If you know you will have food on the table, roof above your head and a bed to sleep in, your perspective will be quite different than a person that is one blown up tyre away from getting evicted.And secondly, when it comes to jobs, always look for a job while employed. And not just that, you can use that to renegotiate your salary and benefits with your current employer because hiring new person would also mean mentoring them in the company culture and know-how and things like that, that you already know. So it is a cost to them that might be, and usually is, much higher than increasing your salary.And a tip for the road, make sure your pay increases every year, either with inflation or based on agreed upon percentage(like 5% a year, for example). Inflation is universal and companies increase their prices accordingly, yet workers never require increase of their salaries, usually until years later. reply killjoywashere 3 hours agoparentHe who cares the least controls the situation. reply toasted-subs 2 hours agorootparentSimilarly, not hitting a gift horse in the mouth is a good idea. reply wholinator2 48 minutes agorootparentI thought it was looking a gift horse in the mouth. Something about gum health being indicative of the age or health of the horse, and it being disrespectful to critically examine a gift in front of the giver. reply tasuki 1 hour agoparentprev> when it comes to jobs, always look for a job while employedI have never done this. Sure, I might have missed out on summer cash, but I enjoyed the breaks between the jobs immensely. reply SOLAR_FIELDS 1 hour agorootparentI don’t think it’s a requirement. A well timed interview loop and having 6+ offers on the table where you pit them all against each other does wonders for your negotiating position as well reply hardware2win 3 minutes agoprev>The main question recruiters ask up front about money is: “What are your compensation expectations?” They claim that it’s because they want to make sure that you’re not so far off in your expectations that interviewing with that company would be a waste of time. This is a nonsense reason — very few companies pay so much below market that it would be a nonstarter.Of course there are, lol.e.g \"software houses\" in Poland reply xyzelement 14 hours agoprevI used to work in trading and I think some of the principles I learned there apply directly to salary negotiations.Two key things I think about all the time are price discovery and competition. Price discovery means that in some illiquid markets, you don&#x27;t really know what a thing will trade at unless you try to trade it (which itself reveals some information to the counterparty but that&#x27;s not important in the job case)From that point of view, I am always surprised to hear people who hate interviewing, are reluctant to interview, etc. Interviewing is the only real way to learn \"the market\" - what offers to you would actually look like, and other information as well. Like if you always get offers at the low end of a range - or if you always fail interviews - is very good signal that you can act on.Competition - when we traded bonds, we&#x27;d always go to multiple dealers for quotes. The dealers would know that we always ask at least X of their competitors by rule, so they knew that whatever number they gave us, we&#x27;d compare against others. That prompted them to strike the balance between a good deal for them and a price we&#x27;d actually accept. From that point of view, the best negotiating advice is to have multiple offers, because (1) you see what the highest one is (2) you can see how close or dispersed they are and you can infer something from that (3) they give you leverage. EG: let&#x27;s say you want job X most, but job Y gave you $20K more on the offer or whatever. You can always tell job X \"I&#x27;d love to work with you but it&#x27;s hard to accept a lower offer, can you match?\" This isn&#x27;t even a game, you&#x27;d be saying this sincerely. Or, if your offers are close, you can push the highest one a bit because you know they aren&#x27;t so far out of the norm with more confidence. reply atomicnumber3 10 hours agoparent\"the best negotiating advice is to have multiple offers\"This is borderline \"get in the job cannon and blast off to jobland\" territory.Also - it can be terrifically difficult to line up multiple simultaneous offers because companies would rather explode their offer than generally let people get a better leverage. I know multiple companies who do this on purpose for this explicit reason. Is it inefficient from a market perspective? Of course. But since when has that ever stopped the owner class from oppressing the workers? reply adrianmsmith 1 hour agorootparent> it can be terrifically difficult to line up multiple simultaneous offersI&#x27;ve found that too. It seems like even if you apply at the same time, companies move at a variety of speeds. But there are things you can do to help align the offers temporally, at least a bit.- At the start of each process, ask how long the process will take (how many interviews, number of weeks from start to offer). They&#x27;ll generally tell you. If you do this for every company, you have an idea of which companies are fast and which companies are slow.- The fast companies can be slowed down, a least a bit. It&#x27;s Thursday and they want to schedule an interview for Monday? Say \"Unfortunately I&#x27;m not available Monday to Wednesday next week, would Thursday next week work for you?\" Answer emails the next day, or if they sent you one in the morning answer in the evening \"after work\".- The slow companies can be sped up a bit. Firstly, ask for interviews sooner, they might go for it, who knows. If you get an offer from one company, send an email to all the other companies that you have an offer but you&#x27;d like to get their offer as well, that might speed them up.None of this is guaranteed to work but it&#x27;s worth trying. reply sammorrowdrums 4 hours agorootparentprevNever accept an exploding offer. If they won’t give you more time, then let them see you’re prepared to let it lapse. It’s a ploy to create urgency when there is none, as is never in your interest as a candidate. I’d be very surprised if a single offer actually expired, it’s expensive to lose qualified candidates for the hiring company. reply __oh_es 3 hours agorootparentUrgency isn’t a always just a ploy.My background is consulting and earlier-stage startups in the UK which may mean we’re in a different environment to what you’re used to, but the teams are often lean, and sometimes strained by the time we’re out to hire.Sourcing and screening often starts a few weeks&#x2F;months before but generally we move quite quickly through technical to offer stages - I think its healthy and fair for both parties to keep expect these final stages around 1-2 weeks.Interviewing takes quite a bit of time and energy from the tech team and can impact team health, delivery, and ultimately bottom line - where our salaries come from.If we’re in the fortunate position to have a final candidate (or two - three), theres going to be an exploding offer because we need to get back to work, and we need to let other candidates know to move on.As a candidate its very fair to line up your interviews with a few companies and tell them you would like to make a decision by a particular date. If they cant accommodate you or extend an offer with a deadline prior to that, its on them. In my last job hunt no company turned down this request and two adjusted their processes to accommodate it. reply doix 2 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s interesting you mention UK and urgency in the same sentence. In my experience, nothing in the UK happens quickly when it comes to permanent employees (I guess contractors are different). Everyone has 2-3 months of notice period, plus people usually take a month off between switching jobs to relax. So there&#x27;s usually 3-4 months between when everyone agrees and when they eventually join.The only time things happen quickly is when someone is jobless, or if they already handed in their notice, they were going to join company X and you manage to snipe them in that 3-4 month period before they&#x27;ve started at company X. reply vidarh 4 hours agorootparentprevI agree it can be hard to line up multiple at the same time, but unless you&#x27;re in a desperate situation you can get much the same effect by being prepared to walk. I&#x27;ve talked offers up by being entirely opened that I walked away from an offer of $X, because it was a clear signal to the place I was interviewing at that I was confident I could land more, and I was confident I could because that first offer helped confirm I understood the right salary levels.It&#x27;s not quite as powerful as having a simultaneous offer, but the point is not whether or not you go to a specific other company, but whether or not they believe a) you&#x27;ll actually turn them down, b) you&#x27;re worth roughly what you demand. Another offer, even if turned down will help in both respects. reply klipt 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s generally easy to line up the interviews, at least at big companies you can pretty much pick your interview date.Then if you&#x27;ve done say 5 interviews (1 per day for a week), you can just wait for the first offer and use that as leverage to get the others to hurry up. Since they already have all the data they need. reply el_benhameen 9 hours agorootparentI haven’t pursued it seriously so I don’t know how much you can hurry things along, but most of the interview processes I’ve seen are weeks long. Google even warns you up front that it’ll probably take on the order of months. So it’s kind of tricky to get them to all line up like that. reply jacksnipe 8 hours agorootparentIt all depends. I have done first phone call -> offer in 2 weeks at FAANG. reply dharmab 4 hours agorootparentOr at the tier below FAANG- I did one afternoon of interviews at Adobe and got an offer a few days later. reply xyzelement 9 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s still valuable info. Like let&#x27;s say you actually made it thorough all the rounds at Google per your example, and are &#x27;stuck&#x27; in hiring committee. That&#x27;s a huge signal to you that you are in striking distance of the level you interviewed for, even if you don&#x27;t ultimately make it this time.That means you can for example use levels.fyi number for that level at Google as &#x27;something that applies to me&#x27; reply ryan_lane 9 hours agorootparentprevIf a company gives you an exploding offer, it&#x27;s a strong signal that the culture of that company isn&#x27;t good, or that they can&#x27;t afford to hire quality candidates (or both). In companies like this you can assume you&#x27;ll probably also get poor raises.In practice, if you get an exploding offer, unless you already think it&#x27;s an extraordinary offer and love the potential opportunity, you can tell them that you won&#x27;t be able to make a decision within that time. If the company is worth working for, they&#x27;ll remove it. If they won&#x27;t remove it, it&#x27;s probably best not to take the offer. reply gambiting 2 hours agorootparent>>If a company gives you an exploding offer, it&#x27;s a strong signal that the culture of that company isn&#x27;t good, or that they can&#x27;t afford to hire quality candidates (or both).I work in games - what happens for us quite often is that we&#x27;ll interview ~10 candidates and 2-3 are actually good enough to hire. So the process is to give the top candidate the offer with a few days to accept it, if they don&#x27;t then we move on to the next candidate because they also want to know whether we are proceeding or not - otherwise it&#x27;s just rude(to the candidate). How does that indicate poor culture? reply chadash 7 hours agorootparentprevThis is highly dependent on the role. I have been tasked with growing teams where my mandate is to hire X number of engineers at various levels. If I found X hires and then hire X + 1 shows up and was a great fit, the company would make an exception. No exploding offers necessary.On the other hand, sometimes you are hiring to fill a specific position rather than to generally grow a team. You have two candidates you like and you can&#x27;t afford to let candidate 1 sit on the offer for three weeks. People treat it like it&#x27;s nefarious on the part of the company to ever have an exploding offer, but sometimes it&#x27;s just not practical. reply WalterBright 5 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s hard to see how making $400k offers is exploiting the worker, rather than the worker exploiting the company. reply csaha 5 hours agorootparentThe first time I applied to work for a high frequency trading group in a hedge fund, my boss asked me what my desired comp would be? I replied 400k, to which he immediately responded saying that&#x27;s extremely reasonable... So clearly, I f*** myself over in the negotiation.No company in our capitalist society pays any worker at any level. What the worker thinks they are worth- they pay the worker the absolute bare minimum that they think they can get away with. Doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s an entry level job, or ( like mine) a high end algo trading outfit etc reply intelVISA 1 hour agorootparentDepending on skill and experience that salary request&#x27;s an incredible feat of self-sabotage. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprevThat is the same principle in any market, not just the labor market. It is based on the laws of supply and demand, not what the product&#x27;s \"worth\" is (how would you even know that at a large scale without price discovery?). reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprevThey&#x27;re talking about exploitation in the Marxist sense, that excess profit belongs to the workers. Of course, I don&#x27;t believe in the Labor Theory of Value, as supply and demand is a much more useful model of the world, but that&#x27;s what they mean by exploitation, not what it&#x27;s seen as colloquially. reply toasted-subs 2 hours agorootparentDepends, most companies paying that kind of money expects the employee to bring in enough money for additional hires. reply epups 5 hours agorootparentprevExploitation is not about whether each party is making a lot of money, it is whether one party makes a disproportionate amount of money over the value the other party produces. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentNo, they are talking about the Marxist theory of exploitation, where excess profits belong to the workers. It is however not a very useful model in the real world when market principles like supply and demand have much more predictive power. reply systemvoltage 4 hours agorootparentprevI think the word \"exploitation\" colloquially has the connotation of exploiting the poor as they cannot afford to leave the exploiting conditions.Exploitation is labor is never usually headlined in the context of $400k&#x2F;year salary. Technically, you&#x27;re right. But we can take this to the limit, instead of $400k, let&#x27;s say $4M&#x2F;year for a job that&#x27;s worth $5M&#x2F;year? Are they \"exploited\". Yes, but not by the common use of the term.Perhaps the reason for GP&#x27;s take was that it robs away the colloquial definition of exploiration in an entirely different context where it&#x27;s the least meaningful, i.e. exploitation of Bangladeshi child laborers vs. a programmer earning $400k year salary. reply JohnFen 13 hours agoparentprev> From that point of view, I am always surprised to hear people who hate interviewing, are reluctant to interview, etc. Interviewing is the only real way to learn \"the market\"Interviewing may be the best way to gather market information, but does that make it surprising that people hate doing it?There are very few activities I hate more than taking part in a job interview (on either side of the desk). That it&#x27;s useful and necessary doesn&#x27;t make it any less unpleasant. reply ABCLAW 11 hours agorootparent>but does that make it surprising that people hate doing it?When an activity validates you, it&#x27;s tough to imagine other people having the opposite experience with it. Imagine every time you went to a round of interviews you were offered riches and status. It would be tough to understand why others just didn&#x27;t muster up the gumption to go downtown and get what they&#x27;re worth. reply xyzelement 10 hours agorootparentI am the person y&#x27;all replying to. This is a good prompt for my mental model on interviewing.I assume that the answer in any interview process I go into will be \"no\" 90%+ of the time. That&#x27;s not some defeated pessimism, it&#x27;s just reality that the process is hairy (how many people do you go on dates with before you get married?) and every single instance can fail for reasons that have to do with you (how you did that day, fit for the role) or not (hired internally, headcount went away, etc.)While obviously it&#x27;s frustrating to fail a round &#x2F; not get an offer, there&#x27;s less sting to it when you manage your expectations as above, and then add to it that the frequency of at-bats + the learning process can lead to a better outcome despite - and in fact - because of - the rejections.So yes, there&#x27;s a big mental&#x2F;attitude component that helps you engage with this productively and see the process as something you&#x27;re doing for yourself - and thus even the fails are part of the plan - versus stepping into some sort of meat grinder.And to be fair to your comment about \"offered riches and status\" - I would not put it that way and the 90%+ fail rate is very real. That said, I definitely feel positive about work and have been lucky with opportunities and there&#x27;s no question that extensive experience interviewing - and learning from the fails - has been key to that. reply ABCLAW 3 hours agorootparentI think most people recognize that you don&#x27;t get every job you apply for, but there are people who contact hundreds to thousands of organizations, apply with custom crafted letters and tailored resumes, put in thousands of hours of job searching time over months of time and get jobs well under the median of their cohort.The assumption that other people&#x27;s experiences are like yours is a key cognitive bias. A 90% fail rate means 10 offers after a hundred applications - that&#x27;s an incredibly solid success rate. Now imagine some people have orders of magnitude more difficulty because their name is strange, or because their social class shows through in their dress or mannerisms.If I can offer a comparison, most people on this forum have it made. It&#x27;s like asking a group of models how difficult online dating is and having someone say \"I can&#x27;t fathom anyone having trouble keeping their weekends full of new people to date... It&#x27;s just so easy!\"Also, I note that you seem to assume I&#x27;m talking about my own experiences; I&#x27;m not. I am a very well established professional in a lucrative field. reply xyzelement 12 hours agorootparentprevI can agree w that but with a caveat. There are lots of activities that fit that description (eg public speaking, exercise) that are good for you but many people hate. But there&#x27;s also room to learn to enjoy and have fun with it. Maybe not available to everyone. reply j1elo 13 hours agoparentprev> You can always tell job X \"I&#x27;d love to work with you but it&#x27;s hard to accept a lower offer, can you match?\"It&#x27;s of course very dependant on each country and the jobs market, but in my experience the issue would be even getting to have multiple offers in a short enough period of time. To the point that it happening could be called a coincidence, more than anything. Unless you are fiercely hunting for a job (aka. doing several interviews per week), I don&#x27;t see how it would happen to get an offer and telling the company \"well, wait for a couple weeks or a month for my answer\" just to see if it happens that offers arrive from the other places and one gets to compare simultaneously.Seems more likely that an offer comes, you accept or decline it, if declined then other will eventually come some time later, and one can compare them and maybe regret having declined the former, and so on. reply cyanydeez 12 hours agorootparentThese seem like old times or a very narrow band of. High salaries.The only general purpose advice here is the price discovery. If you want to know, you need offers. reply saagarjha 11 hours agorootparentprevThe article says to not do it but I’ve had pretty good results with “I’m on a short timeline due to competing offers” to speed things up. reply xyzelement 10 hours agorootparentDitto. Almost every recruiter will ask you at the onset if you are interviewing with other places. They ask so they have a lever to speed up your process if necessary - eg \"hey hiring manager, this dude&#x27;s resume looks great and I had a good convo with him, but he&#x27;s already had one round with AWS. We better line up our side of things ASAP\"As I mentioned in another comment, I try to be forthcoming with companies especially in cases where the transparency doesn&#x27;t hurt me and helps everyone. So if the following is the case, I would say something like \"Yup, I am in a pretty active search right now, I am talking to a handful of other companies. I am definitely interested in going through the process with you as well, so if you want I will keep you abreast of how my other conversations are going throughout this process\" - I&#x27;ve found that this both creates credibility&#x2F;good vibes and the company is often able to keep pace with the process and offer timing.Elsewhere in this thread someone was asking how you can possibly get to a place where you have multiple offers around the same timeline - it&#x27;s something like this. reply distant_hat 13 hours agoparentprevThat&#x27;s a sound advice for bonds but jobs are largely not like that by design. It is kind of like dating, and asking for a price upfront makes it closer to whoredom and companies explicitly downgrade you for being in it only for the money. If you want to sell a bond and the other person&#x27;s price is too low, you don&#x27;t sell it and that&#x27;s that. For interviews, you end up spending hours through the interview process and may not even know whether you will end up getting a salary quote at the end of it. Getting multiple quotes is a great idea, but putting it in action is harder than it appears. It may help to go with someone like a recruiter who can disintermediate the process. I&#x27;ve often thought someone like an agent for software professionals could make a great idea. That person&#x27;s job is to get you great gigs and good prices and she makes a percentage of your salary so is aligned with getting you the best offers. reply GVIrish 7 hours agorootparentTypically you&#x27;re not asking for a price(salary) upfront. Ideally you&#x27;ve done a bit of homework to figure out what positions can pay in the ballpark of what you want. Then you get their offer at the end of the interview process and negotiate as appropriate.Yeah you may go through hours of interviews and not end up with an offer in some cases but think of it this way: you could potentially earn tens of thousands to over one hundred thousand extra dollar per year off that time investment in interviewing.Attempting to line up multiple interviews and balancing offer timelines is hard, but the payoff can be huge. Considering that people spend 4 years or more working in college to get into their career, making a time investment of a few weeks to get a potentially large raise is nothing. reply zoomablemind 13 hours agoparentprevInterviewing on the actual offer&#x2F;price is not the same as interviewing about getting a chance to schedule a conversation about ability to qualify for being considered for an interview with a person who could evaluate your worthiness to fill in a position within known but flexible compensation band which may not be directly offered after all...Of course, not always it is that convoluted, but the \"beef\" is often that much detached from the process. reply somsak2 11 hours agoparentprevThis stuff only works if market participants abide by the law, which we know they don&#x27;t: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_L...The other issue you run into is cost of getting to competing offers. In your example, you can just ask a dealer for a quote and they&#x27;ll give it to you, with little to no work on your part. In tech, you have to go through multiple hours of interviews to get this information.It&#x27;s no wonder that people are resistant to go interview. Especially when you can get most of this information much more easily through levels.fyi. reply hinkley 4 hours agorootparentAlso it&#x27;s not just a matter of getting several offers in a two week period. That&#x27;s somewhat doable if you are unemployed. If you&#x27;re trying to interview without your current employer freaking out, you have to space these things out. You can only have so many &#x27;appointments&#x27; in a two week period. reply xyzelement 10 hours agorootparentprevI follow your logic but I am not sure it really works.Agree levels.fyi is a great resource under the right conditions. EG, if Facebook wants to interview you as an E5 engineer, it&#x27;s great to look up the range for that.But if you are say a \"senior developer\" working outside of FAANG, what does it mean for you to know the E5 comp when you have no idea how that lines up against your profile? How would you know if FB would consider you for an E5 or even an E3 unless you interview and see how close you can get? The only other way is if you&#x27;re already in a FAANG with very comparable levels. Otherwise, what&#x27;s a \"senior engineer\" in one place may not pass the resume screen for a \"junior\" in another.I agree with you that it obviously takes multiple hours to go through an interview, I am calling out that it&#x27;s often well worth it, because: you may actually get an offer at the end, which you may take or use to negotiate with another company, and even if you constantly fail interviews there&#x27;s a very actionable signal in that too. So the return on investment for those hours - ultimately being able to get a better&#x2F;more lucrative job, seems like a good use of time. reply lelanthran 4 hours agoparentprev> I used to work in trading and I think some of the principles I learned there apply directly to salary negotiations.I think exactly zero of those principles apply (assuming you are talking about stock exchange trades).All these types of \"technical analysis\" on price-discovery during negotiations is fairly pointless.There&#x27;s only one rule that works when personally doing a trade with someone:(whether you&#x27;re negotiating salary, buying a property or selling car) be likeable!The more the other party likes you, the more flexible they are going to be on their price-points.So, sure, the hiring manager has a band (say $100k to $140k). What you want is for him to make an offer at the top of his band ... or even higher - if you interview well they may decide on a more senior role for you.This is why, even if your minimum is above his maximum, be likeable!Even if you have already decided you don&#x27;t want that job, be likeable!Even if you don&#x27;t want to work for that particular company, be likeable!Even if you already have an offer in hand that is way above anything anyone else can offer you, be likeable!What likeable means depends on context.When selling a car, being upfront and having all the paperwork up to date, and all the services done on time and recorded as such, a clearance certificate to prove \"not stolen\", etc ... makes you likeable.When negotiating a salary, gush about how nice their offices are, how their mission statement resonates with you, how wonderful the interviewers have been up to that point.[1] Make a list of things you admire about the company&#x2F;its products&#x2F;its vision ahead of time so that you can truthfully tell them all wonderful things about themselves.Practice telling people horrible things in nice ways (called constructive criticism?). Practice, Practice, Practice! They will give you stupid challenges, maybe even broken code. How you respond must make them like you even more for the role.You must come across as a collaborator and leverager, not as a coding genius. Coding geniuses are a dime a dozen. Competent coders who can act as a force multiplier for their team, their manager or their company are rare gems who get offered much more than genius coders.Everywhere I&#x27;ve been at, or done work for, for over 25 years, has been filled with people who would rather work with pleasant people who are basically competent (or even slightly below average) than work with unpleasant people, no matter how good they are technically.Look at highly paid surgeons: the ones making the most money are the ones filling every single one of their slots. They know - bedside manners matter.[1] I spent a full day interview for a senior-ish (L5? L6? Dunno now) position at AWS. It was hard work, with challenges coming at me the whole day, coding, design, etc ... and yet I thanked every single interviewer for their time, and told them how much I appreciate them making the effort to interview me.

I&#x27;m not seeing why these are good signals to act on. reply xyzelement 9 hours agorootparentThe signal varies and I think you need to calmly reflect on the data points which is hard. But I can imagine a few scenarios:Let&#x27;s say you recognize that you \"underperform\" versus your capability because you get insanely nervous. At some point you have to realize that your ability to grow depends on your ability to get your nerves under control. How you do that is the next question but that could be one observation.You can seek patterns of what kind of interviews you tend to fail out on. Eg, is it coding, algorithmic, problem solving, behavioral, whatever. Once you have that zeroed in, you can ask yourself (and the internet): how can I get better at X type of interview.More generally, you can seek for patterns of what kinds of questions surprised you and you had to make shit up on the spot, but could have been better prepped? EG if you go \"hmm let&#x27;s see\" if you are asked about the coolest thing you&#x27;ve worked on or whatever, maybe that&#x27;s the kind of topic you can pregame and have a story for.Another maybe subtler thing is reading the interviewer. What are the things you were saying&#x2F;doing where the interviewer was visibly happy&#x2F;impressed vs confused, where did they say \"that&#x27;s great, go on\" and where did they go \"hmm.. but what about..\" In the moment you may have just taken the \"what about\" as a prompt but in reality they may have seen you struggle and tried to help you - what can you do to prep for that type of questions next time?I can go on - but the conclusion is something like this - I know a bunch of people who every interview they had, they think they nailed it and then they are totally shocked to not advance. And I know people who can reflect on what went poorly and adjust for next time. I don&#x27;t know how to teach someone to recognize all the signals like this but it&#x27;s definitely there to be perceived if one looks. reply CaveTech 11 hours agorootparentprevThe signal is that you don’t present well and need to work on that. reply lylejantzi3rd 11 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s a signal you can more easily get from a practice interview.

You should assume that anything you tell your recruiter is going to get back to every company you’re working with. Why? Because their primary objective is to place your butt in the seat of one of the companies they’re working with, and they will do whatever they need to do to make the deal happen. Often, those things will run counter to your interests.While the OP has a ton of experience, I disagree with this advice unless you&#x27;re just starting out and don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re worth yet.I think it is much faster and easier to ask what you&#x27;re looking for up front.If you want $200,000, $400,000, whatever, just say so. BEFORE you start any interviews.If GOOD recruiters are talking to you, they want to place you at the highest comp package they can. If the number isn&#x27;t realistic, they&#x27;ll tell you. Last thing they want is to waste your time interviewing for a position you&#x27;ll reject because of the package.(There are plenty of recruiters that only care about placement volume and nothing else. Inbound emails from recruiters that clearly look like a copy and paste job are probably one of these. Good recruiters don&#x27;t leave money on the table like that.)I DO agree with OP that you _shouldn&#x27;t_ state what your current salary&#x2F;comp is (unless you don&#x27;t care about negotiating on comp but want to ensure you maintain what you&#x27;re making). reply lelanthran 4 hours agoparent> If GOOD recruiters are talking to you, they want to place you at the highest comp package they can.I&#x27;m pretty certain the article covered this exact point; even GOOD recruiters aren&#x27;t going to jeopardize a deal with $1500k commission for an extra $150.We see the same thing with real estate agents, or sales anywhere a commission is paid - the sales person would rather have 10% less commission from a closed deal than 0% commission from a deal that fell through.Their incentives aren&#x27;t aligned with yours: Their incentive is to close the deal, yours is to close the deal at the highest price.> Good recruiters don&#x27;t leave money on the table like that.All good sales people are closers. That means they are always leaving money on the table. It&#x27;s more important to close than to hold out for 10% more.There is no such thing as a sales person who only closes deals at the highest possible price; they&#x27;d starve. reply twic 2 hours agorootparentI read \"place you at the highest comp package they can\" to mean \"place you at the employer that will give you the highest comp package they can\". So if they think you&#x27;re good enough for clearlydoomed.io who pay 175k and GigaTech who pay 200k, but not Risk Securities who pay 300k, they will push you towards MegaTech. reply lelanthran 2 hours agorootparentIt depends. \"they can\" is doing a lot of work in the original claim.If A, B and C are the companies involved, with respective pay rates of 175k, 200k and 300k, it&#x27;s still going to be better for the recruiter to try you at all three, because that is very little extra work for the commission involved.However, if B is more circumspect about hiring and always takes a month to make a decision while always A comes back with \"go&#x2F;no-go\" in 2 days, then its better for the recruiter to take the 1.75k commission and move on to the next candidate, rather than hold out a month for a $2k commission that may not happen while the 1.75k commission is lost because A has a quick turnaround time. In order for them to do this, they have to mislead you about your chances with B, or have to completely hide the option of B from you, because they know that you, personally, would hold out a month for an extra 25k.Business and sales is all about cashflow. It&#x27;s better to conclude your business today with a profit of $1.75k rather than in a month with $2k.As far as the $3k commission goes, the recruiter is almost definitely not going to wait a month either, unless, in their experience, you&#x27;re so far and beyond the best candidate for that position that it&#x27;s a slam dunk. That is highly unlikely. reply madeofpalk 2 hours agorootparentprevThis exact thing was covered in Freakonomics years back https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=aFYlgqv3T-w reply Aurornis 13 hours agoparentprevForcing the company to name a number first works well when the person has absolutely no idea what market rate is.However, the idea that it’s the optimal strategy in every situation has been blown out of proportion online. When you force a company to name their price first, they will start with usually a number lower than their target compensation because most candidates will then want to negotiate up. Of all the salary negotiations I’ve done in the past decade, I can’t remember anyone who asked us to make a price first and then didn’t counter with a token $5K or $10K (or more depending on position) counter request. So the easy bet is to take your mid-range comp target, subtract $5K, and then most candidates will end up at your target after they “negotiate”. It’s basically a script that everyone who reads internet advice follows, and once you see it play out you can start to predict it.If you want to get the upper end of what companies are willing to pay, you often have to start by naming your price and letting them negotiate down. This is scary to people who don’t have a lot of data or who are afraid of being told “no”. It can also result in outright discontinuation of the interview process if the company doesn’t want to pay a lot, but that’s not really a big loss if your goal was high compensation anyway. reply OkayPhysicist 12 hours agorootparentDon&#x27;t forget that you have multiple axes to negotiate on: I would happily take a 25% pay cut if it came with a couple months worth of PTO. Then, when they&#x27;re unwilling to budge on the PTO, you can leverage that back into getting the salary number moving again.I find that kind of haggling to work best as a synchronous, ideally face-to-face, communication. In that setting, it&#x27;s very unlikely that you can&#x27;t manage to smooth over any too ambitious of an ask and arrive at some sort of agreeable number. reply pdonis 13 hours agoparentprev> If you want $200,000, $400,000, whatever, just say so. BEFORE you start any interviews.Unless the number you give is significantly higher than any of your potential employers are ever going to offer you, you are shortchanging yourself by giving that number--it means that you have now foreclosed potential higher offers that otherwise might have come your way. That is the basis of the advice given in the article.I get what you&#x27;re saying about knowing what you&#x27;re worth, but that in itself doesn&#x27;t give you very much help in knowing what potential offers might come your way. Unless you have detailed inside information about all of your potential employers (hint: if you do, you should already be leveraging that information to get a job offer without having to go through all the drudgery of interviewing like everyone else), you can&#x27;t possibly know how the number you give compares to what they could potentially offer you. So you shouldn&#x27;t give a number at all.In fact, the more you know what you are worth, the less inclined you should be to give a number instead of just waiting for an actual offer. What knowing what you are worth should do is help you to decide, on your own (i.e, without asking recruiters who have conflicts of interest), which potential employers are worth your time to even look at in the first place. Don&#x27;t even bother talking to companies that you know can&#x27;t compensate you enough. But you don&#x27;t need to, and shouldn&#x27;t, tell recruiters what your threshold is for \"enough\". Just tell them company X doesn&#x27;t look like it would be a good fit. Nuff sed.> If recruiters are talking to you, they want to place you at the highest comp package they can.They want to place you at the highest comp package they can as long as it doesn&#x27;t risk not placing you at all. They never want to walk away altogether. But you might. So your interests and theirs are not quite aligned. reply pandaman 11 hours agorootparentYou argument is essentially hanging on the assertion that the first number an employer would offer is also the maximum number it could offer. I know exactly one company that operated like that: they&#x27;d make the maximum offer and if you did not like it there was no further negotiation. Most companies don&#x27;t do that (neither does that one any more, the CEO who had this policy had retired a while ago).What I&#x27;ve observed in my experience is that most companies will try the minimum offer regardless if you tell them your requirements or not, which makes sense since they do research too and unlike yourself their HR has much more experience and data for that. If you were asking less than the minimum they were willing to pay they will likely still pay the minimum as the sibling suggests, there is no point to save and get to hire again for the same position in a couple of months.I think it&#x27;s an illusion people get when they ask for a number and get it without much fuss. It makes them think they asked too little but in reality the hiring manager had the range like 200-250 and you asked for 210. Why would he bother to try to push you down to 200? On the other hand, why would he offer anything other than 200 if you did not ask? reply pdonis 11 hours agorootparent> You argument is essentially hanging on the assertion that the first number an employer would offer is also the maximum number it could offer.Not at all. You should expect to negotiate once they have made an offer.

Why would he bother to try to push you down to 200?Because you&#x27;ve now anchored the negotiation at 210 as the max, and he&#x27;s going to try to get you for less because this is business. He&#x27;s not going to just take your first number any more than you would just accept his first offer.Whereas if you hadn&#x27;t anchored the negotiation there wouldn&#x27;t be a ceiling at 210.> On the other hand, why would he offer anything other than 200 if you did not ask?He might not.

If you would, then you picked a bad number: you should have said 220. Or 230. Or 250. You&#x27;ve already hypothesized that the manager&#x27;s actual range is 200-250; given that hypothesis, you should be targeting at least the top of that range, not the bottom 20%, if you&#x27;re going to give a number at all. And if your objection to that is that you don&#x27;t know the manager&#x27;s range, yes, that&#x27;s the point! That&#x27;s why you shouldn&#x27;t be risking anchoring the conversation in the wrong place.If you wouldn&#x27;t refuse an offer less than 210, then the manager is not going to lose the placement by negotiating with you for less. Yes, 210 is \"within budget\", but that doesn&#x27;t mean negotiating for less has no benefit. That&#x27;s still budget he could now use for something else.In my experience any number you give is not going to be interpreted as your absolute minimum. It&#x27;s going to be interpreted as the first step in a negotiation--one in which you should have waited for the company to take the first step, but you didn&#x27;t and the company will feel no compunction in taking advantage of that.But in any case, even if you get 210, you have, as I said, foreclosed any chance of getting more. See below.> You also might get less.But you&#x27;re not going to get more, and that&#x27;s what you should be thinking about.You&#x27;ve already said the manager&#x27;s actual range is 200-250. If you say 210, then, as noted above, you&#x27;re restricting yourself to just the bottom 20% of that range no matter what.If you give no number and the manager offers 200, when his range is 200-250, that probably means he views you as a baseline hire and you wouldn&#x27;t have gotten 210 anyway if you&#x27;d given that number first. In any case you&#x27;re no worse off not giving a number; the key point is that the manager views you as a baseline hire.If you give no number and you&#x27;re a good enough hire that the manager would give you at least 210, he&#x27;ll probably offer 210. And then you can negotiate from there. reply pandaman 10 hours agorootparent>If you say 210, are you going to absolutely refuse any offer that&#x27;s less than that?I, for one, tell the number, which if was given to me during negotiation would result in acceptance on my part.> You&#x27;ve already hypothesized that the manager&#x27;s actual range is 200-250And I have not hypothesized the range, in my example I speculate why people believe they would have been offered more than they asked for if they did not ask first, this is the hypothesis, not the actual range.>But you&#x27;re not going to get more, and that&#x27;s what you should be thinking aboutIt&#x27;s trivial to raise it if you suddenly decided you can get more, just say you have another offer for $X+10K, but you like the company so much you are willing forfeit 10K.

Of course you can make up any numbers you like, but at the end of the day my argument is still the same: it&#x27;s to your disadvantage to anchor the conversation on a number first. And you don&#x27;t have to: as I&#x27;ve pointed out in another subthread in this discussion, if the company genuinely wants to hire you, at some point they have to commit to an offer. You don&#x27;t; you can always go away and talk to someone else. (If you object that you might not be able to, my response is that you&#x27;re already assuming you might get a better offer, which means you&#x27;re assuming you can go away and talk to someone else. See further comments below.)> It&#x27;s trivial to raise it if you suddenly decided you can get moreI don&#x27;t see how. You&#x27;ve told them you&#x27;d accept an offer from them for 210, but now you&#x27;re reneging. The fact that you might get another offer for more than 210 is a reason not to tell them the 210 number at all. It&#x27;s not a reason to go back and revise the 210 number afterwards if you get a better offer.> This is why negotiating down from already satisfactory for both sides comp is a bad strategy for the HM.You&#x27;re assuming that the company will interpret your giving them the 210 number up front as a sign that your negotiating position is strong. I think they will assume the opposite: that your negotiating position is weak. Someone who already has good offers on the table, or expects to get them soon, doesn&#x27;t have to commit to a number up front. They can just say \"Give me an offer you think is competitive and I&#x27;ll consider it in the light of my other options\". reply pandaman 8 hours agorootparent>That&#x27;s not the same as saying you would refuse any offer for less. So you haven&#x27;t answered the question I actually asked.The question is ambiguous, in some cases I stood on my number and would not take anything less, in other cases I renegotiated for other compensation e.g. less base, for much higher sign up bonus. Don&#x27;t see how is this relevant though.Essentially, after each side called a number, no matter the order, you are either in agreement or with the employer&#x27;s number lower than yours. The final outcome in the latter case will be either rejection, or a number between these two. You claim that if the employer calls the number first, the final number will magically be higher than if the candidate called the number first. I don&#x27;t see how is this feasible unless the employer always calls the maximum possible number or close to it.>In other words, you&#x27;re moving the goalposts.Not really, I did not edit my message, just read it again, the goalposts are still there.>I don&#x27;t see how.

They might, as you say, decide it&#x27;s not worth it to do that and just write you an offer at that number. But if they do do that, you are almost certainly leaving money on the table that you could have gotten if you had not given them a number and waited for them to make an offer.And if, in that scenario, you then come back and tell them you want more because someone else made you a higher offer, you&#x27;re, as I said before, reneging on what you already told them, and you&#x27;re now saddling them with additional work they didn&#x27;t even think they would need to do--they thought it was just a matter of writing you an offer at the number you said and you accepting it, boom, done.

Otherwise they&#x27;re not an actual alternative.If there is an employer you really want to work for who literally won&#x27;t give you an offer unless you tell them a number first, then you&#x27;re in a buyer&#x27;s market.

Jobs, home purchases, following \"rules\" and \"policies\" are in many cases left to the personal discretion of the enforcer. Yet we dont teach people how to effectively negotiate.

Even if they&#x27;ve worked a similar job in the area, doesn&#x27;t mean they know what the current going rate is. Once when applying for a job I asked for what was basically my current salary plus $20,000. The hiring manager said something to the lines of \"Oh, we can do better than that\" and ended up hiring me at my ask plus ANOTHER $40,000.

But most people will not be so lucky and most managers are not that amazing. reply nunez 13 hours agorootparentThere is another side to this advice.If you don&#x27;t know what market is, you can do one of three things:1. Check out levels.fyi (overindexed on FAANG; not reliable),2. Ask for a number that \"sounds\" high to you, and let the recruiter negotiate down (risky; recruiters might laugh you out the room if you go too high), or3. Ask a recruiter, and then add a premium on top of whatever they tell you!Recruiters will be an excellent source of what a realistic market is for your skills in your area. However, as this article articulates, many people don&#x27;t negotiate, so it&#x27;s fair to assume that the market rate they give you is low. reply pdonis 13 hours agorootparentYou left out:4. Don&#x27;t give a number at all. If you are interested in Company X, and you&#x27;ve gone far enough in the process to know they are interested in you, tell the recruiter that you would be interested in seeing a competitive offer from Company X, or something along those lines. At the end of the day, the best negotiating leverage you have is that if Company X actually does want to hire you, at some point they have to commit to an offer. You don&#x27;t.

Like, they probably use ADP or Paychex as their payroll service, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they can ask the payroll company or just look up what you currently make.The last time I interviewed (at a FAANG), they didn&#x27;t do any kind of negotiation dance about pay. They didn&#x27;t ask me what I make or what I wanted. After the interviewing, they said \"Here&#x27;s your offer, it is non-negotiable.\" and lo and behold it was about 0.2% or so above what I was currently making.

If I&#x27;m buying a 12 bedroom mansion, I&#x27;m going to expect a lot more photos, better staging, and so on in the marketing compared to a 1 bed apartment.Equally small, cheap, properties are likely to sell faster (bigger buying pool) than more expensive ones. That $20m mansion is going to take a lot more visits than the $200k apartment.In other words, there is sufficient variability in the cost of selling to warrant a sliding fee. And generally the best way to do that is as a % of the sale. A % BTW which is negotiable based on how fast the realtor thinks the property will sell, and the sale price expected. reply MobileVet 10 hours agorootparentIt is very dependent on the market.

They&#x27;re hiding it from all candidates, and a policy of telling everyone (or hiding from everyone) can have an effect on just what sort of candidates they get.If, in exceptional circumstances, they would pay 30% more than everyone else, they might want to hide this. Instead of saying \"we do 95% to 135% of what everyone else offers\", they say \"we do 95% to 105% of what everyone else offers\"... and suddenly they get fewer cranks and weirdos. But they still have the option of offering that 30% more, if they stumble upon some diamond in the rough.They might want to, even if showing would bring in a few more good candidates. Is it disturbing the signal to noise ratio so much that it takes far longer and costs more to go through the whole process.Of course, just because it might work this way in theory, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it does in practice, especially consistently. So, it could be them chasing bad strategy that they can&#x27;t determine to be bad strategy.If they have a few more bad assumptions (like \"our stated range is still good enough to get the decent candidates\"), then they might be even more inclined to hide the range.They&#x27;re working through all sorts of bad tradeoffs too, just like you. reply wuliwong 16 hours agorootparentprevI do think being proactive like you suggest is a good approach. It is pretty easy to couch it in a relaxed way that you are attempting to save everyone&#x27;s time and it makes them show their hand first.

I’ve heard it described as bimodal or trimodal, but I’m not even sure that captures it.There was a YC company on the hacker news homepage recently looking for senior AI engineer for 60k. Even by international standards that’s absurdly cheap , but this is a YC backed company, I don’t think their head is in the sand (though I do suspect YC coaches founders to play moneyball with hiring as YC companies as a whole seem to pay far below average).There’s many companies that consider 150-200k as “standard”.And there’s still many companies paying 400-600k for senior engineers. I thought in the “tech recession” with the interest rates up this wouldn’t be available for a while but an acquaintance who got laid off from Twitter did the “grind interview prep and interview a dozen companies simultaneously” strategy just this summer in 2023 and got multiple competing 500k+ offers (all liquid) for staff SWE including from some companies I didn’t realize paid that much like HubSpot.Despite many great offers he also encountered many companies that tried to lowball by claiming “salaries are going down for engineers” but that turned out to be wishful thinking and&#x2F;or a bluff on the company’s part given his final result.So basically there is no “market rate” for senior engineers but to the extent there is one a huge percentage look to massively go under it. I don’t blame them as it’s part of the game but just be aware many companies say things like “we want the best and are willing to pay for it” but then lowball and try to bluff engineers into thinking “the market” is much lower than reality.

Don’t take it personally. reply pc86 16 hours agorootparentWhether I am thrilled to take a $60k TC job or my absolute minimum is $400k that doesn&#x27;t change the market in that 60k is insultingly low and 400k is well above the median (cue all the folks who think FAANG is the market chiming in about $450k TC juniors). reply jrockway 14 hours agorootparentWait, which FAANG hires junior engineers for $450k? reply johnnyanmac 5 hours agorootparentProbably not \"junior\" in the traditional sense of the world. Maybe some PhD holders researching very, very specific literature that the company wants to lock in pronto. You&#x27;re not hiring a new engineer for that much to simply code. reply Manuel_D 12 hours agorootparentprevPerhaps people who joined shortly before a stock rally. I was pulling ~$270k TC at 2 YoE, but it was really ~$175k TC at the time I actually joined the company. Equity is so variable, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s better to compare TC at time of offer. Of course, when I negotiate I always cite the highest stock value in the last several months. reply saagarjha 11 hours agorootparentTC numbers are typically not meant to include stock variations. reply gabereiser 15 hours agorootparentprev$60k is a lot of money in other parts of the world reply pc86 15 hours agorootparentYeah, in different markets. reply zoomablemind 13 hours agorootparentprevMy understanding is that the game is usually about the money saved between the offer and the target salary band.Companies have their review schedules and the new hires would be boarded before the reviews. This would allow to hire at low ball and then give a \"raise\", effectively leveling it.Not only aiming at below market figure saves company the money, this also serves as a retention tool.So, it does pay to know an approx of the target comp band AND your own \"happy\" target. The hard part is to formulate it as a package. reply joezydeco 16 hours agoparentprevPrecisely. The article misses a third bullet point:3) Many recruiters will say yes to everything and anything to get you into the interview seatAnd if you&#x27;re juggling multiple FAANG offers in the same week, you probably don&#x27;t need salary negotiation tips. reply treprinum 16 hours agorootparent> And if you&#x27;re juggling multiple FAANG offers in the same week, you probably don&#x27;t need salary negotiation tips.If they are remote jobs, you just accept them all, buy as many computers as the offers you accepted and multitask for n x the pay. reply HWR_14 13 hours agorootparentI thought the next step was hire N people in india to do the work, collect the difference between your salary and theirs, and apply for more jobs. reply rmujica 16 hours agorootparentprevr&#x2F;overemployed is leaking reply folmar 11 hours agorootparentprevFAANGs can be _really accomodating_ money-wise if they badly want you.

IMHO, the article’s advice is spot-on. reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agoparentprevOnly apply to businesses that advertise pay range, or at least a minimum pay, in their job listings. It is the law in CO&#x2F;NYC&#x2F;WA&#x2F;CA, so all the highest paying businesses have to comply anyway, and any business that wants to compete with them will have to advertise pay range also.Thus if a business does not advertise pay ranges, you can assume it will not be on the high end, at least not competitive with pay in the above regions. reply photonerd 16 hours agorootparentA lot of businesses post stupid ranges.Like, ok your range is $150-250k, fan-fucking-tastic, that’s completely unhelpful reply leeny 16 hours agorootparentAuthor here. These ranges are typically wide because your compensation depends on your interview performance and perceived seniority&#x2F;value add to the company.There&#x27;s no way to tease this out before you interview, except that if you&#x27;re looking for compensation that&#x27;s significantly above the top of the band, it might be hard to get. (A little above the top is possible, and sometimes a lot is possible too... that&#x27;s where the negotiation comes in.) reply noitpmeder 16 hours agorootparentI feel like it&#x27;s not a great look to say \"I don&#x27;t know enough about the role to give you my salary expectations at this point\" while also asking \"but what is the salary range for this position, given you don&#x27;t know enough about me\".Any thoughts on how to approach that? reply xyzelement 15 hours agorootparent&#x2F;&#x2F; Any thoughts on how to approach that?This may sound quaint but I find that being forthcoming and asking the question you have works.During the latest job search, I would just ask for a range and say myself that \"obviously where I fall in the range depends on my candidacy, I won&#x27;t hold you to it.\"If they tell you the range is something like $120K to $150K, it tells you what kind of seniority they are looking for - whether they know it or not - and how much they value people of that profile. If they tell you it&#x27;s like $150K to $750K - then you know they are really wide open to range of experience and impact. Someone may say that a $600K wide range is meaningless but I don&#x27;t think it is. If you&#x27;re more junior you can count on being towards the left but still know they can afford to give you a bit more if they like you, and if you&#x27;re very senior you can recognize that they have room for someone like you and have an appetite to pay. You&#x27;d be totally self-unaware to go into the process hoping for $750 and then landing at $150 but that&#x27;s more on you.So I am fine asking for a broad range - it&#x27;s way more meaningful than no range. reply nonethewiser 15 hours agorootparentprevTheir range is independent of you so just dont worry about it. reply lotsofpulp 16 hours agorootparentprevIt is very helpful, the bottom of the range tells you almost everything you need to know. I don’t care if the top is $1B per year if I am willing to accept $200k in order to decide which jobs to apply. reply xyzelement 15 hours agorootparentI think that&#x27;s true when you&#x27;re on the more junior side of things. When you&#x27;re more senior, you&#x27;re more interested in the ceiling. the $200k may not be enough but if you know it goes up to say $500k - you can consider interviewing. reply sneak 16 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s not \"completely unhelpful\" - if your current job is $99k&#x2F;yr or $400k&#x2F;yr it answers your \"should I bother spending time interviewing here?\" question quite nicely.The fact that the range is 100k isn&#x27;t that big of an impediment to utility. reply Lucasoato 16 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s better to have reasonably large salary ranges than no range at all. reply brianwawok 16 hours agorootparentprevBut like, that is a perfectly valid salary range for a job? Not all companies have a 10k salary band on a given title. reply roland35 15 hours agorootparentIt can be a valid range - I&#x27;ve seen plenty of postings (internal at least) where the the seniority is flexible. Also a flexible location could also lead to a big range depending if you are based in NYC versus Iowa... reply HellDunkel 16 hours agoparentprevI recently found out that i did not know the maximum. Only multiple offers and taking some risks allowed me to find out and it was well beyond what i had assumed. reply xyzelement 15 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;re spot on, and I don&#x27;t know why people complain about \"wasting their time interviewing\" so much. Interviewing is both a valuable skill and a good information discovery process - as you mentioned.If you are doing a lot of interviews and not getting jobs - then you need more practice doing them.

    "originBody": "Graham Helton Blogs / Tags / Archive / Other / RSS An Excruciatingly Detailed Guide To SSH (But Only The Things I Actually Find Useful) Oh you like SSH? Name every flag. Published: August 22, 2023 Reading Time: 15 minutes Welcome We’ve all seen these great diagrams of how SSH port forwarding works but if your brain is anything like mine, these diagrams leave you with a lot of unanswered questions. If you’re on a red team, understanding how to traverse a network better than the people who designed it gives you immense power to do evil things. SSH is such a powerful tool but sometimes the syntax and other concepts can get in the way of us accomplishing our goals. In an effort to do more evil things in a timely fashion I’ve put together a massive list of SSH things that I find useful. You can read it too, but if I’m being honest, this is mostly for me. I’ve learned that I really don’t grasp concepts unless I have hands on keyboard time doing them. This post is essentially just everything I learned while doing so. Also I should point out that in all of these examples I am using a websever to demonstrate port forwarding but this can be done with almost any service including RDP, SQL, etc. Local Port Forwarding (-L) Like the name implies, local port forwarding allows you to create a local port that is forwarded to a remote port. Let’s assume that the server internal-web.int is hosting a webpage that is only accessible on the loopback interface. This means that in order for us to access that webpage, we must be on internal-web.int. One way that we can get around this is by using an SSH local port forward. Assuming we SSH access to internal-web.int, on the host machine campfire.int, we can create a local forward that will allow us to access the remote webserver via a local port. The command to do this is: ssh -N -f -L 1337:127.0.0.1:80 root@internal-web.int. This command is ran on campfire.int. That’s a complicated command, as always, breaking it down by flag will allow us to figure out what exactly is happening. -N: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on root@internal-web.int -f: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it. -L Tells SSH to forward a local port 1337:127.0.0.1:80: This tells SSH to bind the local port 1337 to the remote port of 80 (the port our webserver is on). The best way I found to remember this is -L means local is on the left-hand side of the address. -R means the local port is on the right-hand side of the address. root@internal-web.int This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel. Remember, port 1337 on our local machine is going to be bound to port 80 on the remote server. Now that we have established the local port forward, we can interact with port 80 on internal-web.int by sending requests to port 1337 on our local machine( campfire.int). Remote Port Forwarding (-R) Remote port forwarding is the opposite of local port forwarding. Lets assume that we have access to internal-web.int and it is hosting a webpage that is only accessible on the loopback interface. Lets also assume that campfire.int cannot directly access internal-web.int. In this scenario we’d like to access internal-web.int from campfire.int. The problem is that we cannot directly communicate between campfire.int and internal-web.int due to a firewall. To get around this, we identify that vuln-server.int is reachable by both campfire.int and internal-web.int. The solution in this case is to use remote port forwarding SSH option to forward the port 80 from internal-web.int to an arbitrary port on vuln-server.int. Once we complete the remote port forward, we should be able to access the internal-web.int’s internal web page running on port 80 by issuing a curl command to vuln-server.int. The command to do this is: ssh -N -f -R 3000:127.0.0.1:80 root@vuln-server.int. -N: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on root@internal-web.int -f: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it. -R Tells SSH to forward a remote port 3000:127.0.0.1:80: This tells SSH to bind the remote port 3000 to the local port of 80. The best way I found to remember this is local forwarding with-L means local is on the left-hand side of the address. Remote forwarding with-R means the local port is on the right-hand side of the address. root@vuln-server.int: This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel. Remember, port 3000 (on vuln-server.int) is going to be bound to port 80 on this server. Now that we have established the remote port forward, we can access port 80 on internal-web.int by sending a curl request to vuln-server.int:3000 Dynamic Port Forwarding (-D) Dynamic port forwarding with the -D option is an interesting option for proxying traffic over a SOCKS proxy. Lets assume that internal-web.int is hosting a web application that is only accessible on the internal network. We will assume that we have SSH access to vuln-server.int and it is on the same internal network and able to reach internal-web.int. What we would like to accomplish is accessing the webserver running on internal-web.int by proxying all of our traffic from campfire.int through vuln-server.int using both proxychains and our local web browser. First, we must ensure the /etc/proxychains.conf configuration file is set correctly. Socks5: Tells proxychains to use socks5 (instead of socks4) 127.0.0.1: Tells proxychains to use our localhost 8080: Is the port we will use for our dynamic forward. This must match the port you specify with -D in your SSH command. The command to do this is ssh -N -f -D 8080 root@vuln-server.int -N: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on root@vuln-server.int -f: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it. -D 8080 Tells SSH to create a dynamic local port to send our traffic through. root@vuln-server.int: This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel so that we can proxy our traffic through it. After creating the dynamic port forward over port 8080 and setting socks5 127.0.0.1 8080 in /etc/proxychains.conf, we can now run proxychains curl 192.168.1.185 and see our webpage hosted on 192.168.1.185. Additionally, DNS over SOCKS is hit or miss for me which is why I’ve used the IP address in the below curl command. Next, we can configure Firefox to browse the internal web server via our SOCKS proxy by configuring the proxy settings within firefox itself. To get to the settings in firefox go to: Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Network Settings. Once there select Manual proxy configuration and check the “Proxy DNS when using SOCKS V5”. Finally, tell firefox about the SOCKS proxy we just set up by setting SOCKS host to 127.0.0.1 and the port to 8080 (Or whatever you set your port to in your SSH command). Now that we’ve set up our proxy, we can now access the webpage on internal-web.int since all of our traffic is being proxied from our local machine through vuln-server.int. Pretty cool. Jumphosts (-J) Compared to the previous commands, jumping through hosts with SSH is fairly straight forward. In this scenario we will proxy our traffic through two hosts to reach a destination host that is not reachable by our current host campfire.int. Our jump chain will look like this: campfire.int -> vuln-server.int -> internal-web.int -> dns.int. The command to do this is ssh -J root@vuln-server.int,root@internal-web.int root@dns.int. Note that multiple jumps are separated by commas. Agent Forwarding (-A) SSH Agent forwarding is an interesting concept that I’ve written about about in my post Zero Effort Private Key Compromise: Abusing SSH-Agent for Lateral Movement which I encourage you to read if you’re considering using agent forwarding. To summarize that post, The SSH agent allows you to add private keys/identities to the agent running on your local machine using ssh-add . These keys can then be listed with ssh-add -l. After adding a key to the ssh-agent utility, you can then SSH to a server using the key without having to re-enter the password. This is useful for both humans and service accounts. The -A option allows you to forward your key agent to the machine youâ€™re connecting to, allowing you to use your private keys from the machine youâ€™re connected to. Again, if you want more information about this, check out my previous post on the topic as there are some security concerns with this. To demonstrate this, lets assume we want to jump through vuln-server.int into internal-web.int while also forwarding the keys in our ssh-agent so that we can utilize them once on internal-web.int. The command to do this is: ssh -A -J root@vuln-server.int root@internal-web.int -A Tells SSH to forward the keys in our SSH agent to the remote machine internal-web.int -J root@vuln-server.int Tells SSH to proxy our traffic through vuln-server.int before accessing internal-web.int root@internal-web.int: This is telling SSH that we wish to login to the remote server as the root user to establish the SSH tunnel. As you can see, after executing ssh -A -J root@vuln-server.int root@internal-web.int, we can use ssh root@dns.int without having to specify a private key or enter any credentials. This is because our local machine campfire.int has the ssh key for dns.int loaded into the ssh-agent. We confirm this by running ssh-agent -l. TTY Command Allocation (-t) This option is super simple but very helpful for quickly running commands on a remote server that require some sort of interaction such as Vim or top. My favorite use case for this is when I need to quickly edit a file on a remote server. All you need to do is run the command ssh root@internal-web.int -t top and you will be greeted with a TTY containing the top command. Global port (-g) This one is a bit less common, but it allows us to define a locally forwarded port as a “global port” (my terminology, not official) that will allow us to proxy and traffic coming in on a local port to a port on an external server. This is similar to the -L option mentioned previously, but it will allow us to access the “Local” ports from an external machine. In the scenario below we have shell access to vuln-server.int and we would like to proxy any connection hitting port 2222 to port 22 on internal-web.int. The command to do this is: ssh -N -f -g -L 2222:localhost:22 root@internal-web.int -N: This lets SSH know that we’re not going to be sending any commands after the server. Without this we’d get a shell on root@internal-web.int -f: This sends SSH to the background. If we didn’t do this, our terminal would hang and we wouldn’t be able to use it. -g This tells SSH to allow remote hosts to connect to locally forwarded ports -L Tells SSH to forward a local port As you can see, even though our initial SSH command was to port 2222 on vuln-server.int, our shell tells us that we are actually on internal-web.int because of the ssh -N -f -g -L 2222:localhost:22 root@internal-web.int SSH Console (~?) The SSH console is a “hidden” feature of SSH that allows you to exert some control over SSH without having to interact with the remote system. This is useful if you’re trying to control SSH itself but your shell is broken. To access the help menu for the console press ~?. If you’re familiar with vim, this is similar to using the leader character. This will bring up the help console. There are two options that I find very useful. First is the ~. option which will kill your session (very useful if you’ve broken something). The second is the “Console” option which can be accessed with ~C. This console has a few options for forwarding. If you find that you’ve SSH’d into a server and would like to begin using this session as a port forward session (such as a dynamic forward with the -D option mentioned previously), you can forward this session with the -D 8080 option to create a forward-on-the-fly out of this session. In this example, I’ve connected to vuln-server.int via a normal ssh command. After pressing ~C and typing -D 8080 and pressing enter twice, a normal prompt is returned to me. However, upon utilizing proxychains on the host machine campfire.int (and ensuring the /etc/proxychains.conf file is set to use port 8080), we can utilize the SSH session as if we had initiated it using ssh -D. Nifty. SSH Config The SSH config file is located at ~/.ssh/config and can be utilized to save you time when making connections over SSH. The config file uses a very easy to follow syntax that allows you to save your SSH configuration instead of having to type out all the options you want in the command line each time. SSH will parse this file when making an SSH connection. If the server you’re connecting to has an configuration defined in ~/.ssh/config, it will use that configuration. Note that command line parameters take precedence over the configuration file. This means that if your ~/.ssh/config file says that the user for internal-web.int should be root, but you run the SSH command ssh graham@internal-web.int, SSH will attempt to log you in as graham, not root. Below is an example of a very basic ~/.ssh/config file. 1 # You can put comments with a `#` at the beginning of the line only. 2 host internal-web.int 3 User root 4 IdentityFile /home/smores/ssh_agent/internal-web-no-pw 5Port 2222 The way SSH parses this file when running ssh internal-web.int is: It attempts to match internal-web.int in the command line invocation with a host keyword matching internal-web.int in ~/.ssh/config If internal-web.int is found in ~/.ssh/config, any of the options under host will be utilized if they’re not specified in the command line invocation If no match is found, SSH will only use options you’ve defined in your command line invocation of SSH. SSH Config Keywords There are many keywords you can utilize in your SSH config file but here are a few of the common ones I use that aren’t self explanatory (such as Port and User) . IdentityFile /path/to/private_key: Allows you to specify the private key you wish to use for the host. Same as using -i ForwardAgent: This is the same as running ssh -A (Once again, please see Zero Effort Private Key Compromise: Abusing SSH-Agent for Lateral Movement before using this.) ProxyJump root@internal-web.int: Specify a server to proxy traffic through. Same as the -J option mentioned above. Note that in the below example we are asked to authenticate to root@vuln-server.int. This demonstrates that our traffic is indeed being routed through vuln-server.int before giving us a shell on internal-web.int like we asked for in the SSH command. Match: This one is a bit more complex. The Match keyword allows you to define conditions in your SSH config. In the below example, SSH executes the command exportgrep PROXYME=TRUE. If the program returns with a status code of 0 (in this case, meaning grep found a match), it will utilize the SSH keywords defined under the Match block (In this case, ProxyJump). Otherwise only the normal host internal-web.int block is used. In the below example, we first run ssh internal-web.int which successfully connects us to the server using the private key denoted with the IdentityFile keyword. Since exportgrep PROXYME=TRUE returns with a status code of 1 (meaning grep did not find a match), we do not execute the ProxyJump keyword under the match statement. Next, we set the PROXYME environment variable to TRUE using export PROXYME=TRUE and re-run the same ssh internal-web.int. This time we are asked to authenticate to vuln-server.int before we get a shell on internal-web.int. This is because SSH evaluated the Match block and executed exportgrep PROXYME=TRUE which returned status code 0 (meaning grep found the match). Since it returned true, it executed the ProxyJump keyword defined under the Match block. I should also point out that scp (and some other SSH based utilities) can use your SSH config file! Typically it does this by default, but I’ve had instances where it does not. If you’re on a system where scp does not automatically utilize your ~/.ssh/config file, you can explicitly define it with the -F ~/.ssh/config argument. ssh-copy-id The ssh-copy-id utility is a small tool that allows us to quickly upload our public key to a server. The command to do this is: ssh-copy-id -i internal-web root@internal-web.int -i internal-web: Specify the name of the private key we wish to use to authenticate and copy to the server. root@internal-web.int Specify the server we wish to upload the private key to. ssh-keygen This utility is used to generate private/public key pairs. It is typically recommended that you specify a larger key size using the -b option. Although I’m not a crypto expert, longer is generally better and the default keysize is 3072 (At least on my machine). ssh-keygen defaults to RSA, however, other (preferably stronger) algorithms can be used by specifying the -t flag. IE ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 Additionally, you can inspect keys to see their fingerprint and byte size using ssh-keygen -lf . Wrapping up So there you have it, my personal SSH cheatsheet for SSH.

It annoys me on older versions of Amazon Linux (2 and earlier) because it involves (among other things) an invocation of the openssl CLI to verify the format of individual keys in the authorized keys file that is hardcoded to use RSA, so you can&#x27;t authenticate to Amazon Linux 2 hosts using ed25519 even though the version of OpenSSH on them supports it.In theory it&#x27;s kinda nice because it can let you do fancy things¹, but my actual experiences with it breaking basic functionality even for people who don&#x27;t use those fancy things has ultimately made me trust Amazon Linux less.It was especially frustrating because when I first encountered this, I was trying to SSH into a box owned by one of our cloud-first DevOps guys. I couldn&#x27;t diagnose the box because I didn&#x27;t have hands on it. He couldn&#x27;t diagnose the issue because he knows AWS better than he knows Linux and didn&#x27;t know where to look. He&#x27;d chosen Amazon Linux because it&#x27;s by the owner of the cloud platform, so it must be &#x27;more compatible&#x27;, right?

This is more than a little counter intuitive as IME the more common semantic in configuration parsers and rules engines is for subsequent directives to take precedence over previous ones.This may seem inconsequential, but IME when changing defaults in, e.g., &#x2F;etc&#x2F;ssh&#x2F;sshd_config, people and software tend to append their changes to the end of a file or directive block, not the beginning, expecting those changes to be effective. Even security companies and organizations get this wrong, including various SSH bastion products I&#x27;ve seen. CIS Benchmarks recommendations (IIRC) and most (all?) third-party CIS audit suites don&#x27;t consider precedence at all or get it wrong--e.g. by recommending appending a value, or by providing a compliance test that accepts a broken configuration. FWIW, the proper way to check whether an OpenSSH configuration directive is defined as expected is to use `sshd -T` or `ssh -G` to dump the derived, internal configuration, not by directly inspecting the configuration file(s). reply pxc 4 hours agoparent> Here&#x27;s something I bet few people know: the OpenSSH configuration parser ignores duplicate directives; only the first such directive has any effect. This is more than a little counter intuitiveThis is how the sudoers file works as well. I think this is desirable in software that authenticates or authorizes users, and maybe more broadly wherever security concerns are essential. That&#x27;s because this logic makes it easy to create settings that can&#x27;t be overridden in by adding a new file in a whatever.conf.d directory: you define those settings in the main config file before you source whatever.conf.d&#x2F;* and you put some kind of special protections on that file.Even where you&#x27;re not worried about somebody evading your controls per se, it can be nice from a configuration management perspective in giving you a soft &#x27;guarantee&#x27; that if some new hire who doesn&#x27;t have the whole picture adds a new file in there, or some package tries to install a stupid default for its own service, your baseline settings can retain priority.In other contexts you probably see the opposite behavior because what you really want is not a &#x27;baseline configuration&#x27; but a collection of defaults in the strict sense: fallback settings to be used in case nothing is explicitly configured by the user, developer, or administrator (as the case may be). reply ggm 12 hours agoprev> The best way I found to remember this is local forwarding with-L means local is on the left-hand side of the address.

Rather than establish a new tcp connection, doing the auth dance, etc, you can tell ssh to reuse an existing connection. (The protocol itself has a notion of channels, a bit of metadata with every data frame to distinguish different streams, and this functionality uses that).The big thing with it is that you don&#x27;t have to do a full auth for subsequent sessions - nice if you don&#x27;t have tmux (etc) on the remote, and do multiple panes via multiple terminal windows. Particularly when auth involves a passphrase and hsm touch or similar that can take several seconds.It also has a \"connection persistence\" setting so when you&#x27;re bouncing around between a handful of servers you don&#x27;t have to auth each and every time you switch between servers.Overall I think of it as one of those features that&#x27;s nice to have, but not really life changing or anything - Some servers I connect to have it turned off and I notice it&#x27;s absence more than I notice when it&#x27;s working.More info: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikibooks.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;OpenSSH&#x2F;Cookbook&#x2F;Multiplexing reply fanf2 9 hours agoparentIt makes a huge difference if there’s significant latency between the client and server: ssh is a very chatty protocol, which has not been optimized to reduce round trips like TLS has been - apart from this multiplexing option. reply tedunangst 16 hours agoprevAnother member of the intergovernmental agency domain squatters club. reply zamadatix 16 hours agoparentFor those wondering what this is referring to it&#x27;s the use of \".int\" for the TLD of the examples. \".test\" and \".example\" are the only really good reserved TLDs for this (\".local\" isn&#x27;t quite what people think it is). reply tiffanyh 16 hours agorootparentExample.comPeople should just use example.com, it’s reserved and the most obvious to the end user that it’s for example purposes.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Example.com reply zamadatix 14 hours agorootparentExample.com is certainly acceptable as well but it does have a somewhat negative side effect of being an actual running, pinging, sometimes-service-responding host which means if people paste the documentation verbatim it may either actual execute or take longer than normal to timeout (ssh would fall into the latter). \".example\" is reserved for the same purpose but does not have any registered domains, on top of being a few characters shorter for when you need more than 1 name in your documentation. reply digging 15 hours agorootparentprevDoesn&#x27;t work if you need to refer to more than one domain..example is also reserved for this exact purpose. reply layer8 15 hours agorootparentIt does work when you use subdomains.

A domain name ending in .local may be resolved concurrently via other mechanisms, for example, unicast DNS reply fanf2 9 hours agorootparentSadly it’s more complicated than that.Back in the 1990s, Microsoft distributed a Netware-killer version of NT called Windows Small Business Server. It was aimed at companies that might at best have a dial-up internet service. SBS, being based on Active Directory and Exchange (etc usw) required a domain name, but back then you needed considerable arcane knowledge to register an Internet domain name, which most SBS users lacked.So Microsoft recommended that their SBS users should pick a name under .local for their AD domain name. I will not relive the many hilarious fuckups this caused, especially when Exchange was trying to use POP3 for incoming email. [tedu’s comment upthread reminds me of an incident when I spotted a company that was clever enough not to use .local for their AD, but not clever enough to understand that corp.int is not an internal subdomain of corporation.com.](What MS should have done, instead of squatting on a name that might get created as a real TLD in the future, was tell their customers to make up a subdomain of a properly registered domain of MS’s own; if MS’s customers wanted to turn their fake domain name into a real internet presence, MS would have had a ready-made lever to turn their customers into subscribers. But that was 15ish years before MS realised Azure might be a good idea.)OK, so part two of this story is the early years of Mac OS X when Apple needed a replacement for AppleTalk that worked with IP over Ethernet. The main gap that needed filling was zero-configuration service discovery, which AppleTalk had enjoyed forever and IP lacked. The solution was called Rendezvous or Bonjour (I forget which name replaced which) and multicast DNS was a foundational part of it. Apple did an incredibly effective job of getting other vendors (especially printer manufacturers) to adopt the new protocol.HOWEVER, Apple needed to choose a domain name for mDNS so that names of devices on the LAN could be distinguished from names out on the internet. They chose .local because a LAN is a local area network.Hence, hilarity ensued. So much confusion and failure to interoperate because two large corporations failed to appreciate the importance of a global shared namespace, and foolishly chose the same cute name to mean completely different things.Possibly the saddest episode was when Apple were in the process of turning mDNS from a de facto standard (with multiple implementations across multiple vendors) into an IETF standard. MS tried to derail the effort by persuading the IETF to spin up a working group to develop LLMNR, link-local multicast name resolution, TOTALLY NOT mDNS HONESTLY. Surprising no one, there was zero interest in replacing a successful working deployed protocol with slightly differently shaped vapourware. Rough consensus and running code wins again.The upshot of this is that the IETF has a lot of institutional trauma and scar tissue around the question of non-DNS domain names.

They&#x27;re pretty close so maybe the distinction doesn&#x27;t matter. The former seems more legible than most pages I see posted here since most of them have poor contrast. The latter is approximately what I use in my own terminal, except my text color is closer to that of the text editor screen capture than any of the shell ones for the same reason of contrast. I&#x27;ve pretty poor eyesight in general though so perhaps there&#x27;s something to that. reply h2odragon 16 hours agoparentprev [–] > do people really find color schemes like this easier to readThat scheme works great for me.

Particularly when the title gives the main message. I ask because auto translation is almost perfect for at least all the European languages. I agree maybe there should be a bias towards English but this seems a reasonable exception here reply zamadatix 19 hours agorootparentIMO, regardless of the language of the article, if your alternative title summarizes the point as good as or better than the body of the article you&#x27;re linking then it should just be a text post for discussion in the first place. If you&#x27;re submitting an external site the focus should be on the content of that site. Encouraging posters to create their own main takeaways when posting and commenters to focus on the HN title instead of linked article seems like a net loss vs using the text post type. reply lost_tourist 18 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s very important for proper understanding of such things as translation is currently really not up to HN quality expectations just yet. Maybe in the future as AI gets better at it reply dmarchand90 16 hours agorootparentFor me this translation is extremely easy to understand:What is the maximum amount I can pay in cash? At this time, you may pay for all purchases in cash. For cash purchases above € 10,000, the seller must conduct a customer due diligence. But not all sellers accept cash. The cabinet is working on a bill to ban cash payments from € 3,000.Pay for purchases in cash At this time, you may pay for all purchases in cash. It doesn&#x27;t matter how high the amount is. A seller can decide not to accept cash above a certain amount. Or not accepting cash at all .Customer research for purchases above € 10,000 Do you make a purchase that costs more than € 10,000 and do you pay in cash? Then the seller must conduct a customer due diligence . This check is mandatory to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.Bill cash payments up to € 3,000 A bill is being drafted to ban cash payments from €3,000 .

What are some good reasons to allow cash payments above 3000 EUR? reply dijit 20 hours agorootparentYou&#x27;ll be downvoted, but to answer this question with all honesty:1) Disallowing a third-party in every single transaction you make, especially as1a) Inflation means 3k now might be quite low in 20 years1b) Banks themselves have been shown to be scummy1c) Banks are a rare institution to allow outsiders into.2) Bank accounts themselves are not actually all that accessible; it&#x27;s quite common for people to be ineligible for a bank account under random (but common) circumstances. -- an interesting loop you can get into is that you need to pay a utility bill in order to get a bank account, yet you can&#x27;t pay a utility bill without a bank account.3) Cash is the only fiat currency that actually exists, I know it&#x27;s trendy to think that lines in a database are meaningful- but if you have physical cash you know what it&#x27;s worth and it can&#x27;t be hacked or seized. (though a good counterpoint is of course that you can be robbed or it can get destroyed).I live in Sweden and we&#x27;re very far down the path of \"cash is dead\" - there&#x27;s a considerable number of stores and fast food joints that do not even accept cash. However, when I moved to this country I couldn&#x27;t open a bank account and without people accepting cash at that time I would have paid exorbitant fees on each transaction.So with that in mind I&#x27;m not in favour of restricting cash, I&#x27;m aware of the drawbacks of large fiat currency transactions; but It gives the central banks even more power than they currently have (which is a lot, which you&#x27;d know if you were on the wrong side of a policy or get into one of their loops) and we&#x27;re not sure that they are going to continue to be fair into the future.Note: you cannot hold a bank account with the central bank that actually issues currency. You are voting for a middle-man. reply thraxil 1 hour agorootparent> I live in Sweden and we&#x27;re very far down the path of \"cash is dead\" - there&#x27;s a considerable number of stores and fast food joints that do not even accept cash.

We moved to the Netherlands in 2014 from the US and it was three or four months before our immigration stuff was far enough along that we could open a local bank account with an IBAN and get a chip and pin card (at the time, virtually no US banks would give you chip and pin cards). My partner couldn&#x27;t even get paid during that time until she had a bank account. We lived off withdrawing cash from my US account at ATMs. That included paying our rent (we were lucky that our landlord, who lived in a different city, was OK with us just paying cash to their relative who lived nearby). reply Aaargh20318 20 hours agorootparentprev> Bank accounts themselves are not actually all that accessible; it&#x27;s quite common for people to be ineligible for a bank account under random (but common) circumstances.Not in the Netherlands.

I can say that with absolute confidence after working in financial services (albeit briefly). reply ghaff 19 hours agorootparentWhen I got a RealID-compliant driver&#x27;s license a few years ago in my state in the US, an existing driver&#x27;s license and passport were not sufficient. I needed some document to server as proof of my current address, such as a utility bill. I don&#x27;t remember what all the options were but, yes, some people--including kids getting their first driver&#x27;s license or people sharing an apartment who don&#x27;t have their name on a lease--can run into issues. reply Aaargh20318 19 hours agorootparentIn the Netherlands, the government already keeps track of everyone’s address. If you move, you have to register your new address with the municipality within a certain time frame. (IIRC 2 weeks) reply ghaff 19 hours agorootparentThe US is sort of loosey-goosey partly because we&#x27;re not real big on getting registered with authorities and partly because the states have their own jurisdictions. So, if you&#x27;re legitimately a digital nomad you sort of would have to do one or more things that are probably in a quasi-gray legal area so you can get ID and not be considered a tax evader. reply someplaceguy 17 hours agorootparentprevYes, and that gets really \"interesting\" when you don&#x27;t have a stable address of residence (e.g. because you are traveling for an extended period of time, possibly in-and-out of the country).In some cases, you can get basically locked out of all essential services, including bank account closures, not being able to make payments (especially now with these laws), etc.Real fun! reply PrimeMcFly 10 hours agorootparentprevJesus that&#x27;s freaky. Talk about government overreach. reply Aaargh20318 1 hour agorootparentThis seems like a pretty basic thing for a government to do. They need to know your address for a lot of things. For example: taxes (notification that you need to file, your returns, etc).

People are unaware because they&#x27;ve never experienced it, but it&#x27;s really awful.Last year it took me 5 months and a lot of proverbial \"banging fist on the table\" to get a bank account in the Netherlands.

This may not sound too bad, but:- Few people are willing to rent to you if you don&#x27;t have a Dutch bank account and current registration.- You can&#x27;t get registration without a place to rent that qualifies (and many places don&#x27;t).I was earning €90k&#x2F;year at the time; it wasn&#x27;t a money issue. reply someplaceguy 18 hours agorootparentprev> Yes, but you don’t need a bill for that, you can just get it from the municipality where you are registered.Yeah, that&#x27;s not how it works in all European countries. Which can get really \"interesting\" in some cases, believe me (I&#x27;ve lived through that).I&#x27;ve also been requested proof of employment, which is also interesting when you&#x27;re unemployed. In one of the countries, they said I can just give them proof of unemployment benefits... which I don&#x27;t have, because I left my job willingly.And then they told me: \"well, in that case you can get proof of unemployment from the municipality\". Except... that I&#x27;m not even living in your damn country and the municipality where I live doesn&#x27;t even know whether I&#x27;m working or not (why would they?!).But this does not even compare to all the problems I&#x27;ve had when I&#x27;ve not been living in the same place stably for an extended period of time. It has been an absolute hell in some cases, because institutions (governments, banks, lawyers, etc) simply do not account for this possibility.

No permanent address; they were doing a lot of traveling.Nothing wrong&#x2F;illegal about that. But, by the books, it means they can&#x27;t get a driver&#x27;s license and other important documents.

Proof of address isn&#x27;t a systemic requirement, it&#x27;s a soft credit check that unlocks profitable functions.Many banks (Santander, HSBC just two I checked) have entry points for people who are genuinely homeless.

Count out money and you&#x27;re done.- vendor gets their money immediately, no 5 day hold like there could be on a check or money transfer- reply derfniw 20 hours agorootparentAt least in NL there is no such thing as a 5 day hold on a transfer. Typically these are instant, at worst next business day, and if you use something like \"payment request\" or \"tikkie\" all it involves is sending the buyer a link or posting a QR code somewhere to allow them to send money directly, instantly, to your account.No chance of making errors in the bank nr, you can pre-specify the required amount in the request. No chance of making an error counting out 3K or more in cash notes.Within the NL banking&#x2F;payment landscape I&#x27;d argue that large cash transactions are more bothersome for everyone involved. (well, unless involving a bank is bothersome to either of the parties, but if that is the case we&#x27;re probably entering \"dubious transaction\" or \"dubiously sourced money\" territory..) reply OkayPhysicist 18 hours agorootparent\"Next business day\" is a huge amount of time relative to the \"instantly\" that the value changes hands in a cash transaction. Cash also eliminates any need for prying into the background of the buyer: Their proof of ability to pay and payment itself is the stack of cash they have in their hand.If the government wants to eliminate the requirement of accepting large amounts of cash, I can see that. If you&#x27;re not equipped to handle being paid in a large cash sum, it can definitely be inconvenient.

Paying with a card is much simpler and faster. Take your card, phone or watch and hold it to the terminal for one second and you&#x27;re done. It&#x27;s not normal for payouts to take 5 days.

If not, they usually just send you an invoice. Makes bookkeeping much simpler for the business too.I have only paid in-person using NFC for nearly 10 years in Norway. I understand that the situation is different other places, but I&#x27;m literally not sure what our physical currency looks like now.However, I walked into a store in Spain yesterday that was cash only. Now I have cash in EUR that I not only overpaid insanely for because of the ATM , but I also can&#x27;t use it in Norway. If cash was no longer an option then it would be much simpler and cheaper as my bank does the currency exchange for me.Digital payments are probably better in every way when it&#x27;s the norm, except for privacy, and that&#x27;s a big one. reply tekknik 10 hours agorootparentI don’t know much about Norway, but how would you transact during a natural disaster when power or network services are down for an extended period of time?Centralized digital payments fail here as well. reply throwaway2037 7 hours agorootparentLOL.

Cash doesn&#x27;t have this built in tax.Now I&#x27;ll admit I have no idea bout Norway, so maybe you have some special way to pay with zero transaction fees and have the cash show up instantly with no holds on the payment ever, if so, good for you guys. reply piva00 19 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s done through a SEPA transfer that shouldn&#x27;t take more than 10 minutes to complete, last time I paid a contractor more than 4k€ it was in their account in seconds. reply beej71 19 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s also the fee.

That’s too much money to have on hand when a bank transfer is much more comfortable…still happens rarely though so I think this law is overreaching.Disclosure: I’m not Dutch nor European so my opinion hardly matters here. reply dangus 20 hours agorootparentI think your second sentence&#x2F;paragraph points out exactly why this restriction is needed: the only people who would ever in their right mind transact in that much cash are very likely to be either avoiding taxation (a.k.a. stealing from the common taxpayer), or keeping money off the books to hide illegal activity.The average person isn&#x27;t affected by this type of government surveillance and potential overreach because the average person doesn&#x27;t buy things that are priced at over 3,000 euros per transaction. They can easily hide all their daily transactions from the scrutiny of government and surveillance capitalism just fine.This regulation only impacts the wealthiest people and&#x2F;or the organized criminal. reply Loughla 20 hours agorootparentI purchase, restore, and sometimes sell old woodworking machinery as a side gig to subsidize my own purchase of woodworking equipment for my shop.I have had multiple cash transactions above $3,000 every year that I&#x27;ve done this. Not to avoid taxes, not to keep them off the books, but because one of the parties has either the unwillingness or inability to take electronic payments. Elderly people, those located in rural or otherwise isolated areas, those with a natural distrust of government for whatever reason, or those with a distrust of banks in general.

I transact often over that amount to purchase old woodworking equipment. The people I work with often do not want to transact electronically for multiple reasons. The tax is paid, it&#x27;s on the books, but they want cash.Why should that be limited? reply nolok 20 hours agorootparentBecause a 80&#x2F;20 rule is much better than having to chose between \"everything is controlled\" or \"nothing is controlled\", and that&#x27;s essentially the two choices we have.It works just fine in most of europe since a very long time, and frankly people insisting to be paid in cash and then going out of their way to fully declare the taxes and source of the money is even weirded, why not take the easier shortcut.Of course, maybe it&#x27;s linked to how strange sending money seems to still be in some circumtances in the US ? Reading about Venmo and the likes is just surprising to me, a 10 minutes SEPA wire is free here, and as good as cash. reply systems_glitch 19 hours agorootparentYeah our electronic transfer methods suck. Even between my business and personal accounts, doing a regular bank transfer, it takes several days. Literally faster to withdraw cash and drive it over.Meanwhile, if you have to do a wire transfer for a large sum of money, and the bank screws it up, they have around 30 minutes to recall it before the wire is permanently completed. replythereddaikon 20 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not a european but I do have an example. A few years back I purchased a project car in cash. I don&#x27;t carry checks, who does anymore? And my bank would have given me grief trying to transfer an amount that large at once. I had tried before and it would trigger their fraud detection and give me headaches. Its good its there but can be a barrier when I&#x27;m just trying to buy something. So going to branch and withdrawing the cash was the most convenient option. reply jacobgorm 20 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m in Denmark, and the last car I bought was from a private seller on a Sunday, we met at a coffee shop and settled the (large, cars are expensive here) payment via an instant bank transfer that I initiated from my laptop. The money immediately showed in the seller&#x27;s account and we transferred the title&#x2F;registration via a government online service (which is free of charge).Easy as that, no need for checks or cash. reply tekknik 10 hours agorootparentIn the US, it’s quite possible your bank may not exist tomorrow. This just happened with two banks here. Plus during natural disasters you won’t be able to load up your laptop to transfer money for groceries, or NFC for that matter. These things still need cash. reply frumper 17 hours agorootparentprevNo need for people that understand and trust the systems you used. That doesn&#x27;t mean everyone understands how to do what you said, but they can count cash just fine. reply halfdan 20 hours agorootparentprevThis seems a US centric problem. No one in Europe has carried checks since the 90s and large bank transactions are really a non issue as they resolve within a banking day and for a small fee you can usually do real time transfers too. reply EliRivers 20 hours agorootparentOr for free. One of the reasons Venmo and similar do well in the US but have almost no equivalent (and certainly not at scale) in the UK, for example, is that free, near instant transfer of cash from retail (i.e. ordinary people) bank accounts has been free for years. If I need to pay someone, I need their bank account number and their bank identifying number, and that&#x27;s it; the money will be in their bank within sixty seconds, with no fee. I&#x27;ve told people mine so often to get paid that I&#x27;ve accidentally memorised it.Even some people who historically took cash (such as household tradesmen) now often simply have the money transferred instantly on the doorstep, rather than have to carry cash around in their pockets all day. I imagine a similar story in much of the rest of Europe. reply tekknik 10 hours agorootparentWe’re a few years late but getting this now with FedNow. reply sacado2 19 hours agorootparentprevChecks are still a big thing in France nowadays. reply officeplant 20 hours agorootparentprevIdk about europe, but as an American I would have used a money order for this.

Depositing large cash transactions is monitored as well. If you are staying within the law there is no real way to get around it since hardly any legal employer will pay you in cash.If the banks actually track it or not is another question. Every now and then a report comes out mentioning a banks failure to do so. reply throwaway2037 7 hours agorootparentTo be clear, the ~10k USD cash limit before reporting is standard in all highly advanced countries for global money laundering agreements.

It&#x27;s not that easy to end up under scrutiny for structuring unless you&#x27;re running a cash heavy business without declaring it. Moreover, 99% of the time, the \"scrutiny\" is \"fill out this paperwork\" reply sowbug 15 hours agorootparentI stand by my statement. Are banks required to scrutinize $10K+ transactions? Yes.

GP&#x27;s right that you only have to declare certain things, a completed form can be &#x27;nothing to declare&#x27;, which obviously doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;I am entering nude with no belongings&#x27;. reply badpun 21 hours agorootparentprevI think you can, you just must declare carring the cash if it&#x27;s more than $10k. reply slashdev 21 hours agorootparentWhat happens if you declare it? Could they confiscate it without due process, like the police can in many states? reply adventured 21 hours agorootparentIf you don&#x27;t declare it, it&#x27;s guaranteed to be confiscated until you prove a legitimate purpose for the > $10,000.Federal authorities generally have a higher standard of behavior than local or state police, although obviously not in every instance. If you try to cross the border with $500,000 declared, they may have some questions for you. reply ComputerGuru 20 hours agorootparentI was under the impression if you don’t declare it then there is no legal burden on the government to return it to you, whether you have a reasonable explanation or not. Whereas if you declare it and have a reasonable story&#x2F;sufficient paperwork they can’t&#x2F;shouldn’t take it.The point being that in cases where there is no funny business (at least in your opinion), you are strictly better off declaring it than taking your chances on not doing so. reply mrguyorama 18 hours agorootparent>Whereas if you declare it and have a reasonable story&#x2F;sufficient paperwork they can’t&#x2F;shouldn’t take it.The law in the US is that, the police can take anything they want from you, with zero judicial process needed, slap it into their department&#x27;s slush fund, buy whatever toys they want, or even as someone posted above, MAKE IT PART OF THEIR YEARLY BUDGET PROCESS TO \"EXPECT\" MILLIONS IN STOLEN MONEY, and unless you can AFFIRMATIVELY PROVE in a court of law that you obtained the property through zero criminal or near criminal activity, you will never get it back reply slashdev 20 hours agorootparentprevI feel a lot more comfortable wiring the money or using checks or so on than traveling across a border with that kind of cash. replyxxs 21 hours agoparentprevCash payments over (few) thousands are not permitted in the most&#x2F;many EU member state already. NL are just catching the train. Greece has it as low as 500 Euro. reply euix 20 hours agorootparentI can&#x27;t believe in a lot of these countries this is enforced or obeyed to any degree. The closer the empire is to collapse the stupider the laws. reply xxs 20 hours agorootparentThe laws are there due to anti-money laundering. Since virtually no cash income (in those country) is viable - think salaries, etc., it&#x27;s not hard to be followed. All retail sales need a valid VAT receipt, all of those receipts have source of the payment as well. Wholesale tends to be never in cash (requires tax administration approval), the laws might differ, of course - however that&#x27;s a common framework.So it&#x27;s sort of automatic. reply benterix 21 hours agorootparentprev> Greece has it as low as 500 Euro.Any source for this?[EDIT] As pinted by other commenter:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.europe-consommateurs.eu&#x2F;en&#x2F;shopping-internet&#x2F;cas...They also mention \"There is no cash limit for car purchases.

Some of them are fascinating in their technical depth. reply f1yght 20 hours agorootparentprevCars still kill people at high speed, human bodies haven&#x27;t adapted to get hit by cars better. reply HPsquared 20 hours agorootparentThe cars have adapted to hit people better though, at least for a given size of car. See Euro NCAP pedestrian test. Cars have softer front ends, and they even pop up on impact to give a softer landing for the pedestrian. Also, automatic emergency braking systems. reply willcipriano 18 hours agorootparentAutomatic brakes, driver warning systems, better medicine to treat you if you do get hit. Less alcoholism and drunk driving. Radial tires, led headlamps, automatic windshield wipers, daytime running lights, ABS, airbags, hell I think a lot of cars didn&#x27;t even have seatbelts standard back when some of these were set.Can&#x27;t even get 5 more mph on the highway. reply ilyt 20 hours agorootparentprevThe reflex of people didn&#x27;t got faster so while some could probably use some reasonable bump it&#x27;s not as much as you think. reply mrguyorama 18 hours agorootparentprevNah, physics didn&#x27;t change in the years since, and neither has human reaction time, both things that have a much more significant impact on road safety than modern rubber or brakes. reply lettergram 20 hours agoparen",

CFO Commentary Commentary on the quarter by Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s executive vice president and chief financial officer, is available at https://investor.nvidia.com. Conference Call and Webcast Information NVIDIA will conduct a conference call with analysts and investors to discuss its second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results and current financial prospects today at 2 p.m. Pacific time (5 p.m. Eastern time). A live webcast (listen-only mode) of the conference call will be accessible at NVIDIA’s investor relations website, https://investor.nvidia.com. The webcast will be recorded and available for replay until NVIDIA’s conference call to discuss its financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP Measures To supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude acquisition termination costs, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, IP-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, other, gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

Was super fun there in terms of the project work and the people. If the code still exists, I created the main class that schedules work out to the GPU on Windows.That level of programming gave such rewarding moments in between difficult debugging sessions. When I wanted to test a new kernel driver build I needed to walk into some massive room with all of these interconnected machines that emulated the non-yet-fabricated GPU hardware. One of the full time people on my team was going insane trying to track down a memory corruption issue between GPU memory and main memory when things paged out the entire time I was there.Back then the stock was around $7&#x2F;share and the CEO announced a 10% paycut across the board (even including my intern salary) and had an all hands with everyone in the cafeteria. It&#x27;s pretty cool they went from that vulnerable state, with Intel threatening to build in GPU capabilities, to the powerhouse they are today. reply alanfranz 4 hours agoparent> the CEO announced a 10% paycut across the boardWhich is still better than a 10% layoff, anyway! reply M3L0NM4N 2 hours agorootparentOnly for 10% of the workers. reply bottled_poe 1 hour agorootparentI guess that depends if you want to do 11% more work, and probably the tedious stuff. reply granshaw 6 hours agoparentprevInterned there Summer of 08. Remember mentions of “this CUDA thing” then, that was during its infancy.Midway through, our intern friend group found out one of the smaller buildings had a buffet lunch and started taking the shuttle there often.Saw this tweet just now and that lanyard holder really brought back memories, hasn’t changed at all: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;x.com&#x2F;jimcramer&#x2F;status&#x2F;1694465908234699243?s=46&t=NA... reply 1-6 7 hours agoparentprevDo you still own stock? reply the_svd_doctor 7 hours agorootparentHe probably didn’t get any as an intern. reply enos_feedler 6 hours agorootparentI joined as a new college grad (full time) the same year. I remember the 10% pay cut announcement. I didn&#x27;t get any stock granted to me in the 4 years I was there as a SWE working on CUDA. They had an ESPP you could put 10% of your paycheck into or something like that though. reply srj 6 hours agorootparentprevI vaguely remember that I could participate in the employee purchase program. This was during the financial crisis though and I was an undergrad intern with a paltry ability to invest.Even if I had hit received some great stock award in all likelihood I would have sold it for index funds at my first opportunity. I imagine some of my old coworkers made out quite well though. reply radium3d 7 hours agoparentprevI do wonder though, why has moore&#x27;s law stopped in its tracks? Using CS:GO benchmark, a 1070 got 218 FPS, while a 4090 is at 477 FPS. Only a ~2.2x increase in FPS in 6 years? :( reply dahart 6 hours agorootparentBetween those 2 GPUs, the fp32 perf went up 12.7x according to TechPowerUp’s specs. The SM count went up 8.5x (which represents Moore’s law and note is almost exactly in line with Moore’s prediction), and the clock rate went up 1.5x. The FPS of CSGO (or any game) is not a good measure of Moore’s law. Games have all kinds of complexities and caveats that will prevent them from scaling linearly. I used to write some of those bottlenecks :P What are the 2080 and 3080 datapoints for CSGO? Did it approach 400-500 fps on the 2080 and never get any faster after that? reply radium3d 4 hours agorootparentWow, didn&#x27;t expect to get so many comments. It&#x27;s just interesting to me that we have 500hz monitors, yet games are still coming out that only run at ~70 fps on a 3080, etc. I used CS:GO as a comparison just because it was an example capable of coming near 500 FPS. Avg FPS are not going up fast enough in my opinion. I understand some games purposefully limit FPS for physics calculations, but there are many that do not. reply KronisLV 2 hours agorootparent> Avg FPS are not going up fast enough in my opinion.I&#x27;ve never had hardware to run above 1080p at 60fps (monitors, GPUs), so my desires are a bit orthogonal - I wish more games let you customize the graphics settings so that you could maintain a consistent framerate (be it 30 on a low spec laptop, 60 on a regular PC or more fps) at a resolution of your choice.Things like switching between baked or dynamic shadows, their type&#x2F;filtering, things like ambient occlusion and tessellation, various post processing effects and filters, model LOD limits and texture resoltion, resolution scaling and so on.More so, it would actually be nice if games let you download a version with lower fidelity assets (like War Thunder sort of does, for example), so you don&#x27;t need 100 GB of models and textures if you&#x27;re realistically only ever going to see 20 GB of those on your hardware.Thankfully, most modern game engines scale both up and down decently, for example, Unity&#x27;s URP (though historically a bit half baked and fragmented the community&#x2F;assets). It&#x27;s just up to the developers to get over the hubris of wanting \"low\" settings to still be pretty, that choice should be up to the user. reply Cloudef 2 hours agorootparentprevAlso note that FPS is non-linear value, you want to compare frame times instead. reply AnotherGoodName 6 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s because single thread perf of CPUs hasn&#x27;t progressed and ~500fps is where CPUs cap out on that game still to this day. GPUs are doing fine. reply teaearlgraycold 6 hours agorootparentFor anyone that doesn&#x27;t understand why this matters, the CPU still needs to prepare the full scene before sending it over to the GPU for polygons to get rasterized and shaders to get calculated. Most of the time the CPU does all of the physics as well. So even if GPU render time goes to 0ms, 2ms spent by the CPU per frame means 500fps is the best you&#x27;ll get without a better CPU or better code. And I suspect game devs aren&#x27;t looking to shrink their budgeted CPU time just so someone benchmarking can see 1000fps. reply izacus 3 hours agorootparentCS:GO also doesn&#x27;t use any of the new approaches that reduce CPU time in those operations and more effectively saturate the GPU. Compare CS:GO against Doom:Eternal, which runs at high fps while providing massive improvements to visuals. reply devnullbrain 37 minutes agorootparentprevMoore&#x27;s law is about transistors, not CS:GO. CS:GO benchmarks stopped advancing as quickly because Moore&#x27;s law is - objectively, despite the protestations of semiconductor companies - dead. reply HWR_14 7 hours agorootparentprevAt low frame rates, the GPU is (usuallly) the bottleneck most of them time. At very high frame rates, there are other more significant bottlenecks.A much better benchmark would be to take a game designed for 120 or fewer FPS on a 4090 and try it on a 1070. reply ATMLOTTOBEER 7 hours agorootparentprevFps in CSGO isn’t really so dependent on the GPU as more modern games, so comparing with a different game might be more accurate. reply radium3d 4 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m curious, do you know of a study that has proven that single core CPU or other is the bottleneck in CS:GO? reply user_7832 54 minutes agorootparentActually kinda yes, look at AMD’s 3d v cache. There’s a very recent review by the verge on an Asia laptop with the AMD chip, and it does hit like 600-700 fps. CPUs can absolutely make such a difference. reply AaronFriel 3 hours agorootparentprevThis is essentially folk wisdom - but I think you can trust the other people in this thread that it&#x27;s accurate. I doubt anyone has done a scientific study on this, but you could see this for yourself by setting your computer&#x27;s clock rate lower and re-running the benchmark.I expect that if you have a 4090, you have an Intel or AMD CPU that exposes a core clock multiplier. You could run this benchmark with whatever value it&#x27;s at, then reduce the modifier by say, half. That should halve your CPU&#x27;s clock rate, and I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll see the frame rate decline similarly. You can conclude that the game is \"CPU bound\", then.Even if your GPU was infinitely fast, you have to remember that game developers are not optimizing for the game event loop to run in sub-millisecond times. If the core loop in the game takes under 16ms to run on a common CPU, such as one in a console: that&#x27;s better than 60hz and the overwhelming majority of video game players will never see a benefit.Some game developers, I see someone in another thread mentioned Doom Eternal, pride themselves on that optimization. With a fast enough CPU and GPU, you could probably reach 1000 FPS on Doom Eternal. A quick search suggests this might have been accomplished with a liquid cooled, this was done with a liquid nitrogen cooled PC with a 6.6GHz CPU: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamer.com&#x2F;heres-doom-eternal-running-at-1000-f... reply fragmede 7 hours agorootparentprevGS:go aside, the 1070 is said to do 6.5 TFlops to the 4090&#x27;s 1,321 TFlops, for a 203x improvement in 6 years. Not bad! reply bexsella 7 hours agorootparentprevFPS of one specific game isn&#x27;t a great indicator of GPU grunt. reply transcriptase 7 hours agorootparentprevAdmittedly knowing nothing, I’m going to assume that a great deal of the advantages of the latest generation aren’t going to improve performance in a decade old game since the engine won’t touch them.How does a 1070 fare versus a 4090 in Hogwarts Legacy or another modern game at 1440 or 4K? reply spoonjim 6 hours agorootparentprevPhysics stopped Moore’s law reply newZWhoDis 6 hours agorootparentprevI’m more worried about how human development has seemingly stopped in its tracks, backtracking more like it reply Mechanical9 7 hours agorootparentprevMy guess is that we&#x27;ve reached a peak in the amount of new investment that can be made annually, based on tech nearing total proliferation throughout society. The tech can sort of only advance as fast as tech companies can grow, and they can&#x27;t grow exponentially after they account for some percentage of the global workforce.My guess is that we&#x27;ll see improvements at closer to the current rate rather than at an increasing rate. reply TheAlchemist 12 hours agoprevWhat&#x27;s also pretty interesting that they actually didn&#x27;t sell more chips this quarter - they ... just pretty much doubled the prices (hence the huge margin).This is what having a monopoly looks like !This is also why companies that manufacture their cards didn&#x27;t report any uptick in profits. I&#x27;m wondering how this play out in some months ? Do they have any pricing power with respect to NVidia ? Or NVidia could just switch to another manufacturer ? reply PheonixPharts 11 hours agoparent> This is what having a monopoly looks like !As someone who has been in the AI&#x2F;ML space for over a decade, and even had an AMD&#x2F;Radeon card for more than half of that, I can&#x27;t help but feel that this is partially AMD&#x27;s own fault.For many, many years it seemed to me that AMD just didn&#x27;t take AI&#x2F;ML seriously whereas, for all it&#x27;s faults, NVIDIA seemed to catch on very early that ML presented a tremendous potential market.To this day getting things like Stable Diffusion to run on an AMD card requires extra work. At least from my perspective it seems like dedicating a few engineers to getting ROCm working on all major OSes with all major scientific computing&#x2F;deep learning libraries would have been a pretty good investment.Is there some context I&#x27;m missing for why AMD never caught up in this space? reply xiphias2 7 minutes agorootparentLook at the good thing instead: they are catching up, and open source devs are starting to be serious about AMD because of its price&#x2F;performance.I believe it&#x27;s a highly undervalued stock right now. reply ken47 11 hours agorootparentprevUntil very recently, AMD was struggling for survival. Rather than making the big bet on AI, they went for the sure thing by banking on revolutionary CPU tech. I&#x27;m sure if they were in a better financial position 5 years ago, they would have gone bigger on AI. reply xmprt 11 hours agorootparentAnd arguable their bet on CPU tech worked! AMD is in a much better position today than they were 5+ years ago. They have some catching up to do but that doesn&#x27;t mean their completely out of the game. reply xcdzvyn 2 hours agorootparent\"much better\" is an understatement! \"AMD predicted to go bankrupt by 2020\"[0][0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.overclock3d.net&#x2F;news&#x2F;cpu_mainboard&#x2F;amd_predicted... reply izacus 3 hours agorootparentprevThey also focused on game consoles, where they won contracts for both major platforms this generation. reply zirgs 3 hours agorootparentThe other non-major Nvidia based console has higher sales numbers than both of so-called major consoles combined. reply mschuster91 3 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s ... difficult to compare a low-power SoC released in 2015 (so, design dating back to 2014 if not earlier) with high-power consoles developed in 2019 onwards. reply zirgs 2 hours agorootparentThey belong to the same generation. Until Switch 2 is released. reply asddubs 30 minutes agorootparentThat doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re meaningfully comparable (in the context we are talking about). A $100 budget android phone that was released at the same time as the latest iphone also belongs to the same generation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the chip manufacturers profit equally from the two (of course apple makes their own chips so in a literal sense this comparison doesn&#x27;t make sense, but I&#x27;m sure you understand what I mean)And I don&#x27;t mean to disparage the switch, just point out that the way it&#x27;s designed is very different which makes the comparison questionable reply Toutouxc 3 hours agorootparentprevPrevious one too. Xbox One and Series and PS4 and PS5 are all AMD, and there’s several revisions of each (e.g. PS4 OG, Slim, Pro). reply uluyol 9 hours agorootparentprevCatching up in this space requires a significant, sustained investment over multiple years and competent software engineers. It&#x27;s not a simple thing for a hardware company to suddenly become competitive with Nvidia in AI&#x2F;ML.Instead, they&#x27;ve been going after the CPU market (and winning), HPC&#x2F;scientific computing (high FP64 performance, in contrast to Nvidia&#x27;s focus on low-precision ML compute), and integrating Xilinx.However, I agree that it&#x27;s an unfortunate situation, and I hope AMD becomes competitive in this space soon. reply slashdev 8 hours agorootparentI think their hardware is comparable with nvidia. The problem is the software is awful by comparison. It’s hard to run any of the AI workloads with AMD, and even when you can the performance is poor. The software investment just hasn’t been made. Until then they are not even in the game. reply edgyquant 11 hours agorootparentprev100% this. I, and many others, bought multiple AMD cards due to disliking NVidia and tried to get ROCm set up to no avail. It just never worked except under hard to maintain configurations. I switched to an nvidia card and within the hour import tensorflow just worked reply fleischhauf 10 hours agorootparentto be fair Nvidia drivers are also a nightmare under linux reply jacooper 3 hours agorootparentNot anymore reply michaelt 21 minutes agorootparentEh, depends what you want out of them.Do you want solid dependability and settings that are right first time, because you&#x27;ve only got one PC and if the graphics get broken you&#x27;ve got no browser to google for a fix?Do you want the absolute most up-to-date drivers, to support the very newest GPUs, while running an LTS version of your OS?Do you want to always run the latest driver version and upgrade without testing or worrying, like we do for web browsers?Do you want to run CUDA and ML stuff, but also want to run Steam which for some reason wants 32-bit support available?Do you want to run on a laptop with hybrid graphics, and have suspend&#x2F;resume work reliably every time?Do you have a small &#x2F;boot&#x2F; partition, because you expected initrd.img to be 50MB or less?Do you want to support Secure Boot?If you want to achieve all these things at once, it&#x27;ll take you a few tries to get it right :) reply kristopolous 3 hours agorootparentprevUntil they are. When the system breaks it breaks real bad. Nvcc&#x2F;gcc&#x2F;cuda&#x2F;kernel mismatches are a pain to match up right. It gets gnarly super fast.All systems hit snags. In most, you skid the tires a bit, maybe lose balance. With nvidia you&#x27;re flying over the handlebars on to the asphalt.I got snagged by this just about 2 weeks ago. It gets nasty. Not as bad as CUPS, but probably #2. reply tho23iu423o4324 9 hours agorootparentprevYes, this is true.However, a lot of this has to do with the fact that AMD was on the brink of bankruptcy before the launch of Zen in 2016 (when their share price was ~$10). They simply did not have the capital to the kind of things Nvidia was doing (since &#x27;08 ?).The bet on OpenCL and the &#x27;open-source&#x27; community failed. However, ROCM&#x2F;HIP etc. really seems to be catching up (I even see them packaged on Arch linux). reply slavik81 2 hours agorootparent> However, ROCM&#x2F;HIP etc. really seems to be catching up (I even see them packaged on Arch linux).There are now distro-provided packages on Arch, Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora. reply Dalewyn 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat really strikes me is Nvidia&#x27;s been working hard on doing practical work on their GPUs even just 10~15 years ago with PhysX, while both Intel and AMD just existed.Nvidia&#x27;s dominance today is the product of at least over a decade of work and investments to make better products. Today they are finally reaping their rewards. reply desiarnezjr 11 hours agorootparentI remember meeting NVIDIA in the late aughts (2007?) first launching their CUDA efforts. Really the product was a re-branded 780GTX or whatever their high end gaming card was at the time more or less, but they already laid out a clear pathway to today (more or less). reply dekhn 10 hours agorootparentI remember meeting with them in the mid aughts when they were first talking to HPC folks about using their cards for science. I&#x27;ll never forget what the chief scientist from nVidia said. \"What is the color of a NaN? That is, when you render a texture with a nan value, what does it look like? I&#x27;ll tell: it&#x27;s nvidia green.\" reply WanderPanda 10 hours agorootparentThat is a funny way to signal their commitment to HPC! But compared to other tooling (non GPU) CUDA is still really clunky. Way ahead of everything else in the GPGPU space but still surprisingly clunky. Also I don&#x27;t get what they are fearing with all their \"Account required for download\" (e.g. for CuDNN) what are they fearing? And is it really worth the trade-off for the pain it causes for dev environments and CI pipelines? It really seems like Intel and AMD have to step in to break this monopoly to force them to improve the situation for everyone. reply jjoonathan 10 hours agorootparentNo, you&#x27;re not missing anything, NVIDIA&#x27;s software is super clunky by the standards of most of the software world. However, for the last decade, the competition has been much worse: OpenCL development on AMD would be riddled with VRAM leaks, hard lockups, invisible limits on things like function length and registers that would cause the hard lockups when you tripped over them without any indication as to what you did wrong or how to fix it, that sort of thing. Cryptic error messages would lead to threads scattered around the internet, years old, with pleas for help and no happy endings.The thing that caused me to ragequit the AMD ecosystem was when I took an OpenCL program I had been fighting for two days straight and ran it on my buddy&#x27;s Nvidia system in hopes of getting an error message that might point me in the right direction. Instead, the program just ran, and it ran much faster, even though the nvidia card was theoretically slower.In terms of quality, I expect the competition to catch up in a generation or two, but then there is still the decade+ of legacy code to consider. Hopefully with how fast AI&#x2F;ML churns that isn&#x27;t actually an insurmountable obstacle. reply versteegen 11 minutes agorootparentYears ago I gave up on OpenCL (1.2 on an AMD card) because of those hard lockups, with no way to debug it. nVidia didn&#x27;t even support OpenCL 1.2 (and IIRC didn&#x27;t support the synchronisation primitives I wanted in CUDA either -- AMD was more capable on paper). Thanks, I feel better to hear just how bad it was -- so it wasn&#x27;t just my fault for quitting. hinoki 3 hours agorootparentprev32-bit NaN is encoded: s111 1111 1xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxWhere both the sign (s) and the x bits can be anything and it will still be treated as a NaN.There are lots of ways to encode colour, but there would be too much red with RGBA, and ARGB could be almost any opaque colour, but the red channel has to be at least 0x80, which is still too much red.So NaNs are too red to encode nvidia green. reply andersa 3 hours agorootparentI once ended up having nans get interpreted as 32 bit colors accidentally, and it made everything red and white, like Christmas decoration.Wonder what caused the difference in the latter bits being all 1 or 0 together. reply jjoonathan 10 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a quality meme but I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out the settings that make it work. It looks like RGBA8 would be blue: >>> struct.pack(&#x27;f&#x27;,math.nan) b&#x27;\\x00\\x00\\xc0\\x7f&#x27;maybe that becomes green if you composite over white or something? Or maybe there is a common type of NaN that fills some of the unspecified bits? (\"Just use the particular NaN that makes it green\" is cheating unless you have an excuse) reply nealabq 9 hours agorootparentThey mean big-endian NaN, taking only the first 3 bytes.

They’re right.

At some point, they own the entire market - or enough that they functionally control it, and start leveraging this position. I&#x27;d argue we&#x27;re seeing this from Nvidia right now.People talk about AMD being competition - but from most stats I&#x27;ve seen, they&#x27;re ~10% of dGPU sales, with Nvidia being the other 90% (with new Intel offerings being pretty much noise now). That means that if they invest the same proportion into development, NVidia nearly have 10x the resources.It may be that tech companies like this would \"naturally\" form a monopoly without outside (IE government) interference, as the only reason that multiplier of development resources doesn&#x27;t completely crush new entrants is rather extreme mismanagement, or a new segment is created where the design resource don&#x27;t really cross over that much.I don&#x27;t see anything like that happening in the short term, if anything there seems to be more opportunity for cross pollination of development within these corporations, as there&#x27;s a fair bit of design similarities between various silicon (GPUs, CPUs, accelerators for the current ML techniques etc.) that may encourage more consolidation in the whole semi market to take advantage of that, not less. But again the only thing stepping in the way of that seems to be governments trying to keep national interests, like the blocking of NVidia buying ARM to pull in one of the big CPU players. Plus all their other IP that they may benefit from, like low power GPU designs or other accelerators ARM have designed. reply tm-guimaraes 2 hours agorootparentAt the end of the day, what nvidia does is just producing IP. All manufacture is by other companies.This means that nvidia capital is spend on testing&#x2F;development infrastructure and creative labor.So, you don’t need monopoly breaking to handle nvidia if it keeps growing, but instead rethink IP laws.Testing infrastructure is less capital investment than production manufacture. (See ASML and TSMC beeing booked), and humans can be persuaded to work elsewhere.This means Nvidia cannot fall a sleep, even if they keep snowballing. In a few years a rival can always arrive, or current ones snag key people or have dev&#x2F;test infra breakthrough, or IP law could change as its critics rise every year.Sure, if Nvidia keeps its good game it will keep on growing and get even bigger share, but if it doesn’t, it will happen what happened with intel, intel got greedy on its position, and the company got fat.As long as nvidia keeps its game, it’ll be good for customers even if they swallow more market share, as prices are always limited by the value business customers get from AI, and the investment needed for a competitor is not even close to infrastructure or resource extraction stuff like high end chip fabs, oil extraction, energy grids, telecom grids.Again, Nvidia does not produce any physical goods, only designs. reply creer 11 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s not like designing this kind of product is easy; or that Nvidia&#x27;s designers are sitting idle; or that everybody else&#x27;s design team is not busy building something else. There are in fact many competent design teams, chipping at their own business.There are in fact startups, also doing what they can (and probably not trying to go head on against the most productive competitor they can find.) And it has been reported countless times that some of the biggest customers of Nvidia are actually trying to design their own.If you want to point out a market with broken competition, this isn&#x27;t it. reply fulafel 7 hours agorootparentprevTo play the free market advocate:The situation is created by artificial restrictions on free market (namely state enforced monopolies on \"IPR\", or as some call it, imaginary property). reply sph 11 hours agorootparentprevAre they motivated? Seems like a massive coincidence how the big two of the GPU world are cousins, and one has been having massive success on the CPU, the other on GPU&#x2F;AI, and every attempt from both side to enter the other&#x27;s niche has been pretty weak.AMD compute is nowhere compared to NVIDIA. NVIDIA wanted to buy ARM, has got its finger in RISC-V, but apart from that, they don&#x27;t really care. To be fair AMD has done decent with GPUs, but never enough to dethrone NVIDIA, whose playbook for the past few gens is \"just make everything bigger than last gen and increase the frequency.\" Surely AMD could have chosen the same lazy approach to surpass the 4090 only just, but instead they didn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s still NV undefeated in its space because AMD forgot to squeeze the last 1% out of their card.The market is powerless if the competitors aren&#x27;t really competing. Intel is the only chance, unless they manage to get their own Taiwanese CEO somehow related to Huang and Su. reply AlotOfReading 9 hours agorootparentLeaving aside the weird conspiracy stuff, I don&#x27;t know how you can see stuff like the nvlink C2C that makes Grace Hopper possible and think they went \"just make everything bigger\". reply tzhenghao 12 hours agoparentprev> motivate everyone (Intel, AMD, ARM, Google, etc.) to try and tackle the problem by making new chipsYes, there has been repeated efforts to chip at Nvidia&#x27;s market share, but there&#x27;s also a graveyard full of AI accelerator companies that fail to find product market fit due to lack of software toolchain support - and that applies even for older Nvidia GPUs and their compatible toolchains, let alone other players like AMD.

There&#x27;s far less margin for error when you get a hardware design wrong. Correcting a Python software mistake is orders of magnitude easier and cheaper to resolve, it doesn&#x27;t cost multiple billions and take 6 months to iterate.

To get acceptable performance you need to use ROCm, which is Linux only. There was some Windows release of ROCm few weeks ago, but I am not sure how usable it is and none of the libraries have picked up on it yet.Even with a Linux installed, most frameworks still assume CUDA and it&#x27;s an effort to get them to use ROCm. For some tools all it takes is uninstalling PyTorch or Tensorflow and installing a special ROCm enabled version of those libraries. Sometimes it will be enough, sometimes it wasn&#x27;t. Sometimes the project uses some auxiliary library like bitsandbytes which doesn&#x27;t have an official ROCm fork, so you have to use unofficial ones (that you have to compile manually and Makefiles quickly get out of date). Which once again, may work or may not.I have things set up for stable diffusion and text generation (oobabooga), and things mostly work, but sometimes they still don&#x27;t. For example I can train stable diffusion embeddings and dreambooth checkpoints, but for some reason it crashes when I attempt to train a LORA. And I don&#x27;t have enough expertise to debug it myself.For things like video encoding most tools also assume CUDA will be present so you&#x27;re stuck with CPU encoding which takes forever. If you&#x27;re lucky, some tools may have a DirectML backend, which kinda works under Windows for AMD, but it&#x27;s performance is usually far behind a ROCm implementation. reply paulmd 2 hours agorootparentVideo encoding doesn’t use CUDA but rather NVENC.However AMD is still as terrible at H264 as ever, and their AV1 encoder also has a hardware defect they’ve patched by forcing it to round up to 16 line multiples, so it is incapable of encoding a 1080p video and instead outputs 1082p that won’t be ingested properly when streaming.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;freedesktop.org&#x2F;mesa&#x2F;mesa&#x2F;-&#x2F;issues&#x2F;9185#note_1954937Also the AV1 quality is not as good as intel+nvidia even with resolutions that aren’t glitched. AMD seemingly went big on HEVC (supposedly because of stadia?) but everything else is a mess.And most places won’t touch HEVC because of the licensing costs. Microsoft makes it a windows store plugin you have to buy separately etc. somewhat odd that google picked HEVC for stadia but I guess those customers are actually directly paying you vs YouTube being a minus on their balance sheet (at least until recently possibly) reply smoldesu 13 hours agorootparentprevNvidia has a small lead on the industry in a few places, adding up to super attractive backend hardware options. They aren&#x27;t invincible, but they profit off the hostility between their competitors. Until those companies gang up to fund an open alternative, it&#x27;s open season for Nvidia and HPC customers.The recent Stable Diffusion results are great news, but also don&#x27;t include comparisons to an Nvidia card using the same optimizations. Nvidia claims that Microsoft Olive doubles performance on their cards too, so it might be a bit of a wash: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.nvidia.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2023&#x2F;05&#x2F;23&#x2F;microsoft-build-nvi...Plus, none of those optimizations were any more open than CUDA (since it used DirectML).> crunching 4&#x2F;8&#x2F;16 bit width numbers is no rocket science.Of course not.

The corollary is you&#x27;re betting that \"customer demand\" for ever-improving GPUs is climbing an incredibly upwards, secular (read: permanent, non-cyclical) trajectory, such that it outpaces the assumptions of these already-lofty expectations.I think betray my own opinion, but the price is what it is. :) reply saberience 50 minutes agorootparentSo you think demand for AI driven software and tools is going to stop growing over the next few years?

No. Is it the best investment you can find? That&#x27;s harder to tell which is why the complaint of \"very high valuation already\". It&#x27;s not in doubt that it&#x27;s a great business. It&#x27;s less easy to decide whether it&#x27;s a great investment to get in right now.But everything is relative a PE around 40-60 is NOT historically crazy high for the verge of a giant new market. And yet it is very high for a trillion dollar market cap. This is exciting: a trillion dollar market cap at the verge of a giant new market! reply squeaky-clean 14 hours agoparentprevIt&#x27;s pretty overpriced already if you&#x27;re looking at the fundamentals, and has been for a while. But fundamentals haven&#x27;t really mattered in tech stocks for a long time.If you want the responsible advice, it&#x27;s overpriced. If you want my personal advice, well I bought more yesterday afternoon. reply what_ever 11 hours agorootparentCan you add a little more color on what fundamentals is it overpriced? Have you looked at their QoQ growth (not even YoY) for last few quarters? I would say the stock price is just trying to keep up with the numbers they are putting out. reply ripper1138 10 hours agorootparentTheir quarterly dividend is only $0.04 per share, total assets at 50B (vs 350B+ for other 1T companies), they cannot easily sell more chips and increasing price can only go so far. reply AnotherGoodName 10 hours agorootparentA lot of stocks don&#x27;t pay dividends at all. They are problematic with tax and theoretically the same benefit can be achieved with buybacks. reply AnotherGoodName 10 hours agorootparentprevI don&#x27;t see it. It would have been overpriced if not for this insane report. 854% YoY earnings growth. A PE that&#x27;s now below 50 (even taking into account the $500 share price).Its not overpriced anymore. In fact if there&#x27;s anything left in the tank or this is at all sustained it&#x27;s cheap. reply mikeweiss 14 hours agoparentprevIn my opinion it&#x27;s likely mostly pull forward demand. Companies are racing to buy as many chips as possible and hoard them.I already saw a few posts here on HN from companies that threw down insane amounts of $$ on H100s and are now looking to rent out their excess capacity. I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll be seeing a lot more posts like that soon. reply mortehu 4 hours agorootparentLooking to rent out, or fully booked for the next year and looking to buy more GPUs? reply epolanski 13 hours agoparentprevThis incredible growth was already priced in at 250$.Now it&#x27;s just crazy. reply tmn 14 hours agoparentprevValuation fundamentals don&#x27;t justify current prices. That said it could easily go higher (much higher).

It&#x27;s printing money from an industry that is only starting. This isn&#x27;t crypto nonsense. reply fnordpiglet 14 hours agorootparentYeah, every company of any note is planning how to use AI, and a lot of the use cases are already proved out. This isn’t speculative nonsense. The question is how big does it get, not will it be big.Crypto and blockchain never had an actual proved out use case. There was an interesting idea but no one ever could figure out a way it was useful. The costs associated were much higher than the risks of not using it.People who think this is a meme aren’t paying attention, and they’re certainly not in the rooms of power where AI planning is happening at megacorps. I’ve been in them, and it’s serious and material and we are just now beginning to scratch the surface. reply reilly3000 8 hours agorootparentI’m saying all of that growth has been priced in for multiple years now. It’s likely to have very solid fundamentals and new relationships in enterprises everywhere for years to come. As such it’s ripe for overvaluation by both retail and institutional traders. If I had a horse in this race I would ride the wave for a while as others piled on, then take a nice honest profit before one of their many competitors turns in a healthy AI driven quarter like this. It will still be a strong stock, but expect some significant flux in a correction. reply kelvie 13 hours agorootparentprev(Not sure if it&#x27;s true), but a meme stock is one whose price is propped up by retail traders, and spreads through social media &#x2F; word-of-mouth, as memes do.How we prove it&#x27;s one is probably another matter. reply pb7 12 hours agorootparentRetail investors make up a low single digit percent of individual stock ownership. &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets is not putting even a dent in a $1T company&#x27;s stock price. reply rvz 14 hours agoparentprev> The aftermarket trading is up over 8% as of right now, roughly $41 USD to approximately $513 a share. Insane.8% is close to nothing in stocks. Biotech stocks go up and down more than that without earnings announcements.> Anyone who is a lot more versed in company valuation methodology see this as being near peak value, or does Nvidia have a lot more room to run?As long as fine-tuning, training or even using these models are inefficient and no other efficient alternatives to that without these GPUs, then Nvidia will remain unchallenged unless that changes.EDIT: It is true like it or not AI bros. There are too many to list. For example, just yesterday:Fulcrum Therapeutics, Inc.

By any standard industry measure, Nvidia stock is highly volatile and it can be seen mathematically by just looking at the IV over time. reply rvz 13 hours agorootparentprevExactly.Nvidia is just one of many lottery tickets and 8% in one day is hardly volatile in stocks. reply saberience 41 minutes agorootparentVolatility in stocks is measured in terms of “IV” (implied volatility) and Nvidia (and Tesla) have some of the highest IV in the stock market which is why they are so interesting for people trading in options making money from theta decay.Also I would add, volatility measures continued volatility over periods of time, not single days. Most pharma stocks are essentially static for months or years until they announce one good result and the stock jumps 30% in a day. This doesnt mean they are volatile stocks, compare Gileads IV to Tesla for example. reply mthoms 7 hours agorootparentprevThe point is that 8% is volatile relative to the market cap. That&#x27;s a massive amount of (paper) wealth being created. reply94 more comments... GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originLink": "https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v0.8.0",
    "originBody": "Docs Guides Blog Bun v0.8.0 Colin McDonnell · August 24, 2023 Bun v0.8.0 adds debugger support, implements fetch streaming, and unblocks SvelteKit. ReadStream and WriteStream from node:tty are implemented, and .setRawMode() now works on process.stdin, unblocking several interactive CLI tools. Plus Node.js compatibility updates, bug fixes, stability improvements. Bun 1.0 is coming on September 7th! Register for the launch stream at https://bun.sh/1.0. Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. We've been releasing a lot of changes to Bun recently. Here's a recap of the last few releases. In case you missed it: v0.7.0 - Web Workers, --smol, structuredClone(), WebSocket reliability improvements, node:tls fixes, and more. v0.7.1 - ES Modules load 30-250% faster, fs.watch fixes, and lots of node:fs compatibility improvements. v0.7.2 - Implements node:worker_threads, node:diagnostics_channel, and BroadcastChannel. v0.7.3 - Coverage reporting in bun test, plus test filtering with bun test -t. To install Bun: curl npm brew docker curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/installbash To upgrade Bun: bun upgrade Debugger support Bun now implements debugger support via WebKit's Inspector Protocol. To use it, run your file or script with the --inspect flag. Consider the following simple HTTP server. server.ts const server = Bun.serve({ fetch(req){ console.log(req.url); return new Response(\"Hello world!\"); } }); console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port}`); When we run this file with --inspect, it starts our HTTP server and spins up a localhost WebSocket server on an unused port. This WebSocket server uses the Inspector Protocol to communicate with debugging tools, which can introspect and control the running bun process. bun --inspect server.ts Listening on http://localhost:3000 ------------------ Bun Inspector ------------------ Listening at: ws://localhost:6499/0tqxs9exrgrm Inspect in browser: https://debug.bun.sh/#localhost:6499/0tqxs9exrgrm ------------------ Bun Inspector ------------------ Using debug.bun.sh The --inspect flag will also print a https://debug.bun.sh# URL to the console. This domain debug.bun.sh hosts a stripped-down version of Safari Developer Tools designed for debugging Bun. Open the link in your preferred browser and a new debugging session will start automatically. Bun Developer Tools at debug.bun.sh From the web debugger, you can inspect the currently running code and set breakpoints. Once a breakpoint is triggered, you can: View all variables in scope Execute code in the console, with full access to in-scope variables and Bun APIs Step through your code step-by-step Read the Debug Bun with the web debugger guide for more complete documentation. bun update The new bun update command will update all project dependencies to the latest versions that are compatible with the semver ranges in your package.json. bun update To update a particular dependency: bun update zod Note — Unlike npm, the bun upgrade command is reserved for upgrading Bun itself. It is not an alias for bun update. Thanks to @alexlamsl for implementing this feature. SvelteKit support Improved support for environment variables in Worker has unblocked SvelteKit. Scaffold your project with create-svelte. bunx create-svelte my-app create-svelte version 5.0.5 ┌ Welcome to SvelteKit! │ ◇ Which Svelte app template? │ SvelteKit demo app │ ◇ Add type checking with TypeScript? │ Yes, using TypeScript syntax │ ◇ Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar) │ none │ └ Your project is ready! ✔ Typescript Inside Svelte components, useInstall community-maintained integrations: https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add To install dependencies and start the dev server: cd my-app bun install bun run dev -- --open Open localhost:3000 to see the demo SvelteKit app in action. A SvelteKit app running on Bun Support for Nuxt (nuxt dev) With improved node:tty and node:fs support, the Nuxt development server now works with the Bun runtime. To get started, use the nuxi command-line tool. bunx --bun nuxi init my-app cd my-app bun install Once dependencies are installed, start the development server with the \"dev\" package.json script. bun --bun run dev $ nuxt dev Nuxt 3.6.5 with Nitro 2.5.2 > Local: http://localhost:3000/ > Network: http://192.168.0.21:3000/ > Network: http://[fd8a:d31d:481c:4883:1c64:3d90:9f83:d8a2]:3000/ ✔ Nuxt DevTools is enabled v0.8.0 (experimental) ℹ Vite client warmed up in 547ms ✔ Nitro built in 244 ms The --bun flag ensures the server is using the Bun runtime instead of Node.js. By default the nuxt CLI uses Node.js. Then visit http://localhost:3000 to see the default Nuxt welcome screen. Nuxt app running on Bun Note — There are still some issues with Nuxt's build command. When doing a production build, use bun run build instead of bun --bun run build. This will use Node.js to run Nuxt's build pipeline. Track this issue here. Refer to the Building an app with Nuxt and Bun for a more complete walkthrough. Fetch response body streaming Bun now implements fetch() response body streaming, thanks to @cirospaciari. This means that you can now stream data from a fetch response, instead of waiting for the entire response to be downloaded. const res = await fetch(\"https://example.com/bigfile.txt\"); // read the response chunk-by-chunk! for await (const chunk of res.body) { console.log(chunk); } Use OpenAI in Bun Streaming is especially useful when working with APIs that take awhile to respond. Now you can stream responses from OpenAI's API in Bun. import OpenAI from \"openai\"; const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: \"my api key\", }); const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({ model: \"gpt-4\", messages: [{ role: \"user\", content: \"Say this is a test\" }], stream: true, }); for await (const part of stream) { process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || \"\"); } Bun.serve() streaming improvements Previously, the following would buffer the response body, meaning it would only send the response once the entire body had been generated. import { serve, sleep } from \"bun\"; serve({ fetch(req) { return new Response( new ReadableStream({ async pull(controller) { for (let i = 0; i{ test(`returns ${expected}`, () => { expect(a + b).toBe(expected); }); }); .toSatisfy() and .toIncludeRepeated() Thanks to @TiranexDev, bun test now supports additional matchers. These matchers are part of jest-extended and are now natively supported by bun test. Sample usage of .toSatisfy(): const isOdd = (value: number) => value % 2 !== 0; it(\"toSatisfy\", () => { expect(1).toSatisfy(isOdd); expect(2).not.toSatisfy(isOdd); }); Sample usage of .toIncludeRepeated(): test(\"toIncludeRepeated\", () => { // check if string contains substring exactly 2 times expect(\"hello hello\").toIncludeRepeated(\"hello\", 2); // works with .not expect(\"hello hello world\").not.toIncludeRepeated(\"hello\", 1); }); 40x faster buffer.toString(\"hex\") The Node.js Buffer.toString(\"hex\") function gets optimized with SIMD, leading to 40x faster performance. Bun.inspect.custom Objects can now be augmented with custom formatters using the Bun.inspect.custom symbol. For compatibility reasons, util.inspect.custom from Node.js's node:util works too. class Password { value: string; constructor(value: string) { this.value = value; } [Bun.inspect.custom]() { return \"Password \"; } } const p = new Password(\"secret\"); console.log(p); // => \"Password \" Global File constructor The File constructor has been added as a new global. File instances can be constructed. const file = new File([\"hello world\"], \"hello.txt\", { type: \"text/plain\", lastModified: Date.now() - 1000, }); file.size; // 11 file.name; // \"hello.txt\" file.type; // \"text/plain\" file.lastModified; // 1693597759310573 Accordingly, Crash in Buffer-related functions fixed A JIT crash in Buffer-related functions has been fixed. This crash was caused by incorrect side effects when passed to DOMJIT which led to a crash during type validation when the functions were called. This impacted several libraries and the crash began after a JavaScriptCore upgrade in Bun v0.7.3. This crash would cause EXC_BREAKPOINT to be thrown after enough calls to Buffer.alloc, Buffer.allocUnsafe, Buffer.isBuffer were called. Bugfixes and stability improvements Buffer.toString(\"hex\") memory leak fix A memory leak has been fixed in the implementation of buffer.toString(\"hex\"). NAPI fixes and support for resvg, sharp A couple bugs in the NAPIClass constructor and napi_create_external_arraybuffer/napi_create_external_buffer have been fixed. The resolves issues when using resvg-js or sharp. Better error when this is invalid When calling a method with an unexpected value for this, Bun now reports an informative error. const { json } = new Response(`\"hello\"`); json(); // ^ TypeError: Expected `this` to be instanceof Response Handle cross-device file copies Bun now detects when a file copying operation (e.g fs.copyFile) is attempting to copy files across devices or partitions and falls back to a manual file copy syscall. Fix Bun.deepEqual URL comparison #4105 fixes a bug where URLs we're not properly compared by their internal href. 10% Regression in async-await performance on macOS has been fixed The daylight savings time cache is no longer updated on each microtask call. This regression began in v0.7.x. Several fixes to streams #4251 includes a number of improvements and bugfixes in the implementation of ReadableStream have been fixed. This includes: Pending writes to HTTP response bodies are automatically flushed once the microtask queue has been drained, fixing #1886 Improved error handling inside pull.

The small cuts quickly add up where getting even some of the official examples to work takes effort because they&#x27;re ever so slightly out of date and things have changed in the interim. reply junon 1 hour agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s also sad that Bun is written in Zig, which has not had a proper review of the stdlib since it&#x27;s not v1 yet, where Andrew has already stated publicly that Zig should not be used in production until v1 due to security vulnerabilities in the standard lib.But here we are. reply kristoff_it 37 minutes agorootparent> Andrew has already stated publicly that Zig should not be used in production until v1 due to security vulnerabilities in the standard lib.Andrew has made the claim a couple years ago that Zig should not be used in production yet. The part about security is not at all part of anything he ever claimed, and is in fact only something that you went crazy about on your own.See: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34669045While I can understand holding real hard onto your opinion, please don&#x27;t put words in people&#x27;s mouths, especially when the person in question does not share your position on the matter at all. reply ojosilva 1 hour agorootparentprevBun is currently below v1.0, so not declared production-ready either.But I&#x27;m not sure Bun should go to 1.0 without Zig going to 1.0 too. And Zig 1.0 is a distant target, which is a normal timeline for a programming language. reply trashburger 1 hour agorootparentprevWhat security vulnerabilities, exactly? reply brabel 1 hour agorootparentI&#x27;ve never heard Andrew say you shouldn&#x27;t use Zig in production because of \"security vulnerabilities\", but simply because Zig is quite immature (expect bugs including segfaults in perfectly \"good\" code) and changing constantly, not something anyone should want in a production setting. reply junon 40 minutes agorootparentprevThe one I found a while back was a DOS in UTF-8 decoding. I believe it&#x27;s since been fixed but things like that given that the standard library hasn&#x27;t been audited.

I saw your PR review of a community effort to add Bun to the Techempower benchmark. You had really great, exact feedback about \"unnecessary allocation here\", \"unnecessary allocation there\".It was eye-opening, in terms of how often us JS programmers play fast & loose with \"a little filter\" here, \"a little map\" there, and end up with death by a thousand allocations.Given that context, I&#x27;m curious:1) How much you think Bun&#x27;s (super-appreciated!) fanatical OCD about optimizing everything \"up to & outside of JSC\" will translate to the post-boot performance of everyday backend apps, and2) If you&#x27;re tempted&#x2F;could be compelled :-D to create a \"Mojo of TypeScript\", where you do a collab with Anders Hejlsberg to create some sort of \"TypeScript-ish\" language that, if a TS programmer plays by a stricter set of rules + relies on the latest borrowing inference magic, we could bring some of the Bun amazing-performance ethos to the current idiomatic FP&#x2F;JS&#x2F;TS style that is \"lol allocations everywhere\". :-)Or, maybe with Bun bringing the right native&#x2F;HTTP&#x2F;etc libraries wrapped around the core runtime, doing \"just the business logic\" in JS really won&#x27;t be that bad? Which iirc was the theory&#x2F;assertion of just-js when its author was benchmark hacking Techempower, and got pretty far with that approach.Anyway, thanks for Bun! We&#x27;re not running on it yet, but it&#x27;s on the todo list. :-) reply Jarred 1 hour agorootparent> 1) How much you think Bun&#x27;s (super-appreciated!) fanatical OCD about optimizing everything \"up to & outside of JSC\" will translate to the post-boot performance of everyday backend appsBun is extremely fast at data processing tasks. Shuffling data from one place to another (disk, network, APIs, etc). We use SIMD, minimize allocations&#x2F;copies and pay lots of attention to what system calls are used and how often and where. A naively implemented script in Bun that moves data using Bun’s APIs will often outperform a naively implemented program written in Rust or Go. Bun’s APIs try really hard to make the obvious & default way also the fast way.That, and Bun’s builtin build tooling are where Bun’s performance shines.> “Mojo of TypeScript”I’ve thought a little about this. I think it’s a project that’d take 5+ years and crazy hard to hire the right people to do it. I think it’s mostly unnecessary though. JITs are really good. The API design is usually the reason why things aren’t as fast as they could be. reply vaughan 3 minutes agorootparent> I think it’s a project that’d take 5+ yearsWhat are the major difficulties you see? Is this estimate for supporting all existing TS code...or as the OC said, a new language with only newly written code.The way I naively think about it is to imagine transpiling TypeScript code to Zig code. How far could that take you?And if you restricted how much dynamic-y stuff you could do...maybe with a linter. I always get the feeling that 90% of the business logic (sequence, selection, iteration) is that same between languages whether they are interpreted or compiled, with just some memory management stuff added on top - which can be abstracted anyway. reply the_duke 1 hour agorootparentprev> A naively implemented script in Bun that moves data using Bun’s APIs will often outperform a naively implemented program written in Rust or Go.Sounds exciting, do you have some example benchmarks I can run that show this? reply vorticalbox 5 hours agorootparentprev> us JS programmers play fast & loose with \"a little filter\" here, \"a little map\" there, and end up with death by a thousand allocations.That&#x27;s because speed isn&#x27;t always top priority. Readability is very high on the list.I would rather have a slightly slower .map or .filter in a chain than a harder to read nested for or while loop. reply flohofwoe 4 hours agorootparentThis just shows again that readability is entirely subjective, IMHO combinations of .map, .filter, .reduce, etc are often less readable than doing the same thing in a nested loop. reply vorticalbox 3 hours agorootparentThis is true I code very functional style in javascript but I can see how that might be harder to read for some. reply dralley 5 hours agorootparentprevA nested for or while loop isn&#x27;t always less readable FWIW. If you need more than 3-4 filters and&#x2F;or maps the balance starts shifting back the other way. reply intellix 2 hours agorootparentprevyeah, cause fixing the missing index on your DB that adds 3 seconds to an API call is better than optimising loops to save 2ms.In the front-end we were making about 20 API calls to fetch data we probably don&#x27;t need yet and the developer is like: the problem has to exist in the way we call them, time to optimise the loops! reply ughitsaaron 3 hours agorootparentprevThe fact of un-readability isn’t necessarily implied by the statement being replied to. `map` and `filter` are names for common operations on lists, not less performant alternatives other things. If there’s a more performant alternative to either operation, give it a name and express it in a function. That’s what functions are for, no? reply hinkley 5 hours agorootparentprevWell-factored code often reveals more important optimizations one can make.

As a TS developer, I&#x27;ve found picking up rust to be really neat. reply dapperdrake 6 hours agorootparentprevConcerning stephen&#x27;s item (2). The stricter set of rules was laid out by Richard C. Waters in Optimization of Series Expressions: Part I: User&#x27;s Manual for the Series Macro Package, page 46 (document page 48). See reference Waters(1989a).The paper&#x27;s language is a bit different than contemporary (2023) language.`map()` is called `map-fn`.`reduce()` a.k.a. `fold` seems to be `collect-fn`, although `collecting-fn` also seems interesting.sorting, uniqueness and permutation seem to be covered by `producing`.Just think of McIlroy&#x27;s famous pipeline in response to Donald Knuth&#x27;s trie implementation[mcilroy-source]: tr -cs A-Za-z &#x27;\\n&#x27;tr A-Z a-zsortuniq -csort -rnsed ${1}qAs far as pipeline or stream processing diagrams are concerned, the diagram on page 13 (document page 15) of Waters(1989a) may also be worth a closer look.What the SERIES compiler does is pipeline the loops. Think of a UNIX shell pipeline. Think of streaming results. Waters calls this pre-order processing. This also seems to be where Rich Hickey got the term \"transducer\" from. In short it means dropping unnecessary intermediate list or array allocations.Shameless self-plug: Eliminated unnecessary allocations in my JavaScript code by adding support for SERIES to the PARENSCRIPT Common Lisp to JavaScript compiler. The trick was (1) to define (series-expand ...) on series expressions so that they can be passed into (parenscript:ps ...) and (2) the parenscript compiler was missing (tagbody ... (go ...) ...) support. The latter is surprisingly tricky to implement. See dapperdrake(2023). Apologies for the less than perfect blog post. Got busy actually using this tool. Suddenly stream processing is easy, and maintainable.When adding a Hylang-style threading macro (-> ...) you get UNIX style pipelines without unnecessary allocations. It looks similar to this: (-> (it :let*-symbol series::let) (scan-file in-path-name #&#x27;read) (map-fn T #&#x27;some-function it) (collect &#x27;list it))Sadly, the SERIES compiler available on quicklisp right now is a bit arcane to use. It seems like it may have been more user friendly if it would have been integrated into the ANSI Common Lisp 1995 standard so that is has access to compiler internals. The trick seems to be to use macros instead of (series::defun ...) and use (series::let ...) instead of (cl:let ...). Note, that the two crucial symbols &#x27;defun and &#x27;let are not exported by SERIES. So using the package is insufficient and pipelining fails without a decent warning.Am chewing on the SERIES source code. It is available on sourceforge. [series-source]. If anybody is interested in porting it, then please reach out. It seems to be of similar importance as Google&#x27;s V8 relooper algorithm [relooper-reference].

Is windows support for 1.0 still on the horizon or has that been pushed? What’s been the best part of this project for you? reply Jarred 8 hours agorootparentThe honest answer is: don&#x27;t know yet, but if it doesn&#x27;t happen in 1.0, it will be the priority for 1.1.I&#x27;m going to do some experiments in the next few days and see how it goes.Roughly, the way we&#x27;re thinking of adding Windows support to Bun is:1) Get all the Zig code using platform-specific system APIs to use the closest Windows equivalent API. Fortunately, we have lots of code for handling UTF-16 strings (since that&#x27;s what JS uses in some cases)2) Get uSockets&#x2F;uWebSockets (C&#x2F;C++ library we use for tcp & http serve) to compile for Windows, or fall back to using libuv if it takes too long to make it work3) Get the rest of the dependencies to compile on Windows4) Fix bugs and perf issuesThere are a lot of open questions though. None of us are super familiar with I&#x2F;O on Windows. JavaScriptCore doesn&#x27;t have WebAssembly enabled on Windows yet.The biggest thing I&#x27;m worried about (other than time) re: Windows is async i&#x2F;o. In Bun, we _mostly_ use synchronous I&#x2F;O. Synchronous I&#x2F;O is simpler and when using SSDs, is often meaningfully lower overhead than the work necessary to make it async. I&#x27;ve heard that anti-virus software will often block I&#x2F;O for potentially seconds, which means that using sync I&#x2F;O at all is a super bad idea for performance in Windows (if this is true). If that is true, then making it fast will be difficult in cases where we need to do lots of filesystem lookups (like module resolution) reply snnn 5 hours agorootparentOn Windows you may consider using higher level IO routines. For example, for HTTP requests you can use WinHTTP which is super fast and scalable. For other IOs you can use Windows Thread Pool API(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;windows&#x2F;win32&#x2F;procthread&#x2F;t...) so that you do not need to manually manage threads or register&#x2F;unregister IO handlers&#x2F;callbacks. gRPC uses that. Though Windows IOs internally are all async, actually it makes using sync I&#x2F;O easier and you do not need to say it is a super bad idea. Windows has IOCP. If the machine has n logical CPUs, you may create a thread pool with 2*n threads. And, by default the operating system will not make more than n threads active at the same time. When one of the threads is doing blocking IO and entered IO wait state, the OS will wake-up another thread and let it go. This is why the number of threads in the thread pool needs be larger than than the number of CPUs. This design doesn&#x27;t lead to an optimal solution, however, practically it works very well. In this setting you still have the flexibility to use async IOs, but it is not a sin to use sync IO in a blocking manner in a thread pool.Disclaimer: I work at Microsoft and ship code to Windows, but the above are just my personal opinions. reply ninepoints 3 hours agorootparentprevSync IO is probably fine on Windows with the exception of CloseHandle, in which case Windows Defender or other AV will invoke a file filter in the kernel&#x27;s file I&#x2F;O filter stack to scan changes for data recently written to the file. A common approach used in Rust, version control software, and other runtimes is to defer file closing to a different thread to keep other I&#x2F;O and user-facing threads responsive. All that said, I think IOCP on Win32 is a far superior asynchronous programming model to the equivalent APIs on Linux which feel far less usable (with more footguns). reply pie_flavor 8 hours agorootparentprevCommon misconception - it&#x27;s not opening or writing files that can take a second, it&#x27;s closing them. reply Jarred 8 hours agorootparentThis definitely also used to be true on macOS. Bun previously would just request the max ulimit for file descriptors and then not close them. Most tools don&#x27;t realize there are hard and soft limits to file descriptors, and the hard limit is usually much higher.On Linux, not closing file descriptors makes opening new ones on multiple threads occasionally lock for 30ms or more. Early versions of `bun build` were something like 5x slower on Linux compared to macOS until we narrowed down that the bug was caused by not closing file descriptors. reply CoolCold 5 hours agorootparentHere likely meant that system level hooks of antiviral software are invoked on CloseFile call when you do writes, not on OpenFile.You may want to take a look on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qbKGw8MQ0i8?si=HO5b0MuljPQN9Sb2 replyaltano 2 hours agoparentprevHey Jarred, any idea where the bundler + React server components fall in the priority list?

And perhaps Flow might be better at several things but if it’s only really good at solving 5% of the total problem I’m going to pick the solution that also solves the other 95% even if the 5% Flow solves is just a mediocre solutionNote that I don’t really think that bun is the solution for everything or really that it is all that great.

THE FOUNDERS OF 404 MEDIA. FROM LEFT TO RIGHT: EMANUEL MAIBERG, JASON KOEBLER, JOSEPH COX, SAMANTHA COLE. PHOTO BY SHARON ATTIA Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content. This site is entirely funded by subscribers and you will be directly powering our journalism. Hello, and welcome to 404 Media, a new digital media company created, owned, written, edited by four journalists who until very recently worked at VICE’s Motherboard. We’re glad you’re here, and we’re glad we’re here, too. At 404 Media, we aspire to do society-shifting technology journalism, and to create a sustainable, responsible, reader-supported media business around it. We will report and publish stories that you will not find anywhere else, that we believe only we can do. We hope these stories will take over the internet, impact public policy, and expose bad actors. We will point out the absurd. We will be irreverent and have fun. We will also do very serious work. We hope that you will read these stories and want to send them to your group chat, or bring them up as conversation starters at parties. We believe that if we do this journalism well enough, you, our readers, will be willing to subscribe because you think it’s important, because you think it should exist in the world, and because you feel you’re personally getting value from it. Today, you’ll find an article about a horrifying data broker ecosystem where highly sensitive data filters from credit bureaus to violent criminals on Telegram. You’ll get a look inside a generative AI community that’s churning out sexual images of real people without their consent on a massive scale, and you’ll finally figure out why sex toy vibration patterns are so frustrating. You’ll see the incident report from the Boston ‘Cop Slide’ fiasco (thank you, FOIA). And you’ll learn why Airpods Max are being felled by small droplets of water and sweat. Tomorrow, we’ll show that the DHS is using an AI tool to track “sentiment and emotion” in peoples’ online posts; and then dive into the underground world of ads for illegal products on Instagram. After that we will write lots and lots of articles about crazy shit that we hope you will want to read. For the first week or so, everything on the site will be available to everyone for free. After that, we will begin putting some articles behind a paywall. Subscribers will get access to all articles, commenting privileges, access to interactive sessions where we’ll brainstorm and file your Freedom of Information Act request (FOIA) ideas, bonus episodes of the 404 Media Podcast (we have a free, ad-supported feed here; subscribers get the show ad-free), and the knowledge that without your support, this type of journalism will not exist. We will likely add more perks as we’re reasonably able to think of and execute on them. If we do our jobs well enough, we will be able to do this work indefinitely. If we do it really well, we will be able to sustainably grow by hiring other journalists to do more of it. Our point of view In the short term, we will be focused on doing beat reporting, blogging, investigations, and scoops about hacking, cybersecurity, sex, porn, artificial intelligence, consumer rights, cybercrime, surveillance, privacy, and the democratization of the internet. In the long term, the company will be focused on expanding our best work into books, documentaries, feature films, and narrative podcasts. JOIN THE NEWSLETTER TO GET THE LATEST UPDATES. We will focus on transparency, explaining how we do what we do, and how systems of powers do what they do. We are not going to reinvent the wheel because the wheel doesn’t need reinventing, but we will also explain how systems of power and governance work. Specifically, this means we will be filing a lot of FOIA requests, buying a lot of court documents, and watching a lot of city council hearings. Articles that rely primarily on public records requests will not be paywalled. We will also be focused on ground-up reporting. We will embed in the communities we cover to do local reporting from the internet, which means explaining what the communities we cover care about and why it’s important. Drivers at Amazon know more about how and why a new surveillance system is ruining their lives than a PR executive does. Repair professionals looking inside an iPhone know more about a design flaw than Johny Ive ever would have. Sex workers and women who are having their likenesses stolen understand the ramifications and impacts of these technologies more than an AI startup. Our reporting has previously shut down surveillance companies, introduced the world to deepfakes, got right-to-repair legislation passed, changed policies at major social media platforms including Reddit and Facebook, and got hundreds of millions of dollars of fines levied against some of the most significant companies in the world. At 404 Media, we intend to continue that work, only now, we will own it ourselves, and will be in charge of the direction of the company and responsible for its financial viability. This means that we will be experimental, take risks, and try different forms of generating revenue in hopes we can figure out how to do this for a long time. But we will always put the work first. Why are we doing this? Much has been written about the failing business model of new media. We have watched how new media companies fail, and it’s not because of a lack of audience, revenue, impact, or vital work. New media companies fail because of a growth-at-any-cost mentality, and venture capital investments made at absurd valuations. Most importantly, astronomical overhead costs make it impossible for journalists to out-earn the cost of expensive office space, the ever-changing whims of management, executives’ salaries, the cost of unnecessary enterprise software, and an endless parade of consultants brought in to figure out what’s wrong. It doesn’t have to be this way, and at 404 Media, it will not. We propose a simple alternative: pay journalists to do journalism. We have spent the last decade learning how “content” turns into money, and we believe that good journalism can bring in enough revenue to pay the people who make it livable wages. We believe it is possible to create a sustainable, profitable media company simply by doing good work, making common-sense decisions about costs, and asking our readers to support us. We’re excited to be here, and we’re excited you’re here, too. Become a paid subscriber for unlimited, ad-free articles and access to bonus content.

Honestly the reason we haven&#x27;t joined Mastodon yet is because there have been a million little things to adjust&#x2F;fix in the days leading up to launch to make sure the site didn&#x27;t break, to edit the stories, get art done, backend business stuff as well.There are a lot of things we wanted to launch with that we haven&#x27;t had time to do yet, which doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not a priority. As you can imagine we&#x27;ve had a few (very minor) urgent fires in the leadup to launch, so tbh our social media accounts across the board have taken a temporary backseat. Mastodon is high on our list and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll be there by the end of the week if not the end of the day.Thank you for your support! reply user_named 14 hours agorootparentSounds like there&#x27;s lots of overhead. reply ehPReth 10 hours agorootparentI mean, setting up a new publication&#x2F;company is a little more involved than just idly clicking though setting up a blog on wordpress.com and shitting out a singular 5 paragraph essay if that&#x27;s what you mean. reply satvikpendem 2 hours agorootparentprevWhere are they getting the money to pay the journalists? Isn&#x27;t that the main issue, that people don&#x27;t pay for journalism, hence why media outlets take VC in the first place? Seems like VC funding is a consequence, not the cause. reply smcleod 14 hours agorootparentprevThis is absolutely spot on. It’s refreshing to see. reply 037 18 hours agoparentprevWow, the full article in the RSS summary... I&#x27;m deeply touched. It reminds me of an old, not hostile web. Maybe it&#x27;s a configuration error, in which case thanks for the experience :D reply lagniappe 17 hours agorootparentI hope it&#x27;s not an error. This is how the web was when it was at its best. I hope this is a trend that continues. reply mewse-hn 18 hours agoparentprevPeanut gallery reporting in. It always felt sort of weird that vice had a technology section, but I think there is space for tech coverage with a more edgy slant (eg. Beto O&#x27;Rourke and his hacker background).Why would you name your website after a website error code? Appreciate the easter egg on the actual 404 page.Not really direct feedback but when the Verge launched they made a big splash with in-depth, long form stories like \"Pre to postmortem: the inside story of the death of Palm and webOS\" from 2012. I hope you guys could dig up some stories like this, and your commitment to filing FOIA requests seems promising. reply jkoebler 18 hours agorootparentNaming the site was a big struggle sesh. Lots of good names are taken, weren&#x27;t the right vibe, etc. We sort of made the joke \"404 Media Company Not Found\" to ourselves but, I think to be honest we:1) Like how it sounds2) People get it right away, even folks I know who don&#x27;t care a lot about tech journalism or aren&#x27;t super internet savvy (maybe they are even more likely to find themselves on 404 pages!)3) This is a little pretentious and not the actual reason we chose it (i.e. we realized it later), but we really do want to tell stories from \"hidden\" parts of the internet &#x2F; tech and the undercovered parts of it. 404 pages are full of easter eggs, and maybe it&#x27;s just something about accidentally stumbling onto a community or wold you didn&#x27;t previously know existed. reply mewse-hn 17 hours agorootparentI guess it is also in the tradition of 2600 magazine to use a numeric code as your nameplate reply kornhole 18 hours agorootparentprev404 has become a sign of censorship as we are seeing more pages taken down from Internet Archive and other places. I am excited to see you continue on surveillance and perhaps broaden into censorship and propaganda now that you are freed from some of the forces behind it. reply xkcd-sucks 14 hours agorootparentIs there a Russian Internet Archive that doesn&#x27;t comply with American takedown notices by any chance? reply kornhole 13 hours agorootparentI am not sure about Russian hosted, but an alternative to archive.org is archive.is. Centralized services eventually get compelled or corrupted. I setup https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archivebox.io&#x2F; on my server. Some other options have been reported here. reply SSLy 14 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s something with your lazy img loader. Even if I disable uBo and FF&#x27;s built-in protection, they don&#x27;t come up. reply nickthegreek 17 hours agoparentprevFull article in the RSS feed! Rarely see that these days. Was this a conscious choice or a tech oversight? reply opheron 16 hours agoparentprevHey Jason, cool to see you pop up here! Congrats on the launch, I&#x27;m happy to be able to join up as a new paid subscriber. Really glad y&#x27;all included RSS feeds for the articles and premium podcast feed; there are dozens of us who still use RSS - dozens! :PI have a small suggestion: Would you consider adding a perk for premium subscribers to be able to suggest (not demand) story pitches&#x2F;ideas, and maybe vote for them to indicate which ideas have more interest? It&#x27;s kind of an extension of what you&#x27;re planning to do with the FOIA requests forum, and similar to how some FOSS projects try to prioritize features that are requested or bountied by supporting donors. Also, it could be a nice way to crowdsource ideas from your pre-vetted audience, so you don&#x27;t drown in spam and vote manipulation. reply dendrite9 17 hours agoparentprevDid you look at other groups which have done something similar? Im curious to see how this type of project works even if not all of them are for me. So many people bemoan the structure of news and media businesses but I wonder if there needs to be more of a cycle of business destruction and creation to keep things from getting ossified and having the wrong priorities. Seeing this reminded me of https:&#x2F;&#x2F;escapecollective.com&#x2F; which came from the implosion of Cycling tips after being purchased by Outside. reply monetus 18 hours agoparentprevHow long of a process is it, give or take, for you all to publish an article? Give us a behind the scenes? Thanks for the site! I like the aesthetics. reply jkoebler 18 hours agorootparentThis fully fully depends on the article. We want to respect our readers&#x27; time, so while we love doing big investigations, it&#x27;s a lot to ask people to ONLY read 2,000-5,000-word articles about complicated topics. We want to have a lot of short posts that are insightful or about the news. So, for example, this was a breaking story I did yesterday:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.404media.co&#x2F;biden-administration-changes-mind-sa...This article took me 20-30 minutes to write, edit, and publish. It&#x27;s still news, but it&#x27;s more of an update on something I&#x27;ve covered and written about literally hundreds of times before. So I am providing some of the context about the decision that I can recite from memory (I check the specifics, of course), telling people what&#x27;s new, and providing them the document.This article I published earlier today, meanwhile, is something I&#x27;ve been poking along on for weeks, talked to a lot of sources on, read a lot of academic papers on, etc.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.404media.co&#x2F;instagram-ads-illegal-content-drugs-...At Motherboard our main way of operating was to always have a big investigation or narrative feature going on in the background, but to be on the lookout for news or timely things to do that align with our \"beats\" (the things we cover day-to-day, the topics we know inside and out). Usually features are something that you poke along on for weeks or months and go through a very rigorous back-and-forth editing process.FOIA stuff can \"take\" months or years, but often very little of that is active work time. The way that works is you file a request, wait for the agency to respond, and bug them a bunch when they miss deadlines or don&#x27;t respond. I&#x27;ve had FOIA requests returned the same day, and I&#x27;ve had others returned five years after I file them.Good question! reply tentacleuno 17 hours agorootparent> https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.404media.co&#x2F;biden-administration-changes-mind-sa...On LibreWolf, the scrolling is really messed up on this page, and on the home page. Out of curiosity, are you Rolling Your Own Scrolling(TM)? That&#x27;s generally a no-no. reply DyslexicAtheist 16 hours agoparentprevI was wondering before clicking the link if I might see Joseph Cox there. For me Joseph _IS_ Motherboard, because the only time MB pops up in my feed it&#x27;s because Joseph&#x27;s content. well done and best of luck with the new endeavor guys!! reply aidenn0 17 hours agoparentprevDo you really think you will get more than half-as-many people to pay $10&#x2F;mo as would pay $5&#x2F;mo?That surprises me, but I suspect you are more likely to know the answer to that than I am, so it also makes me a bit sad. reply wyre 7 hours agorootparentIf there was a $50 option with the only perk being access to their articles (doesn’t even need to unlimited either) I would have easily subscribed. reply slim 16 hours agoparentprevwhat&#x27;s your cms ? reply jonchurch_ 15 hours agorootparentGuessing by the &#x27;Ghost-Fastly&#x27; header in the response, I&#x27;d say Ghost.Edit: Oh there&#x27;s also plenty of references in the HTML, as well as it literally saying \"Published with Ghost\" in the footer which I just noticed hahahttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;404-media.ghost.io&#x2F; redirects to the main 404media site, as well. reply hoppyhoppy2 16 hours agorootparentprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37237722 reply 363849473754 18 hours agoparentprevDo you plan to do any investigative pieces on AI alignment? I’d be interested in a piece that interviewed people like Paul Christino, Eliezer Yudkowsky, Chris Olah and the like. Covering opposing views from doomerism to e&#x2F;acc. reply jkoebler 18 hours agorootparentAI will be one of our core coverage areas and I&#x27;m sure we will be doing pieces both short and in-depth on AI alignment, doomerism, optimism, etc. reply joshe 18 hours agoparentprevAny chance you could not be vicious tech haters? There&#x27;s a hole for Michael Arrington era TechCrunch reporting which just focused on factual information about companies and people.

I was involved with a few Vice projects in 2011-2014 and it was honestly leadership that let them down. They have great talent but it&#x27;s not easy in this day and age to run any kind of content site.Hope they pull it off. reply nickthegreek 19 hours agoparentGood luck to them but $100&#x2F;yr sub is the cheapest tier. oof! reply Humboldtsnee 19 hours agorootparentThat said, it&#x27;s going to actual workers who actually do the journalism.Supporting 404 feels better than sending money to some corp where it gets pocketed by the c suite. reply iterminate 19 hours agorootparentprevI wrote a long a comment theorising why $100&#x2F;year is a great starting point and then discovered you can toggle between \"yearly\" and \"monthly\". So they do offer $10&#x2F;month -- it&#x27;s just hidden behind a toggle. reply wffurr 18 hours agorootparentYou mean I can also choose $120&#x2F;year?No comment on whether either is reasonable but responding to “it costs too much” with a more expensive option is an interesting choice. reply kup0 16 hours agorootparentOnly viewing total cost misses the point. For some people, it may be more reasonable for them to want to pay a fraction of the cost monthly vs. one big sum every 12 months. $10&#x2F;month is more expensive, in total, over a year. However, $100 is more expensive in the short-term.Also, paying monthly is only more expensive if the person paying decides to stay that long. Monthly payments allow flexibility to cancel rather than committing to a year. reply carlosjobim 16 hours agorootparentprevLet&#x27;s imagine you need to read a certain story, but don&#x27;t care to become a long-term subscriber. The $10 for a month option fits that use. reply eviks 7 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t fit, direct payment for an article fits that use, not an expensive subscription you&#x27;d have to remember to cancel reply googlryas 16 hours agorootparentprev$100 sounds much worse than phrasing it as 27 cents a day.(cue cheesy music): \"For just a quarter a day, you can save a struggling journalist from corporate overlords, submarine PR pieces, and human interest stories\" reply frumper 14 hours agorootparent27 cents a day sounds worse to me. You typically can&#x27;t pay for 1 day, so it&#x27;s not really true. reply jzb 16 hours agorootparentprevIf anybody has the magic formula for pricing, I&#x27;d be all ears. Yeah, $100 a year seems steep - but OTOH are twice as many people going to subscribe for $50? Five times as many for $20? (Or more...)I don&#x27;t know what the answer &#x2F; formula is, but I pay more than that per year for my LWN.net subscription and for a few other publications. Less than that for others, but I really don&#x27;t know what the \"right\" level would be to maximize revenue so they&#x27;re able to pay themselves a decent salary and keep the lights on. reply selectodude 19 hours agorootparentprevMeans they need to average 4200 subscribers to pay themselves and run the place. reply jzb 16 hours agorootparentAssuming hosting costs, credit card fees, etc. - $420,000 a year for 4 people doesn&#x27;t sound like enough. reply doctorwho42 19 hours agorootparentprevCheaper than being owned by a billionaire, it just is a visible cost not external cost. reply patmorgan23 19 hours agorootparentprevLess than $10&#x2F;month reply autoexec 18 hours agorootparentStill more per month than a netflix account. reply OGWhales 13 hours agorootparent*Ad-supported Netflix account.Ad-free Netflix is more expensive. reply Invictus0 17 hours agorootparentprevAh yes, Netflix, the noted journalism company reply autoexec 16 hours agorootparentNetflix the contender for our limited attention and only one of an ever growing number of subscriptions whose cost needs to be justified. I&#x27;m guessing a streaming service, even one with netflix&#x27;s catalogue, is going to provide a lot more bang for your buck in terms of minutes of quality content per dollar. reply carlosjobim 16 hours agorootparentNetflix has nothing to do with newspapers or other digital content and services that aren&#x27;t video streaming.People seem to make the comparison only because the things are accessed by using a screen, which seems to be a very simple perspective. Just because Netflix is a great bargain (for those who like their content), doesn&#x27;t mean you can conclude that everything else is expensive. reply dahwolf 15 hours agorootparentValue for money and value for time will apply regardless.Both entertainment and reading in-depth paid news are one and the same: luxuries one does in their (typically) scarce spare time using an (often) modest budget. reply carlosjobim 14 hours agorootparentThat&#x27;s not my attitude to paid news at all. Quality news are often essential in order to understand things that are happening in your vicinity, that will have a direct impact on your life and on the life of people close to you. It is not necessarily about entertainment or wasting some time. Mostly low quality news media will have a focus on entertaining.If we use Netflix as a benchmark, you shouldn&#x27;t spend money on anything except for on Netflix, since almost nothing gives the same amount of hours of use per cent paid. Exceptions for lightbulbs, which are not that entertaining to watch.I think most people sometimes go out for a drink, a meal, or a coffee - without agonizing much about the price, even though you could get many days glued to Netflix for the same price as that drink with friends. replyshortformblog 16 hours agoprevI just want to personally vouch for Jason and company as being solid folks who do great work. I have freelanced for Motherboard for 7+ years and Jason and&#x2F;or Emanuel worked with me on about 90 percent of my stories over that time, which included extremely weird things like a step-by-step for Hackintoshing a laptop that ended up far longer than any of us were expecting, and a deep dive into the backstory of NESticle.They are truly great at what they do, and I’m excited to see what comes of it now that they have their own plot on the open internet. reply i_am_jl 18 hours agoprevI was super confused while I was reading the story posted here yesterday regarding ID theft via credit reports; it&#x27;s a quality piece but I couldn&#x27;t stop asking myself \"where the hell did 404 Media come from?\"Excited to see where this goes. reply jkoebler 18 hours agoparentThanks for reading!

Although I think this is interesting and has potential, the trust and absolute statements in their reporting worries me greatly.As a journalist, your job is to inform and question. They don&#x27;t seem to be questioning.In their apple article on apple support RTR, they write, \"This is a landmark shift in policy from Apple.\" [1]It&#x27;s not. They have played this game before; creating RTR \"friendly\" programs and then forcing signing of strict NDAs, and requirements that leave repair shops worse then they would without the program.

We are making a bet that a small fraction of those people will be willing to pay for accountability journalism and offbeat stuff that people care about (porn, for one, but lots other things) but that might make advertisers nervous.We are under no illusion that this will be easy but we are excited to give it a shot. The worst thing that can happen is that we tried our best on something we really believe in and enjoy doing, it doesn&#x27;t work financially, and we ultimately have to go do something else. We are hopeful and optimistic that we CAN make it work, but already we are overwhelmed and thrilled with the response. It&#x27;s only our second day but we&#x27;re committed to becoming a vital publication for people who care about how tech impacts humans, and how humans impact tech. We understand we will need to prove this day in and day out for people to feel like they are getting their money&#x27;s worth, or that their money is supporting a force for good in the world&#x2F;the internet.

    "originBody": "Home Articles Series Feedback Log in A half-hour to learn Rust Jan 27, 2020 20 minute read rust fasterthanlime In order to increase fluency in a programming language, one has to read a lot of it. But how can you read a lot of it if you don't know what it means? In this article, instead of focusing on one or two concepts, I'll try to go through as many Rust snippets as I can, and explain what the keywords and symbols they contain mean. Ready? Go! let introduces a variable binding: Rust code let x; // declare \"x\" x = 42; // assign 42 to \"x\" This can also be written as a single line: Rust code let x = 42; You can specify the variable's type explicitly with :, that's a type annotation: Rust code let x: i32; // `i32` is a signed 32-bit integer x = 42; // there's i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 // also u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 for unsigned This can also be written as a single line: Rust code let x: i32 = 42; If you declare a name and initialize it later, the compiler will prevent you from using it before it's initialized. Rust code let x; foobar(x); // error: borrow of possibly-uninitialized variable: `x` x = 42; However, doing this is completely fine: Rust code let x; x = 42; foobar(x); // the type of `x` will be inferred from here The underscore _ is a special name - or rather, a \"lack of name\". It basically means to throw away something: Rust code // this does *nothing* because 42 is a constant let _ = 42; // this calls `get_thing` but throws away its result let _ = get_thing(); Names that start with an underscore are regular names, it's just that the compiler won't warn about them being unused: Rust code // we may use `_x` eventually, but our code is a work-in-progress // and we just wanted to get rid of a compiler warning for now. let _x = 42; Separate bindings with the same name can be introduced - you can shadow a variable binding: Rust code let x = 13; let x = x + 3; // using `x` after that line only refers to the second `x`, // the first `x` no longer exists. Rust has tuples, which you can think of as \"fixed-length collections of values of different types\". Rust code let pair = ('a', 17); pair.0; // this is 'a' pair.1; // this is 17 If we really wanted to annotate the type of pair, we would write: Rust code let pair: (char, i32) = ('a', 17); Tuples can be destructured when doing an assignment, which means they're broken down into their individual fields: Rust code let (some_char, some_int) = ('a', 17); // now, `some_char` is 'a', and `some_int` is 17 This is especially useful when a function returns a tuple: Rust code let (left, right) = slice.split_at(middle); Of course, when destructuring a tuple, _ can be used to throw away part of it: Rust code let (_, right) = slice.split_at(middle); The semi-colon marks the end of a statement: Rust code let x = 3; let y = 5; let z = y + x; Which means statements can span multiple lines: Rust code let x = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] .iter() .map(|x| x + 3) .fold(0, |x, y| x + y); (We'll go over what those actually mean later). fn declares a function. Here's a void function: Rust code fn greet() { println!(\"Hi there!\"); } And here's a function that returns a 32-bit signed integer. The arrow indicates its return type: Rust code fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 { 4 } A pair of brackets declares a block, which has its own scope: Rust code // This prints \"in\", then \"out\" fn main() { let x = \"out\"; { // this is a different `x` let x = \"in\"; println!(\"{}\", x); } println!(\"{}\", x); } Blocks are also expressions, which mean they evaluate to.. a value. Rust code // this: let x = 42; // is equivalent to this: let x = { 42 }; Inside a block, there can be multiple statements: Rust code let x = { let y = 1; // first statement let z = 2; // second statement y + z // this is the *tail* - what the whole block will evaluate to }; And that's why \"omitting the semicolon at the end of a function\" is the same as returning, ie. these are equivalent: Rust code fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 { return 4; } fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 { 4 } if conditionals are also expressions: Rust code fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 { if feeling_lucky { 6 } else { 4 } } A match is also an expression: Rust code fn fair_dice_roll() -> i32 { match feeling_lucky { true => 6, false => 4, } } Dots are typically used to access fields of a value: Rust code let a = (10, 20); a.0; // this is 10 let amos = get_some_struct(); amos.nickname; // this is \"fasterthanlime\" Or call a method on a value: Rust code let nick = \"fasterthanlime\"; nick.len(); // this is 14 The double-colon, ::, is similar but it operates on namespaces. In this example, std is a crate (~ a library), cmp is a module (~ a source file), and min is a function: Rust code let least = std::cmp::min(3, 8); // this is 3 use directives can be used to \"bring in scope\" names from other namespace: Rust code use std::cmp::min; let least = min(7, 1); // this is 1 Within use directives, curly brackets have another meaning: they're \"globs\". If we want to import both min and max, we can do any of these: Rust code // this works: use std::cmp::min; use std::cmp::max; // this also works: use std::cmp::{min, max}; // this also works! use std::{cmp::min, cmp::max}; A wildcard (*) lets you import every symbol from a namespace: Rust code // this brings `min` and `max` in scope, and many other things use std::cmp::*; Types are namespaces too, and methods can be called as regular functions: Rust code let x = \"amos\".len(); // this is 4 let x = str::len(\"amos\"); // this is also 4 str is a primitive type, but many non-primitive types are also in scope by default. Rust code // `Vec` is a regular struct, not a primitive type let v = Vec::new(); // this is exactly the same code, but with the *full* path to `Vec` let v = std::vec::Vec::new(); This works because Rust inserts this at the beginning of every module: Rust code use std::prelude::v1::*; (Which in turns re-exports a lot of symbols, like Vec, String, Option and Result). Structs are declared with the struct keyword: Rust code struct Vec2 { x: f64, // 64-bit floating point, aka \"double precision\" y: f64, } They can be initialized using struct literals: Rust code let v1 = Vec2 { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 }; let v2 = Vec2 { y: 2.0, x: 4.0 }; // the order does not matter, only the names do There is a shortcut for initializing the rest of the fields from another struct: Rust code let v3 = Vec2 { x: 14.0, ..v2 }; This is called \"struct update syntax\", can only happen in last position, and cannot be followed by a comma. Note that the rest of the fields can mean all the fields: Rust code let v4 = Vec2 { ..v3 }; Structs, like tuples, can be destructured. Just like this is a valid let pattern: Rust code let (left, right) = slice.split_at(middle); So is this: Rust code let v = Vec2 { x: 3.0, y: 6.0 }; let Vec2 { x, y } = v; // `x` is now 3.0, `y` is now `6.0` And this: Rust code let Vec2 { x, .. } = v; // this throws away `v.y` let patterns can be used as conditions in if: Rust code struct Number { odd: bool, value: i32, } fn main() { let one = Number { odd: true, value: 1 }; let two = Number { odd: false, value: 2 }; print_number(one); print_number(two); } fn print_number(n: Number) { if let Number { odd: true, value } = n { println!(\"Odd number: {}\", value); } else if let Number { odd: false, value } = n { println!(\"Even number: {}\", value); } } // this prints: // Odd number: 1 // Even number: 2 match arms are also patterns, just like if let: Rust code fn print_number(n: Number) { match n { Number { odd: true, value } => println!(\"Odd number: {}\", value), Number { odd: false, value } => println!(\"Even number: {}\", value), } } // this prints the same as before A match has to be exhaustive: at least one arm needs to match. Rust code fn print_number(n: Number) { match n { Number { value: 1, .. } => println!(\"One\"), Number { value: 2, .. } => println!(\"Two\"), Number { value, .. } => println!(\"{}\", value), // if that last arm didn't exist, we would get a compile-time error } } If that's hard, _ can be used as a \"catch-all\" pattern: Rust code fn print_number(n: Number) { match n.value { 1 => println!(\"One\"), 2 => println!(\"Two\"), _ => println!(\"{}\", n.value), } } You can declare methods on your own types: Rust code struct Number { odd: bool, value: i32, } impl Number { fn is_strictly_positive(self) -> bool { self.value > 0 } } And use them like usual: Rust code fn main() { let minus_two = Number { odd: false, value: -2, }; println!(\"positive? {}\", minus_two.is_strictly_positive()); // this prints \"positive? false\" } Variable bindings are immutable by default, which means their interior can't be mutated: Rust code fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 17, }; n.odd = false; // error: cannot assign to `n.odd`, // as `n` is not declared to be mutable } And also that they cannot be assigned to: Rust code fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 17, }; n = Number { odd: false, value: 22, }; // error: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `n` } mut makes a variable binding mutable: Rust code fn main() { let mut n = Number { odd: true, value: 17, } n.value = 19; // all good } Traits are something multiple types can have in common: Rust code trait Signed { fn is_strictly_negative(self) -> bool; } You can implement: one of your traits on anyone's type anyone's trait on one of your types but not a foreign trait on a foreign type These are called the \"orphan rules\". Here's an implementation of our trait on our type: Rust code impl Signed for Number { fn is_strictly_negative(self) -> bool { self.valuebool { selfNumber { Number { value: -self.value, odd: self.odd, } } } fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 987 }; let m = -n; // this is only possible because we implemented `Neg` println!(\"{}\", m.value); // prints \"-987\" } An impl block is always for a type, so, inside that block, Self means that type: Rust code impl std::ops::Neg for Number { type Output = Self; fn neg(self) -> Self { Self { value: -self.value, odd: self.odd, } } } Some traits are markers - they don't say that a type implements some methods, they say that certain things can be done with a type. For example, i32 implements trait Copy (in short, i32 is Copy), so this works: Rust code fn main() { let a: i32 = 15; let b = a; // `a` is copied let c = a; // `a` is copied again } And this also works: Rust code fn print_i32(x: i32) { println!(\"x = {}\", x); } fn main() { let a: i32 = 15; print_i32(a); // `a` is copied print_i32(a); // `a` is copied again } But the Number struct is not Copy, so this doesn't work: Rust code fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; let m = n; // `n` is moved into `m` let o = n; // error: use of moved value: `n` } And neither does this: Rust code fn print_number(n: Number) { println!(\"{} number {}\", if n.odd { \"odd\" } else { \"even\" }, n.value); } fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; print_number(n); // `n` is moved print_number(n); // error: use of moved value: `n` } But it works if print_number takes an immutable reference instead: Rust code fn print_number(n: &Number) { println!(\"{} number {}\", if n.odd { \"odd\" } else { \"even\" }, n.value); } fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; print_number(&n); // `n` is borrowed for the time of the call print_number(&n); // `n` is borrowed again } It also works if a function takes a mutable reference - but only if our variable binding is also mut. Rust code fn invert(n: &mut Number) { n.value = -n.value; } fn print_number(n: &Number) { println!(\"{} number {}\", if n.odd { \"odd\" } else { \"even\" }, n.value); } fn main() { // this time, `n` is mutable let mut n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; print_number(&n); invert(&mut n); // `n is borrowed mutably - everything is explicit print_number(&n); } Trait methods can also take self by reference or mutable reference: Rust code impl std::clone::Clone for Number { fn clone(&self) -> Self { Self { ..*self } } } When invoking trait methods, the receiver is borrowed implicitly: Rust code fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; let mut m = n.clone(); m.value += 100; print_number(&n); print_number(&m); } To highlight this: these are equivalent: Rust code let m = n.clone(); let m = std::clone::Clone::clone(&n); Marker traits like Copy have no methods: Rust code // note: `Copy` requires that `Clone` is implemented too impl std::clone::Clone for Number { fn clone(&self) -> Self { Self { ..*self } } } impl std::marker::Copy for Number {} Now, Clone can still be used: Rust code fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; let m = n.clone(); let o = n.clone(); } But Number values will no longer be moved: Rust code fn main() { let n = Number { odd: true, value: 51 }; let m = n; // `m` is a copy of `n` let o = n; // same. `n` is neither moved nor borrowed. } Some traits are so common, they can be implemented automatically by using the derive attribute: Rust code #[derive(Clone, Copy)] struct Number { odd: bool, value: i32, } // this expands to `impl Clone for Number` and `impl Copy for Number` blocks. Functions can be generic: Rust code fn foobar(arg: T) { // do something with `arg` } They can have multiple type parameters, which can then be used in the function's declaration and its body, instead of concrete types: Rust code fn foobar(left: L, right: R) { // do something with `left` and `right` } Type parameters usually have constraints, so you can actually do something with them. The simplest constraints are just trait names: Rust code fn print(value: T) { println!(\"value = {}\", value); } fn print(value: T) { println!(\"value = {:?}\", value); } There's a longer syntax for type parameter constraints: Rust code fn print(value: T) where T: Display, { println!(\"value = {}\", value); } Constraints can be more complicated: they can require a type parameter to implement multiple traits: Rust code use std::fmt::Debug; fn compare(left: T, right: T) where T: Debug + PartialEq, { println!(\"{:?} {} {:?}\", left, if left == right { \"==\" } else { \"!=\" }, right); } fn main() { compare(\"tea\", \"coffee\"); // prints: \"tea\" != \"coffee\" } Generic functions can be thought of as namespaces, containing an infinity of functions with different concrete types. Same as with crates, and modules, and types, generic functions can be \"explored\" (navigated?) using :: Rust code fn main() { use std::any::type_name; println!(\"{}\", type_name::()); // prints \"i32\" println!(\"{}\", type_name::()); // prints \"(f64, char)\" } This is lovingly called turbofish syntax, because :: looks like a fish. Structs can be generic too: Rust code struct Pair { a: T, b: T, } fn print_type_name(_val: &T) { println!(\"{}\", std::any::type_name::()); } fn main() { let p1 = Pair { a: 3, b: 9 }; let p2 = Pair { a: true, b: false }; print_type_name(&p1); // prints \"Pair\" print_type_name(&p2); // prints \"Pair\" } The standard library type Vec (~ a heap-allocated array), is generic: Rust code fn main() { let mut v1 = Vec::new(); v1.push(1); let mut v2 = Vec::new(); v2.push(false); print_type_name(&v1); // prints \"Vec\" print_type_name(&v2); // prints \"Vec\" } Speaking of Vec, it comes with a macro that gives more or less \"vec literals\": Rust code fn main() { let v1 = vec![1, 2, 3]; let v2 = vec![true, false, true]; print_type_name(&v1); // prints \"Vec\" print_type_name(&v2); // prints \"Vec\" } All of name!(), name![] or name!{} invoke a macro. Macros just expand to regular code. In fact, println is a macro: Rust code fn main() { println!(\"{}\", \"Hello there!\"); } This expands to something that has the same effect as: Rust code fn main() { use std::io::{self, Write}; io::stdout().lock().write_all(b\"Hello there!\\n\").unwrap(); } panic is also a macro. It violently stops execution with an error message, and the file name / line number of the error, if enabled: Rust code fn main() { panic!(\"This panics\"); } // output: thread 'main' panicked at 'This panics', src/main.rs:3:5 Some methods also panic. For example, the Option type can contain something, or it can contain nothing. If .unwrap() is called on it, and it contains nothing, it panics: Rust code fn main() { let o1: Option = Some(128); o1.unwrap(); // this is fine let o2: Option = None; o2.unwrap(); // this panics! } // output: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', src/libcore/option.rs:378:21 Option is not a struct - it's an enum, with two variants. Rust code enum Option { None, Some(T), } impl Option { fn unwrap(self) -> T { // enums variants can be used in patterns: match self { Self::Some(t) => t, Self::None => panic!(\".unwrap() called on a None option\"), } } } use self::Option::{None, Some}; fn main() { let o1: Option = Some(128); o1.unwrap(); // this is fine let o2: Option = None; o2.unwrap(); // this panics! } // output: thread 'main' panicked at '.unwrap() called on a None option', src/main.rs:11:27 Result is also an enum, it can either contain something, or an error: Rust code enum Result { Ok(T), Err(E), } It also panics when unwrapped and containing an error. Variables bindings have a \"lifetime\": Rust code fn main() { // `x` doesn't exist yet { let x = 42; // `x` starts existing println!(\"x = {}\", x); // `x` stops existing } // `x` no longer exists } Similarly, references have a lifetime: Rust code fn main() { // `x` doesn't exist yet { let x = 42; // `x` starts existing let x_ref = &x; // `x_ref` starts existing - it borrows `x` println!(\"x_ref = {}\", x_ref); // `x_ref` stops existing // `x` stops existing } // `x` no longer exists } The lifetime of a reference cannot exceed the lifetime of the variable binding it borrows: Rust code fn main() { let x_ref = { let x = 42; &x }; println!(\"x_ref = {}\", x_ref); // error: `x` does not live long enough } A variable binding can be immutably borrowed multiple times: Rust code fn main() { let x = 42; let x_ref1 = &x; let x_ref2 = &x; let x_ref3 = &x; println!(\"{} {} {}\", x_ref1, x_ref2, x_ref3); } While borrowed, a variable binding cannot be mutated: Rust code fn main() { let mut x = 42; let x_ref = &x; x = 13; println!(\"x_ref = {}\", x_ref); // error: cannot assign to `x` because it is borrowed } While immutably borrowed, a variable cannot be mutably borrowed: Rust code fn main() { let mut x = 42; let x_ref1 = &x; let x_ref2 = &mut x; // error: cannot borrow `x` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable println!(\"x_ref1 = {}\", x_ref1); } References in function arguments also have lifetimes: Rust code fn print(x: &i32) { // `x` is borrowed (from the outside) for the // entire time this function is called. } Functions with reference arguments can be called with borrows that have different lifetimes, so: All functions that take references are generic Lifetimes are generic parameters Lifetimes' names start with a single quote, ': Rust code // elided (non-named) lifetimes: fn print(x: &i32) {} // named lifetimes: fn print(x: &'a i32) {} This allows returning references whose lifetime depend on the lifetime of the arguments: Rust code struct Number { value: i32, } fn number_value(num: &'a Number) -> &'a i32 { &num.value } fn main() { let n = Number { value: 47 }; let v = number_value(&n); // `v` borrows `n` (immutably), thus: `v` cannot outlive `n`. // While `v` exists, `n` cannot be mutably borrowed, mutated, moved, etc. } When there is a single input lifetime, it doesn't need to be named, and everything has the same lifetime, so the two functions below are equivalent: Rust code fn number_value(num: &'a Number) -> &'a i32 { &num.value } fn number_value(num: &Number) -> &i32 { &num.value } Structs can also be generic over lifetimes, which allows them to hold references: Rust code struct NumRef { x: &'a i32, } fn main() { let x: i32 = 99; let x_ref = NumRef { x: &x }; // `x_ref` cannot outlive `x`, etc. } The same code, but with an additional function: Rust code struct NumRef { x: &'a i32, } fn as_num_ref(x: &'a i32) -> NumRef { NumRef { x: &x } } fn main() { let x: i32 = 99; let x_ref = as_num_ref(&x); // `x_ref` cannot outlive `x`, etc. } The same code, but with \"elided\" lifetimes: Rust code struct NumRef { x: &'a i32, } fn as_num_ref(x: &i32) -> NumRef { NumRef { x: &x } } fn main() { let x: i32 = 99; let x_ref = as_num_ref(&x); // `x_ref` cannot outlive `x`, etc. } impl blocks can be generic over lifetimes too: Rust code impl NumRef { fn as_i32_ref(&'a self) -> &'a i32 { self.x } } fn main() { let x: i32 = 99; let x_num_ref = NumRef { x: &x }; let x_i32_ref = x_num_ref.as_i32_ref(); // neither ref can outlive `x` } But you can do elision (\"to elide\") there too: Rust code impl NumRef { fn as_i32_ref(&self) -> &i32 { self.x } } You can elide even harder, if you never need the name: Rust code impl NumRef { fn as_i32_ref(&self) -> &i32 { self.x } } There is a special lifetime, named 'static, which is valid for the entire program's lifetime. String literals are 'static: Rust code struct Person { name: &'static str, } fn main() { let p = Person { name: \"fasterthanlime\", }; } But owned strings are not static: Rust code struct Person { name: &'static str, } fn main() { let name = format!(\"fasterthan{}\", \"lime\"); let p = Person { name: &name }; // error: `name` does not live long enough } In that last example, the local name is not a &'static str, it's a String. It's been allocated dynamically, and it will be freed. Its lifetime is less than the whole program (even though it happens to be in main). To store a non-'static string in Person, it needs to either: A) Be generic over a lifetime: Rust code struct Person { name: &'a str, } fn main() { let name = format!(\"fasterthan{}\", \"lime\"); let p = Person { name: &name }; // `p` cannot outlive `name` } or B) Take ownership of the string Rust code struct Person { name: String, } fn main() { let name = format!(\"fasterthan{}\", \"lime\"); let p = Person { name: name }; // `name` was moved into `p`, their lifetimes are no longer tied. } Speaking of: in a struct literal, when a field is set to a variable binding of the same name: Rust code let p = Person { name: name }; It can be shortened like this: Rust code let p = Person { name }; For many types in Rust, there are owned and non-owned variants: Strings: String is owned, &str is a reference Paths: PathBuf is owned, &Path is a reference Collections: Vec is owned, &[T] is a reference Rust has slices - they're a reference to multiple contiguous elements. You can borrow a slice of a vector, for example: Rust code fn main() { let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; let v2 = &v[2..4]; println!(\"v2 = {:?}\", v2); } // output: // v2 = [3, 4] The above is not magical. The indexing operator (foo[index]) is overloaded with the Index and IndexMut traits. The .. syntax is just range literals. Ranges are just a few structs defined in the standard library. They can be open-ended, and their rightmost bound can be inclusive, if it's preceded by =. Rust code fn main() { // 0 or greater println!(\"{:?}\", (0..).contains(&100)); // true // strictly less than 20 println!(\"{:?}\", (..20).contains(&20)); // false // 20 or less than 20 println!(\"{:?}\", (..=20).contains(&20)); // true // only 3, 4, 5 println!(\"{:?}\", (3..6).contains(&4)); // true } Borrowing rules apply to slices. Rust code fn tail(s: &[u8]) -> &[u8] { &s[1..] } fn main() { let x = &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; let y = tail(x); println!(\"y = {:?}\", y); } This is the same as: Rust code fn tail(s: &'a [u8]) -> &'a [u8] { &s[1..] } This is legal: Rust code fn main() { let y = { let x = &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; tail(x) }; println!(\"y = {:?}\", y); } ...but only because [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is a 'static array. So, this is illegal: Rust code fn main() { let y = { let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; tail(&v) // error: `v` does not live long enough }; println!(\"y = {:?}\", y); } ...because a vector is heap-allocated, and it has a non-'static lifetime. &str values are really slices. Rust code fn file_ext(name: &str) -> Option { // this does not create a new string - it returns // a slice of the argument. name.split(\".\").last() } fn main() { let name = \"Read me. Or don't.txt\"; if let Some(ext) = file_ext(name) { println!(\"file extension: {}\", ext); } else { println!(\"no file extension\"); } } ...so the borrow rules apply here too: Rust code fn main() { let ext = { let name = String::from(\"Read me. Or don't.txt\"); file_ext(&name).unwrap_or(\"\") // error: `name` does not live long enough }; println!(\"extension: {:?}\", ext); } Functions that can fail typically return a Result: Rust code fn main() { let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]); println!(\"{:?}\", s); // prints: Ok(\"🍉\") let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[195, 40]); println!(\"{:?}\", s); // prints: Err(Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }) } If you want to panic in case of failure, you can .unwrap(): Rust code fn main() { let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]).unwrap(); println!(\"{:?}\", s); // prints: \"🍉\" let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[195, 40]).unwrap(); // prints: thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` // on an `Err` value: Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }', // src/libcore/result.rs:1165:5 } Or .expect(), for a custom message: Rust code fn main() { let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[195, 40]).expect(\"valid utf-8\"); // prints: thread 'main' panicked at 'valid utf-8: Utf8Error // { valid_up_to: 0, error_len: Some(1) }', src/libcore/result.rs:1165:5 } Or, you can match: Rust code fn main() { match std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]) { Ok(s) => println!(\"{}\", s), Err(e) => panic!(e), } // prints 🍉 } Or you can if let: Rust code fn main() { if let Ok(s) = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]) { println!(\"{}\", s); } // prints 🍉 } Or you can bubble up the error: Rust code fn main() -> Result { match std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137]) { Ok(s) => println!(\"{}\", s), Err(e) => return Err(e), } Ok(()) } Or you can use ? to do it the concise way: Rust code fn main() -> Result { let s = std::str::from_utf8(&[240, 159, 141, 137])?; println!(\"{}\", s); Ok(()) } The * operator can be used to dereference, but you don't need to do that to access fields or call methods: Rust code struct Point { x: f64, y: f64, } fn main() { let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 }; let p_ref = &p; println!(\"({}, {})\", p_ref.x, p_ref.y); } // prints `(1, 3)` And you can only do it if the type is Copy: Rust code struct Point { x: f64, y: f64, } fn negate(p: Point) -> Point { Point { x: -p.x, y: -p.y, } } fn main() { let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 }; let p_ref = &p; negate(*p_ref); // error: cannot move out of `*p_ref` which is behind a shared reference } Rust code // now `Point` is `Copy` #[derive(Clone, Copy)] struct Point { x: f64, y: f64, } fn negate(p: Point) -> Point { Point { x: -p.x, y: -p.y, } } fn main() { let p = Point { x: 1.0, y: 3.0 }; let p_ref = &p; negate(*p_ref); // ...and now this works } Closures are just functions of type Fn, FnMut or FnOnce with some captured context. Their parameters are a comma-separated list of names within a pair of pipes (|). They don't need curly braces, unless you want to have multiple statements. Rust code fn for_each_planet(f: F) where F: Fn(&'static str) { f(\"Earth\"); f(\"Mars\"); f(\"Jupiter\"); } fn main() { for_each_planet(|planet| println!(\"Hello, {}\", planet)); } // prints: // Hello, Earth // Hello, Mars // Hello, Jupiter The borrow rules apply to them too: Rust code fn for_each_planet(f: F) where F: Fn(&'static str) { f(\"Earth\"); f(\"Mars\"); f(\"Jupiter\"); } fn main() { let greeting = String::from(\"Good to see you\"); for_each_planet(|planet| println!(\"{}, {}\", greeting, planet)); // our closure borrows `greeting`, so it cannot outlive it } For example, this would not work: Rust code fn for_each_planet(f: F) where F: Fn(&'static str) + 'static // `F` must now have \"'static\" lifetime { f(\"Earth\"); f(\"Mars\"); f(\"Jupiter\"); } fn main() { let greeting = String::from(\"Good to see you\"); for_each_planet(|planet| println!(\"{}, {}\", greeting, planet)); // error: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows // `greeting`, which is owned by the current function } But this would: Rust code fn main() { let greeting = String::from(\"You're doing great\"); for_each_planet(move |planet| println!(\"{}, {}\", greeting, planet)); // `greeting` is no longer borrowed, it is *moved* into // the closure. } An FnMut needs to be mutably borrowed to be called, so it can only be called once at a time. This is legal: Rust code fn foobar(f: F) where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 { println!(\"{}\", f(f(2))); } fn main() { foobar(|x| x * 2); } // output: 8 This isn't: Rust code fn foobar(mut f: F) where F: FnMut(i32) -> i32 { println!(\"{}\", f(f(2))); // error: cannot borrow `f` as mutable more than once at a time } fn main() { foobar(|x| x * 2); } This is legal again: Rust code fn foobar(mut f: F) where F: FnMut(i32) -> i32 { let tmp = f(2); println!(\"{}\", f(tmp)); } fn main() { foobar(|x| x * 2); } // output: 8 FnMut exists because some closures mutably borrow local variables: Rust code fn foobar(mut f: F) where F: FnMut(i32) -> i32 { let tmp = f(2); println!(\"{}\", f(tmp)); } fn main() { let mut acc = 2; foobar(|x| { acc += 1; x * acc }); } // output: 24 Those closures cannot be passed to functions expecting Fn: Rust code fn foobar(f: F) where F: Fn(i32) -> i32 { println!(\"{}\", f(f(2))); } fn main() { let mut acc = 2; foobar(|x| { acc += 1; // error: cannot assign to `acc`, as it is a // captured variable in a `Fn` closure. // the compiler suggests \"changing foobar // to accept closures that implement `FnMut`\" x * acc }); } FnOnce closures can only be called once. They exist because some closure move out variables that have been moved when captured: Rust code fn foobar(f: F) where F: FnOnce() -> String { println!(\"{}\", f()); } fn main() { let s = String::from(\"alright\"); foobar(move || s); // `s` was moved into our closure, and our // closures moves it to the caller by returning // it. Remember that `String` is not `Copy`. } This is enforced naturally, as FnOnce closures need to be moved in order to be called. So, for example, this is illegal: Rust code fn foobar(f: F) where F: FnOnce() -> String { println!(\"{}\", f()); println!(\"{}\", f()); // error: use of moved value: `f` } And, if you need convincing that our closure does move s, this is illegal too: Rust code fn main() { let s = String::from(\"alright\"); foobar(move || s); foobar(move || s); // use of moved value: `s` } But this is fine: Rust code fn main() { let s = String::from(\"alright\"); foobar(|| s.clone()); foobar(|| s.clone()); } Here's a closure with two arguments: Rust code fn foobar(x: i32, y: i32, is_greater: F) where F: Fn(i32, i32) -> bool { let (greater, smaller) = if is_greater(x, y) { (x, y) } else { (y, x) }; println!(\"{} is greater than {}\", greater, smaller); } fn main() { foobar(32, 64, |x, y| x > y); } Here's a closure ignoring both its arguments: Rust code fn main() { foobar(32, 64, |_, _| panic!(\"Comparing is futile!\")); } Here's a slightly worrying closure: Rust code fn countdown(count: usize, tick: F) where F: Fn(usize) { for i in (1..=count).rev() { tick(i); } } fn main() { countdown(3, |i| println!(\"tick {}...\", i)); } // output: // tick 3... // tick 2... // tick 1... And here's a toilet closure: Rust code fn main() { countdown(3, |_| ()); } Called thusly because |_| () looks like a toilet. Anything that is iterable can be used in a for in loop. We've just seen a range being used, but it also works with a Vec: Rust code fn main() { for i in vec![52, 49, 21] { println!(\"I like the number {}\", i); } } Or a slice: Rust code fn main() { for i in &[52, 49, 21] { println!(\"I like the number {}\", i); } } // output: // I like the number 52 // I like the number 49 // I like the number 21 Or an actual iterator: Rust code fn main() { // note: `&str` also has a `.bytes()` iterator. // Rust's `char` type is a \"Unicode scalar value\" for c in \"rust\".chars() { println!(\"Give me a {}\", c); } } // output: // Give me a r // Give me a u // Give me a s // Give me a t Even if the iterator items are filtered and mapped and flattened: Rust code fn main() { for c in \"SuRPRISE INbOUND\" .chars() .filter(|c| c.is_lowercase()) .flat_map(|c| c.to_uppercase()) { print!(\"{}\", c); } println!(); } // output: UB You can return a closure from a function: Rust code fn make_tester(answer: String) -> impl Fn(&str) -> bool { move |challenge| { challenge == answer } } fn main() { // you can use `.into()` to perform conversions // between various types, here `&'static str` and `String` let test = make_tester(\"hunter2\".into()); println!(\"{}\", test(\"******\")); println!(\"{}\", test(\"hunter2\")); } You can even move a reference to some of a function's arguments, into a closure it returns: Rust code fn make_tester(answer: &'a str) -> impl Fn(&str) -> bool + 'a { move |challenge| { challenge == answer } } fn main() { let test = make_tester(\"hunter2\"); println!(\"{}\", test(\"*******\")); println!(\"{}\", test(\"hunter2\")); } // output: // false // true Or, with elided lifetimes: Rust code fn make_tester(answer: &str) -> impl Fn(&str) -> bool + '_ { move |challenge| { challenge == answer } } And with that, we hit the 30-minute estimated reading time mark, and you should be able to read most of the Rust code you find online. Writing Rust is a very different experience from reading Rust. On one hand, you're not reading the solution to a problem, you're actually solving it. On the other hand, the Rust compiler helps out a lot. For all of the intentional mistakes made above (\"this code is illegal\", etc.), rustc always has very good error messages and insightful suggestions. And when there's a hint missing, the compiler team is not afraid to add it.

I quickly started to write programs like I would have in C but got completely thwarted by the borrow checker because I wanted pointers everywhere.

The only trick is that a programmer cannot learn Rust exclusively by trial-and-error (which programmers love to do), trying dozens of syntax combinations to see what works. A programmer is forced to learn Rust by RTFM (which programmers hate to do), in order to understand how Rust works. That&#x27;s all there&#x27;s to it. It&#x27;s like trying to learn to play the guitar without reading a book on guitar cords, pulling guitar strings individually at random - the music just won&#x27;t happen for quite a long time, unless you&#x27;re Mozart. At any rate, one can always forget Rust references (i.e., raw pointers) and use Rust reference-counted smart pointers[1], effectively writing Rust analogously to Swift.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch15-04-rc.html reply bryanlarsen 19 hours agorootparentRust has fabulous error messages, so I do a lot of programming by trial and error. reply smodo 15 hours agorootparentTrue, but because there are many ways to satisfy the borrow checker it is very easy to arrive at needlessly complicated solutions.

This allows: all objects to be stored in a contiguous block of memory (increasing the likelihood of \"pointer-chasing\" style of code to have the pointed to value warm in cache, significantly speeding them up), allows relocation (because you&#x27;re no longer dealing with pointers, but rather offsets to the beginning of the pointer), and doesn&#x27;t have the pointer invalidation problem (because the \"pointer\" now asserts that the pointed to value hasn&#x27;t changed, and if so return an Err&#x2F;None). It also has the benefit that because you&#x27;re not dealing with pointers you don&#x27;t need to write any unsafe Rust code, out of bound accesses are checked, and the borrow graph becomes simpler because the arena owns all of its contents, instead of having to keep track of the lifetime of borrows at compile time (the famous \"fighting with the borrow checker\") nor is as \"expensive\" as the tracking an Arc> could be. reply karimf 19 hours agoprevPrevious discussion with 333 comments (2021):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25610741 reply dang 19 hours agoparentThanks!

If you had to be explicit without all the syntax sugar and type &#x2F; lifetime inference it would be insufferable to program in. reply trane_project 19 hours agoparentprevNot sure if I disagree but your example is terrible. Let patterns in if statements greatly simplify things. The alternatives are a lot more convoluted.See example from code I wrote this week: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trane-project&#x2F;trane&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;data&#x2F;...Without the let, I&#x27;d have to do a match statement followed by an unwrap just to check if a field in an enum is set. reply tinco 18 hours agorootparentYou are confusing shortening with simplifying. The `if let` syntax is an unnecessary addition to the language so it is by definition an added complexity. Of course the resulting code is much easier to read and I definitely agree that it&#x27;s a nice feature but I wouldn&#x27;t pretend it made the language simpler, just more comfortable once you already know it. reply pornel 13 hours agorootparentYou imply simple = better, complex = worse, but this isn&#x27;t such a simple relationship.If you keep removing redundant constructs from languages, you will end up with something pure and minimal like the lambda calculus or turing machine. But these aren&#x27;t easy to program in!Languages are an interface for humans. If the code density is too low or too high, it becomes difficult to for people reason about the programs. Concepts like readability and expressiveness are important, but end up requiring some level of complexity. reply tinco 13 hours agorootparentExactly, it&#x27;s a smooth trade off curve from lambda calculus all the way to Haskell with 30 language extensions enabled.You could learn lambda calculus in an afternoon, but then spend a month writing a single complex algorithm. You could spend 5 years learning Haskell, and then write the most powerful system in a couple minutes.There&#x27;s a sweet spot somewhere between those two, and Rust is definitely near it. reply bornfreddy 15 hours agorootparentprevExactly what I had in mind, thank you for explaining it so succinctly! reply dureuill 1 hour agorootparentJust to elaborate on the \"just more comfortable once you already know it\" part, I think a lot of Rust is optimized (willingly or not) for the \"once you know it\" use case.Which, while it might arguably hurt adoption, is a good value proposition, since you spend a lot more time knowing the language than not knowing it.Now, not everything is always perfect, and I agree that the `if let` is not the most useful part of the language, as it drives pointless discussions about when to use it vs match (some people prefer the esthetics of match even when an if let can be used, others prefer to use a if let whenever possible). This redundancy apart, the construct doesn&#x27;t eat any mental energy once you know it. The same can&#x27;t be said of many of C++ quirks (initialization rules, member-initializer list in constructors, the rule of five) reply masklinn 18 hours agorootparentprev> Without the let, I&#x27;d have to do a match statement followed by an unwrap just to check if a field in an enum is set.You... would not?An `if let` trivially desugars to a `match`. if let={ ... }becomes match{=> { ... } _ => {} } reply trane_project 18 hours agorootparentSee my example. I am trying to extract the value of an optional field in the enum. That&#x27;s where the unwrap comes in. reply masklinn 17 hours agorootparentWhat I wrote up is the spec-defined desugaring of a single-branch `if let`, aside from desugaring bugs there should be no counter-example.The snippet you link to should be replaceable by something along the lines of match &passages.asset { TranscriptionAsset::Track { artist_name: Some(artist_name), .. } => { metadata .entry(ARTIST_METADATA.to_string()) .or_default() .push(artist_name.clone()); } _ => {} }no `unwrap` needed. I don&#x27;t know where you got that idea. reply gary17the 18 hours agoparentprev> I love the idea of Rust, but the language itself seems needlessly complexWell, I have to agree Rust isn&#x27;t one of the simplest PL-s on the planet. This is due to the fact that it is quite a modern PL and quite a versatile PL, supporting elements of functional programming, trait-oriented (conditional generics) programming, asynchronous programming, etc. and a capable standard library on top of it all. It takes, indeed, quite some time to take all of that Rust in. As a reward, you get a lot of expressiveness and the capability to discover a significant percentage (if not an overwhelming majority) of your programming mistakes at compile time as opposed to runtime (unit&#x2F;integration tests or Q&#x2F;A), which to me is priceless.Nevertheless, from my experience, Rust is, at the same time, one of the most... \"consistent\", \"predictable\", \"internally symmetric\" PL-s I have ever seen. I consider Rust to be way easier to learn than, say, Swift.> `let` patterns can be used as conditions in `if`I somewhat cannot help it but feel that such an example should not be used in an introductory tutorial. `if let` is usually used to pattern-match a simple `enum`[1], not a complex `struct` that looks \"dense\" unless you&#x27;re used to it.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch06-03-if-let.html reply bornfreddy 15 hours agorootparent> ...and quite a versatile PL, supporting elements of functional programming, trait-oriented (conditional generics) programming, asynchronous programming, etc. and a capable standard library on top of it all.Yes, exactly! Now can I have just a safe C without all the other stuff, pretty please? :) I understand Rust is not it, but I hope someone comes up with a simple PL which is also compile-time memory safe. I think it would be an instant hit. reply dureuill 1 hour agorootparent> Now can I have just a safe C without all the other stuff, pretty please? :)Not sure how much we could remove from Rust while keeping the problem tractable. The borrow checker is needed for compile time memory safety sans garbage collection. For borrow checking to be tractable, one needs shared references, exclusive references, owned values, the possibility for reference counting, and the possibility for interior mutability. This mandates smart pointers, that pretty much mandate generics. These various abstractions also mandate a capable standard library, unless the language would hardcode all these abstractions, which would endanger the low-levelness of the language (since you wouldn&#x27;t be able to implement your own abstractions for e.g. embedded contexts)For the demarcation between unsafe Rust and safe Rust to work, one needs encapsulation, so field privacy.For concurrency, the language requires a way to mark types as thread safe, which requires a way to say things about structures, so a least a weak version of traits.A smaller version of Rust probably exists, but I don&#x27;t think we could remove as much of the language as we could imagine at first without compromising safety. It also wouldn&#x27;t be \"just a safe C\", because C itself has heaps of accidental complexity (e.g. the way function pointers are declared, integer promotions, implicit conversions, the antiquated textual inclusion compilation model that is prone to ODR violations and complicates build systems, array decay, and so on...) that would need to be removed. reply gary17the 13 hours agorootparentprev> Now can I have just a safe C without all the other stuff, pretty please? :)Hmmmmm, if you are not being forced by others into any particular Rust feature set (standard) and you are not being forced into any preexisting Rust codebase, then perhaps just forget the entire standard library, traits, async, etc. and go Bare Metal Rust[1], using only the Rust language features that you need and interfacing with external C APIs through Foreign Function Interface[2].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;comprehensive-rust&#x2F;bare-metal.html[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;nomicon&#x2F;ffi.html reply parentheses 18 hours agoparentprevThe problem with Rust is learning it for...> when I have a good project for it... is a bad idea. I&#x27;ve heard this from several programmers who now use Rust professionally, but don&#x27;t have first-hand experience about it. Their take can be boiled down to:Rust has a learning curve that will mean that the first version will invariably be throw-away. Developing a mental model for how to change memory management structures to please the borrow checker and properly encode ownership seems like the biggest hurdle to writing good Rust.I believe this is the main reason Rust adoption isn&#x27;t skyrocketing, but still growing. The \"onboarding\" for Rust is more labor intensive and therefore disincentivizes its use. reply bornfreddy 15 hours agorootparentI understand it will be a throwaway project, that&#x27;s fine. But it helps me learn if I have a goal in front of me. reply masklinn 19 hours agoparentprev> One example:Your example is a minor but quite useful piece of syntactic sugar, which was introduced a few years in following a similar construct being successful in Swift.

So if you&#x27;re reading any introductory material after Nov. 2019, or anything after 2018 that isn&#x27;t related to asynchronicity&#x2F;futures&#x2F;etc., it&#x27;ll be reasonably similar to modern code. reply justinpombrio 19 hours agorootparentprevNo, introductory Rust code would not have become dated in the past few years. It&#x27;s possible there would be slightly shorter ways to do some things using new standard library functions. reply mhb 19 hours agorootparentprev [–] And has it? reply oconnor663 19 hours agorootparentNo it&#x27;s still good. reply rewmie 19 hours agorootparentprev [–] That&#x27;s perhaps the most pressing problem of Rust: not providing a concrete specification that can be targeted by projects and implementations. reply CoastalCoder 19 hours agorootparentI get the impression that Rust revisions are (at least intended to be?) backwards compatible: [0]Are there are good workarounds when breaking changes to occur? No idea if&#x2F;how well breaking language changes can be isolated to stay within individual crates.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;subscription.packtpub.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;programming&#x2F;978178934... reply rewmie 18 hours agorootparent> I get the impression that Rust revisions are (at least intended to be?) backwards compatibleI don&#x27;t think that matters at all. If I try to build a new project with an older version of Rust, the compiler will still throw errors when stumbling upon newer features. reply CoastalCoder 18 hours agorootparent> If I try to build a new project with an older version of Rust, the compiler will still throw errors when stumbling upon newer features.Usually when people worry about language evolution, the concern is that a newer compiler can&#x27;t handle older code. reply estebank 16 hours agorootparentprevIs there any language toolchain that isn&#x27;t absolutely static capable of having not only backwards compatibility but also forwards compatibility? If I try to open an MS Office XP file in MS Office 97, it will fail. If I try to run a new linux application that uses a new syscall in an older kernel, it will fail. If I try to use structural pattern matching in Python 3.9, it will fail. How is Rust any different?If the concern is that projects are using \"too new a rustc version\", then your beef is with those projects, but be advised that demanding open source projects not use newer versions of their toolchains can be a big ask that increases their workloads and they might not be amenable to cater to your usecase.Finally, because every Rust version is backwards compatibility, there&#x27;s no reason for builders and developers to not use the latest stable release as quickly as feasible, all existing projects will continue compiling. reply umanwizard 19 hours agorootparentprev [–] That&#x27;s indeed a problem, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the most pressing one, since it&#x27;s common to the majority of widely-used languages. reply rewmie 18 hours agorootparent [–] > since it&#x27;s common to the majority of widely-used languages.I don&#x27;t think so.Both C and C++ are specified in international standards. That&#x27;s the gold standard.Java has very concrete versioning and specification process.Python is also exemplary in its release and versioning process.C# even breaks down versioning in terms of both CLR and fundamental frameworks.Exactly which widely used language do you think is missing from that list? reply dureuill 51 minutes agorootparent [–] The person you&#x27;re responding to was specifically responding to your criticism that Rust does not provide a specification that implementations can target.You&#x27;re now listing languages, such as Python, that don&#x27;t have a specification, so it is unclear what your criticism actually is.By python&#x27;s standards, Rust is very good: a lot fewer breaking changes (changes are tested against the entire, huge, open source ecosystem to check if they are breaking, I think this level of testing is unparalleled), the release and versioning process is extremely clear (one minor release every six weeks, patch releases to address unexpected regressions + security issues), and it also have a really well specified evolution process through the RFC process. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "Andrew Kelley - So Long, Twitter and Reddit (2023 Aug 23) So Long, Twitter and Reddit It's been over three years since my last blog post. I think that the website code started to feel like it had bitrotted, and so making new blog posts became onerous. But I've taken the time to redo this website using Zig, so it's quite easy to add blog posts now, and plus I added dark mode. Twitter Over the past few years I amassed a healthy number of followers on Twitter by posting screenshots, demos, and small progress updates for the Zig programming language. It felt good to gain an audience and have my perspective and efforts weighed more heavily in the court of public opinion. However, I always knew that it would need to end. It's not really possible to use Twitter without at least a little bit of doomscrolling, and that activity took a toll on me emotionally. I think that the core concept of a \"tweet\" is fundamentally unhealthy, because by design it promotes angry and extreme content. Nuance and subtlety is impossible to distinguish from dog whistling. Most users don't understand that by \"dunking\" on someone, they are actually promoting the content. In summary, it gave me a darker feeling about the world in general, and in exchange, did not offer much to enrich my life. So, when the enshittification process kicked into high gear with the Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, this was the perfect opportunity for me to make my exit. It has now been a few months since I downloaded all my data and deleted my account, and in retrospect it was so, so worth it. I feel more optimistic about the world and human society in general. I interact with people around me with fewer preconceived judgements about their belief systems. And finally, I have more nuanced conversations with my wife and friends about politics and other hot topics, without worrying that I'm going to come off as dog whistling or naysaying. One thing I do miss is to have the ability to correct misinformation that I stumble upon in the wild. For example, somebody linked me to this tweet: I cannot stop thinking about this. Andrew created Zig and ~15 years ago asked on SO how to open a file in C++ (screenshot of this StackOverflow question) if you take this in any other way than this is incredible and motivating that you can accomplish anything with time + effort then you nuts/sad It's a sweet sentiment! Unfortunately it's based on a bit of a misunderstanding. If you look at the date the question was asked, it was August 11th, 2008. According to Wikipedia, StackOverflow launched on September 15th, 2008. How is this possible? I'll tell you - if you look at the citation, it's a link to the launch announcement on Joel Spolsky's blog - a blog that I was a huge fan of when I was 20 years old. The fact is that Stack Overflow actually was annouced before that, on a podcast episode with Jeff Atwood. Being a bored intern at Lockheed Martin, because they failed to find me anything to do besides \"learn XML\", I enthusiastically participated in the launch of Stack Overflow, including asking basic questions such as \"How do you open a file in C++?\" in order to farm karma points. And it definitely worked! I have edit powers on that website now, and you can bet your ass I use them to clean up misleading suggestions and stinky opinions whenever I see them. Now, I don't want to poop on ThePrimeagen's parade, so I can find him some replacement lore. Here you go, enjoy! Binary files - Programmers Heaven I don't have a clue about binary files. I'm a good programmer, have read more programming books than I can count, but still have no knowlege about binary files. Can you read them? Will they look like text? Is it good to use them? How can I print to a binary file, and then retreive from a binary file? I was 14 years old when I wrote this cringefest. I think ThePrimeagen's take can survive transplanted from the Stack Overflow question to this forum post. Reddit Unlike Twitter, where I find the elemental unit of socializing problematic in and of itself, I think the Reddit formula is solid gold. This one is a case of malevolent platform stewards. I expect this from every platform run by for-profit entities, where the goal is not to serve the users, but to milk them for capital gains. The grim reaper of capitalism has come for Reddit. Right now, venture capitalists are freaking out about \"AI\". Publicly-traded businesses with access to structured user speech that can be used as training data are rushing to build a moat around that data. That's why Twitter prevented viewing tweets from logged out users, and Reddit locked down its APIs despite it causing a massive protest from the moderators who do the actual labor to keep the website running. Detecting that Reddit enshittification was reaching terminal levels, I decided that during these protests was the ideal time to close the /r/zig subreddit, which I was currently a moderator of. I closed the subreddit, downloaded all my user data, and permanently deleted my reddit account, leaving moderation to Loris Cro, VP of Community of Zig Software Foundation. Once Loris was the sole moderator, he decided to change the subreddit to read-only mode. However, this was thwarted today when a troll (check their comment history) performed a hostile takeover in broad daylight and reopened the sub. It appears that Reddit admins are perfectly willing to forcibly replace moderators in an effort to keep the system churning out user data. Those Large Language Models are hungry! Anyway, I don't consider this to be a problem; it is outside of my control what Reddit does with its own data. I just want to make it crystal clear that Zig, Zig Software Foundation, and myself are not in any way affiliated with /r/zig. That subreddit is now run by a third party and all signs point to a high likelihood of problematic behavior happening there which I definitely want to avoid being associated with. If you want an alternative to a zig subreddit, give Ziggit a try. This is the Discourse forum software run by dude_the_builder, a friendly Zig community member, and I find it to be a healthy and rewarding way of socializing with other community members. Moving Forward I have a Mastodon account, but I don't love it, for the same reasons I didn't like Twitter. In addition, I think that way of consuming content is generally like watching mainstream TV or listening to radio with ads. You're letting a bunch of people who aren't really that important to you, or qualified to do the job, be the content curators for you. Discord has been decent for a while. I suspect enshittification will commence soon, so we should be on the lookout for an alternative over the next five years. I'm going to look into setting up an RSS reader for myself and start hunting for high quality blogs. And finally, I will be redirecting my micro-blogging energy that was previously wasted on Twitter into actual-blogging energy here. Thanks for reading my blog post.

Projects that try to funnel everything onto Discord are (a) losing anyone who thinks joining an 800 person chatroom doesn&#x27;t sound fun, and (b) always seem to wind up being very irritable at people who join and immediately ask all 800 people their common question, despite Discord being extremely poorly searchable. reply gabereiser 7 hours agoparentDiscord is not a social platform. It&#x27;s a chatroom for gamers, to share memes and voice chat while they play . It&#x27;s not a base for documentation. It&#x27;s not a platform for your next product (other than a bot..) launch. It&#x27;s poorly designed for searching, for knowledge, for connecting. It&#x27;s 2020s version of ICQ. reply tmpX7dMeXU 6 hours agorootparentI find it utterly insufferable. I, a very technically capable person, really struggle with using Discord. I can’t help but feel that people that misuse Discord in this way are doing it from a place from extreme ignorance and hubris. It is so blatantly not intended or appropriate for what a bunch of people use it for. The only thing it has going for it is that the person setting up the community knows how to use it. It is utterly inscrutable from the perspective of an outsider, trying to look past all the stuff that is at the very least using gamer jargon, if not functionally built explicitly for gamers in a way that is not useful for others.REALLY cynically, I think that Discord has a feature set that the admin &#x2F; moderator &#x2F; power user functionality of Discord gets a particular sort of controlling “community manager” very excited. They can have their bots and username colours and whatever else set up just the way they like them, usually in a way that people don’t really care about. A means of a power-seeker to tinker around with community dynamics in a way that is far from having an in-person analogue. reply judge2020 6 hours agorootparentTo be fair to the people running Discord, they&#x27;ve been trying to simplify and change it.

Because everyone loves needing an irc bouncer to be able to assimilate the context of the active conversation when they log in. reply gabereiser 6 hours agorootparentExactly. Back in 2012 or so I wrote a web chat system that had all that (minus the screenshare & voice chat) and it was quite a challenge supporting all the permutations of links, images, emoji&#x27;s, bbcode, etc. It&#x27;s a pos in today&#x27;s standards but back before slack it was \"on the right track\". Slack pretty much came out of nowhere and killed the effort though. To your point about a bouncer, I think a lot of folks are nostalgic and forget what a shitty system IRC was. Net-splits, bouncers, no filters or mod tools other than kick. No embedded media unless your client did magic.

CheckIn what way? verification emails don&#x27;t count. And for many servers where spam and troll accounts is a problem, custom bots and new member screening features deal with this - since they don&#x27;t want to spend every waking moment staring at the server and banning people who join and immediately cause issues. reply gabereiser 6 hours agorootparentOkta recently partnered with a few folks to tackle this. They published a thing [1] in April. Fraudulent registrations and bots are being screened using Shape which was acquired by F5 [2]. I&#x27;m not saying this problem has been solved, but it&#x27;s an area of active concentration. For most folks, the offerings are more than adequate. For the top saas or platforms, you&#x27;ll probably always have this issue as you&#x27;re a lucrative target.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sec.okta.com&#x2F;shareddetections[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.f5.com&#x2F;cloud&#x2F;products&#x2F;bot-defense replyWA 1 hour agorootparentprevIRC…?

You’re hanging with your friends playing games, you show them that side project you’ve been working on, they all love it and it grows into a shit show of channels, rules, bots, response emoji’s to indicate intent, merging with other servers, with a whole new set of rules, channels, bots, mods.It’s unprofessional. AI tools that rely on Discord as their delivery, unprofessional. Possibly even down right illegal. Not the act of using a bot, but what service they offer through that bot. reply extr 7 hours agoparentprevOne way that Discord is similar to Reddit (and, imo, a reason for it&#x27;s relative success) is that it operates on the same authorization model. A single pseudonymous account gets you access to many disparate communities. In either case, once you have an account the activation energy needed to join that subreddit&#x2F;server is very low. reply sundvor 6 hours agoparentprevI manage a Discord server for a few friends, topics are gaming related (DCS World primarily, but also Star Citizen and iRacing) - could easily be other hobbies.I have structured the channels to support the learning journey that DCS is.I absolutely love it, so incredibly useful. It&#x27;s very easy to share resources, pictures - anything. The voice chat is also superb, just hop into a fixed hangout channel that anyone can join. I&#x27;ll often just go into one early in the night, so that my friends (all over the world) can see me and hop on if they want.I have joined server vendor specific discord servers, as well as racing league ones. The fact that they are invitation based is perfect.Furthermore the scan on screen QR code with phone to sign in on desktop merits special mention, another massive usability win.I specifically love how siloed it is or can be. Sure there is a lot of fluff they&#x27;re putting in (game stuff in the message editor etc) which I just ignore; I can only hope they never change this core design and turn it into way more than it is now.(Have been using it heavily since 2020, but started before then - fwiw. It absolutely helped me get through some of the strictest lock downs in the western world. Oh and I&#x27;m in my fifties, been on computers since the Vic20.

I hike trails and go to the gym at early hours because the vibe is right.Social media is like the mall, or a stadium. Some people like going there, and do so often. They’re excited to see Taylor Swift with 80K other people. They go to the mall early on a weekday for a sneaker drop. I don’t get it but c’est la vie. That’s their life.I don’t rant about the 80K people in the stadium for the big show. I’m sad there aren’t more quiet cafes. I spend time in countries where quiet cafes are more the norm. Maybe I’ll move there some day.I’m also reminded by my parents who talk about the old country, or how grand it was to buy a house in LA in the 60s for $14K.

I suspect enshittification will commence soonDiscord was enshittified years ago. It&#x27;s just that nothing really changed recently, unlike Twitter&#x2F;Reddit, so it&#x27;s not making the news.You&#x27;ve got a platform that&#x27;s completely inaccessible without an account. Acquiring an account often requires handing over a mobile number. And Discord can then ban you arbitrarily, despite never posting a single message (the one saving grace is that you can email them about it, and they&#x27;ll often restore the brand new account, if you don&#x27;t mind the weeks worth of waiting).And that doesn&#x27;t cover the five minute rigamarole of logging in (enter user&#x2F;pass, fill in captcha, get told that this is an unrecognised IP&#x2F;device, wait for email to arrive, open Discord email, click on link*, click Authorize, fill in user&#x2F;pass again, solve captcha) - why do I have to do this just to view content?* Bonus: the link has like a ~5 minute expiry, so you can&#x27;t just go and do something else during the process, or you&#x27;ll have to start over from the beginning reply seanhunter 7 hours agoparentGoodness knows you can validly critise discord for any number of reasons but the time taken to log in on an untrusted device isn&#x27;t really one that resonates with me. I have done this recently and the process took all of 5 seconds.Here&#x27;s the process if you have a phone and want to do it fast:1. Click login on discord on the untrusted device. It shows a qr code next to the credentials box.2. Log in on phone (which for me is just a faceid check).3. Scan qr code. Now you&#x27;re logged in on the untrusted device.No captcha, no username&#x2F;password typing on the untrusted device, no second factor even (because your phone is logged in using 2FA so you&#x27;re using that trust) and definitely no email verification. reply RaisingSpear 6 hours agorootparentGood to know. I refuse to let a bunch of things touch my phone (Discord doesn&#x27;t exactly have a stellar privacy record), so have never tried, but for those that don&#x27;t care so much about privacy, it sounds reasonable.But hopefully you can at least understand how unnecessarily convoluted Discord makes the process if you don&#x27;t have or want to use a phone. reply seanhunter 3 hours agorootparentSo if you choose not to do the thing that is designed to make the process simple then the process is exactly the same as it is for me on just about any other site&#x2F;system when I log in on an untrusted device. I don&#x27;t really see it as unnecessarily convoluted, but even if it was, you inflicted that on yourself did you not?I care a lot about privacy and for me personally, logging in to discord on my own phone in order to log in on seamlessly on an untrusted device seems less bad than logging in to some arbitrary system using my actual creds. The latter combines any threat from discord with threats from password sniffing either while I&#x27;m getting creds to the device or on the device itself. reply RaisingSpear 2 hours agorootparent> the process is exactly the same as it is for me on just about any other site&#x2F;system when I log in on an untrusted deviceThis is not my experience.

When Apollo got shut down, my usage of Reddit died with it.

I tried twitter for 2-3 months. I found the quality of almost the entire user base to approach quality reminiscent of Markov chains. I amassed a handful of followers. 95% of whom were bots. With the change to X, I think it’s about time to wrap it up.Funnily enough, the en-shitification of both has brought me back to my original love: reading.

    "originBody": "___ Coffee offers performance boost for concrete SKIP TO CONTENT RMIT Australia Students Alumni Staff Library RMIT Online Courses Study with us Life at RMIT About Research Partner International Coffee offers performance boost for concrete Engineers in Australia have found a way of making stronger concrete with roasted used-coffee grounds, to give the drink-additive a “double shot” at life and reduce waste going to landfills. Lead author Dr Rajeev Roychand from RMIT University said the team developed a technique to make concrete 30% stronger by turning waste coffee grounds into biochar, using a low-energy process without oxygen at 350 degrees Celsius. “The disposal of organic waste poses an environmental challenge as it emits large amounts of greenhouse gases including methane and carbon dioxide, which contribute to climate change,” said Roychand, from the School of Engineering. Australia generates 75 million kilograms of ground coffee waste every year – most of it goes to landfills. Globally, 10 billion kilograms of spent coffee is generated annually. Published in the Journal of Cleaner Production, the study by RMIT engineers is the first to prove that waste coffee grounds can be used to improve concrete. Coffee offers performance boost for concrete Engineers in Australia have found a way of making stronger concrete with roasted used-coffee grounds, to give the drink-additive a “double shot” at life and reduce waste going to landfills. “The inspiration for our work was to find an innovative way of using the large amounts of coffee waste in construction projects rather than going to landfills – to give coffee a ‘double shot’ at life,” said Roychand, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at RMIT. “Several councils that are battling with the disposal of organic waste have shown interest in our work. “They have already engaged us for their upcoming infrastructure projects incorporating pyrolysed forms of different organic wastes.” Pyrolysis involves heating organic waste in the absence of oxygen. Drew Paten, Co-founder of Talwali, listens to Dr Rajeev Roychand explain how they used spent coffee grounds in their concrete, with fellow RMIT researchers Dr Shannon Kilmartin-Lynch and Dr Mohammad Saberian (pictured left to right). Credit: Carelle Mulawa-Richards, RMIT University The construction industry can support the recycling of waste Joint lead author, Dr Shannon Kilmartin-Lynch, a Vice-Chancellor’s Indigenous Postdoctoral Research Fellow at RMIT, said construction industries around the world could play a role in transforming this waste into a valuable resource. “Inspiration for my research, from an Indigenous perspective, involves Caring for Country, ensuring there’s a sustainable life cycle for all materials and avoiding things going into landfill to minimise the impact on the environment,” said Kilmartin-Lynch from the School of Engineering. “The concrete industry has the potential to contribute significantly to increasing the recycling of organic waste such as used coffee. “Our research is in the early stages, but these exciting findings offer an innovative way to greatly reduce the amount of organic waste that goes to landfill.” Samples of unroasted coffee beans, roasted coffee beans, spent ground coffee and the team’s coffee biochar. Credit: Carelle Mulawa-Richards, RMIT University Preserving a precious natural resource Corresponding author and research team leader Professor Jie Li said the coffee biochar can replace a portion of the sand that was used to make concrete. “The ongoing extraction of natural sand around the world – typically taken from river beds and banks – to meet the rapidly growing demands of the construction industry has a big impact on the environment,” Li said. 50 billion tonnes of natural sand are used in construction projects globally every year. “There are critical and long-lasting challenges in maintaining a sustainable supply of sand due to the finite nature of resources and the environmental impacts of sand mining,” Li said. “With a circular-economy approach, we could keep organic waste out of landfill and also better preserve our natural resources like sand.” Co-researcher Dr Mohammad Saberian said the construction industry needed to explore alternative raw materials to ensure its sustainability. “Our research team has gained extensive experience in developing highly optimised biochars from different organic wastes, including wood biochar, food-waste biochar, agricultural waste biochar, and municipal solid-waste biochar, for concrete applications,” Saberian said.

One might imagine a law that says \"all new cement products must be at least 20% carbon by weight, or pay a $1000&#x2F;ton tax for missing carbon\".That incentivises locking up carbon in structures, in a form unlikely to escape anytime soon, and gives a proportional fee for anyone who doesn&#x27;t wish to do so (for example, concrete for very specialist purposes). reply CoastalCoder 18 hours agoparentCould such a fee create perverse incentives, like in the anecdotal India cobra effect [0].E.g., to avoid the $1000&#x2F;ton missing-carbon tax, use a manufacturing technique that only adds $500&#x2F;ton to the cost of concrete, but also generates far more atmospheric CO2 in the process.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Perverse_incentive reply blueblisters 18 hours agorootparentNitpick but how would that be a perverse incentive? That would just be an unintended consequence. reply noodle 18 hours agorootparentBecause the intent of such a hypothetical law would be to reduce&#x2F;capture C02, but the end result of it is that it financially incentivizes generating more C02 through some unexpended&#x2F;unanticipated means.An unintended consequence might be that yes companies do correctly follow the law and adding carbon to concrete is successful, but also adding carbon to concrete in high enough volumes makes the lifetime of the concrete lesser when exposed to rainwater for long enough, or something like that, resulting in the need to replace the concrete more frequently.Its the difference between people acting in good faith vs neutral&#x2F;bad faith with respect to the intent of the law&#x2F;regulation&#x2F;etc.. reply nvader 16 hours agorootparentNitpick: The O in CO2 stands for Oxygen, and is the letter O. It looks like you&#x27;ve used the numeral zero, which looks similar but is not interchangeable. reply eru 15 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s why your regulation should just directly tax what you don&#x27;t like (like CO2 emissions), instead of going via some weird proxy that&#x27;s prone to being gamed. reply rolandog 16 hours agorootparentprevWell, you gotta compare the cost-per-kilo of setting up a coffee grounds collection program that gathers X% of the 30+ billion ton&#x2F;yr of concrete that is used each year.If the regulations are not properly written, they could be an incentive to start cutting down trees to turn to charcoal as a carbon filler. Companies are sometimes heartless like that. reply xapata 15 hours agorootparentIf tree cutting were also taxed appropriately, that specific example wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. reply rolandog 5 hours agorootparentAgreed, that&#x27;s why we need properly written regulations that don&#x27;t leave ambiguities to be debated after the law is written.And also, we should probably normalize amendments to laws, instead of canonizing them. reply Kerb_ 16 hours agorootparentprevIt would still probably be a better carbon capture plan than capturing it for temporary use in the fuel supply as ethanol. But worse of a measure than just burying the trees reply standyro 18 hours agorootparentprevSounds like the same thing to me. Incentivizing something that is unintended. reply InitialLastName 17 hours agorootparentA perverse incentive (like what our ancestor is correctly noting) involves incentivizing something that is antithetical to the goal (not just a side effect). In this case, a policy whose goal is \"reduce carbon in the atmosphere\" leads to an outcome of \"increase carbon in the atmosphere\". An unintended effect could just be \"makes all the buildings weaker\" or \"bridges smell like coffee\". reply LordDragonfang 17 hours agorootparentprevI mean, in a sane world this would be accompanied by a tax on emitting atmospheric CO2 as well. Though I suppose it would make more sense to just allow the amount of sequestered carbon as a write-off against the CO2 tax; no need to set a specific target like \"20%\". reply calmdownpeople 18 hours agoparentprevIsn&#x27;t the carbon already locked away in the coffee grounds? Why spend energy and hence more CO2 emissions on charring the grounds? reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentBecause coffee grounds would actually make terrible aggregate, as complex organic and formerly alive compounds, there&#x27;s a lot of potential for weird chemical breakdown that could harm the concrete or anything else in the concrete.Char is pretty chemically stable, because carbon is very chemically stable. reply tedivm 18 hours agorootparentprevThe coffee grounds are biodegradable, and that process causes CO2 and methane to be released. reply soperj 18 hours agorootparentJust to clarify, methane is only released if it biodegraded by anaerobic bacteria, if it&#x27;s biodegraded by aerobic bacteria it only produces CO2. reply jayd16 18 hours agorootparentprevWe could carbonize the biomass then cram it in a landfill and... wait that&#x27;s just reburying charcoal. reply thfuran 16 hours agorootparentMy vote is for sequestering carbon as an ever-growing mountain range of diamonds. reply Eldt 18 hours agorootparentprevWhere are the grounds going to be stored? reply jeffbee 22 hours agoparentprevWow $1000&#x2F;ton instead of 20% carbon? Are you also proposing a $160&#x2F;gallon fuel tax? reply londons_explore 22 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s usually better to have a high fee for things you don&#x27;t want people to do rather than outright banning something.For example, rather than saying \"planes must not be louder than 80db to land at this airport at night\", you could instead say \"planes must pay a $$$$ fee to the city for each db over 80db to land at the airport at night\". The large fee means loud planes will very rarely land, but when they do it was because it was really worth it to them. The large fee compensates local residents in the form of reduced city taxes over time. If it starts happening too often and the residents don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re getting a good deal, they can increase the fee. reply frognumber 18 hours agorootparentI agree, but ideally, the high fee should be proportionate.Cement is about $130&#x2F;metric ton. A 30% surcharge seems comfortable. A 100%, I won&#x27;t squirm at. An 800% surcharge feels punitive, rather than good policy.I&#x27;d like far more surcharges for consumer-unfriendly and environmentally-unfriendly actions, but mostly in the 1-5% range. That&#x27;s enough to impact most margin-constrained firms, but not so much as to avoid innovation or distort strategy.Examples:- Make products repairable- Provide service manuals and full schematics- Provide parts at no more than e.g. 2x cost of the product (e.g. if I wanted to buy all the parts for my washing machine to build a new one, it might cost $1000 instead of $500)- Provide long support lives for e.g. security updates and parts- Make firmware &#x2F; software open-source (consider my air conditioner, rather than Microsoft Office)- Use standard batteries and chargers- Avoid plastic- Minimize packaging... etc.In a commodity market (like basic air conditioners), a 5% surcharge is way more than enough to influence behavior. On the other hand, if I have a genuinely better battery, or something super-confidential in my firmware, I can still keep it secret at modest cost. reply vGPU 12 hours agorootparentprevYes, that would be a great example, especially when applied to gasoline.What could possibly go wrong from adding a sudden huge load to our already unstable and crumbling infrastructure?It’s not like we don’t have any spare parts for the majority of our grid or anything, right?Oh. reply mrguyorama 16 hours agorootparentprev>It&#x27;s usually better to have a high fee for things you don&#x27;t want people to do rather than outright banning something.Why? Any rule with a fine is a rule that the wealthy can just ignore. Why is that a desired attribute of the system?Your example is great because it doesn&#x27;t mean that planes very rarely land there and are very important, but rather that rich people land there to get a burger next door whenever they want.>If it starts happening too often and the residents don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re getting a good deal, they can increase the fee.I don&#x27;t see how more money makes you sleep better at night when the rich private plane owner is flying over your house most nights. reply bastawhiz 16 hours agorootparent> I don&#x27;t see how more money makes you sleep better at nightNot paying property tax would definitely make me sleep better at night. reply burkaman 16 hours agorootparentprev> when they do it was because it was really worth it to themBut this is totally unrelated to why the thing was banned in the first place. We don&#x27;t ban things out of a moral concern that the perpetrators haven&#x27;t fully considered their lives and decided what&#x27;s really important to them, we ban things because we don&#x27;t want them to happen.I also disagree that \"I am willing to pay a lot of money\" has any correlation with \"this action is worth a lot to me\". To make that relationship work, the fine would have to be set at \"whatever you personally consider to be a lot of money\". reply feldrim 20 hours agorootparentprev> The large fee compensates local residents in the form of reduced city taxes over time.I wish lowering the taxes by compensating with other means was a more common approach. The most usual approach is accumulating income in whatever way possible. reply 29083011397778 19 hours agorootparentIsn&#x27;t this in part because so many cities need all the cash they can get to fund individually-insolvent infrastructure? [0] If the goal is to be able to maintain roads that can&#x27;t pay for themselves by enabling revenue generation, then I can absolutely see why cities would need to accumulate income in whatever way possible.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.strongtowns.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;2019&#x2F;8&#x2F;25&#x2F;if-strong-town... reply zbrozek 18 hours agorootparentIn my town&#x27;s it&#x27;s to pay an infinite parade of the city manager&#x27;s friends as consultants on various non-issues. reply sgtnoodle 9 hours agorootparentYou should become one of those consultants! reply danielrhodes 17 hours agorootparentprevWhat types of activities does this apply to and where does it not apply? Just for the sake of argument, could this also apply to something like murder? i.e. if you wanted to murder somebody, you can do so only if you pay a super high fee otherwise go to prison. If you pay the fee, it must be worth it to you. reply jkestner 16 hours agorootparentIt already practically does. You just pay the fee to sufficiently high-powered lawyers. Or spend the money to incorporate, where your actions can be divorced from the consequences and maybe you pay whatever the actuarial cost of a human life is. reply Reefersleep 17 hours agorootparentprevAKA legalizing murder for rich people? reply olddustytrail 17 hours agorootparentprevThat was known as a weregild. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weregild reply danielrhodes 5 hours agorootparentSounds similar to life insurance. reply carlosjobim 18 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s usually better to have a high fee for things you don&#x27;t want people to do rather than outright banning something.Even better is putting a high fee on things normal people have to do, so that you can continue to finance friends and family in the nomenklatura and make sure they afford everything that pleases them. reply ben_w 21 hours agorootparentprev> Are you also proposing a $160&#x2F;gallon fuel tax?I&#x27;ve witnessed two political decisions that led to no cars on the roads (the UK fuel strike 23 years ago, and the COVID lockdowns), and in both cases they made the sub&#x2F;urban environment better immediately.As soon as batteries or whatever can replace hydrocarbon engines for the average person, then sure $160US&#x2F;gallon or whatever. reply jeffbee 20 hours agorootparentFor a long time I have casually suggested a fuel tax that goes up by a dime per gallon per month, and just keeps increasing at that rate until the situation improves. It would take years for America to equal the OECD average fuel tax at that pace. reply londons_explore 20 hours agorootparentThe idea of \"increase fuel tax 1% each month that our country emits more capita carbon than the world average, and decrease them 1% if we emit less\" would seem like a very sensible law.But alas, very few laws use that kind of structure - not only in the USA, but anywhere in the world, and not just for environmental stuff, but for any regulated thing.Instead lawmakers seem to prefer to see some problem, make some move, and then if the problem still exists repeat the process.I don&#x27;t really understand the aversion to &#x27;automation&#x27; of that loop. reply euroderf 20 hours agorootparentSomething something software deployment something something. reply vGPU 12 hours agorootparentprevAnd how much do you think the price of groceries will go up? reply gottorf 18 hours agorootparentprevNo cars on the roads works for short periods of time, but with 15 million people living in e.g. the London metro, you need something to move 15 million people&#x27;s worth of living logistics (food, goods for sale, garbage removal, etc.). Those are all carried by wheeled vehicles, whether it be cars, vans, or lorries. The niceties of the suburban or urban areas aren&#x27;t possible without them.Even if they were all electric or powered by unicorn farts or whatever, it&#x27;s still millions of multi-ton steel vehicles zipping around leaving as much trace as a multi-ton moving thing would. I grant you at least the air quality would be better without internal combustion.In the end, all Europe is filled with cute little walkable towns, yet people still congregate to the congested, filthy, car-filled metros, for some reason. And at a certain level of built-up population density, you just can&#x27;t have a very nice natural environment; the brief moments of peace you observed during the Covid lockdowns or whatever can&#x27;t last, because that would mean the city itself dies. reply KptMarchewa 18 hours agorootparentLogistics take only fraction of road and parking space that personal transportation takes.Argument that we&#x27;ll need to live with 5% or 10% or 20% of traffic we have today, so we can as well do nothing is dishonest. reply gottorf 16 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s also dishonest to not include an answer for personal transportation. \"Public transit\" is a handwavy answer, since obviously if personal transportation means are removed, more public transit will be needed, meaning more vehicles (be it trains, buses, or taxis) will be on the road.Unless your solution is that people should just move less? reply michaelmrose 16 hours agorootparentprevYou are going to need to grandfather users of existing used cars if you don&#x27;t want a mob with pitchforks and torches. Even when electric cars are affordable on average its necessary to understand the effect on price and value that would be caused by changing incentives. There are around 250 million fossil fuel cars on the road and $160&#x2F;gallon fuel taxes would make those cars value effectively go to zero while sending electric cars price to the moon.Even if scaled in over time to avoid breaking the economy you would have a long tail of cheap used cars which would be difficult for users to up and replace owned by those least likely to be able to absorb the shock.You have folks commuting in a $5000 car for 10 years for which $20,000 would be a financial death sentence. There are plenty of folks who absolutely need a car to be able to work and continually keep an older used car for a LOT less than average.Not all of these folks could even get a car loan for a compliant car so you would be basically telling them to go fuck themselves.It makes more sense to simply mandate phasing out manufacturing or importing new gas powered consumer cars and let cars age out rather than using extreme gas taxes as a lever. reply owisd 14 hours agorootparentYou would direct the revenue from the tax into grants for those least able to upgrade to electric on their own. London is doing such a scrappage scheme right now for the latest increase in emissions standards. reply vGPU 12 hours agorootparentYou mean another cash for clunkers scheme? Like the one that has caused the prices of cars to skyrocket already?Yeah, great idea there. reply owisd 1 hour agorootparentCausing car prices to increase post-recession was kind of the point of cash for clunkers, but I don’t see why something more targeted has to have the same effect. reply3pt14159 22 hours agorootparentprevJust imagine he said \"say\" or \"for example\" and see how it reads to you. This is internet work, not serious business. reply jeffbee 22 hours agorootparentI don’t think you can wave off orders of magnitude with either of those clauses. reply anigbrowl 18 hours agorootparentGP just pulled a number out of the air. You could have just said it was disproportionate to the actual cost of concrete rather than reacting emotionally. I was surprised to learn concrete is only $130&#x2F;ton, I thought it would be a lot more. reply jeffbee 13 hours agorootparentIt doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with the price of concrete, though. It has to do with the price of carbon. If valuing carbon captured in concrete at $5000 per ton, the equivalent emissions tax on burning carbon is absurdly high. reply karaterobot 17 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s a skill we all need to learn if we are to avoid completely missing the actual point and getting focused on the least important aspect of what somebody said. replybjterry 22 hours agorootparentprevI was curious what it would actually be. Assuming a full offset with expensive direct air capture of CO2 ($238 &#x2F; tonne [0]), the carbon tax would only be $2.12 per gallon for 8,887 grams CO2 [1].[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;commentaries&#x2F;is-carbon-capture-too-expen...

The other part is sequestering it for millions of years. Concrete is a great place to do that, where many other &#x27;sequestering&#x27; techniques might only last tens or hundreds of years, requiring the capture fee be paid again and again and again. reply londons_explore 21 hours agorootparentprevRegular concrete is about $130&#x2F;ton. Concrete products like decorative paving can cost $1500&#x2F;ton installed. Specialist carbon-free concrete for those would cost $1500 + $200 = $1700. An 11% surcharge doesn&#x27;t seem an unreasonable for choosing to do something the &#x27;hurt the environment&#x27; way - anything less and I suspect many would say &#x27;nah, don&#x27;t bother&#x27;. reply empath-nirvana 18 hours agorootparentprevThere&#x27;s a very strong climate argument for taxing fossil fuels at rates that make it not economically viable to use for nearly anything. reply rpmisms 17 hours agoparentprevShould be a tax break per percentage of carbon up to the safe limit. Same with corporate taxes. Corporations should receive a progressive tax break for their lowest-paid employee&#x27;s salary. The higher the lower the tax. reply shrubble 18 hours agoparentprevThe greedy oxygen thieves at the UN are only asking for $75&#x2F;ton... reply spoonjim 17 hours agoparentprev“Here we have the newly installed Destructoid 3000, you put panda bears in this end and it burns them up and mixes the ash into the concrete.” reply ghastmaster 18 hours agoparentprevAn alternative to taxing or fees, is to allow the free market to utilize the capital that would have gone to fees to further advance our understanding and capabilities. The technological advances lost due to onerous fees across industries could be keeping us in a CO2 producing scenario. reply Jeff_Brown 18 hours agorootparentTaxes on pollution are by far the most direct and effective way to motivate the free market to work on the pollution problem. It shouldn&#x27;t be a collection of ad-hoc taxes and subusidies; it should be a flat carbon tax equal to the global harm that the carbon does, coupled with a market in offsets.Hoping the market will solve this problem without imposing reasons for it to do so is basically how we got here in the first place. reply ghastmaster 17 hours agorootparent> Hoping the market will solve this problem without imposing reasons for it to do so is basically how we got here in the first place.Humans inherently seek technological advancements. We have been extracting CO2 from the environment from our very beginnings. Cheap energy allows us to do more research and development to escape the carbon dependency. Fees could potentially incentivize the right person at the right time to develop an escape. Depending on that is as much a hope as I have for free market incentives. We&#x27;re both hoping here. reply mgkimsal 18 hours agorootparentprev> is to allow the free market to utilize the capital that would have gone to fees to further advance our understanding and capabilitiesWhat was stopping the &#x27;free market&#x27; from utilizing that capital to further advance our understanding and capabilities? Before &#x27;onerous fees&#x27;, how many large-scale polluters were taking some of their profits and investing in researching how to reduce CO2? reply ghastmaster 18 hours agorootparent>Before &#x27;onerous fees&#x27;, how many large-scale polluters were taking some of their profits and investing in researching how to reduce CO2?Here is one example:>Patent records reveal oil companies actively pursued research into technologies to cut carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change from the 1960s – including early versions of the batteries now deployed to power electric cars such as the Tesla.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2016&#x2F;may&#x2F;20&#x2F;oil-company... reply vineyardmike 17 hours agorootparentFrom the same article:And ExxonMobil funded a disinformation campaigned aimed at discrediting scientists and blocking government efforts to fight climate change for more than 50 years, before publicly disavowing climate denial in 2008.Another quote that ages well:We in the petroleum industry are convinced that by the time a practical electric car can be mass produced and marketed, it will not enjoy any meaningful advantage from an air pollution standpoint,” he told Congress. “Emissions from internal-combustion engines will have long since been controlled.”I don’t think that we should trust companies to act against their best interest just because “capitalism” is a magic word.Why didn’t they spend more profits on research? Why did they lobby against pollution reduction if they’re so advanced? Why did they invent emission reduction technology in 1960, but in 2023 we have a massive pollution problem? The last 60 years could be a thesis to prove your entire premise as flawed. This is proof that they can’t be trusted with their profits, nor their research results. reply ghastmaster 17 hours agorootparentAre we talking about pollution or CO2? Pollution from vehicles is largely controlled. It is not perfect by any means. CO2 is not pollution. It is a necessary component of plant growth and animal life.> Why did they lobby against pollution reductionFor the same reasons I mentioned previously. Arbitrary fees and regulations can stifle the natural advancement. The patent in this case shows that they were working on reducing CO2 emissions which would benefit them in the long run as ICE engines would be cleaner. As such, they would be better competition to future electric competitors. Hence, more oil being purchased for their bottom line.If they spend money and time lobbying and paying fees, that is money that is not spent on productive activities. Furthermore, it costs consumers more to purchase their product. This cost to consumers restricts their ability to invest in themselves and their future. Little Johnny wants to go to school to study clean nuclear fusion? Too bad, Ma & Pa have been paying more for goods and services for 18 years. Little Johnny will have to flip burgers instead. reply michaelmrose 15 hours agorootparentC02 isn&#x27;t a pollutant insofar as any amount being a pure negative but too much of it is obviously negative. This is a distinction that nobody including the parent poster or you are confused about.The free market might over time get us cleaner engines when interests align but in all honestly the biggest factor driving cleaner engines has always been regulation and the next logical step for that regulation is to move towards forbidding the manufacture of new gas powered consumer vehicles which we can likely accomplish by the 2030s with regulation.If too much money is spent lobbying we could very well make the productive part of that equation where money changes hands illegal, watch it become vastly less effective, and watch companies investment in same spin down quickly. reply ghastmaster 14 hours agorootparent>The free market might over time get us cleaner engines when interests align but in all honestly the biggest factor driving cleaner engines has always been regulation...One scientist learned that smog was a result of automobile emissions as early as 1948 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Arie_Jan_Haagen-Smit). That was 56 years after automobiles were first produced. Shortly thereafter, the Federal government started tackling the issue in 1955 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;clean-air-act-overview&#x2F;evolution-clean-a...). Why would companies invest in cleaner emissions if the government was going to make mandates that would throw a wrench in their investments? It has been better for them to wait and see what they have to do. They were never given the chance to self regulate. reply mgkimsal 14 hours agorootparentprevand... the cynic in me thinks that the purpose of that research would be to lock it up and prevent anyone from using it, vs actually deploying it and reducing emissions. reply anonymousab 17 hours agorootparentprev> The technological advances lost due to onerous fees across industries could be keeping us in a CO2 producing scenarioThis seems quite backwards. If there is no incentive or motivating market stimulus, then there is no reason for any company to invest it research anything outside of what makes them the most money. We already know that these companies will not spend capital in those ways, because they already did not do so in the time periods before the associated taxes and fees existed. And to do so without be dereliction of what their shareholders expected and wanted them to do. reply ghastmaster 17 hours agorootparent>If there is no incentive or motivating market stimulusIs the depletion of oil and gas reserves not enough incentive? They will not last forever. In the grand scheme of things it is a small amount of time before we have to convert to nuclear, solar, hydro, and wind or start burning trees en masse again. As the resources are depleted, the price will go up due to limited supply. That price increase will spur R&D. reply svachalek 17 hours agorootparentAbsolutely not. We&#x27;ve got at least 50 years before that&#x27;s an issue. 200 quarterly reports. reply hackerlight 11 hours agorootparentprev> Is the depletion of oil and gas reserves not enough incentive?No, because the problems that face a commons do not create an incentive for the individual. You need to learn this concept:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Tragedy_of_the_commons reply ghastmaster 9 hours agorootparentTragedy of the commons is precisely what I have used to argue that prices will go up because the resources are being depleted. In this case, oil&#x2F;gas is being over harvested by the individual. However, other energy sources are relatively infinite. Oil&#x2F;gas happens to be cheap right now, but in the future it will not be. As the price rises, there becomes a greater incentive to seek other sources. reply hackerlight 7 hours agorootparent> As the price rises, there becomes a greater incentive to seek other sources.This is not a valid or reliable mechanism for correcting misaligned incentives. It may occur by happenstance but is not guaranteed to happen prior to significant damage to the commons. The point of a carbon tax is to create a direct mechanism that corrects incentives in the presence of market failure. I would suggest this article:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Externality replyanigbrowl 18 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;ve tried that approach. It doesn&#x27;t work because many people are greedy and will redirect capital towards marketing efforts to increase their own profit in the short term. reply mrguyorama 16 hours agoprevSo, the \"coffee\" in this study is an intentional clickbait red herring.

[0]Which makes me feel better about scattering our daily coffee grounds onto the lawn and in the garden beds — the grounds will decompose aerobically and are reportedly good for the soil, and with the grounds scattered, the paper filters take up less space in our kitchen-counter composting bucket and bag. (Brewing coffee with a paper filter reduces the grounds&#x27; acidity, which can matter for some types of plant.) [1]Relatedly: For $10 per month, residents of our little enclave city can have their kitchen food waste picked up curbside each week and taken to a local-ish composting facility. The pickup truck used to pick up the compost is gasoline-fueled, but it&#x27;s a start, and it&#x27;s far more convenient than DIY composting. We&#x27;ve been subscribing to that service for a couple of years and have found that we don&#x27;t fill up trash bags to put out for curbside pickup as often, so there&#x27;s a small win there as well.

Landfills are not expected to be used for agriculture almost ever because of contamination with all sorts of waste, heavy metals, etc. (I think a serious decontamination effort would be needed). Of course, it would be good if organic waste was separated and returned to the environment.I&#x27;ve also been wondering about soil depletion. What we do today is use fertilizers, which can be extracted from the ocean or air as Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium, they&#x27;re not expected to be depleted ever (and they&#x27;re the basic elements needed for plants, along with CO2). However I don&#x27;t know the situation of other micronutrients, such as iron, selenium (well known to vegans), copper, etc. (copper is already very difficult and costly to extract). It shouldn&#x27;t be impossible to fertilize micronutrients as well, but that&#x27;s going to be an additional cost and difficulty to agriculture in the future.In regards to this being eco-friendly or not, it really depends, and most likely a 30% reduction in concrete usage would be well worth it, even with soil depletion taken into account. As a senior internet citizen though, I&#x27;m skeptical of those claims, specially with large numbers as those (you see one of those every now and then...). reply onetimeuse92304 21 hours agorootparentAgain, I think it is important to remember WHAT exactly are we comparing.I am not comparing a) throwing coffee grounds into landfill, to b) using coffee grounds for cement.I am comparing a) collecting coffee grounds and use them as a fertiliser, vs b) collecting coffee grounds and using them as an ingredient for cement.Essentially, if you can collect coffee grounds for cement you can also collect them for all sorts of other uses. What I am saying is that, once you went through the trouble of collecting coffee grounds, there are better ways than to use them for cement. reply samwillis 22 hours agoprevIf this helps to reduce the quantity of concrete used that can only be a good thing.

I live in an adobe house, and I wondered for a long time what the difference is between concrete blocks and adobe bricks, in terms of their physico-chemical structure. Adobe has comparable compressive strength to concrete blocks, but unlike concrete will dissolve in water. I always found this a bit mysterious.Turns out that the most significant difference is that in concrete (or any cementitious material), the important molecular bonds are covalent. In adobe the bonds are ionic.Consequently, adding water to adobe easily disrupts the structure by interfering with the ionic bonds (just as it when salt dissolves in), but does essentially nothing to the covalent bonds in concrete.Even cooler, perhaps, is that as the wet adobe dries out again, the same bonds will reform, and you get back to the original state again. reply kibibu 21 hours agorootparentprev> It&#x27;s probably not replacing the cement though -- it&#x27;s almost certainly an additive in the concrete mixture, like flyash.No probably about it.

Building grade sand is scarce and its extraction is environmentally catastrophic. reply laputan_machine 22 hours agorootparentSand is cheaper per kilo than used coffee grounds.\"Building-grade sand\" is sharp sand. It is the cheapest sand you can buy. Roman&#x27;s built things out of their concrete which was full of random bits of rubble, and some of these structures still stand today. reply hkt 21 hours agorootparentCorrection: they used lime mortar. Modern concrete was created about a century and a half ago. The random bits were chunks of lime which increased the building&#x27;s hydraulic qualities - lime self heals, concrete doesn&#x27;t reply slothtrop 22 hours agorootparentprevYes, but concrete does not use this grade. It&#x27;s crushed granite and limestone, i.e. the most sustainable. -- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.builderspace.com&#x2F;types-of-sand-used-in-construct... reply slothtrop 22 hours agorootparentprev [–] It depends on the sand &#x2F; use-case. Sand in concrete is crushed granite&#x2F;limestone. replyGuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",
