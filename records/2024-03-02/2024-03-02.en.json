Apple reverses course on death of Progressive Web Apps in EU Mike WuertheleMar 01, 2024 Progressive Web Apps aren't getting changed in the EU 2 Facebook x.com Reddit After a few weeks of internet drama, Apple has responded to complaints about the death of Progressive Web Apps in the European Union and is restoring them to how they worked in iOS 17.3 and before. When the first iOS 17.4 beta launched, European Union users were hit by problems with Progressive Web Apps that weren't working properly. Further iterations of the beta, including the release candidates on February 27, made this worse. And now, Apple has changed its mind on the matter. Apple says that it has reversed course because of numerous requests by consumers to keep the feature. Apple has altered its page on what the Digital Markets App changes entail to reflect the Progressive Web App direction change. Watch the Latest from AppleInsider TV Apple's new page reads as follows: Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS. We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS. Developers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March. For support, the Progressive Web Apps will still need to be built on WebKit, with all that entails. The European Union Digital Markets Act that spawned all these changes has an implementation deadline of March 8. If Apple follows its normal course, iOS 17.4 with the contained App Store concessions to suit the law will arrive on Tuesday, March 5. Apple's DMA plans and subsequent complaints On January 25, Apple revealed its changes that will come into effect from March 2024 to comply with DMA. For all users, Apple will start to notarize all iOS apps, regardless of where they're sold. Developers can offer their own app marketplace in the EU, but they must be approved by Apple and use a human review process. Those stores are also responsible for their own refunds but can use alternative third-party payment processors. At the same time, Apple is changing its fee structure, reducing the standard commission of 30% down to 17%. For apps that stay within the App Store, there will also be a 3% fee for using Apple's payment processing services. Controversially, all apps not sold via the App Store will be subject to a Core Technology Fee of 0.50 Euro per first install of an app annually, waived for the first million installs. Alongside the changes is a mandate that iOS supports multiple browser engines beyond custom front-ends on top of WebKit. In short, in the EU, Apple has to fully support Mozilla's Firefox instead of just using Apple's WebKit. At the same time, it crippled Progressive Web Apps. Presumably, it did so because it thought it would have to support them across all browsers that didn't use WebKit, but that is not the case. Apple's move also comes after a threat to look into the issue by European Commission authorities. \"We are indeed looking at the compliance packages of all gatekeepers, including Apple,\" the European Commission said in a statement on February 26. \"In that context, we're in particular looking into the issue of progressive web apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment.\" Apple's proposals have, naturally, attracted complaints. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek called the fees \"extortion, plain and simple,\" while Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney referred to it as \"hot garbage\" and a \"devious new instance of malicious compliance.\" Mike Wuerthele Managing Editor After his exit from the Navy in 1999, Mike spent 11 years as a tech analyst, and supported a large swathe of Apple customers in the Washington DC area.

I wonder if there was some sort of back channeling with the EU to determine that “actually this is fine, we don’t care about rendering engine competition for PWAs, WebKit-only is better than removing them.” The law ultimately only requires changes to features the EU cares about. reply turquoisevar 16 hours agoparentThis is the most likely theory. The notion that Apple was purposefully trying to kill PWAs never made sense in light of their significant investment in supporting PWAs over the last four years, down to recruiting industry rockstars such as Jen Simmons. Nobody who was screaming bloody murder ever tried to reconcile that incongruence, much less succeeded. What’s more likely is that Apple’s lawyers went with the most careful interpretation of the DMA, concluded that they’d have to facilitate Home Screen install for other browsers as well, figured it wasn’t worth the engineering effort, especially on short notice, and instead just deactivated it for Safari as well. Then, after all the bloody murder that was being screamed about, the EU started to inquire[0] both with Apple as well as developers about the consequences for PWAs. Apple was told that their interpretation was too strict (or that they will be given more time to implement it for other browsers, but less likely because such decisions are typically made public) and that they’re fine (for now) with PWAs running in WebKit. 0: https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/26/apple-blocking-web-apps/ reply afavour 15 hours agorootparent> in light of their significant investment in supporting PWAs over the last four years Investing in PWAs for four years is only going to get you so far when you’re eight years behind the competition. Obviously I’m making numbers up here but to my perspective Apple’s recent investments (bringing them to a level still behind competitors) has a lot more to do with staving off legal threats to their 30% cut on native apps (e.g. the Epic lawsuit) than any benevolence towards the web platform. reply brookst 12 hours agorootparentI don’t think the comment you’re replying to was saying Apple’s PWA support was world-leading. I think it was saying that if Apple wanted to kill PWA it would have made more sense to just not make those investments over the past four years. reply nox101 9 hours agorootparentThe cynical view would be that apple was only doing that to try staving off anti-trust litigation. The fact that PWAs are seriously crippled on iOS vs Android still seems certainly makes it appear Apple has ulterior motives. If you make PWAs not able to do everything a native app can do then you're incentivizing native apps. Apple wants everything to go through their store. (1) so they can ban anything they don't like. (2) they can get their 30% (can't get 30% of websites) reply agust 9 hours agorootparentI'd say this is not a cynical view at all, rather a quite realistic one. They only added support for push notifications to iOS in 2023 (7 years after Firefox and 8 years after Chrome on Android), right after the UK regulator started its investigation in mobile ecosystems. reply mdhb 8 hours agorootparentYeah I’m not sure how that seemed to get lost in some of the revisionist history in the comments here but it at a minimum sure was a hell of a coincidence that they managed to not make any meaningful investments in supporting the web as a viable app platform right up until the moment that regulators started looking into it. reply albert180 1 hour agorootparentApple Fanboys are World Leaders in Mental Gymnastics and making excuses for their corporation that won't love them back reply afavour 10 hours agorootparentprevYes… and what I was saying in my response is that even if Apple did want to kill PWA there is good legal reason to have made the investments they have in the past few years. In court they can argue that app makers are free to make a PWA if they don’t want to pay the 30% cut. If they removed PWA support they’d not be able to make that argument. reply kelthuzad 12 hours agorootparentprev>I think it was saying that if Apple wanted to kill PWA it would have made more sense to just not make those investments over the past four years. wrong, Apple only started implementing the bare minimum because they felt the heat from devs & feared the legal consequences for their anti-competitive behavior. Apple still has the unquenchable desire to kill PWAs, they will just keep sabotaging them more subtly. Apple will keep up their shenanigans until the bitter end, but I hope that the EU will have none of it. reply danlugo92 2 hours agorootparentprevYou own Apple stock?

I don’t think this speaks to intention, the investments that have been made and are still being made bring with them a cost, both in a monetary sense and in other ways. Regardless of the separate question with regards to them having been able to catch up with the competition. A generous interpretation, with the presupposed premise that they haven’t been able to catch up, could say that it warrants a more favorable interpretation of their intentions if they were willing to invest after having lagged behind for so long, because the required investment would be greater and the pay off less clear. > (bringing them to a level still behind competitors) Let’s be honest here. When people say something like this, they’re mainly thinking of Chrome/Chromium-based browsers. Google is known to have no qualms supporting certain things that both Mozilla and Apple are uncomfortable with, while at the same time implementing a bunch of stuff that isn’t standardized. On the whole, Safari/WebKit has roughly met Mozilla’s level of support for frameworks and APIs and even surpassed Mozilla on certain things (especially desktop). Of course if the benchmark is just Chromium, then none of it will ever be enough, then again, Mozilla doesn’t seem to catch a lot of flack for drawing a line in the sand in terms of support. Other than that, Safari seems to be doing great on test suites/benchmarks that focus on progress such as the annual Interop. Consistently[0] keeping up[1] over the years[2], and sometimes coming out on top[3]. > has a lot more to do with staving off legal threats to their 30% cut on native apps (e.g. the Epic lawsuit) than any benevolence towards the web platform. I tend to stay clear with attributing maleficence or less than generous intentions without something substantial to back it up. Especially when behavior seems to contradict such attributions. For example, if that where the main motivator then I’d expect a bare minimum approach and Apple dragging their feet, like we see with DMA implementations (e.g., only allowing what must be allowed in the EU instead of globally), instead we not only see improvement of PWA support, in part beyond what Mozilla supports, but also direct contributions of standards that PWAs rely on in the form of improvements.. 0: https://wpt.fyi/interop-2021?stable 1: https://wpt.fyi/interop-2023?stable 2: https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024 3: https://wpt.fyi/interop-2022?stable reply wolfendin 4 hours agorootparentprev“The competition” is just Google/Chrome. Unless there’s someone else? reply scarface_74 14 hours agorootparentprevThis makes absolutely no sense. It came out in the Eoic trial that 90% of App Store revenue comes from games and in app purchases. Those apps are no more going to leave the App Store and go to the web than they are going to leave the Google Pay Store. In app purchases monetize too well and people aren’t going to put their credit cards on every third party website. That’s not even to mention all of the ways that you can pay via in app purchases that you can’t pay via the web and all of the kids with phones without credit cards attached. If it’s only Apple, then why aren’t Android developers creating great PWAs to escape the same 30%? reply afavour 13 hours agorootparent> Those apps are no more going to leave the App Store and go to the web than they are going to leave the Google Pay Store. ...Microsoft did exactly that, though: https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/30/hands-on-xbox-cloud-gam... I don't really understand the rest of your argument. \"Of course developers aren't going to use the web instead of apps, it's a way worse experience!\" is precisely the point in criticizing Apple letting the web platform languish. They have a vested interest in making sure the in-app experience remains superior to web experience because of their 30% cut. reply scarface_74 13 hours agorootparentIf it’s just Apple, then why aren’t developers leaving Google Play Services in droves to avoid the same 30% cut? And Microsoft did that not because they didn’t want to be in the store, but because at the time Apple wouldn’t allow them. Yes I disagree with this. If PWAs could be made one to one with apps - and today games like Candy Crush could be web apps - game developers who make up 90% of App Store revenue still wouldn’t give up the direct access to users wallets they get from in app purchases. reply int_19h 1 hour agorootparentIf PWAs were on par with native feature-wise, why couldn't they have single-click in-app purchases? All you'd need is some large trusted platform to provide a single sign-on experience and process payments. reply ToucanLoucan 12 hours agorootparentprevIf we ever reach a point where compiled code is equally as performant as web apps, I'll eat a shoe. reply danShumway 9 hours agorootparentprevThat's a good question: Apple has argued in court that PWAs are a serviceable alternative to the app store. So why aren't developers using them? Is Apple wrong? Are they not a serviceable alternative to the app store? Android has better support than iOS, and Android's userbase spends less money on apps and is more often monetized through ads. So it's not the payment platform that causes developers to avoid PWAs, otherwise they'd be used all over the place on Android. Android also has a semi-thriving community of Open Source applications through F-Droid that are privacy preserving and completely non-monetized. But installing apps through F-Droid is complicated. And F-Droid has zero user reviews. So it's clearly not the ease of delivery or advertisement that's causing those developers to ship native apps that need to be sideloaded through a complicated process that involves going into your phone settings and turning on sideloading instead of just shipping web apps. So what's left? Well, invasive apps like Facebook/Twitter could ship as PWAs (with the caveat that their notification support would be worse). But they'd be giving up tracking ability by doing so. Web browsers are better secured than phones are. Facebook on iOS has an easier time tracking your behavior than Facebook in Safari does. Facebook on iOS could even at one point (and might still be able to, I can't find a source that this is patched) push custom code into web views of other articles through its iOS native app. So yeah, they're obviously interested in shipping an iOS app because (frankly) the Safari team is better at security than Apple's iOS developers are. The only reason left that explains that behavior is the fact that PWAs on both Android and iOS are severely lacking in APIs that would enable anything other than shallow internet-connected services. They are not alternatives to the app store in their current state, no matter how much Apple pretends otherwise. Notification support on Android for PWAs is a joke, it's basically only usable for advertisements. And it's even worse on iOS. If you want to make an alarm app as a PWA, it is literally impossible to do that reliably. Want to make an RSS reader? I have no clue how that would be done as a PWA, I don't think it can be done without a web server handling the article fetching. ---- And I'm sure you would say at this point that there are tons of apps that don't need this stuff and that really it's not about capabilities it's about payments and about what the users want and where they look for apps... And I would just repeat your question back to you -- there are a ton of apps that are not monetizing through app store payments that aren't shipping PWAs. There are a ton of apps that are not looking for mass-market appeal that are not shipping PWAs. And Apple is arguing in court that they could. But they're not. They're not using PWAs on iOS or on Android. They're not shipping PWAs when they rely on advertising. They're not shipping PWAs when they would benefit tremendously from not needing to pay so many commissions to Apple. Even when they're Open Source and don't monetize at all, they're not shipping PWAs. Why not? What do those developers know that Apple either doesn't know or is pretending not to know? There's no NewPipe for iOS shipping through Safari. Why is that? reply DANmode 1 hour agorootparentFacebook and Twitter webapps are awesome, by the way. reply scarface_74 8 hours agorootparentprevJust a quick Google search shows that App Store revenue is 67%/33% split Apple/Google. https://www.bigabid.com/apple-app-store-vs-google-play-store.... In that case, if PWAs were good enough on Android and they could avoid the 30% cut, why bother making native Android apps at all? All of the HN commenters blame mean old Apple for holding the web back. But the fact is that every mobile platform at one point announced that “you can make good apps using web technology” - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Palm, and RIM. They’ve all sucked Even before then, Sun promised that you could make great cross platform GUI apps and they sucked. Today Electron apps are, battery draining, memory hogging monstrosities. And the tracking thing is a non starter. You have much better ways to track on the we then through native apps - at least on iOS with a much better permission model. To the first approximation - no one cares about PWAs - not users, not companies. reply danShumway 8 hours agorootparent> In that case, if PWAs were good enough on Android and they could avoid the 30% cut, why bother making native Android apps at all? I don't want to skirt too close to HN guidelines here, but I'm genuinely curious if you actually read my comment or not. This is exactly what I asked you. If PWAs are (as Apple claims) good enough alternatives to the app store, why isn't anyone using them? You can complain about Electron, but developers build Electron apps. They don't build PWAs. Because Electron apps are actually a feasible alternative to more native GUIs, and PWAs are not. The question you and I are asking (why isn't anyone using PWAs) reveals exactly how bullcrap Apple's legal arguments about PWAs are. They are not reasonable alternatives to the app store. > All of the HN commenters blame mean old Apple for holding the web back I don't blame Apple exclusively for holding the web back. They're a part of it, but so is Google. I don't think I've ever had much good to say about Google on here, and as the US and EU are actively proving right now, it is possible to pursue regulation for multiple companies at the same time. > You have much better ways to track on the we[b] then through native apps - at least on iOS with a much better permission model. This is not true by any metric. Native apps have more access to fingerprinting vectors than web apps do, are capable of requesting deeper levels of user information like contacts. Native Facebook on iOS got called out for injecting custom code into the in-app web view when users clicked on links within Facebook for 3rd-party sites. That's something that's not possible to do in any modern web browser. Native apps are indisputably easier to use to fingerprint and track users on both iOS and Android. Even if you're unfamiliar with the technical side of this, you can still think of it this way: if apps like Facebook had an easier time tracking you on the web than on mobile devices, they wouldn't try to get you to install mobile apps. They would force you to use the website. The reason why Facebook ships an iOS app is because it is easier to track you via iOS than through the Facebook website. reply scarface_74 8 hours agorootparentI’m very familiar both - exactly how can apps track you - without your permission that the web can’t? And your example of how Facebook can track you by knowing what links you clicked on off the site from the app, of course Facebook could do that from the web.

And what do you think is going to happen if there are more native APIs exposed in browsers? reply saagarjha 6 minutes agorootparentThere are plenty of APIs exposed to native apps that are not exposed to the web, stuff like your OS version, loaded libraries, boot time, … DANmode 1 hour agorootparentprevIn, at minimum, any way you agreed to on the permission screen when installing. reply danShumway 7 hours agorootparentprev> of course Facebook could do that from the web. Facebook could insert custom code into 3rd-party domains that have no relationship with it? No, it can't. If Facebook could perform arbitrary XSS on 3rd-party websites it had no relationship with when you clicked on links on the Facebook website, that would be rightly treated as critical zero-day security flaw in any web browser. I mean, you're saying you're familiar with this stuff, but you're also saying that Facebook can do arbitrary XSS via links, so forgive me for doubting you. Of course fingerprinting is possible on the web. It's easier with native apps. The web at least tries to shut down fingerprinting vectors; native platforms like iOS largely don't. Far from shutting down fingerprinting vectors, both Android and iOS have platform-supported device-specific advertising IDs that don't even require fingerprinting. At least Apple (eventually) started clearing the low, low bar of forcing applications to ask permission to access it, but that's a far cry from the kind of sandboxing and site/app isolation that happens in Safari. > And what do you think is going to happen if there are more native APIs exposed in browsers? I'm sorry, your defense for privileging native apps over browser apps is \"if browsers could do everything native apps could do, it would be a nightmare for privacy\"? What do you think that says about the privacy and security of native apps? reply scarface_74 6 hours agorootparent> No, it can't. If Facebook could perform arbitrary XSS on 3rd-party websites it had no relationship with when you clicked on links on the Facebook website, If you click on a link from Facebook on the web - the only reason you would view a page in a web view on the app - you don’t think FB could know that you clicked on the link? I also see that you ignored the dozen or so well known ways that you can track someone across the web. Are you really saying you’ve never searched for something on one site and seen ads follow you around on other sites? > At least Apple (eventually) started clearing the low, low bar of forcing applications to ask permission to access it, but that's a far cry from the kind of sandboxing and site/app isolation that happens in Safari. I just cited a list of ways that apps can’t track you across the web that you keep ignoring. reply nox101 9 hours agorootparentprevAFAIK Apple still doesn't support PWAs. As one example AFAIK, iOS Webkit doesn't support fullscreen mode and orientation so it's impossible to make a landscape game as a PWA. That is supported on Android Firefox and Chrome for like 10 years? And would likely be supported on an alternate browser on iOS I'm pretty sure there are many other APIs that PWAs want, that native apps have, that Firefox and Chrome offer on Android, but since 3rd party browsers are not supported on iOS, don't exist there. That to me says Apple doesn't want PWAs. reply latexr 7 hours agorootparent> AFAIK, iOS Webkit doesn't support fullscreen mode and orientation I just opened a web app saved to the Home Screen, and it’s both full screen and rotates orientation. reply jwells89 6 hours agorootparentYes, installed PWAs can run fullscreen. This limitation exists only inside of Safari proper. The intent here is likely to avoid the messes that could be caused by arbitrary sites being able to fullscreen and confuse or trick the user. Requiring a user interaction to fullscreen doesn’t help here much, it’s easy to attach the function to an innocuous looking link or image that baits users into tapping them. reply nox101 3 hours agorootparentAnd yet (1) Firefox and Chrome has shipped with that ability for 10+ years on Android and the world hasn't ended (2) PWAs are effectively apps.

Also, it’s an about 18 months old law. Not that they wouldn’t have time or resources for that matter. So there was clearly a purpose to kill PWAs on iOS, and it was clearly their decision according to them. Another thing with EU, you can ask them. And normally, first, you ask them when something is questionable. This either didn’t happen, or Apple didn’t wait, or they already know what is the response. This was clearly a PR move.

Apple's investment into PWA support can charitably be characterised as \"begrudging\". You don't need to defend this company. They have been behaving badly for a long time. reply danShumway 10 hours agorootparentprevIf (as many people have suggested) Apple's intention in suddenly devoting significant resources into PWAs (after completely ignoring them for years) was to avoid app store regulation, it makes perfect sense that when they failed to stave off regulation in the EU Apple would no longer have a motivation for investing into them within the EU. Additionally, even if Apple is still looking at PWAs as a way of staving off regulation in the EU, it still makes perfect sense that Apple is running a cost-benefit analysis on PWAs being open to other browsers. PWAs on iOS are significantly limited even after Apple's increase in support. Supporting PWAs just well enough to stave off regulation while keeping them locked down so that other browsers can not extend them or push capabilities further is entirely in Apple's interest. ---- My take is that Apple as a company would prefer not to be working on PWAs at all. But that's not really an option, because both the EU and the US are looking at regulating the app store. The next best option is to have PWAs be a serviceable but ultimately inferior option for offline-only and privacy-preserving apps (and in fact many of the APIs Apple supports are entirely unusable for offline-only apps, although to be fair that's probably more Google's fault than Apple's). Apple may very well have thought the option of a semi-supported but ultimately inferior, controlled PWA experience was off the table in the EU; or they thought that with the app store opening up they could get away with killing the platform for EU users entirely. In either case, they now seem to believe they can keep PWAs locked down to only support Safari capabilities. Maybe they're right, I'm sure Apple has more access to regulators to ask these questions than anyone else here does. And so none of this is incompatible with the notion that Apple wants to kill PWAs. The idea that a company can completely ignore a technology for years and years and years, and then suddenly out of the blue as soon as regulation gets suggested start pouring resources into their browser and openly arguing in court, \"see, you don't need to regulate us, we have a browser\" -- and we're supposed to believe that this means that Apple is suddenly on board with the technology and that they don't have ulterior motives or that their motives wouldn't shift back if the threat of regulation went away. That is just silly. Apple has had literal years to both clarify with regulators what the browser regulations would mean and to build APIs for PWAs that Microsoft and Google have been perfectly capable of creating. And in light of their last-minute scrambling, the most likely and reasonable interpretation is that Apple thought they could get away with killing off PWAs now that they were no longer useful for avoiding app store regulation, a bunch of people screamed about it, regulators reached out, and suddenly Apple had a (partial) change of heart. Note, of course, Apple has no timeline or plans or announcements about when (or if) PWA APIs are going to stop being 1st-party privileged and exclusive to Safari, despite the fact that Apple has known that this regulation would be coming for multiple years. Which does seem to conflict a little bit with the narrative that Apple is all-aboard with PWAs as a technology and that they've been investing into them as a long-term strategy or commitment to the web, but what do I know? --- But I really, genuinely do not see what the past 4 years prove other than that Apple's motivations about the web can change on a dime the moment that regulation enters the picture. And I think that's really revealing, and I think it says something about Apple's commitment to the web that it took the threat of regulation to make them care at all about the web as a platform, and I think it really says something about Apple's motivations that the moment that regulation went through anyway, Apple suddenly reverted back to its previous stance on PWAs and was comfortable throwing all of the PWA investment of the past 4 years out the window. I very honestly do not understand how people can look at these series of events and say, \"this proves that Apple cares about the web.\" We're looking at the same timeline, but it's like you're reading it in a different language than I am. reply shuckles 7 hours agorootparentThe DMA was passed many years ago (January 2022), before the cited investments in PWAs. So if Apple was acting to proactively stave off regulation, you have a big hole in your theory of causality. The web is more than a Chromium app runtime. We are commenting on the web without any of the random features Chrome builds because they are strategically invested in ChromeOS, and their user data harvesting business model relies on more clients sharing more data with Chrome and Google. Apple’s interest in the web cannot be gauged by how much they support technology funded and evangelized by a bunch of current and ex-Googlers that has little to do with open exchange of information. Conflating it is a strange rhetorical trick. reply danShumway 6 hours agorootparent> The DMA was passed many years ago (January 2022), before the cited investments in PWAs. So if Apple was acting to proactively stave off regulation, you have a big hole in your theory of causality. I'm not sure I do? The DMA was passed in January 2022. In that entire span of time when Apple was actively arguing in court that PWAs were an alternative to the app store, at no point did they ever consider building out a proper security model for PWAs that didn't rely on the assumption that Safari would be the only supported browser. You're saying that Apple learned about the DMA before they started looking at PWAs seriously, then we got to February 2024 and suddenly Apple was caught flat-footed about browser requirements? That doesn't make sense: either they knew about the DMA and their current lack of PWA security models are an active decision that purposefully complicated compliance with the DMA, or Apple somehow wasn't thinking about the DMA in which case it's kind of silly to say that it disproves anything about their apparent web strategies. This is a situation where the excuse makes Apple seem more suspicious, not less. Apple knows in 2022 that the DMA is coming. In February 2024 out of the blue they announce that they're shutting down PWA support. If that's not strategic, it's at least wildly incompetent. And I don't think that Apple is wildly incompetent -- I think that announcement was strategic. > So if Apple was acting to proactively stave off regulation I'll also note that this is not a theory, Apple is actively arguing in the US that PWAs mean that it shouldn't be regulated. I don't really understand the contention here, the way I see it Apple is saying that PWAs are a proactive strategy to stave off regulation. We can disagree about their motivations beyond that regulation, about whether they would consider dropping support in the absence of regulation, but it is just a fact that Apple started investing more heavily in Safari around the same time that regulation arguments started popping up in both Europe and the US, and it is just a fact that Apple has proactively put forward PWAs as an argument in court cases as to why it shouldn't be regulated. Is it really that weird to connect those dots? ---- > Apple’s interest in the web cannot be gauged by how much they support technology funded and evangelized by a bunch of current and ex-Googlers Apple's support and advocacy for PWAs is pathetic even ignoring Chrome's support. It's not like Chrome has good PWA support, the entire notifications API is obviously designed by an advertising company with zero real input from any stakeholders other than advertisers. Ideally, investment from Apple into the PWA ecosystem would mean not leaving the entire PWA specification to be written entirely by an advertising company, it would mean proactively getting involved in the process. It would mean asking questions like, \"aside from Google, who on earth does it benefit that notifications have to be triggered by a remote server and can't be scheduled locally?\" The state of PWAs is as much a story about the apathy of every other company besides Google as it is a story about Apple holding back on basic support for extremely needed features like reliable offline storage. I'm not giving Apple credit for sitting back and twiddling its thumbs while Google ruins the spec, and then turning around and saying, \"you can't expect us to implement these features, the proposed specs are terrible.\" Yeah, of course they're terrible, where were you while Google was ruining them? I'm surrounded by people arguing that Safari is some kind of final bastion against Chrome hegemony, but in practice Apple does nothing with that bastion. They let Google make all the decisions, and then use that as an excuse to offer middling browser support. I'm not giving them credit for that. I'm not talking about exposing web usb support, I'm talking about things like: is it possible build an alarm clock as a PWA? I'm not asking Apple to bow to Google's every demand, I'm asking them to act like they're a stakeholder in the web and to give even one single damn about whether it's possible to build privacy-respecting offline webapps. Apple's apathy towards influencing or pushing the PWA web standards process in a productive direction is just as much a problem as their apathy towards supporting obviously beneficial capabilities like icon badges. Apple defers power to Google and then uses that as an excuse for further inaction. reply NicoJuicy 3 hours agorootparentprevSignificant investment...

Point is that that she’s a high profile programmer and web developer and those come at a premium. That, plus the significant efforts made in the last four years to not only support PWAs but also improve standards, runs counter to the notion that Apple has ill will towards PWAs. While she has spearheaded a lot of the investment in PWAs, for the purposes of this debate I only brought her up to emphasize Apple’s investments in making improvements. Even with Simmons out of the equation there’s still four years of significant engineering efforts to reconcile. > doesn't preclude the company from stopping doing something. You’re begging the question here. Without you substantiating the implication that Apple has stopped improving PWAs, you’re just throwing around empty words.

And Safari has been explicitly designated as a separate core platform service. There's no room for this kind of interpretation in the view of enforcement entity. Apple is just trying to buy time by pretending ignorance. reply layer8 13 hours agorootparentIt’s more subtle than that. If Apple uses WebKit within one of their built-in apps or OS components, let’s say in their Weather app or some Apple Pay dialog, there surely is no requirement that this has to be replaceable by Chromium or Gecko. Similarly, the PWA runtime environment may not necessarily count as a “web browser engine”, since they aren’t used to browse the web. It remains to be seen how this will be judged by the EU institutions. reply insidepitch 4 hours agorootparentThis is in fact how PWAs work on iOS. They do not run in Safari at all, but in a special runtime called Web.app, which is coded to use WebKit. Safari doesn’t have the ability to do the things the PWA runtime can do. Letting other browsers “run PWAs” would not be a matter of exposing an existing private API, it would require creating a a brand new plugin API for Web.app that would allow inserting other browser engines into it. reply ajross 10 hours agorootparentprevSurely the distinction is about the existence of a market. There is a market for competing browsers from different vendors which do compatible/interchangeable things that might be selected by different consumers for different reasons. The technical definition isn't the important bit, the regulation exists to preserve that interplay between consumer choice and market innovation. There is no such consumer-driven market for in-app UI libraries, be they WebKit-based or not. The \"consumers\" in such a market would be the app vendors, and in fact this is an area well-served by existing products from competing vendors. That's clearly not what the DMA is trying to regulate. reply summerlight 12 hours agorootparentprevIt's because those apps are not core platform service. Safari and iOS both are core platform services, which are explicitly designated as a target of this regulation. Go read the actual wording and have some understanding before making this kind of assumption. reply layer8 12 hours agorootparentWhen you open a PWA, Safari does not appear. The argument can be made that this is not Safari, but a PWA runtime environment that happens to use WebKit internally. Basically, the PWA is it’s own separate app (i.e. not Safari) that is being run by iOS with the help of WebKit, similar to how other OS features also use WebKit internally. It is not clear at all that this would fall under the category “web browser engine” of the DMA, since using a PWA does not constitute browsing the web. As for your argument about core platform services, the app store is a core platform service and (I’m pretty sure) uses WebKit internally, at least for some of its pages in login and payment flows, and similar for various iCloud-related functions accessible from Settings. I’ve read the DMA, you don’t have to be condescending. reply smoldesu 7 hours agorootparent> The argument can be made that this is not Safari, but a PWA runtime environment that happens to use WebKit internally. This is a silly and thin technicality, and not at all the same as what people are mad about. Nobody cares that WebKit is used to render certain windows on iOS and MacOS - it's Apple's choice to implement first-party programs that way. They can defend their usage of it internally, the problem is the limitations they impose on competitors. > I’ve read the DMA You're certainly taking some elements in liberty. It remains unclear how defining WebKit as a \"PWA runtime environment\" exempts it from the terms of the DMA or DSA. reply turquoisevar 1 hour agorootparentprevYou’re misreading pretty much everything you’ve quoted from the DMA. > No, DMA wording made it very clear that it's about web browser engine.

What it says is: > The gatekeeper shall not require [people] to use, to offer or interoperate with [stuff] of that gatekeeper in the context of services provided by [third party devs] who use the gatekeeper’s core platform services. A good example where this is applicable is the App Store, which is designated as a core platform service. PWAs aren’t designated as core platform service and there’s also an argument to be made that web developers aren’t considered “third party devs” (or as the DMA calls them “business users” due to a lack of agreement between Apple and them. > And they cannot make self-preferencing on their products. Same here. This one is even narrower because it’s only limited to preferential treatment in the sense of “ranking and related indexing and crawling” > The gatekeeper shall not treat more favourably [in ranking and related stuff] [their own products and services] than [similar products and services by others] This applies to ranking apps in the App Store. It has no bearing whatsoever on PWAs unless somehow Apple starts ranking PWAs in a list and then chooses to rank their own PWAs higher. The other one is also much narrower than you’re reading it. > The gatekeeper [shall not prevent users from switching to and subscribing to different apps including browsers] This mainly pertains to setting default apps and switching default apps. This tangentially relates to PWAs, but installed PWAs are technically not run in Safari and instead in their own app that uses WebKit under the hood, so it’s not so clear if this would apply to PWAs. > There's no room for this kind of interpretation in the view of enforcement entity. Apple is just trying to buy time by pretending ignorance. I can’t distill a lifetime worth of legal experience into a tangible piece of evidence nor are there readily available authoritative sources on compliance with government regulation narrow and simple enough that I can just present them without much worry of you understanding them, especially since you’re already struggling with, what is considered in European legal standards, rather straightforward legal text. So all I have is a trust me bro, and perhaps an appeal to common sense: Apple’s lawyers didn’t just wake up today and said to themselves “You know what, we were too cautious with interpreting the DMA a couple of weeks ago, I’m sure it’ll be fine if we keep PWA installs without implementing a way for other browsers to install them as well”, much less a variation in which they are trying to buy time by feigning ignorance. We already know that the EU reached out to Apple about disabling PWA installs. So with that in mind, do you think the lawyers woke up one day and said “fuck it” or do you think it’s more likely the lawyers gave the go ahead after the EU told them that PWA installs as implemented in iOS are beyond the scope of the DMA? reply rejhgadellaa 14 hours agoparentprevThe law requires Apple to open up iOS to 3rd-party browser engines and that Apple can't self-preference their own browser. This would mean that Apple has to open up anything that Safari can do (like run PWAs).

For all we know, the EU might be considering PWAs a thing completely orthogonal to DMA compliance, since they neither provide feature parity with native apps, nor are they widely used (at least according to Apple's measurements). > open up anything that Safari can do (like run PWAs). I think it would be just as valid a viewpoint to consider them an OS feature (as opposed to a browser feature). The question then is whether that OS feature would be considered protected under the DMA. For example, it's also impossible to provide your own kernel extensions (e.g. to facilitate hardware device drivers) for iOS – but that's completely fine (as far as I understand) under the DMA, since it's not one of the covered areas like app stores, NFC payments etc. I'm not very certain of the last point, FWIW – maybe the DMA does actually require Apple to provide, on demand, access to hardware interfaces available to their own product offerings! For example, wireless (Qi) outbound charging is supported by recent iPhones, but only works with Apple's own Magsafe power bank, and other power banks can only do inbound wireless charging and need to be charged via USB – maybe that's actually noncompliant too? That would likely kill, or at least strongly impact, Apple's MFI program in the EU – or maybe just expand it to cover all first-party hardware interfaces too? reply summerlight 13 hours agorootparent> For all we know, the EU might be considering PWAs a thing completely orthogonal to DMA compliance, since they neither provide feature parity with native apps, nor are they widely used (at least according to Apple's measurements).

The European Commission announced a few days ago that they will look into the decision of apple to remove PWAs, so they more or less announced they are trying to fine them because of it. Which means that completely removing PWAs could be the more risky choice instead of keeping them Safari-only. Completely removing PWAs already started an investigation. Keeping them Safari-only might not start an investigation at all, so it might be the lower risk. After all I think Android also has a Chrome-only implementation for PWAs, exactly like Windows, that runs PWAs on Edge. Also back in the days when Microsoft had to give users a choice to use another browser than Internet Explorer it was also not possible to exchange Internet Explorer as the engine for many system services that used the system web view component.

Instead it states: > In all cases, the gatekeeper and the requesting provider should ensure that interoperability does not undermine a high level of security and data protection in line with their obligations laid down in this Regulation and applicable Union law, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Directive 2002/58/EC. The obligation related to interoperability should be without prejudice to the information and choices to be made available to end users of the number-independent interpersonal communication services of the gatekeeper and the requesting provider under this Regulation and other Union law, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679. That’s why one of the main criticisms of the DMA is that gatekeepers generally can’t present proposals for approval and have to wait until after implementing to see if it is to the EC’s liking.

The section the blog post is quoting is saying that the EC can ask another regulatory body to make a decision specifically on whether the technical implementation of interoperability requirements is sufficient. So it's only about a very thin slice of the DMA to start with, and a slice that's not the part that Apple was intending to violate when removing PWAs, but it's also not a process that Apple could trigger or even be a party of. As far as I know, nothing in the regulation suggests that gatekeepers can get their compliance plans pre-approved or pre-rejected. reply troupo 13 hours agorootparent> That's not true.

In addition to that, the EC might choose to ignore the clarification requests entirely, and whatever decisions they do give are not binding. It's certain that Apple does not have any kind of back channel approval for keeping PWAs Safari-only. That is not a possibility within the regulatory framework. reply agust 16 hours agorootparentprevApple didn't have to ask though, they fully knew they were breaking the law here. They are only backing down because of the pressure from the web community and from the DMA team starting an investigation. reply masklinn 16 hours agorootparentThey knew they were breaking the law in their lack if browser choice. The PWA issue is a completely different one. Although what I assume is they floated removing PWAs to see if that would get users / communities on their side. It might have worked if PWA support was first class rather than half abandoned. reply agust 16 hours agorootparentThe DMA plainly states that they have to give other browser vendors access to all features present on device, and that they cannot degrade the quality of their services.

One team of lawyers hashing it out with another. reply smoldesu 16 hours agoparentprevI doubt there was back-channeling - Apple is seeing how liberally they can interpret this act. They tried doing the same thing when they threatened to use MFi on USB-C, up until an EU Comissioner threatened to boot them from the market. Plus, making per-company agreements would kinda render the entire \"point\" of the Digital Market Act moot. Apple knows exactly what the DMA wants from them, they're just deathly terrified of handing it over. reply fh9302 16 hours agorootparentThere is no evidence that Apple ever planned to introduce a MFi system with USB-C. What likely happened is that leakers misinterpreted the USB-C E-Marker as a MFi chip. reply duskwuff 12 hours agorootparentOr that Apple was considering a \"made for iPhone\" certification program to allow manufacturers of USB-C devices to certify that they'll work with iOS devices -- which would be a perfectly reasonable thing for them to have! -- and misinterpreted that as meaning that Apple intended to implement a restrictive device authorization scheme like they had for Lightning devices. (Just because newer iOS devices have a USB-C port doesn't mean that all USB-C devices will work with them! Devices still require drivers; if iOS doesn't know how to handle a device, it won't work.) reply Zak 16 hours agorootparentprevI think terrified is the wrong take here. Apple could fully comply with the letter and spirit of the DMA and remain profitable in the EU, but they would be less profitable. They probably have a very good estimate of how much less profitable, and they're doing their best to minimize the impact. reply smoldesu 16 hours agorootparentThe fear of low-profitability is what drives that behavior, though. You're right that the DMA/DSA threatens Apple's bottom line, but as long as Apple continues to sell iPhone hardware in Europe then they should be turning a profit on hardware margins alone. Apple wants the control at any cost, and it's going to encourage more countries to draft even stronger legislation. reply Zak 16 hours agorootparentI'm surprised the EU appears to be letting them get away with charging a fee for apps installed outside the app store. reply albert180 15 hours agorootparentThe DMA goes into force only tomorrow. We will see if they will get away. I guess they will get bonked, because they apply more favourable conditions for their own App Store. They might get away if they would charge the fee for all Developers, but the Bullshit with \"staying inside the old conditions\" will surely get them into trouble reply threeseed 16 hours agorootparentprevMost companies e.g. Unreal charge a fee for using their SDKs. The idea that you would be forced to give it away for nothing would be a pretty extraordinary and unworkable intervention in the market. reply Zak 16 hours agorootparentThey can charge licensing fees for their SDKs, but the \"core technology fee\" is not structured that way. As currently structured, it would apply even to an app written from scratch in ARM assembly language (not that a reasonable person would build an iPhone app that way). reply threeseed 15 hours agorootparentCLI apps are not supported on iOS. So at some point you have to interact with Apple SDKs. reply Zak 15 hours agorootparentMaking system/library calls to display something on the screen does not necessarily require the use of an SDK either; it might require quite a bit of reverse engineering work. As far as I understand copyright, that doesn't involve copying/distributing the library code and wouldn't be legally encumbered unless there's a patent covering it. reply kmeisthax 11 hours agorootparentprevUnreal is a game engine, iOS is an operating system. In almost every other case application software is not considered to be a derivative work of the operating system it runs on. If this wasn't the case, then Apple could have easily sued Cydia and AltStore for offering the equivalent of iOS fanfiction. Hell, even the Copyright Office was perfectly fine with adding a DMCA 1201 exemption for jailbreaking iPhones to install non-Apple software on them - and they're extremely tightfisted with those. The reasons why this is different is very simple: you don't distribute Apple's SDK along with your application, but you do distribute Unreal's. The user got access to Apple's code when they bought their iPhone, you have to give them Unreal Engine, so you need a license for that. reply justinclift 14 hours agorootparentprevThe fee kills any real world possibility of an OSS App Store though. 1 million downloads for an app sounds like a lot for a paid app. But on the desktop, popular OSS software packages do those kind of numbers in well under a year.

Seems like a pretty bold statement where you would have to have some kind of inside information. I don't have anything to substantiate this but I would like to believe that Apple still has the best interest of it's customers and security in mind when fighting these kinds of legislation. I switched from Android to Apple BECAUSE of those restrictions and the improved security the walled garden model provides. The other reason was the middle finger Apple gave to the cell providers about applying firmware updates to their phones. When I was using Android it was maddening to wait months for an update to be 'approved' and able to install. That led me to rooting and installing firmware that was outside of the manufactures control and who knows what might have been in that. So for me everything that Apple does to keep a walled garden is what actually keeps me as a customer and helps their bottom line. reply Zak 16 hours agorootparentIt does not seem to me that anything about the DMA will make it difficult for people who prefer to stay inside Apple's walled garden to do so. Most Android users only install apps from the Play Store and use Chrome as their browser. reply albert180 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, who knows what's inside of OpenSource Firmware like LineageOS. It's a huge mystery Also I never needed to wait for a carrier to approve an Update for my Android Phone. Neither for my Pixel, Nexus or Samsung Galaxy ones. And beside the \"strict\" controls, malicious Apps got in the App Store, and the iPhones themselves also pwned. Are there other Apple Fanboy Horror Stories about Android that you've missed? reply smoldesu 14 hours agorootparentprev> Are you sure about that? Certain as I can be, without having seen the cards. Apple is a company about margins; you see it in their hardware profitability, but also in Tim Cook's service initiative. They fought Dutch regulators over this for months preceding the regulation, and it's not a stretch to say the DMA and DSA is a direct legislative response to Apple's wanton behavior. Apple can move literal mountains, when it aligns with their incentive of increasing profit margins. Anything that falls outside that purview ends up sidelined or worse-yet, lobbied against. > So for me everything that Apple does to keep a walled garden is what actually keeps me as a customer and helps their bottom line. That's great, and Apple has every right to provide you a differentiated experience. I've been a historical Apple customer, and I still keep a Magic Trackpad around because it's mostly quite good. But you and I aren't entitled to a sustained monopoly because it benefits us. Happy IE users or Bell Telephone customers aren't an argument against antitrust action, and it's ultimately entirely tangential to how legal they are. Consider how Apple behaves in hardware, sponsoring dubious Chinese labor to make shareholders happy. They set industry-leading profit margins by sparing no expense in their exploitation of labor and parts manufacturing. Is it legal? They say so. But of course Apple would, and they have no incentive to ever stop the squeeze if shareholders cheer them on. They will behave just as insidiously with software, and if you do not treat their every action with that scrutiny then you'll pave the road to hell with good intentions. I want businesses to be good people. I want God to run a killer froyo stand. But men are fickle, and Apple has been a swindling bastard of a company ever since Jobs cheated Woz out of $4,500 over an Atari contract. reply roamerz 12 hours agorootparent> But you and I aren't entitled to a sustained monopoly because it benefits us.

Illinois set the precedent that a far-minority can be a monopoly if they block a government-designated common carrier. Europe's DMA doesn't even mention monopolies at all, and instead sets a new compliance bar for large tech-related companies. Japan's legislation is headed in the same direction. Seems entirely feasible to me that the App Store or Safari policies could be seen as obstruction of a common service. Apple's de-facto tax hasn't been explicitly blocked in the US yet, but it also has never been explicitly sanctioned. Without guidelines like the DMA in place, Apple is flying blind against US regulators. Microsoft got trapped deep in that hall of mirrors, and nearly paid the ultimate price. > Is that not what the free market does? The free market is supplanted by a government that ensures that only a non-lethal portion of rat feces is processed into your container of SPAM or McDonalds meal. They prevent you from exposure to what businesses call, \"profit maximization\". If you have a good government, they treat you a little better. They punish the companies that violate consumer rights and scrutinize anticompetitive behavior when it shows up. The free market chooses between regulated competitors; if you think that's unfair, you can move to a country without the rat-feces regulators and see how your breakfast tastes over there. Then we can all be happy. > When companies make poor choices customers punish them. (Budweiser 2023) Your evidence is proof to the contrary of your claim. Budweiser wasn't \"punished\" for making an anticompetitive move, they were boycott because insecure Budweiser customers had a slow news cycle. If Apple had customers protesting for the same reasons, they'd never even know. \"Poor choices\" notwithstanding, Apple customers couldn't be assed if they were angry. Suicide nets go up at Foxconn and the harshest words HN or MacRumors can muster is 'poor choice of manufacturing partner'. Conscientious startups and their Macbooks, nary separated any easier than protesting trailer parks and Budweiser. reply kmeisthax 11 hours agorootparentprevThe issue isn't the size of Apple's market share, it's the tying between their hardware, the OS software, and app store, such that if you choose to buy their phone, you also are locked into their app store. Apple is not subject to market forces because Apple is not a capitalist entity, it is a feudalist one. It is not a merchant buying metal and glass to turn into phones, it is a feudal lord that has put a gate on the river that anyone passing buy has to pay 30% in order to open. reply simondotau 8 hours agorootparent> if you choose to buy their [device], you also are locked into their [software ecosystem]. Other than desktop computing, this describes nearly everything sold to consumers.

Android is a partial exception, but one gets the sense from Google's recent behaviour that openness is an unwelcome vestige of its open source beginnings. reply smoldesu 8 hours agorootparentIt's not an exception. Binary distribution is the norm - Apple founded their business on that norm, found success in it, fostered it and continues to support it on MacOS. The App Store style of distribution is not a replacement for it, especially when the escape hatches for developers cost an annual fee and still has limitations. If it takes legislation to change that, so be it. This is not the future for computing that anyone wanted. If there's a good reason iOS can't run third-party software, now's the time to fix it.

That backtrack would have been a punch in the face of all devs that jumped on that feature. reply rejhgadellaa 14 hours agoprevTo anyone reading this as \"the EU is okay with PWAs being restricted to Safari/Webkit\": (I've seen a couple of those comments go around here on HN) I don't think so. Nowhere in Apple's announcement does it say \"the EU is okay with this\". What Apple has announced today is a(n update to their) plan to comply with the DMA. The EU won't actually do anything until March 7th (the deadline for compliance). The fact that they did do something following Apple's announcements regarding PWAs just shows how obviously ludicrous those plans were. The EU recognized the urgency of the situation and acted [1] - If Apple would have shipped this update, many existing PWAs would stop working overnight, those apps would jump ship and offer their PWA in the App Store with (no way back?) and the damage to the reputation of PWAs would have been done: Apple would've sent a message that you can not rely on the web to reach your customers on iOS. Nowhere does anyone say that the EU is OK with PWAs being restricted to WebKit. In fact, the DMA demands the opposite: Apple has to open up iOS to 3rd party browsers, and Apple can't self-preference Safari/WebKit for any of its features. Like, say, run PWAs. I have read lots of comments and posts that said something along the lines of \"Apple doesn't want other browsers to run Service Workers\". That's not the reason for the attempt to remove PWAs on iOS. Service Workers are not PWA-only, every regular website in a browser tab can have a Service Worker. PWAs can be added to the home screen just fine without one. They are not mutually exclusive. Apple removed PWA support so they would not have to open up the APIs to other browsers. Period. So, to circle back to \"the EU is okay with PWAs being restricted to Safari/Webkit\": I very much doubt it. Apple has announced a plan to comply, forgot to mention they were going to kill support for PWAs, then did confirm it (only took them 2 weeks), and now they backed down. We're back where we left off a month ago - and I believe the EU is very much going to have an opinion on the WebKit restriction Apple is trying to keep in place. [1] The EU only announced they would start an investigation AFAIK, which is a long way from actually enforcing anything. reply Aissen 1 hour agoparentI think this is spot on. It might not seem like much, but the EU announcing they would open an investigation, during the beta of an OS is unheard of.

Apple will still be sandboxing the browser engines, so even if Apple doesn't trust the browser vendors, this still isn't a logical argument against allowing them to run PWAs. reply simondotau 2 hours agorootparentIt might not be practical for the OS to enforce sandboxes between multiple PWAs running on the same third party browser engines. Browsers are incredible resource hogs and loading many instances with perfect isolation enforced by the OS could result in a poor experience. reply redox99 2 hours agorootparentOn Android I think PWAs do indeed share the same browser process. So it's like having another tab. Still, tab level isolation is taken extremely seriously by browser developers. reply jfoster 2 hours agorootparentprevDoes Safari sandbox between multiple PWAs running? Besides, shouldn't it be up to the browser engine to decide on sandboxing between PWAs?

Apple gave us the worst possible outcome so that this now seems like a win. reply zamadatix 15 hours agoparentMaybe, maybe not. It can also be explained by Apple wanting to do the minimum required. First choice: no PWA support at all, Second choice: PWA support independent of custom browser support, and final choice (most work): PWA support on top of the custom browser support.

Especially since I have yet to relocate them... I think you're joking, but I'm not sure. I work in trading, and I've been on the receiving end of that phone call. As I recall, it was around 9PM in the US, my work phone rang and could see from the caller ID that it was from our London office. There were no greetings, first words I hear were \"We're missing over a billion dollars. You need to find it...NOW.\" When I received that call, it was in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis. The daily PnL swings were wild, and it wasn't always clear on the cause. FX volatility was insane. We did all of our PNL reporting in USD, but held a lot of foreign assets. There was no malfeasance; I'd just taken ownership of the system a week or two before, and a nightly job had silently failed. Perl job on Windows, extracting data from a 3rd party trading system that wasn't built w/ integrations in mind, feeding it into in-house systems. It was a very flimsy house of cards. A gentle breeze in the night would knock it over. Rewrote the integration in Python, hooked everything up into our monitored job scheduler. Had to do some janky UI automations in Python until we got the vendor to add a proper CLI-based reporting mechanisms. It was a \"fun\" ride, but I eventually got my evenings back. Did cause the end of a relationship, though, so there's that. reply hef19898 18 hours agorootparentI was joking, the max I ever \"lost\" was a couple 100k of inventory, the majority of it was recovered and the reminder, as far as I know, covered by insurance. Also a, surprisingly similar, fun story involving just slightly different interpetation and handling of messages between our and the service providers WMS, which screwed up things in ways I never thought possible. And almost went unnoticed, after all even with top notch metrics and my borderline paranoia the issue went on for almost three weeks before we caught it. I can only imagine so the slight shock you had after that phone call so!

Seeing as I was hearing about Libor all day, every day (almost all of our clients had their mortgages computed on that piece of info), I had expected it to be something “automatic” (like at least an XML thingie) and well documented. Instead I had to parse some html on a page somewhere (I remember some yellow background) and hope that the HTML structure around that Libor figure would remain unchanged. This was all happening around 2007 - early 2008, suffice is to say that when all the Libor scandal happened a little later on I was not at all surprised. reply Scoundreller 13 hours agorootparentI remember some internet arguments on Libor when I researched how it was determined and everyone disagreed with me because of how much was based on it. It's just survey data, and no verification of whether a loan can happen at that rate? And you throw away the lowest rates, which should be the market-clearing rate all-the-things-being-equal if lenders are fungible? And if lenders aren't fungible, then isn't it all apples and oranges? reply smallnamespace 11 hours agorootparentHigh finance even fairly recently (80s) was based on handshakes and trust. The value of contracts tied to LIBOR grew by an order of magnitude or two while the definition of LIBOR wasn’t adjusted. Why wasn’t it fixed? Because replacing it would require an enormous amount of coordination and there was no clear evidence that it was broken. When that changed it finally got replaced by SOFR. reply rvba 10 hours agorootparentLIBOR not broken? It was a club used by the big boys from banks to screw everyone else. With a madeup number that benefitted them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libor_scandal reply smallnamespace 1 hour agorootparentLIBOR was developed in '86. The LIBOR scandal broke in 2012, with evidence of bad conduct going back to '08 or so. The LIBOR to SOFR transition was officially kicked off around 2016. Due to the complexity, the transition took 5 years. The LIBOR rate-setting mechanism was a reasonable design for the world of 1986 [1], when finance was a smaller club and trust among bankers was higher. Also, it wasn't clear back then that the volume of contracts referencing LIBOR would grow to become many trillions of dollars just a short couple decades later. When problems finally became very clear, we replaced it. [1] One criticism often levied at LIBOR is why it sufficed to take a windsorized bank poll instead of looking at something more reliable, such as market transactions. But that's ahistoric: in 1986, banks didn't always do unsecured 3m lending on a daily basis. And later on, banks mostly stopped doing unsecured lending to one another entirely. So critics who suggest that LIBOR should've looked at market transactions entirely miss that finance, actually practiced, is a constantly moving target and it's hard to predict the future when designing benchmarks. SOFR, LIBOR's replacement, looks at secured interbank lending — a practice that was rare when LIBOR was created. reply omega3 18 hours agorootparentprev> EY believed the documents shown to them. Sloppy for sure, and EY got their amount of flak for it. There are strict rules and guidelines around verifying an asset. The auditor isn't supposed to \"believe the documents\" - they need to form an independent opinion.^1 If the auditor is unable to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to verify the asset, they can issue a qualified opinion due to a scope limitation. ^1 https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/member/discover/cpd-article... reply hef19898 18 hours agorootparentGood nitpick. Thing is, the proof EY got from Wirecard was good enough to meet these thresholds, at least I never read or heard anything else. All that evidence was fabricated, of course. What EY did was ignoring all the warning signs they had: money laundering, making up business, fraud and all that. EY also wanted the proof the standards it seemingly met, that was the failure. But then those audits are not really meant to find organized fraud at a company to begin with. reply omega3 18 hours agorootparent> Thing is, the proof EY got from Wirecard was good enough to meet these thresholds It objectively wasn't. I've never heard of a case where the auditor doesn't independently verify the bank account balance with the bank itself. More reliable evidence reduces the need for additional corroborating evidence.

If memory serves well so, it is quite a while I read Dan McCrum's book, Wirecard produced documents from the Asian banks (fake ones, as we now know). Of course, and I couldn't agree more, they should have at least called the banks up. Especially since a German fin-tech start-up, with on-going bad press, claims to hold billions with some Asian banks from business activities directly related to said accussations circulating in the press. EY deserves all the flak it got. That being said, again, if a company wants to defraud its auditors, they can for surprisingly long periods if they try hard enough. I think, we basically agree. reply ArnoVW 15 hours agorootparentFrom what I gather they not only called the bank, but actually went to a branch in the Philippines.

The russian word for \"non-government organization\" is \"foreign agent\". reply maratc 20 hours agorootparentThat's true, but there's a need to put that information in the proper context. First, there's nothing new or surprising about it, as the official Russian Orthodox church has historically been under the state's control. This goes back to middle ages and Tsars. It would not be reasonable to expect any opposition from them. And second, most of their faithful agree with them on the Ukraine issues. reply int_19h 3 hours agorootparentIt goes back even further, actually, all the way to the Byzantines. Eastern Orthodoxy has this concept called the \"symphony of powers\": https://orthochristian.com/93823.html, which in practice means a church strictly subservient to the government under which it operates. Russia is quite possibly the pinnacle of that, seeing how the Russian Orthodox Church managed to apply it even to the Bolsheviks eventually. This has led to some interesting quirks historically. For example, in Japan, the local Orthodox Church is the offshoot of the Russian one, and at the time of the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, it had a Russian archbishop heading it - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_of_Japan. Upon hearing of the declaration of war, the Japanese clerics under him asked him what they are supposed to do. He told them to pray for the Emperor of Japan and the victory of his hosts, since, as Orthodox, it was their duty to pray for their country's ruler and army during a war. He himself, being a Russian subject, could not do so, but also could not openly pray for the victory of Russia in the war while remaining in his position as the head of the Church of Japan; and he believed that it would be inappropriate for him to abscond from that duty and to flee to Russia. So he gave his bishops the blessing to pray according to the canon, and excused himself from public services for the duration of the war. reply ajuc 19 hours agorootparentprevThe agreement of \"regular Russians\" is a very curious thing. From talking with Russians they weren't expecting or supporting a war with Ukraine even a week before it started. It was a western lie that Putin wants to invade Ukraine up to the second it happened, and then it became obviously the only possible choice overnight. The most important thing to understand about Russians is that they were trained for centuries to be passive cynical conformists. It mostly worked. There are some actual nationalists who want the war. But most Russians view them as madmen who are \"sticking out\" and will suffer for it eventually. It's as stupid to be openly unpatriotic as it is to be too patriotic. See girkin. Most Russians just subconsciously detect the safest position and orient themselves accordingly. Not because of conscious fear, simply by default.

But again, we'll never know. And it's purely theoretical, even if he wasn't dead, there is no scenario that I can realistically think where Putin would have allowed Navalny to replace him, absent the FSB/oligarchs assassinating Putin. But even there, I suspect Navalny would still have been murdered and we'd still just get \"Putin-lite\" reply maratc 11 hours agorootparentprev> If Navalny became Russian president I have lots of respect to the guy, but realistically the only scenario where he would become Russian president would be if the vote for the Russian presidency was conducted in the West. He would win a landslide victory. In Russia though, if you go outside Moscow and St.Petersburg, it's not that people are against him — they simply never heard of him. In the USSR in the 80s there was a lot of talk of one Angela Davis. She was presented as \"the only opposition leader\" or something. There's no doubt that if the election for POTUS was conducted in the USSR, she'd win over Reagan by a huge margin. In the USA though not many people knew who she was. So Navalny is the Angela Davis in reverse — the media across the border makes him look like punching in the weight category he does not really belong to. Regarding Russian political landscape, you can look in any corner, from Gorbachev to Solzhenytsin and anything in between. There are not many points that these people could all agree on. But not a single Russian politician was comfortable with the thought of Ukraine joining NATO. And this includes Navalny too. reply ajuc 10 hours agorootparentPutin will die one way or another and Russia will have to exit the war and try to return to normal economy. Nawalny or another similar leader is their best shot at that. They created nadiezdin for a reason, they kept nawalny for a reason, they will create somebody new like that eventually. It's internal struggle in Kremlin that will determine which of them will succeed Putin and when, but Ukrainian war has a huge influence on that. Every time Russia lost a war they had a temporary liberalization. Usually orchestrated by the government because there's no civil society in Russia. As for what Russians thought about Nawalny - doesn't matter, never did. Nobody knew who Putin was, yet fsb made him a president no sweat. And don't get me started about NATO. Russians will almost all immediately flip from \"Ukraine in NATO is an existential threat\" to \"nobody cares\" the moment the narration in tv switches. The russian trick of presenting their dictators as the reasonable forces keeping the even worse tendencies of Russian people contained is obvious bullshit.

The war had less than 50% approval only a year after starting. Also, contrary to what is commonly passed around as fact today, it was not abundantly clear that the Iraqi chemical weapons program no longer existed, as the US was never actually supplied with evidence that the Iraqi Biological Weapons program was done away with after the Gulf War, which is why it wasn't just the possible existence of WMDs that was given as justification, but the non-cooperation with inspectors also. In the early 2000s, soldiers were given multiple rounds of anthrax vaccine shots due to this lack of clarity. This is not to say that this justification a good reason, but it wasn't a clear lie at the time either, despite being repeated commonly as such on the internet these days. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/29/us/the-2004-campaign-the-... reply dh2022 14 hours agorootparentprevIn USA hundreds of thousands of people protested against the Iraq war : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War Is not even comparable. reply int_19h 3 hours agorootparentprevSpeaking as someone who grew up in Russia and lived for 12 years in US, your average American might be just as gullible as your average Russian, but they are certainly a lot less conformist when it comes to government policies. reply ajuc 18 hours agorootparentprevNow imagine 9/11 hadn't happened and USA invades Iraq after denying it for months.

He then used that popularity to become essentially dictator for life. These bombings were blamed on Chechens- who hotly denied it.

The modern Russian language has developed during the last about 300 years, and the most closest/easiest non-Slavic European language for Russians is German. That all didn't make Russians into Germans, far for it, yet it lets Russians understand and mimicry the German style when needed (at least much easily than say French, English or Italian. Also kind of not surprising that the USSR was helping the revolution in Germany, and later the first 2 mega-totalitarian regimes happened to be Germany and USSR, and they were allies the first 2 years of WWII fighting together against democratic countries of Europe).

The fraud at Wirecard started before Marsalek seems to have been recruited as a Russian asset; the GRU probably didn’t even know it was happening until fairly late in the game. As frauds tend to do, it snowballed, until you’re setting up a Potemkin bank branch in the Philippines to get your auditor off your back about the couple billion Euros in cash you claim to have.

At the same time, these Western officials suspect Marsalek was gathering information on other customers of Munich-based Wirecard, most notably Germany’s main BND intelligence agency and the Federal Criminal Office, the country’s equivalent of the FBI, and handing it over to Moscow.\" ... \"Germany’s foreign intelligence service, the BND, as well as the country’s equivalent of the FBI, the BKA, told parliament during a public inquiry that ran from September 2020 to June 2021 that they had used Wirecard credit cards and bank accounts for their agents abroad as well as for paying informants at home and abroad. Senior German intelligence officials confirmed this to The Wall Street Journal. \" ... \"Marsalek ordered Wirecard Bank employees to breach data-protection and other rules to compile data about clients, according to testimony by former executives to German prosecutors.

It's not like there are no other banks doing the same, but none of them are owned by US-based entity traded on NASDAQ. SEC certainly wont care until it implode on thousands of retail investors.

Don't you think that this is much better for the goals of the western sanctions than preventing money from going out of the country? I'm a Russian guy (with a Freedom bank KZ account), who publicly condemn the barbaric invasion and thus is threatened by the homeland's so called authorities. A guy who left Russia after the war has started in order to stop at least paying taxes that fuel this war (and to avoid being sent to the frontline as well). Who have been living, working and paying taxes in the EU since then. I want the war to stop ASAP from the very first day. As well as having the responsible maniacs to face the trial. And I see many of the sanctions counter-productive. Can you imagine what it took to get my savings (before calling it \"blood money\", keep in mind, that I always supported the opposition, never worked for the government-affilated entities and tried my best to prevent this war) to the European banks with all this witch-hunt and passport-based discrimination. Would you really prefer my money to stay in Russia and work for the benefit of the war? reply Fnoord 7 hours agorootparentI hate to break it for you but whatever you possessed whilst in Russia and you didn't take with you is gone. Your assets are gone; not yours anymore.

The good news is, you're now living in a free society. You're paying taxes, you're probably following the law, too. You'll be fine here. Also, the Ruble will fall, it is just a question of when. Plus, you won't have to participate in a war economy making the useless war crap, or being cannon fodder. You made a brave, life changing decision, and part of that is saying farewell to your past. Also, I don't know if it is possible for Russian people to use cryptocurrency but what I'd consider is go to China and buy some cryptocurrency there, then exfiltrate that to EU. Or something like that, I don't know. You'd be taxed either way (or have it not declared ...). The problem with stuff like this is, it can be used for good and bad. As such, you're collateral damage. reply Aspos 8 hours agorootparentprevThere is a whole industry of people helping russians evade sanctions. And guess what, each and every scheme includes Freedom Finance. There are innocent russians among Freedom's clientele, no doubt, but the number of sanction evaders is too damn high. Note that no other bank in Kazakhstan opens accounts for russians remotely without any proof of residence, proof of funds etc. It is only Freedom Finance doing this. Why they are still being allowed to operate and have not been shutdown is a mystery to me. I guess this needs a coordinated effort of complaints and letters to SEC, FED, congresspeople. reply SXX 15 hours agorootparentprevYou really missed point of my post here. This is not about sanctions or getting money out of Russia. It's about the fact that one big piece of money laundering institution with very shady finances being owned by US holding company that is traded on NASDAQ. That's it. SEC is going after everything related to crypto, but gives no damns about some bs money laundering operation being traded on NASDAQ. This is exactly what Wirecard was in EU, but on smaller scale. reply Sakos 12 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you think the money is used for abroad? Helping fight against climate change or feeding the hungry in Africa?

I just opened said bank account for myself along with many many other people who never in their life been to Kazakhstan. reply zone411 19 hours agorootparentIt actually gained a lot of publicity because Hindenburg has a pretty good track record and many people are paying attention to them. There is zero chance financial regulators didn't see it. FRHC got a law firm to review some of their allegations: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freedom-holding-corp-announce....

Except even last month they been opening bank accounts for anyone and everyone left and right including providing means for very-very-shady registration of Kazakhstan Tax-ID (SSN) remotely. And until a week ago you could literally send money from a bank cards of some Russian sanctioned banks to them and it just worked. Now when Russia payment system provider itself been sanctioned it's no longer works, but fortunately now they'll gladly accept money transfers from their ex-subsidiary that they of course sold a year ago, etc. Again it's very much possible that from legal standpoint everything they do is \"legal\". Just dont be surprised why Wirecard wasn't caught by EU authorities earlier. I pretty certain Wirecard also had great law firms working for them. reply zone411 17 hours agorootparentThat's not how it works. It's a major independent law firm and there is no chance they'd risk their reputation to cover for FRHC.

If anything, I want them to know as little as possible. reply calibas 17 hours agoprevThis is what actual reporting looks like. Look at most news stories these days. There's some kind of conflict, two parties don't agree on something, and they report both \"sides\" of the story. Because the writers don't know what really occurred, it's common that a news story will give equal weight to lies and truth (or semi-truth and semi-truth). In the insanity of normal society, this is actually promoted as a good thing. News stations pat themselves on the back for being \"fair and balanced\", and use it as proof of being \"unbiased\". It's the opposite of unbiased, when there's no bias there are no \"sides\". You can't take both sides in a conflict, each \"side\" being a heavily biased opinion in itself, and combine them together to create a lack of bias. That's not how it works, two conflicting partial truths don't equal a whole truth, two conflicting partial truths just create cognitive dissonance (FUD). Now look at this news story, it's quite different from what I described above. It's proper investigative journalism where the goal is cutting through opinions and second-hand information to find the actual truth. It's a major accomplishment and something to be applauded. In my heavily-biased opinion, it's the job of a free press to seek and report the truth, to create new stories like this one, not to report \"both sides\". And to illustrate when I'm saying, look at what happens to be the #1 story on my Google News at this moment: https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/29/middleeast/gaza-food-truck-de... CNN doesn't know exactly what happened, there's conflicting stories, and all we know for sure is that a bunch of hungry Palestinians were just killed while trying to get food. Here's what CNN found: According to Palestine it's Israel's fault. According to Israel it's Palestine's fault. Yes, clear as mud. It's the perfect kind of reporting for adding to the controversy and acting like there's no clear right & wrong, or viable solutions to the conflict. It's how I would do things if I wanted to extend the war as long as possible. However, I'm biased toward peace and preservation of life, so it's quite clear to me what's causing food riots and subsequent massacres. reply empath-nirvana 15 hours agoparentSome of that is just that there's a 24 hour news cycle, and the event is out there so they have to report that it happened. It takes _time_ to untangle what really happened in an event like that, and it's not going to happen in a day. I'm not going to get into the politics of that, but I do wish that news orgs would report the necessary context for understanding what \"so-and-so claims\" really means and letting people have all the information they need so they can judge how many grains of salt are appropriate. A little bit of he-said, she-said is necessary in breaking news, but there should be a lot of caveats that go along with reporting like that. reply calibas 14 hours agorootparentYou have a country full of starving people, an active war, and trucks full of food guarded by soldiers of the opposing force. You also have the UN, a somewhat independent organization that's supposed to help resolve the conflict, and they're saying Israel is intentionally restricting Gaza's food supply. Understanding this context, seeing all the threads, and there's really not much to untangle. If anything, this was entirely predictable. Nobody should be surprised that starvation was enough to provoke a violent conflict between Palestinians and the IDF. I believe the news media is here to provide clarity, not add to confusion. The problem is that when things are a tangled mess, the media has a lot more to report on. Truth is cut and dry, but when there's a mystery you can just keep going on and on and on... I still remember all the news about OJ Simpson, so much to report and so few facts! reply red_admiral 16 hours agoparentprevWhen something newsworthy happens, like many civilian deaths around a food truck, people reading the news want two things: they want the truth, and they want it now. I agree with you that good journalism seeks the truth first of all - but that takes time and if everyone else is talking about that truck today, your news outlet has to feature that story too somehow. Maybe we'll have a proper investigative report on that truck in a week, or a month. I remember that earlier in the war, when some kind of rocket struck a hospital in Gaza, Israel and Hamas also blamed each other - then President Biden said as far as his intelligence goes, it was Hamas and I think that's the consensus now? We might never know for sure, but in the immediate aftermath of the hit the options for a media outlet were basically \"we don't know\" or \"it was definitely the side we don't like\". The truthful answer until someone's done the investigation is the former, but that gets you the kind of article on CNN that you're pointing out. reply teddyh 13 hours agorootparent> people reading the news want two things: they want the truth, and they want it now. I profoundly disagree. People want two other, completely different things: 1. People want to be given information to confirm their own biases and preconceived notions 2. People want to be able to not have to actually do anything or change anything because of any new information. reply rainworld 16 hours agoparentprevI'll save you the headache: News media does not exist to inform you.

The guy is Austrian. > The Nord Stream might be the most \"famous\" one. How can a society so conservative and risk averse to the point of ridiculousness allow their whole country to be almost exclusively dependent of Russia? It doesn't make any sense. Nord Stream brought in 55% of natural gas managed in Germany. 50% of natural gas managed in Germany was for export. So there's no \"almost exclusive\" dependency, use of russian gas wasn't a German peculiarity, and Germany could have thrown the rest of Europe under the bus to quickly get rid of any association with russian gas at a moment's notice (by restricting exports to compensate for the loss.) For the record, Germany didn't do that. Germany took cheap natural gas, Europe took cheap natural gas, and when the source for cheap natural gas turned out to be a problem, gears were shifted to get away from that. At a cost, certainly, but probably still cheaper than relying only on more expensive gas sources for 50 years. With the added benefit of calming down the cold war (and the attempt to repeat that performance later-on, which in hindsight was unsuccessful) reply dralley 19 hours agorootparentMaybe that's a fine rationale for Nordstream 1, but it's a terrible rationale for Nordstream 2.

Yes, this was the agreement that the US made in return for dropping US sanctions on the pipeline project. Which was made only after it became obvious that Germany was insistent on completing the project against everyone else's wishes because \"they knew better\" and the talk about it being threat to the national security of Eastern Europe was irrational (/s). >And the natural gas they used came from a random non-russian pipeline. Nevermind that it was ~half russian in origin. Hypocrites. > - Ukraine, Poland: Hey, don't bypass our pipelines, we want the money! You understand that there is a legitimate difference? Without Nordstream, Russia can't turn off the gas to Ukraine and Poland (or damage the pipelines) without turning it off for all of Western Europe. Nordstream lets them do that, and that is (was) a significant wedge between Germany and Eastern Europe. reply pgeorgi 17 hours agorootparentBefore 2022 Ukraine shut down the pipeline to the EU in 2009 and threatened to do so again in 2014. I'm not sure what other country or bloc would ever accept the national security concept of \"we can cut you off from energy at any time, to keep you aligned against that other guy\" as something they're supposed to support. Meanwhile the pipelines existed and can be configured to work the other direction, so the somewhat friendly relations at the time between Germany and russia could have secured gas supplies for Poland and Ukraine. So \"we'll cut you off when we want\", \"you're evil anyway\" and \"hey, don't bypass us\", all at the same time. No, thanks. That said, the \"moral high ground\" solution would have been to get rid of fossils earlier - which wasn't much of a talking point by the objectors to Nord Stream 2, except for the Green party. Of course, Poland and Ukraine would have lost their leverage that way as well, while Germany would have lost the lever of economic relations with russia, so that option might have been even more fragile for Eastern Europe. reply dralley 16 hours agorootparent> Before 2022 Ukraine shut down the pipeline to the EU in 2009 and threatened to do so again in 2014. That is a complete lie, Ukraine did not \"shut down the pipeline\", Russia did - both times - because of their disputes (both trade and physical) with Ukraine. During those shutdowns, Ukraine was not receiving gas either. The root of the dispute being that Russia massively increased the price Ukraine had to pay for gas as political punishment. Russia then used that as leverage to try to get other nations, like Germany, to put pressure on Ukraine themselves. reply pgeorgi 15 hours agorootparentIn 2009, Gazprom proposed various alternatives to the main route, some including alternative routes through Ukraine that Ukraine rejected. In the end they shipped some ~12% of their usual through-Ukraine amount as additional shipments on other routes. Doesn't sound like russia was unwilling to deliver. But I'll concede that point as uncertain, given that the EU fact finding mission to figure out who stopped the shipments to the EU didn't come to conclusive results. (some data in https://www.cep.eu/Analysen_KOM/KOM_2009_363_Sicherheit_der_...) 2014: \"Asked if sanctions could affect Russian gas transit, Yatsenyuk said the move could possibly mean halting 'all types of transit, from air flights to transit of resources.'\" (https://webarchive.archive.unhcr.org/20230603044044/https://...)

Note that your link from two posts up states: > Russia in June halted gas supplies to Ukraine in a price dispute that arose as Moscow sought to ramp up political pressure following the exit of Kremlin ally Viktor Yanukovych in February, amid \"Euromaidan\" street protests and the occupation of public buildings. That is, Ukraine was not the first mover even within the confines of the trade dispute (ignoring the fact that Russian troops were literally occupying Ukrainian soil and attacking their cities at the time). Your argument seems to be that Europe was upset that Ukraine, after having been literally fucking attacked by Russia, might cut off the Russian gas supply (even though they didn't), and so Germany was justified in going around Ukraine for gas and ignoring the whole Russia invading their neighbors thing.

Dragon Claws The four-day workweek is proving to be the gift that keeps on giving. Companies that have tried it are reporting happier workers, lower turnover and greater efficiency. Now, there's evidence that those effects are long lasting. The latest data come from a trial in the U.K. In 2022, 61 companies moved their employees to a four-day workweek with no reduction in pay. They began it as a six-month experiment. But today, 54 of the companies still have the policy. Just over half have declared it permanent, according to researchers with the think tank Autonomy, who organized the trial along with the groups 4-Day Week Campaign and 4 Day Week Global. Follow-up surveys help to explain the four-day workweek's success. Business A manufacturer tried the 4-day workweek for 5 days' pay and won't go back Improvements in physical and mental health, work-life balance, and general life satisfaction, as well as reductions in burnout, have been maintained over the past year, says sociologist Juliet Schor of Boston College, who's part of the research team. Workers report higher job satisfaction now than before the trial began. \"The results are really stable. It's not a novelty effect,\" she says. \"People are feeling really on top of their work with this new model.\" Similarly positive results are emerging from other four-day workweek trials, including in the U.S., Schor says. \"Doesn't happen by magic\" At a recent webinar, participating companies shared their experiences and tips for success. \"It absolutely doesn't happen by magic,\" says Nicci Russell, CEO of the London-based water conservancy non-profit Waterwise. \"You can't just drop a day and carry on as usual, because how stressful would that be?\" Russell says after some initial teething problems, they managed to find efficiencies that allow all 10 employees to take Fridays off. They keep all meetings to 30 minutes and make sure those meetings start on time. They block off focus time on their calendars — sometimes even declaring Monk Mode Mondays. They're more mindful of the emails they send and of the time they spend going through their inboxes. TED Radio Hour Less is more: how a 4-day workweek could make you and your company more productive \"I only do my emails now at certain times of the day. I'm not drawn into them all day, every day,\" she says. At the end of the pilot, the staff at Waterwise were unanimous in their desire to continue the four-day week. A majority said they wouldn't consider a five-day-a-week job again unless presented with a significant pay raise. \"It's brilliant for retention, which is super important in a teeny organization like ours,\" says Russell. No one-size-fits-all One important finding, researchers say, is that there is no one-size-fits-all recipe when it comes to the four-day workweek. At Merthyr Valleys Homes in South Wales, giving everyone Fridays off wouldn't have worked, says Ruth Llewellyn, who led the pilot at the housing cooperative. With 240 employees working in roles from customer service to home repairs and maintenance, they decided to keep their operations running from Monday through Friday. \"For us, the thought of dropping repair service for our tenants one day a week meant that we wouldn't be providing the same service,\" Llewellyn says. Instead, employees work a variety of schedules depending on individual and team needs. Some have a set day off every week, while others are on a rolling schedule. Some employees work two half-days, and some still work five days a week but shorter hours, allowing them to drop off and pick up their children from school. The teams found time savings in different places. Some of the trades staff found they could reduce travel time to and from the building supplier with better planning around which materials they needed. Customer-facing teams found they could address smaller issues quickly over the phone. Business Iceland Cut Its Workweek And Found Greater Happiness And No Loss In Productivity Employees are more motivated, employee performance has held consistent, and absences for illnesses have fallen, Llewellyn says. Yet the company is not committing to the four-day workweek forever — at least, not yet. Hoping for still more data, it extended the pilot and will re-evaluate the results later this spring. \"We're really hopeful at that point that we can make it permanent,\" says Llewellyn. Why companies fail Of the 61 U.K. companies that joined the 2022 pilot, only a few have discontinued the four-day workweek. At one small consultancy, although the staff reported improved morale and the company reported a boost in efficiency, there were problems managing client and stakeholder expectations, according to feedback collected after the pilot. Researchers suggest that better external communications and more flexibility in adapting the policy to challenging conditions might have made a difference. \"There is a suggestion that the organisation did not give the policy enough of a chance, and indications of a change of heart on the issue from management,\" the researchers wrote. four day workweek 4 Day Week Global work life balance Facebook Flipboard Email",

I do think there is one clear benefit as measured in the article - employee retention. It's an extremely strong incentive to stay with the current company, and domain knowledge gained over decades really is a competitive advantage if your employees commonly have it. What remains to be seen though are if the efficiency gains are good enough to justify less hours. Are employees more productive? That's the question that remains to be answered or objectively measured here. Less burnout and better mental health means higher quality work for sure, but is output as a whole better with a 4 day work week versus a 5 day work week? That's what shareholders will care about more than anything else. reply burningChrome 14 hours agoparentIn the mid aughts, I worked at a company that put ROWE (results oriented work environment) into practice. This approach basically meant you could work whenever you wanted, as long as you were meeting goals and metrics. There was a list of metrics you had to meet before being eligible for it. They kept it in place for two years and nothing really changed. Devs were still meeting their metrics and the company was still doing well, but when the old VP who put ROWE in place left, the first thing the new VP did was take it away along with some other perks we had. Myself and about seven other devs left within the next 3-4 months. I'm currently working for a large corporation who went through several cycles of trying to get people to come back to the office after C19 slowed down. After three or four versions, they finally gave up and put an optional (hybrid) model in place. It was interesting to hear the stunned VP's glowing about the increased productivity and the company had two of its most successful quarters going into and coming out of the pandemic. I'm guess seeing those results made it easier for them to allow people to work from home more easily. Some anecdotal evidence for your retention theory. Since my current company allowed 100% WFH, our team has had barely any turn over and at least three of the teams I worked with have also have little or no turn over as well. It would stand to reason you probably have a good point about retaining people when you allow them a little more freedom to do their jobs. reply sandworm101 13 hours agorootparentI'm with a large organization (government, military) that also implemented a hybrid model under covid and decided to keep it going. But not a day goes by that someone doesn't scream for it to end. We have too many people \"working from home\" all the time and never getting done the stuff that cannot be done from home. Is the server not responding after the recent power outage? Too bad. The guy to turn it back on only comes in Monday-Tuesday. They put the real property maintenance people on a hybrid model. No joke: The plumbers and electricians still \"work from home\" half the week. \"Hello, this is General Smith.\" \"Sir, ... um .. you are answering your own phone?\" \"Yup. My EA is working from home thursday-friday and we cannot get the secure phone to forward calls to her cellphone.\" \"Did you talk to IT?\" \"It is friday. IT works remote on fridays.\" \"How about I come to your office?\" \"Please do, I'm all alone here.\" reply belval 12 hours agorootparentThat sounds mostly dysfunctional and not really a WFH issue. > Is the server not responding after the recent power outage?

As someone who is a big proponent of WFH, one thing I must still agree to is that organizational and cultural issues that existed prior to WFH at usually just worse in WFH.

That would be a lot of companies and workers out there, dare I say the vast majority even. Believe it or not, many workers don't actually enjoy their work, their company, their boss or their job, but they put up with it because housing in expensive and it was the least horrible job they could find with the highest pay they could land, enabling them a lifestyle upgrade, even if they don't care for the work itself, so of course they'll take every opportunity they get to slack off and watch Netflix if they can. Expecting all your workers to be fully invested and committed on work while on the clock is an exercise in futility and something no company past a certain size will ever accomplish because everyone just looks after themselves and their own self interest first, screw the company and their shareholders. And the companies know this, hence the culture of micromanagement, spyware, RTO, etc. That's why start-ups and small companies can accomplish things the likes of Google can't, because they're formed mostly of motivated people who care about the product and the mission first and foremost, while the likes of Google are full of coasters who are there just to make as much money as possible with as little work as possible while the gravy train lasts. reply RHSeeger 3 hours agorootparent> Believe it or not, many workers don't actually enjoy their work, their company, their boss or their job There are a lot of people that don't enjoy their jobs, but do the work because they're getting paid to do it.

Not everyone is a horrible person. Plenty of people will continue to do their job even if they could lie and not do it; because they agreed \"if you pay me, I will do my job\".

Since I joined the workforce, I encountered something like two or three people doing actually nothing at work. And once they are identified, I just know that I can't expect any output from them and just do without them. It's the opposite that I'm confronted with daily : people who are absolutely terrible at their job and who constantly try participate. Not only I know that I have to triple check their outputs, but I also have to come up with fake tasks to give them so that they are not constantly asking for things to do or worst, doing disasters on their own initiative. They consume a lot of time and energy from the productive members of the team, while having no positive output for the company. It's like daycare for adults. And given that everybody is paid at the end of the month, I have nothing but love for unproductive (in the eyes of the company) people who take care of themselves. I'd rather have both those people doing what they enjoy outside of work instead of forcing themselves to be here because governments and corporations are saying that you are not a member of society if you are not selling your time to capitalism. reply ghaff 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd there's absolutely nothing wrong with people looking after themselves.

I am sure that the majority of people would still do something that can be considered work in a world without jobs. It's obvious that few people are going to subordinate themselves in a world where they don't get paid for doing so, and if they did it would look more like volunteer associations (only emergency response involves much hierarchy, most volunteers are only loosely associated with the org, individuals choose which shifts to turn up to, local leaders are elected and view it as a burden rather than a privilege) and less like work (you don't get to choose anything).

In software development, there is usually an \"infinite amount of work\" to be done, so the important thing is to prioritize well as a lot of that work will never get done. But what does it mean to say \"you've met all your objectives\"? If you say \"great, I finished all my objectives in 20 hours this week, see you at the beach\", this company will eventually get killed by competitors who are just as productive yet work 40+ hours a week. But fundamentally, the idea of \"you've met your objectives, now you can go home\" just feels like a fantasy in the world of software development. reply p1esk 7 hours agorootparentWhat do you do during sprint planning meetings if you don’t know your objectives? reply hn_throwaway_99 6 hours agorootparentBut it's not like you complete your objectives and then you say \"great, we're all done, let's go home.\" Every company I've ever worked for had a backlog a mile long, and we knew we'd probably only ever get to 20% of it or so. The whole purpose of sprint planning is to just prioritize the most important stuff to work on for the next sprint, but if the teams capacity increases you'd pull more stuff in. reply p1esk 4 hours agorootparentNo, the purpose of sprint planning is to specify (more ot less) exactly what you plan to do this sprint. Usually the best case scenario. You make your best effort to finish the things you outlined, sometimes you manage to do it, sometimes you don’t, but why would you ever try to do more than you planned to do? If you’ve done the tasks, you’re done, period, go relax, grab a beer, wait till the next sprint. You’ve literally done your job. Why in the world would you want to “pull more stuff in”? That’s how I’ve done it, and have seen it done in the last 7 companies I worked at. Your reasoning is so foreign to me.

Well, to each their own, but that has never been the case in any of the companies I've worked at.

In my job, every problem seems to take a random amount of time. It might be the thing I'm assigned is trival and done in 1-2 hrs. It might be it would be trivial but it pointed out an issue elsewhere than needs to be fixed first. It might be trivial but the CI was down for 6hrs. It might be trival but requires some other library to roll to a new version and the roll broke something else. It might look trivial but turns out to need a non trival refactor to work. I ran into that last one yesterday where I started on an issue that seemed like it should be trivial, in an object with different options than it currently has. These objects are cached by their options since they are heavy. The code that gets an existing or new one is 5 levels deep. It creates them from a factory but the info this new issue needs needs to query the factory to figure out the creation options. So, what seemed like a 10-15 min change is going to be several hours to decide how to surface or pass that factory to/from the top level the point being, from outside management is going to see different levels of work. It's not as trivial as \"created N widgets an hour\" nor is it as trivial as \"lines per hour\" I feel like there could be lots of unintended consequences with people only taking the smallest tasks or whatever to avoid taking tasks that take longer or to find ways to account things so it looks like they're doing more, etc reply ozim 9 hours agorootparentThis is exactly why I oppose any dashboards with amount of completed tasks per employee.

Perhaps the concern is that high-performers will produce less, and low-performers will be canned, only for the high-performers to have to pick up the slack, or there just be a net negative in total work produced in X amount of time because some engineers have been fired for performance but there’s no one to replace them and others aren’t allowed/able to work more to compensate. reply gnicholas 4 hours agorootparentprevDo you think the lack of turnover might be affected by the current macroeconomic factors?

The company committing to it must also apply the necessary modifications and seek innovation to tap into this productivity well. It's like in the Industrial revolution when kids (!!) shift were lowered from 18 hours to 12-8 hours. Adults that were assisted by kids also couldn't maintain the same 18 hours shift and for the factories to maintain productivity they had to implement innovations. And would you look at that, the average textile factory today is orders of magnitude more productive and efficient than that of the 19th century. reply wahnfrieden 12 hours agorootparentConditions for factory workers in the US haven't improved because it turned out to be an optimal way to improve productivity. It's because of worker movements demanding it again and again. Those productivity innovations you mention would've come either way. In other countries with worse working conditions and even less labor power than the US, factory owners reap the benefits of applying such productivity innovations AND the increased output of longer working hours than is generally tolerated by US workers.

This is only true in a world where workers are entirely subservient to their masters. reply gchamonlive 11 hours agorootparentOh sure, don't get me wrong. I am not a techno-positivist that believes innovations will save us from evil. That was only to illustrate how a change in working policy has to go alongside technical and cultural adaptations.

The parent’s line about a company needing to maintain or increase productivity in order to make an improvement to working conditions is one that only those truly part of ownership should be making. Especially when it’s never said so in both directions: if productivity improved (through automation or otherwise) then the workers shouldn’t have to work as long hours.

Plus 2 days off is very different than 3 in terms of alternate work opportunity. From that a likely issue is a steep increase in people having second jobs so they work a 4 day job and a second 2/3 day job. I suspect the 4 day week will work well for people with good salaries and market power, but encourage working class to 'work the weekend' in alternate jobs resulting in lower downtime. For this I'd actually like a 4 day week but with it either more restricted business opening on Sunday type thing or significant wage multiples over 3 day weekends to encourage time off vs the 24/7 economy. reply ghaff 9 hours agorootparentI suspect a lot of the people yearning for 4 day work weeks wouldn't actually want to return to the days when most stores and other institutions were closed on Sundays. reply Sakos 2 hours agorootparentAs somebody who lives in Germany where everything is closed on Sundays, uh, it really isn't that bad.

These are all real changes with real impacts. Also of note, the increase in these costs from going down to 4 days will be substantially larger than the prior one (due to the smaller dividend). reply ipaddr 13 hours agorootparentCapital costs spent do not go up. An opportunity for saving exist. One extra day means less electrical costs. Admin costs remain static. These costs do not change unless you are hiring someone for that one day.

That article notes most people can't make enough money from 15 hours of work to save up for retirement. I also wonder if \"leisure\" has to be redefined, since work and life blend so much online. What does 15 hours of work really mean in a knowledge work job? reply throwaway-123b 16 hours agoparentFor me and I think in the past leisure did not mean mindlesly doing something like nothing, it meant time after misery is gone. I see it as working necessary time at work that you likely do not want to do, like at a factory assembly line or farm, hospital, etc. After that, you can stay at work, but do something else, like engineering at that factory or what else there is you would like to do. This mean less working hours, more people could get a job, it is something like work sharing. It would allow older people to work too, since work day will be lower, it is not like old people can't work at all, they can't work as intensivelly. In the end, those who do not work at the moment, still connsume, they just do not produce what they consume. With smaller work day, they will be able to produce. By work here I mean work and firms that produce things related to \"misery gone\", not all there is.

Part of it was motivation to keep up with ft colleagues while knowing I had a hard deadline when I would be back on baby duty, so not sure how replicable it is now, but it was wild to go through a few workdays with all the day trimmed out, and then have a very full extended weekend with family every week. reply therealdrag0 4 hours agorootparentBut does ruthless prioritization mean you’re making other people do that work?

I do my required work in 20 hours most weeks. I spend the rest of the 40 hour work week resting, learning, and working on myself. I am careful not to publicize this because I am concerned at backlash from colleagues who find they have to spend more time than me.

Take two equivalent companies, one that has a 4-day workweek and an otherwise identical one that has a 5-day workweek. Which one would you rather work for? Which one do you think will have a relative abundance of applicants (read: supply of labor)? Which other one do you think will have a lower supply of labor and might need to pay more to attract candidates? It seems logical that a company offering 4-day workweek would be more attractive and, on a balance of factors, could pay less to attract the same workforce. Flip it around. If a four-day workweek was the standard, I feel like literally everyone would agree that companies who are trying to introduce a five-day workweek would have to pay more. reply bobthepanda 15 hours agorootparentProbably true.

And if one factory can churn out X steel widgets and another one only X -20% because they work only 4 days per week, then all the jobs and industry will move to the former as the latter will not be competitive anymore. The 4 day workweek seems to currently work without loosing productivity in wealthy service based economies like Amsterdam, the City of London, etc where a lot of \"work\" is just Blue Chip companies with theatrics and endless meetings while riding the gravy train of other peoples' productivity from across the globe who don't have access to a 4 day week doing all the heavy lifting(basically economic neo-colonialism), but this obviously can't scale across economies that actually depend on actually designing and making the stuff the wealthy economies speculate on. reply toomuchtodo 17 hours agorootparentI agree! But workers can organize today while moving forward improvement with each election result (which will take time; for example, 1.8M voters over the age of 55 die every year, 4M young folks age into voting ability at 18 in the US).

The only people who prioritize less hours for less money are those who are already fortunate enough to have enough money but those can always choose to work less hours for proportionately less pay.

They aren't the ones demanding 40 hours and return to office. It's the C-suite that is doing it. The C-Suite got where they are because they are extroverts who excel at in person interactions. They can't use that skill unless you're there in front of them. They also came up in a world where everyone worked in an office 40 hours a week. And since they are in charge, they get to choose the rules of engagement, and are seemingly choosing to ignore productivity studies that show their decisions don't make sense.

But it will take decades. reply FirmwareBurner 15 hours agorootparent>and are seemingly choosing to ignore productivity studies that show their decisions don't make sense. I also don't buy this.

If research would show they would make more profits using AWS instead of Azure(example pulled out of my ass for simplicity), they would immediately switch to it. So if research would be universal and clear cut that working 32 hours outcompetes those companies working 40 hours, then at least a significant proportion of companies would be using this new way of work as leverage to outcompete their competitors working 40 and beat them at profits and market share, and then that would become the new norm as it's the proven winning strategy, since that's how competition in capitalism works.

Unions were one reason, Henry Ford was another [1][2]. His original argument was that if we give workers an extra day of leisure time, there'll be more demand for leisure products to consume - like, you know, Model T cars. Then, Ford noticed that his new 5-day workers were so much more productive per hour than before, that it more than made up the difference for the extra hours not worked. So I'd have two criticisms of your \"X-20%\" figure. The first is that just because individual workers are only in 4 days a week, doesn't have to mean the factory only operates 4 days a week; indeed a lot of steel factories do some kind of shift work anyway because firing up a furnace from cold is hugely inefficient. Sure, that means more heads total and so more HR expenses than if everyone worked 5 days, but I don't think it adds up to the 20% you quoted. Secondly, as in Ford's case, the extra productivity you get this way might be enough to more than offset the losses, and even increase your profits. [1] https://www.morningbrew.com/sidekick/stories/history-five-da... [2] https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/american-... (But note, the claim that moving to a 5-day week was a pay cut needs some context. The 5-day week started in 1926. But in 1914, Ford already doubled his workers' wages from $2.50/day (which was already not bad by the standards of the time) to $5/day, almost unheard of at the time - though initially with strings attached [3] which were later removed. So working 5 days a week at Ford's factory could well have still brought in more net pay a week than 6 days a week at a competitor in 1926.

Henry Ford's revenue boost firstly came from his improvements to automation and innovative highly optimized production line assembly processes, not because le let his workers work 5 days a week instead of 6. It was those innovations that allowed him to reduce the numbers of worker hours needed while get same productivity levels or higher, not vice versa as they didn't just magically come from working his workers less but from innovations to production lines efficiency. Workers working less was a consequence of that, not the cause. reply esafak 11 hours agorootparentAnd while productivity has steadily risen since then, we still work five days/week. reply FirmwareBurner 11 hours agorootparentShareholder returns have also never been higher.

And most companies and factories in the west have already optimized for all these factors to get maximum output on a 5 day work week. Moving to a 4 day workweek would be an automatic production loss and therefore a loss on economic competitiveness compared top those still on 5. What you're talking about, companies who can lower working hours without loosing productivity and competitiveness are very few and far between, usually world champions who have a captive market to themselves like Nvidia, ASML, Airbus, high end service jobs, etc, but that's only a microscopic share of the total amount of players on the market. The rest are firing on all cylinders trying to overtake or catch up to those established market players, and if you ever worked at a startup, it usually means longer hours, not fewer. >This is a BS way to think about an economic model.

I like that things like this are being tried, but I wish the research conducted on it were more intellectually honest and less obviously geared towards pursuing an agenda. The level of analysis here is more like a company marketing whitepaper than anything bordering on scientific. Don't get me wrong, personally I think companies where it's feasible should just define minimum presence where the business needs it and leave it to employees where and when to do the work within those constraints depending on preferences and their situation. I don't have an axe to grind against working less (and in my circles it seems like many people are making this decision by reducing their workload to e.g. 80%, albeit at a corresponding salary cut).

For example, over 1000 school districts in the US have moved to a 4 day week to retain teachers, as they have no other choice [3]. There is evidence it works in many industries (office work, manufacturing, law enforcement, government) [4]; it might not work everywhere, but it can work where it works. There is no reason not to ratchet down the work week as productivity has increased, and most people work to live, not live to work (as indicated by the satisfaction indicators in these 4 day week trials).

Some examples: * Never-ending optimism about UBI, despite the maths clearly not working. Kind of similar to this really. * Expecting salary to exactly match value - i.e. to get the same pay remote working no matter where you live. The number of people here that fundamentally don't understand that salary is a supply/demand negotiation is weird. And they really don't think it through to the obvious conclusion if it did happen - they'd get paid the same as people in Eastern Europe or India. I think a 4-day work week could eventually happen, but HN types like to pretend it will make people more productive which it absolutely won't. It probably won't reduce productivity to 80%.

I agree that it shouldn’t be mandated with laws, but I don’t agree that it should be left totally up to employer / employee because the power balance of negotiation still sits with the employer too much.

Then when asked why you went from being confused on why they couldn't use the results showing their effectiveness to try and enforce another \"effective\" day, to then denying the results and saying that it's already effective and to ask others to personally prove to you why it isn't effective (instead of reading the article).

    "originBody": "In on the secret — WhatsApp finally forces Pegasus spyware maker to share its secret code Israeli spyware maker loses fight to only share information on installation. Ashley Belanger - 3/1/2024, 8:27 PM Enlarge NurPhoto / ContributorNurPhoto reader comments 47 WhatsApp will soon be granted access to explore the \"full functionality\" of the NSO Group's Pegasus spyware—sophisticated malware the Israeli Ministry of Defense has long guarded as a \"highly sought\" state secret, The Guardian reported. Since 2019, WhatsApp has pushed for access to the NSO's spyware code after alleging that Pegasus was used to spy on 1,400 WhatsApp users over a two-week period, gaining unauthorized access to their sensitive data, including encrypted messages. WhatsApp suing the NSO, Ars noted at the time, was \"an unprecedented legal action\" that took \"aim at the unregulated industry that sells sophisticated malware services to governments around the world.\" Initially, the NSO sought to block all discovery in the lawsuit \"due to various US and Israeli restrictions,\" but that blanket request was denied. Then, last week, the NSO lost another fight to keep WhatsApp away from its secret code. As the court considered each side's motions to compel discovery, a US district judge, Phyllis Hamilton, rejected the NSO's argument that it should only be required to hand over information about Pegasus' installation layer. Hamilton sided with WhatsApp, granting the Meta-owned app's request for \"information concerning the full functionality of the relevant spyware,\" writing that \"information showing the functionality of only the installation layer of the relevant spyware would not allow plaintiffs to understand how the relevant spyware performs the functions of accessing and extracting data.\" WhatsApp has alleged that Pegasus can \"intercept communications sent to and from a device, including communications over iMessage, Skype, Telegram, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and others” and that it could also be \"customized for different purposes, including to intercept communications, capture screenshots, and exfiltrate browser history.\" To prove this, WhatsApp needs access to \"all relevant spyware\"—specifically “any NSO spyware targeting or directed at WhatsApp servers, or using WhatsApp in any way to access Target Devices\"—for \"a period of one year before the alleged attack to one year after the alleged attack,\" Hamilton concluded. Advertisement The NSO has so far not commented on the order, but WhatsApp was pleased with this outcome. “The recent court ruling is an important milestone in our long running goal of protecting WhatsApp users against unlawful attacks,\" WhatsApp's spokesperson told The Guardian. \"Spyware companies and other malicious actors need to understand they can be caught and will not be able to ignore the law.\" But Hamilton did not grant all of WhatsApp's requests for discovery, sparing the NSO from sharing specific information regarding its server architecture because WhatsApp \"would be able to glean the same information from the full functionality of the alleged spyware.\" Perhaps more significantly, the NSO also won't be compelled to identify its clients. While the NSO does not publicly name the governments that purchase its spyware, reports indicate that Poland, Saudi Arabia, Rwanda, India, Hungary, and the United Arab Emirates have used it to target dissidents, The Guardian reported. In 2021, the US blacklisted the NSO for allegedly spreading \"digital tools used for repression.\" In the same order, Hamilton also denied the NSO's request to compel WhatsApp to share its post-complaint communications with the Citizen Lab, which served as a third-party witness in the case to support WhatsApp's argument that \"Pegasus is misused by NSO’s customers against ‘civil society.’\" It appeared that the NSO sought WhatsApp's post-complaint communications with Citizen Lab as a way to potentially pressure WhatsApp into dropping Citizen Lab's statement from the record. Hamilton quoted a court filing from the NSO that curiously noted: \"If plaintiffs would agree to withdraw from their case Citizen Lab’s contention that Pegasus was used against members of ‘civil society’ rather than to investigate terrorism and serious crime, there would be much less need for this discovery.” Ultimately, Hamilton denied the NSO's request because \"the court fails to see the relevance of the requested discovery.\" As discovery in the case proceeds, the court expects to receive expert disclosures from each side on August 30 before the trial, which is expected to start on March 3, 2025. reader comments 47 Ashley Belanger Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

Interesting approach. The court could probably care less about Israeli restrictions as it's a different country. Officially US govt blacklisted Pegasus https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/us-blacklists-ma.... However, I wouldn't be surprised if some US spy agencies are still using it. If that's the case, Pegasus might try asking US intel agencies to block the case on the basis of disclose of classified info or harming national interests. It would be interesting to see if all of the sudden \"something happens\" and the case is mysteriously dropped. reply ethbr1 11 hours agoparentI doubt US spy agencies still use it in any official capacity. Far easier to just request and obtain the resulting intelligence from partner intelligence organizations who are using it. Arms-length collection is less legally perilous. But which does bode poorly for any assertion of national security in US courts! \"Are you using this software?\" \"Officially, no.\" \"Then on what basis do you claim national security?\" reply gsk22 10 hours agorootparentThanks to the FISA \"court\" system, I doubt US spy agencies fear any legal reprecussions. No need to follow the law if you have a secret court where no one has standing to challenge your actions. reply ethbr1 8 hours agorootparentOmnipotent and yet completely legally-neutered FISA is a lazy excuse to avoid thinking about things. There are no illuminati. There are powerful institutions, who nonetheless fear other powerful institutions. In this case, intelligence preferring to remain out of the courts and newspapers. reply asveikau 4 hours agorootparentThe problem with FISA as I understand it is not illuminati. It's that the court probably approves almost everything the government asks for without scrutiny. In general, most courts probably have issues like this -- when their job might be oversight and scrutiny they end up as a rubber stamp for the powerful, like cops, prosecutors, etc. For FISA it's especially bad because decisions and arguments made aren't public. reply ethbr1 3 hours agorootparentBut it nonetheless exists and could be reformed if there were political will. There was a (much worse) time when FISA didn't exist. There can also be a future time in which something even stronger exists! It's annoying to get low-effort whatabout'isms that are justifications for inaction on the basis that nothing will ever change. It has and it can. reply mardifoufs 5 hours agorootparentprevWho said anything about illuminatis? Does FISA effectively allow intelligence agencies to hide stuff or not? And can you show me a concrete example of IA actually getting punished from other powerful institutions in any meaningful way? reply ethbr1 3 hours agorootparentFISA allows them to conduct it legally. It doesn't have anything to do with hiding. Before FISA, they generally just did it, without asking anyone. And press reports on intelligence operations led directly to the Church/Pike Committees, which led to EO 11905/12036. reply mardifoufs 2 hours agorootparentWho exactly was punished by that EO? You are proving my point, even the most \"push back\" IAs have seen in terms of concrete actions against them led to... a directive that forbid them from murdering people in foreign countries. No actual consequences for anyone involved, no one got even a slap on the wrist in terms of actual consequences. And that's after the church committee, which revealed some super damning stuff. Oh, and they went back to doing it after a few decades. reply ethbr1 1 hour agorootparentAre you really asking me to cite classified operations? And the fact that subsequent Executive Orders explicitly loosened the reigns on intelligence collection (and assassination with respect to \"terrorists\") indicates that yes, the original orders did restrict intelligence operations. reply j16sdiz 4 hours agorootparentprev> There are powerful institutions, who nonetheless fear other powerful institutions. They don't \"fear\" other powerful institution. Just like chess players, they \"game\" with each other. reply staplers 5 hours agorootparentprevThere are no illuminati. Interesting psyops to conflate corruption with \"illuminati\".. reply cheeze 11 hours agorootparentprevI don't know much in this space, but if I'm the US Gov I'm happy that all of the attention is on Pegasus and not other (presumably) tens (hundreds) of similar programs out there. reply dkjaudyeqooe 11 hours agoparentprevWhat's \"interesting\" is that they claim protection available to governments, as if they speak and act on behalf of those governments. reply rdtsc 6 hours agorootparentExactly, that's pretty odd.

The majority of the world is not American, and presumably the majority of Americans don't use the incorrect phrase, so why should the rest of the world cater for a minority within a minority by putting their butchered phrase on equal footing with the correct phrase? reply cortesoft 5 hours agorootparentAnd logically, flammable and inflammable mean the exact opposite, but here we are. reply omneity 3 hours agorootparentNot quite. \"in\" here as a prefix is not a negation thing but to _do_ something like \"en\" in \"enhance\" or \"encapsulate\". The word's actual latin root is \"inflammare\" which means to put something _in_ flames. The subject is the one doing the burning and it's transitive. Flammable on the hand comes from \"flammare\", which means for something to catch fire, and is intransitive instead, i.e. the subject is the one catching fire. The actual opposite of inflammable is uninflammable, which I reckon is only in British English at this point and mostly lost in American English. reply sirsinsalot 8 hours agorootparentprevIf I make a mistake like this, please correct me. That's one way I can improve. This attitude of just not correcting people is idiotic. It's on the person receiving the correction or criticism to ignore it if they wish. Not on people to be silent. reply serial_dev 5 hours agorootparentLike I could care less (but the \"like\" is silent) reply hackerlight 7 hours agorootparentprevIt doesn't mean the opposite, though. For a formal linguistic example, see the concept of compound words. The meaning of the compound word does not equal the meaning of any of the constituent words. Often because the definition of the constituent words has drifted over time while usage of the compound word remained fixed. You may unilaterally think that's wrong because you wish to impose a set of rules on language that others don't share, but that's not how meaning works. A sentence is just a string of bits. Meaning comes from a shared consensus about how to parse those bits into meaning. reply delta_p_delta_x 33 minutes agorootparent> You may unilaterally think that's wrong because you wish to impose a set of rules on language that others don't share, but that's not how meaning works. 'A set of rules' is called grammar. It may have arisen organically and out of 'shared consensus' but today languages only make sense when we maintain that grammar. Imagine if the positions of the words in the above sentence were randomly jumbled up. It'd make no sense at all. English is somewhat more lax than other languages about grammar (stemming from its extremely wide usage) while still being able to get the point through, but striving for correct grammar should always be a goal, even if 'the point has got through'. Many other stricter and older Indo-European languages that haven't experienced as many changes as English has, can be machine-parsed like a programming language. Sanskrit and Latin come to mind. reply mardifoufs 5 hours agorootparentprevThe majority of the world doesn't speak English, so why care about using correct English at all right? Btw American English is still the most common variant on the internet. More so than British English. reply skyyler 9 hours agorootparentprevBecause you knew what they meant and trying to correct them only serves to make you feel good about your own knowledge. You aren't helping anyone when you correct them on this. reply lmm 7 hours agorootparentIf you understood someone with difficulty, offering a correction is constructive, particularly on the web where editing is often easy. reply o11c 7 hours agorootparentprevIt costs everyone time and effort to try to decode nonsensical input. It's a crime against humanity to not correct grammar. reply zztop44 4 hours agorootparentIt’s not grammar and it’s not a correction. The phrase “I could care less” has only one meaning and that meaning is “I don’t care”. It is being used correctly. reply pests 6 hours agorootparentprevDoes it? I decode it instantly and understand the meaning just like I know what a \"fishbowl\" is. There is no \"decoding\" or even nonsensical input in this case. You are just being stubborn and trying to adhere to an outdated standard. Upgrade or get replaced. reply gifvenut 2 hours agorootparentBut you are not everyone. reply Onawa 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree. I've learned to not care when people say 'expresso' instead of 'espresso', and 'ex cetera' instead of 'et cetera'. I know what they mean, you know what they mean, and correcting everyone only serves to alienate others. reply petesergeant 6 hours agorootparent> I've learned to not care when people say 'expresso' instead of 'espresso' I stopped correcting people on stuff like this 20 years ago, but sadly haven’t been able to stop myself caring :-/ “Expresso” still grates reply skyyler 6 hours agorootparentprevA little kindness goes a long way. reply ryanjshaw 2 hours agorootparentprevThe examples in that article do not actually argue for the point being made (that this has been going on for 70 years): > His bearing towards male acquaintances, of whom he knew little or nothing and could care less, ... Here, \"could care less\" refers to how little he knows about the male acquaintances, and is effectively saying he cares even less than the little he knows. When we see people write \"could care less', they don't write it in the same context, at all. And then: > It is impossible that he could care less. This is clearly a different way to write \"couldn't care less\", and is again not how we see people use the phrase \"could care less\". That being said, \"could care less\" is definitely a thing of the last 10-20 years and is not going anywhere. reply abenga 3 hours agorootparentprevOne day, this reasoning will formalize the use of \"would/could/should of\" and I will rage quit English as a language. reply Jerrrry 7 hours agorootparentprevPer my \"troll metric\" / rage bait/\"le reddit quantification\", formalized as a response's comment's conversational entropy divided by parent comment length, this is a fantastic comment.

At the end of the day, it’s between platforms (specifically iOS and Apple) and these exploit devs/traders, afaiu. That’s why Apple hates them. For better or worse, putting a torch under Apple’s ass is probably a good thing for the rest of us. OTOH, you could argue that Apple should be more of top of these things and reward the security researchers better. Things are better than 20y ago, but still it’s probably more lucrative to sell exploits to these shady actors than to scrape the floor for peanuts in hope that mega corps will reward their discoveries. reply xvector 8 hours agorootparent> than to scrape the floor for peanuts in hope that mega corps will reward their discoveries.

Why would a US court have any jurisdiction over a foreign Israeli spyware vendor that has already been blacklisted by the US government? And why would Israel send their spyware source code to WhatsApp even if they lose the case? reply xxpor 10 hours agoparentBecause the NSO group handles dollars. If they didn't respond, they'd lose by default, and the court could order any assets the US can get their hands on seized. If they're getting paid in NIS by countries outside of Israel, the currency conversion happens with dollars as the intermediary. There's the US's window. reply jevoten 9 hours agorootparentHow is \"Because the NSO group handles dollars\" related to \"the court could order any assets the US can get their hands on seized\"? Presumably, if they were getting paid in bars of gold, the US could seize those too, if they could get their hands on them, no? On the other hand, if they were paid in US dollars, but in cash, that wouldn't establish jurisdiction, nor could it be seized, if the transfer happened outside US territory? reply vineyardmike 8 hours agorootparentHow would they get paid? Almost every bank in every us-allied countries would have to comply to hand over the money. The US banking regulations apply overseas because those banks want to interact with US entities. That's the nature of the US-Dollar economy. Are you a French wine maker that wants to sell to America? You better be using USD with a friendly bank to pay for things like import fees/tariffs (or the American company you work with better do that). Sure you can deal only in Euros if you want, but at some point there's a conversion to USD when you sell to Americans. Middle Eastern Oil Company? Same thing. German Car company? Same. Brazilian fruit farm? Same. How about importing your Coca Cola products, and iPhones? Buying ads from Google? USD and a US-friendly banks are everywhere in the global economy because the US is such a big market. Those banks will be banned from US commerce if they work with the NSO and don't hand over the NSO's money, and will lose tons of \"innocent\" business (like those nice wine makers in France). Their governments probably have treaties with the US, so they don't have a legal choice anyways. The US influence is viral. reply jevoten 6 hours agorootparentBut that's because they're doing business with banks that want to remain friendly with the US, not because they're doing business specifically in US dollars. If they got paid in Turkish liras, but through a bank under US influence, those liras would also get seized, wouldn't they? On the other hand, if someone used a local bank in their country to transact with an entity in China, and China demanded their assets in that bank be seized because they defamed a revolutionary hero [1], I would expect that country to block that seizure, regardless of how the bank itself might feel. I.e. they would demand any seizures comply with their local laws, similar to how extraditions (are supposed to) work, and not let other countries essentially steal from their citizens. Or looking at it a bit different, a bank can't take from its customers on behalf of a foreign country, since locals laws, unless they explicitly allow that taking, would consider it theft. [1] https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-lawmaking-idUSKBN1H... Edit as reply because \"I'm posting too fast\" (thanks HN for not telling when I can post again by the way): > Discussion about the US dollar misses the point. They do it because they can I'd argue it doesn't miss the point, but rather, hides the true cause - that as you say, they do it because they can (as quickly becomes obvious when no other currency has this viral jurisdictional effect). But I'm curious if anyone has ever tried suing their bank, in a non-US court, alleging that their seizure of their assets was illegal under local law. I can understand a bank rolling over for the US government, but it would be interesting to see if and how their legal system would justify it. Especially for something that is not a crime in their country. reply qazwse_ 4 hours agorootparentI think a similar situation you can look into is the sanctions on Carrie Lam. While they are sanctions instead of a lawsuit, they did result in her losing access to all banking facilities in HK and China regardless of the fact they probably didn't think she didn't anything wrong. I think for most countries, keeping their banks working trumps almost all other considerations. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/28/hong-kong-carr... reply selectodude 6 hours agorootparentprevThere are very few FOREX currency pairs that aren’t USD to whatever.

The involvement of USD in and of itself is not relevant to whether the US government has jurisdiction. reply serial_dev 5 hours agorootparentprevDiscussion about the US dollar misses the point. They do it because they can, basically we all live under the influence of the US empire, they can put pressure on most banks of they really want to, and if they really want to, details like which currency was used will not stop them. reply lmm 7 hours agorootparentprevThe overwhelming majority of dollars are not physical cash, and the overwhelming majority of dollar transactions by volume happen in a fashion which New York claims jurisdiction over (and, ultimately, has a big army that will back them on, which is what really matters in international law), even when neither party has any obvious connection to the US. Even for physical cash, they might claim jurisdiction.

If the US govt sanctions you, they can tell all banks in the world that if they touch your (virtual) money they'll be sanctioned too. If some podunk dictatorship no one did business with announced \"Any bank doing business with xxpor will be barred from working in our country!\" then many banks will probably say \"Fine, you're a tiny economy that we don't have anyone that does business with a business in your country anyway, so you can take that sanctions and shove it\". Ironically paper money is the way to \"escape\" sanctions, because anyone around the world knows that that 100 dollar bill can be exchanged for goods and services.

Or more like they'll just order JP Morgan or whomever to fork over your bank's cash because that's how banks interact with each other.

If you're a foreign bank, to transact with anyone in the US you have to do business in the US. The court orders the bank to fork over somebody's cash, they do because they have to and the alternative is disconnecting themselves from the rest of the financial system. Several Swiss banks got the death penalty because they failed to be quite as isolated and secretive as advertised (i.e. they had agents in the US doing business) To seize somebody's gold you'd have to go physically get it. To seize their dollars you just go say hi to their bank. Unless you're an \"enemy combatant\" the US isn't going to go do extraordinary rendition on your assets, so you're pile of foreign gold is safe.

Equatorial Guinea was one such example, with dictator Obiang and his ExxonMobil contract. Steve Coll mentions this in \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power\" (2012): > \"Fortunately for Obiang, coup-prone African governments rolling in oil but lacking in arms and intelligence to defend their bounty had a discrete alternative to the Pentagon and C.I.A. for defense support: Israel. Quietly, the Bush Administration encouraged Obiang to enter into security and commercial ties with Tel Aviv.\" Azerbaijan is a similar example as US weapons sales were banned for human rights abuse reasons. A Wikileaked US State Dept cable stated (2009) \"Through its close relations with Israel, Azerbaijan gets a level of access to the quality weapon systems it needs to develop its army that it can not obtain from the U.S. and Europe due to various legal limitations...\" If the dictatorial government funnels the oil money into the Western banking system, then the US turns a blind eye to this kind of thing (e.g. Saudi and UAE use of Pegasus to persecute pro-democracy activists) and if not, it's sanctions and regime change time. reply CatWChainsaw 5 hours agoparentprevWell it probably sells those same tools to the West as well.

A lot of roles are simply about training personnel in security principles and procedures, implementing data classification etc. Not everyone deals directly with attacks.

Current work culture is bizarre in cyber security. I am not personally very fan of it. Nobody wants to work on defensive side. You are not getting either fame or money if you do your work well. The expectation is that you do your work perfectly. There is no actually measurements in place to prove that your good code prevented 100 data breaches! But on the other hand, if you are on offensive side, sometimes find cool bugs, you get fame and money. Does not matter if there is a long break sometimes. Your goodness is measures based on how much money you got. What does it mean? People start doing bug bounties. They hoard tools only for themselves to make more money, instead of releasing them to improve general security. They keep small bugs themselves so that they can be used in exploit chains to get bigger bounties. If the reputation of the company is based on the participations of the bug bounty program, they start doing less and less in-house engineering and outsource the cyber security testing for bug bounty platforms. And vicious cycle starts. reply saagarjha 8 hours agorootparentPlenty of people working on the defensive side are famous, sometimes even more famous than those who do offensive work.

    "originLink": "https://chriscoyier.net/2024/02/28/where-im-at-on-the-whole-css-tricks-thing/",
    "originBody": "February 28, 2024 Where I’m at on the whole CSS-Tricks thing It was March 2022 when I sold CSS-Tricks to DigitalOcean. So it’s been just about 2 years now. This was me and my wife’s thinking: The negotiated sale price was fair. They are a big company (public!) with tons of resources, and their clear stated strategy was to invest in content and community, because that’s where the top of the funnel is, and it’s good for business. They didn’t just talk this way, they were obviously investing in content and community. There is a chance CSS-Tricks becomes better. They were already decently well known for good content in DevOps and Back End, but were missing solid Front-End content. Filling this gap makes sense. They would rip all the ads off the site. There would be only one “ad”: use DigitalOcean. I’m no advertising hater, it’s always been good to me, but the thought of CSS-Tricks as a clean ad-free site was appealing. They would keep on Geoff, the lead editor, if he wanted it. He did and they did. I was way way too busy trying to run CSS-Tricks and co-run CodePen and it was hard on me. After the sale, things seemed kinda fine for a bit, and that was encouraging. It was cool seeing new voices publishing new work I had nothing to do with. Then started to limp, using up the momentum that it had. A year later they fired Geoff along with everyone else working on content and community. That was the real torpedo. It seems DigitalOcean got excited when the whole industry started doing huge layoffs, they followed suit and slurped up the profits. The necessary directional change was: screw content and community. A month after that, the last article was published on CSS-Tricks, an overview of Passkeys, which will now apparently be on the homepage forever, a very strange bit of content to emblazon the tombstone of the site. They also added a cookie button that looks like a 4th grader designed it?? And started publishing every blog post as a guide??? How do I feel about all that? Well I’m not stoked, but I’m an adult I knew the risks. I sold the site. They now control it. They can do whatever they want with it. They could replace the entire site with antag that says Chris Coyier smells like donkeys and that would be their right. I’ve heard from plenty of people who are pissed. Some are pissed at me. Sellout, yadda yadda. But I’m actually fairly pleased that the site is still online, relatively untouched, and with everybody’s bylines, including my own, intact. That’s a better outcome than scotch.io, purchased from Chris Sev, which was neutered and ultimately turned off. That’s a much more inglorious ending that I hope never happens to CSS-Tricks. Hopefully that doesn’t happen, although during my 3-month consulting period I know they were very interested in porting the content to their own internal SSG system. As someone who has built a lot of SSG-powered sites and a lot of WordPress-sites, all I can say is CSS-Tricks is WordPress-y-as-hell, and I cannot possibly imagine a conversion that maintains any level of quality as being worth the effort. A lot more people are pissed at DigitalOcean. People saying they’ll never use them again, and generally upset they’d take such a useful asset and do nothing with it. A void in the industry that doesn’t sit right. Does any of this negative sentiment actually affect DigitalOcean meaningfully? I have no clue. It can’t help, but I’m sure if it was that big of a deal they would prioritize fixing it somehow. It seems more likely it’s a oh well you win some you lose some shrug it off situation. It’s almost certainly not acting as that strong top-of-funnel player they originally were hoping for it. I bet you could probably guess all that, or piece it together from things publicly said. What you probably don’t know is that I tried to get it back. I got an email from a fella a while back who is now a VP of Content & Community at DigitalOcean who came over from the Cloudways acquisition. I think “ownership” of CSS-Tricks kinda fell is his lap after some internal shifts. Unlike his predecessors, he didn’t have any hangups about just talking directly to me. What he originally wanted was just to learn what it’s going to take to get spun back up and producing again. A “return on investment” is what he was after, understandably. I was as frank with him as I am with anyone: It’s gonna take a lot. They would need a new lead editor, and you might be able to see how people might be squeamish about that role with the last one publicly axed not long ago. Maybe that person knows WordPress development pretty well? If not, ideally, you have someone know that knows WordPress pretty well, because the site uses everything. And maybe that person knows how to wrangle up really good front-end specific writers? If you find that magical person, that’s a developer, writer, community builder, and site-running editor, it’s going to be expensive. More likely you gotta build a team again, and it’s going to take them a while to get things going, so your investment gets deeper and deeper, while the return remains unclear. This got me thinking. Maybe a little braggadocious here, butttt I’m basically the perfect person for the job. Let’s just say the most perfect person on Earth for the job lolz. But I’m not even sure I’d want to do it again, and I have no idea if they would even want me to. But I definitely don’t wanna do free consulting work on it. So I took my big swing. Here’s my best (and wildest) idea. I run CSS-Tricks again myself. CSS-Tricks is big and complicated. Anybody walking in the door alone is going to have a serious learning curve just in getting comfortable operating the basics. I already know every inch of it. I get people reading again. I get people writing again. I get people excited again. I erase any bad mojo against DigitalOcean, fix that brand damage. Get people saying they want to use DigitalOcean instead of saying they never will again. (e.g. 1, 2, 3) Then we do the most valuable possible thing for DigitalOcean: get content on there that helps people know about and do things on DigitalOcean. There are some big wins there. Astro is big right now in front-end, why isn’t DigitalOcean on this list? Let’s get that article written and linked up. We can make a special section of the site that is just DigitalOcean content, making it easy to browse and find stuff. Then we do the second most valuable thing we can do: move the hosting to DigitalOcean and have it be a living, breathing endorsement of DO being a great place to host a WordPress website. Now we’re back in action. Why would I do that? You transfer ownership of CSS-Tricks back to me. Why would you do that? You’re trying to get to break even on it. This means you aren’t spending any more money and time. You’re now just extracting marketing, branding, and conversion value out of money already spent. You don’t have to spend any more time on this, personally or institutionally. Any other internal costs are gone. The community will love it. The trick is in the details. We’d get to an agreement on what has to happen for it to work. For example, no other web host can be advertised on the site for X time, etc. I’d call that a big swing, anyway. I’ll just take it back please and thank you. But I feel like I made the case OK that it’s not completely crazy. Crickets for a while. A few back and forth emails like “still thinking about this…” later, and the conclusion is that the fella basically doesn’t have the “conviction to push it within the halls at DO”. Understandable, really. I wouldn’t want to be handed a huge golden nugget by my boss and then ask for a meeting and be like “I think we should give it back to the leprechaun.” When I pitched that, I wasn’t even 100% sure I wanted it, mainly for stress reasons. But I’m sure I could have figured out a way to run a more minimal ship with reduced stress and the site would be in a much more pleasant place. Anyway, if you want to know some basic information about Passkeys I know a site you can check out. Related 🤘",

That explains why they pulled the plug on all their resources. They believed they could get sizeable traffic towards DigitalOcean and their products, but soon they realized (or some marketing/strategy person in the company proved it) that the audience that cares about CSS and front-end won't likely be buying their products. Because if it was giving them the ROI, I see no reason why they would cut off all the resources. Their tutorials work because most of them are related to server administration that directly brings programmers who might be interested in DO's products.

And unlike some other commenter here saying they only did it because CSS tutorials don't give them ROI, extra information here is that they also did it with javascript tutorials, like scotch.io, so I am leaning towards to that DO just do poorly with their investment regardless. I wrote more about their track record in buying indie dev blog and then kill them in my newsletter last year when CSS-Tricks's editor got laid off: https://build.typogram.co/p/dont-sell-your-indie-business-to I think Chris pointed out a very key fact: running site like css tricks or scotch.io takes a special mix of skill, organically the site grows big with one or two person with that right mix of skills, but once big corporate bought it and for whatever reason didn't retain that talent, they have to replace it with a team, which kills the ROI. reply wentin 5 hours agoparentQuote from my newsletter “Don’t Sell Your Indie Business to Digital Ocean!”: The sad part of the story is that most of what happened can’t be traced easily. Domain redirect can be set up with a few clicks of a button, and soon enough, most people forget these indie blogs ever existed and what happened to them. I want to write down what I saw so that there is a record of what Digital Ocean has done or has not done. Back in 2014, I turned to Scotch.io to learn AngularJS. Scotch.io offered clear and concise tutorials that were easy to follow, even for someone who was new to the framework. I saved many tutorial articles to my browser’s bookmark; as I don’t clean up my bookmarks, I still have them saved up in my messy bookmark folder today. One day I dug up and clicked on a scotch.io article from my bookmark and was surprised to see that it returned a “404 page not found” error. After some research, it turned out that Digital Ocean bought scotch.io, so consequently, the scotch.io home page got redirected to Digital Ocean’s homepage, and articles like the ones I saved were removed. What was my problem with that? I didn’t know where to begin. Redirecting a blog to a product page with no context was just intentionally wasting my time — why would a visitor of a blog not be surprised to land on “Try Digital Ocean for free for 60 days”? And the cherry on top? Not setting up a wild card page rule to redirect all scotch.io article links to Digital Ocean, hence why I got a 404 error — they can’t even do their evil with efficiency. They wanted to milk this cow dry but had a leaky bucket — the stupidity, the carelessness, the insult to the editor who spent years creating quality content. Also, wasn’t Digital Ocean a service to host websites? Setting up page redirects is literally part of their service, and what a demonstration they had put on! The above was what I witnessed in 2022. As of writing this article in February 2023, Digital Ocean has fixed some of the issues. Now all links of scotch.io redirect to the Digital Ocean community, which at least hosts some tech content. The original blog articles of scotch.io are still missing from the Internet. I searched for the titles that were saved to my bookmarks and couldn’t find them, on the Digital Ocean community or elsewhere. It is as if they were never written. What triggers me to write down these words above as “record” is that Digital Ocean bought CSS Tricks — another beloved tech blog — about a year ago, and recently they laid off the only editor of CSS Tricks. It is entirely possible that one day we will lose access to CSS Tricks content like “A Complete Guide to Flexbox” — a front-end “staple food,” a link that always shows up in purple in search results; and instead, we get to enjoy losing 3 seconds of our life being redirected and then bounce. Some of you may think that Digital Ocean will treat CSS Tricks more nicely, and that they won’t take down its quality content written over a decade of time. CSS Tricks is much more famous and high-profile than scotch.io, after all. I wouldn’t be too sure because of what happened to coding-fonts.css-tricks.com — go ahead, click on it. It is broken and just redirects to another page. I launched a similar project called codingfont.com back in 2021, which is a tournament-style game to pick the winner coding font. Chris Coyier, the founder of CSS Tricks, wrote about it, which brought massive traffic to my site (Thanks, Chris! I am grateful as a fellow tinkerer). The article mentioned that CSS Tricks had built their own coding font microsite. Fast forward to May 2022, less than two months after CSS Tricks got bought, the CSS Tricks microsite was broken, and someone reported an issue on Github. Chris, who would be in an advisory role according to the Digital Ocean announcement, answered quickly: > I’m afraid I’m not sure what Digital Ocean plans to do with it. I would, of course, vote for it to be re-hosted right at coding-fonts.css-tricks.com — and would be happy to help put it on Digital Ocean App Platform as well! It was clear that Chris as an advisor wasn’t given any real access to decision-makers at Digital Ocean to make any difference in such a simple matter. It was such a simple and easy matter to solve that a bystander came forward and hosted the microsite somewhere else, ironically on Netlify — a competitor to Digital Ocean. So there you go, another record I put down here in case Digital Ocean bothers to correct it one day, let the Internet remember that it had happened. My open plea to Digital Ocean: Stop this unethical business practice NOW! Your company buys these blogs to build a good reputation among the developer community, but clearly, the plan has failed. Instead, it hurts your brand, and I will never use your service. It is not too late to keep your promises — publish new content to the site, or at least keep the site alive and working as it is. My appeal to other content creators: Don’t sell your indie business to Digital Ocean. reply quickthrower2 21 hours agoprevNot a sellout.

    "originBody": "Atlanta Transit Local The 'Atlanta Magnet Man' is saving our car tires, one bike ride at a time Jasmine RobinsonWABE February 29th, 2024 The Atlanta Magnet Man is cleaning Atlanta's streets of metal debris, one bike ride at a time. (Courtesy of Alex Benigno) One Atlanta resident has taken it upon himself to clean the streets of nails, screws and other metal bits that have been left to accumulate in large amounts. Known as the “Atlanta Magnet Man,” Alex Benigno bikes around Atlanta with a hitched trailer that uses magnets to attract metal debris that poses a risk to people’s car tires. The idea is completely his own, and he does it for free. “I can’t really find anybody that says what I’m doing is a terrible thing unless, you know, they own a tire shop,” he said. Benigno, a native Atlantan, first identified the problem early in the COVID-19 pandemic when roads were empty. During work commutes, his car and motorcycle tires were damaged by nails. After he realized how many more drivers would be affected when traffic conditions returned to normal, he worked to find a solution. “I like to randomly do things to help when nobody’s looking,” Benigno said. “I’ll do just random stuff to help improve things that will benefit random people that I’ve never met before … it’s just so that I can do a little thing to fix something so somebody doesn’t suffer down the road.” In June 2023, Benigno first equipped his bike trailer with magnets. After several months of trial and error, he found the perfect configuration for the trailer and has been riding consistently since last December. Nearly every day, Benigno bikes about 10 miles and picks up around six pounds of debris — about the max the magnets can carry. Over the course of eight weeks, he collected over 410 pounds of metal, recently donating it to a local scrap artist. Benigno started documenting his journeys on Instagram and has amassed over 22,000 followers since January. His most popular video, with nearly 2 million views on Instagram, shows footage of the magnets as he bikes along I-285 and S. Atlanta Road. So far, he said the roads he’s biked with the most debris are South Cobb Drive in Smyrna and Grassdale Road in Cartersville. Thanks to a successful GoFundMe campaign, he was able to cover the cost of a bike lane sweeper prototype. And although he’s not motivated to make a fortune, he said it’d be cool just to earn a living wage cleaning streets full-time. Fundraiser by Alex Benigno : Clean up glass from Atlanta’s bike lanes https://t.co/JH7MrDu8sE — Chris Test (@ChrisTest82) February 9, 2024 “If I never got any recognition for this, I’d still be doing it anyway because it’s so effective,” he said. Although magnetic sweepers are used for things like airport runways and at Air Force bases, it would be impossible to use them on streets riddled with metal plates, grates and manhole covers. Benigno is able to dodge those obstacles on a bike — usually. And while Atlanta does quarterly street sweeping, metal debris still falls through the cracks. Rebecca Serna, the executive director of PropelATL (formerly the Atlanta Bicycle Coalition), said Benigno is highlighting a real need in Atlanta’s public services. “What Alex is doing is incredible, and we’re really inspired by it,” Serna said. “But also we want to see the city invest in the systems and the people in the equipment so that they can maintain our public infrastructure.” The Atlanta Department of Transportation and the Department of Public Works both play a part in the safety of the streets. Atlanta’s transportation department budget was cut by 12% last year. She said that about $50 million is three times less than peer cities. PropelATL is particularly focused on keeping bike lanes clean and safe. She says the city doesn’t have street sweepers that can reach separated bike lanes, so all sorts of debris don’t get cleaned and pose a risk to people in motion. “People using scooters and bikes, Onewheels, skateboards, wheelchairs are all affected by debris in the street, and especially in the separated bike [lane],” she said. For now, it’s up to individuals to keep the streets clean. “A lot of folks … they’re kind of DIY-ing it until we can get the level of public service that we really need.” Related Race Jan 31, 2024 Report examines the historic use of highways to segregate and displace Black residents Listen 20:50 Metro Atlanta Jan 26, 2024 Weatherman Chesley McNeil talks navigating Atlanta through ‘Snowmageddon’ chaos 10 years ago Listen 4:15 City of Atlanta Jan 22, 2024 New e-bike rebate program expected to offer Atlanta residents up to $2,000 Listen 17:30 Top Stories Fani Willis With salacious testimony finished, legal arguments to begin over Fani Willis’ future in Trump case LGBTQ Georgia Senate passes religious liberty bill despite LGBTQ discrimination concerns Georgia Legislation Georgia lawmakers pass immigration crackdown, religious liberty protections at Crossover Day deadline Georgia Legislation Georgia Senate passes bill banning taxpayer, private funds for American Library Association Black History Month Atlanta's Oakland Cemetery doesn't shy away from teaching its history of slavery, segregation Listen 3:36 Atlanta Transit The 'Atlanta Magnet Man' is saving our car tires, one bike ride at a time",

Too bad silver/gold isn't probably magnetic enough. reply dredmorbius 7 hours agoprevThe story discusses, and dismisses, the option of incorporating magnetic sweeping into regular street-sweeping operations, though I find the argument unconvincing. If your goal is to pick up loose ferrous material (much of which incidentally turns out to be dust, some of which is apparently meteoric in origin), you don't need magnets which are capable of yoinking a manhole cover or sewer grating out of the ground. An array of magnets, periodically wiped into the normal trash flow, should do the trick. (This is a case where electromagnets rather than fixed magnets are probably superior.) A fancy-pants solution might use GPS and GIS to note locations of known ferrous infrastructure (grates and the like), though it seems to me that simply by tuning the magnet's strength and reach it should be possible to, say, lift a few grams of nails or tacks, whilst leaving the 100kg+ covers and grates in place. (There are a few smaller utility openings, though I suspect those are rare, as street furniture generally needs to Not Move whilst being trampled by autos, lorries, busses, etc.) This is of course aside from Atlanta's apparently quite stingy sweeping schedule, another matter. reply alanbernstein 20 hours agoprevThis makes me want to get a battery powered shop vac, so I can carry it on my bike and spot-clean gravel and glass messes... reply duxup 20 hours agoparentWhen my kids were younger I used to bring things to clean up / fix local playgrounds that I was at every day.

The person who cares enough to clean up a mess in a local park is eventually going to give up when they notice that it's always the same people leaving the mess in the first place and that cleaning up for them is only emboldening them further. Ideally what would happen is that people would be self-conscious enough to figure out after one or two slip ups that someone else is having to clean up for them, and feel bad enough to avoid doing it in the future. This has become one of my bigger hard learned lessons. I used to go out of my way to be as considerate as possible to everyone I interacted with, trying to predict issues and mentioning them early to make things easier for others even if it might inconvenience myself. The idea was that people would reciprocate enough that it'd make things easier for myself too. But over the years I've had to stop accepting that, because as it turns out, most people really don't care. Being extremely accommodating and planning ahead to fit someone's constraints won't mean that I get the courtesy returned. They'll just continue to push me around at their own convenience. reply wolverine876 15 hours agorootparent> The person who cares enough to clean up a mess in a local park is eventually going to give up Maybe some, but certainly not all! > The idea was that people would reciprocate enough that it'd make things easier for myself too. Here is the flaw in your plan; it was a flaw in my plan too. In more naive days, I thought that too. Then at some point we realize what you did: people don't do good things, and you aren't going to change most of them. That's when we can take a big step forward, and learn what true altruism, generosity, and most of all, what love is: It's caring for and doing good for people who don't 'deserve' it; who act like jerks and idiots, who even do bad things. Anyone who has done good in their life learns this lesson. That is love, the only love in any meaningful sense. That truth is well known, but not always widely discussed. Look at the Gospels in Christianity, and everything that says we are all sinners. Look at stories of prophets in every culture: ignored, attacked, lynched. More contemporaneously, do you think people who do great good, like Washington or Gandhi or MLK, did not realize what you did about human nature? All those people, those religions, those philosophers - they all know. When Jefferson wrote 'All men are created equal, and are endowed with inalienable rights', he knew who he was writing about. When the framers of the Constitution wrote about forming 'a more perfect union', they knew that would be done would be 'of the people, by the people, and for the people' (as Lincoln said later) - and they knew about people. And it's about you too. You're a sinner, and an asshole, and ignorant too, just like me. If that's not love, if love excludes those people, who loves you and me? Remember that ancient prayer: 'Forgive us our trespasses ...'. reply dotnet00 11 hours agorootparentI appreciate your intent, but as much as I might try, I don't have endless energy or patience. Last year I was forced to drag my belongings between 3 apartments, each time with zero forewarning, in the summer heat, to rooms with no AC (despite my initial room having been AC, and my still having to pay the higher rent for it), while I had to prepare for my first ever research conference and later was recovering from the worst flu I've ever had, they even dragged me to a roommate conduct meeting which had nothing to do with me, right in the middle of moving. The person the meeting was actually about didn't even attend. Each time, I had to go to the dorm office and talk to the head administrator in person to get any useful information on what was going on, and was only offered to be compensated after the third time when I came in to the administrator's office, looking half dead from the flu. I refuse to 'love' people who would put complete strangers through all that suffering without seeming to put in even the smallest effort to empathize and try to make things easier (eg by explaining the things in the email, which they told me in person). I'm not a prophet or saint, nor do I aspire to be one. The only people entitled to my completely unconditional love, generosity, tolerance etc are my immediate family, and friends to a slightly lesser extent. With most other people I'm happy to be polite and help them in small ways by default, but going out of my way to be helpful stops as soon as it becomes obvious that they don't even think about reciprocating in even the smallest of ways. It simply isn't worth the stress I put myself through, and besides not being fair to me, it isn't fair to everyone who does try to reciprocate. I've had many other similar experiences of my kindness being shamelessly exploited by people who haven't earned it, to the point that they became a bonding moment with my father as he too has had lots of experience with that and had come to a similar approach to treating human interaction. He often got accused of being insincere because of how much effort he put into keeping things smooth for people who reciprocated compared to those who didn't. reply wolverine876 11 hours agorootparentHey - none of us have endless energy or patience. We just do our best. I don't mean to be dismissive about your experience; we all have a hard road, and some much harder than others. Still, if we're talking about it honestly: Why should the admnistrator and other people have compassion for you if you don't have it for others? I'll bet that, not being saint and under all that stress, you weren't perfect in what you were doing. I'll bet the administrator and others were also under many different stressors like you were; who was understanding them? The only way there is compassion in the world is when it's between stressed people acting less than their best, often much less. If it's restricted to near-perfection, it wouldn't exist; the word 'compassion' wouldn't have any usage or meaning. But that doesn't mean I do it well all the time. And I'm a jerk too and I hope people have compassion for me. reply micromacrofoot 18 hours agorootparentprev> after one or two slip ups that someone else is having to clean up for them, and feel bad enough to avoid doing it in the future.

I've seen this in collectivist societies too. For example, in India, there's a pretty jarring contrast in big cities, between pristine modern buildings with immaculate interiors situated on a street literred with garbage. While Indian society loves to label littering as shameful, because no one sees the street as something they also partly own, their idea of cleaning only extends to keeping their own building immaculate. reply creato 13 hours agorootparentprev> Chronic litterbugs don't care, they're often low enough on the hierarchy of needs that this kind of morality isn't on their radar at all. I used to think trash around my neighborhood was from just a general mass of people not caring about littering. It sounds like that's what you think too. Then, one day, I saw a homeless guy dumping every single trash can on the street out completely, tearing open the bags, looking for maybe 2 seconds, and then moving on to the next trash can. Call me harsh, but that behavior should merit a serious prison sentence. I think people overestimate the damage something like this causes to the environment, but underestimate the damage it does to society and the way people think about each other. reply bombcar 11 hours agorootparentThis is the kind of societal harm that does warrant (apparently) harsh punishment, because if it gets out of control there is just no way to resolve it.

It’s hard to make progress on this because, like, the homeless person knows just as well as anyone else that they shouldn’t make a mess, and the person who can’t afford to eat knows just as well as anyone else that they shouldn’t steal toiletries from stores. And many people in those situations do actually avoid doing that, which is great.

There were many streets near me that obviously had not been swept in years, and while I did see them come up my street a few times, given the traffic volume, it has hardly frequent enough. They also didn't seem to have any kind of communication process between the police, who respond to traffic accidents, and the street sweepers, who never came by after an accident spread debris all over the road. Sometimes the police would have a stiff push broom in their trunk to do a quick sweep of the large stuff into the gutter but for the most part accident sites would remain a hazard until it had rained enough to carry the debris down to the storm drains to be clogged up by it.

We need a magnet man for all big cities! reply sandworm101 15 hours agoparent>> After research found out that if you have some mileage on your tires, you can't just change one You go played by the mechanic. Even if the tread depth thing was an issue, you could have swapped out two rather than four. Unless you are racing, your car will be fine with slightly different treads rear and front. The reality is that most cars are like that anyway. Fronts often wear more than rears these days. So unless you are rotating your tires every month, tread depths will be different no matter what you do. reply lsllc 5 hours agorootparentDefinitely got played. Unless your daily driver is a train and you only go in straight lines, it won't matter about differences in the tire circumference. Every time you turn the steering wheel (even a little, let alone make a turn) all 4 wheels are rotating at different speeds anyway -- it's why we need differentials! An AWD has an additional center diff or transfer case that allows the combined rotation of the front (trans)axle and rear axle to be different (because unless you are steering dead straight on a flat non-cambered road they will always be slightly different). A 4WD doesn't have that center diff and you have to manually engage 4WD to use it (that difference between 4WD and AWD). You will get transmission wind-up if drive in 4WD in anything other than a straight line on a normal road surface -- fine in the mud or snow because the wheels will slip easily enough to reduce the windup. In fact if you get really stuck, you want a diff-lock or limited slip diff so you can prevent the power going all to one wheel (or two in an AWD/4WD config). It's a myth used to sell more tires. reply legitster 15 hours agorootparentprevIf OP has an AWD the mechanic has to swap out all four. reply sandworm101 15 hours agorootparentThe AWD argument is one of those things that sounds logical but really isn't. Lots of AWD vehicles, I would say most AWD vehicles, are driving around with slightly different sized tired front-to-rear. Fronts just wear faster than rears. So within a few miles even a brand new car will have slightly smaller fronts than rear. The diff will be fine. Think of this scenario. What happens when someone sits in the back seat of a car? That compresses the rear tires slightly, imparting a slightly a different radius. Many cars will ask you to increase rear PSI to compensate, but nobody ever does. Are diffs failing for this? Nope. AWD cars and trucks manage carrying a random number of rear passengers just fine without any adjustment to tire radii. reply legitster 14 hours agorootparentI am not an expert on the sorts of computer chicanery that goes into AWD systems. But there is quite a big difference between the normal discrepancies that happen while driving and throwing in one or two brand new tires. Especially given that AWDs are already supposed to account for things like wheel slippage and power distribution. Besides, regardless if it's a myth - doing it will void your warranty, it's a requirement in every AWD service manual, and any tire guy caught doing it will be held liable if your diff blows up later. No mechanic or tire shop will agree to swapping out just two. reply sandworm101 14 hours agorootparentEverything voids warranties. If you are driving a new car, ie one still under warrantee, then you have to do whatever they want you to do. But there are lots of little myths about fixing cars, stuff leveraged by mechanics. Telling people that a diff will \"blow\" should the tires be 0.1% different in size is one of those myths. The entire purpose of a diff is to allow wheels to turn at different rates, hence the name differential. Only when you are getting towards differences enough to trigger anti-slip mechanisms during normal driving would it become an issue. The manual probably also says that aftermarket oil/air filters will void warrantees, or that changing your own brake pads is dangerous. Total bunk. reply legitster 13 hours agorootparentMost AWDs use a central diff for all four wheels. It's for distributing different amounts of torque front and back. It's not quite the same as a 2WD or 4WD differential(s) that only handle left/right. It's not at all the same as just a big open differential. A central diff compensating for front/back distribution while also handling a constant mismatched load on one side is definitely going to mess it up. If it's your car feel free to try it and tell me if you get a bunch of dash lights from your AWD computer. > The manual probably also says that aftermarket oil/air filters will void warrantees, or that changing your own brake pads is dangerous.

That compresses the rear tires slightly, imparting a slightly a different radius. The tire radius changes, but that doesn't matter. What matters is the rate at which the axle turns relative to distance covered, and I doubt that changes significantly with loading. reply KennyBlanken 14 hours agorootparentprevIf you have a true full-time AWD vehicle such as a Subaru or Audi with longitudinal engine, then mismatched tire wear will cause increased wear and tear on the center differential, which is expensive and difficult to get to. This is especially true if the differential is limited-slip. If you have a torsen or similar FWD car that only engages the rear wheels when slip is detected (most Audis with transverse mounted engines, VWs, etc), then you're fine. Tire diameter in passenger cars does not change with loading. reply kurthr 16 hours agoparentprevUnless you have a lot of wear on your tires, or you're driving an AWD, it's unusual to need to replace more than 2 tires. The argument on AWD is that it might cause more expensive increased wear on the AWD system in off-road conditions. If you're only driving on roads this probably isn't such a big deal, and some sports cars don't even have the same size tires front/back. Most nails and screws (1/8\" or 3mm) in the middle of the tire can be patched (if you're not driving >100mph), but that was one BIG nail! Side walls really can't be safely patched, and most places won't patch anything even close. reply HeyLaughingBoy 15 hours agorootparentI heard a loud clicking noise while driving to work one day and pulled over to check.

I understand the reasoning, I just don't agree with it because tires simply don't wear at the same rate. reply whaleofatw2022 15 hours agorootparentprevAbove is semi dependent on the AWD system. If it is one of the 'typical' ones you see on something like a Ford Escape or Chevy Blazer where it activates on slippage, you are probably OK on normal roads as long as the wear isn't extreme.

This is only inside the city though. I live outside the city (25 to 90 minutes depending on traffic) and we don't get any sweeping. The intersection outside our neighborhood gets about an accident a week and it's just constantly filled with glass and, occasionally, bumpers. The tow truck drivers are normally kind enough to sweep it to the side but that isn't great for cyclists. Everyone drives SUVs here and their tires are big enough that glass doesn't matter so no one is going to agree to pay for sweepers. reply Cthulhu_ 18 hours agorootparentAnd that's just off to the side, it'll accumulate and / or spread from there.

So he has collected about $150 worth of scrap so far. Not a bad pay off for getting your daily exercise. Too bad magnets cannot collect aluminum or copper - both are more valuable.

The greater value is all the time in people's lives that would have been wasted from damaged tires: fixing or replacing the tire, time spent to earn money to fix or replace the tire, the time people would have spent in traffic trying to get around the disabled vehicles, etc. reply no_wizard 19 hours agoparentprevThe value is helping the community, first and foremost, isn't it? The computed dollar value is pale by comparison. We should talk more about this community value IMO reply bluGill 16 hours agorootparentThere is more than one value. I talked about two of them, but that doesn't mean those are the only two. That just means that are the only two that I feel like I can contribute anything to the discussion of in one topic.

Most residential roads in the borough receive a litter- picking service every other day and are manually swept once every 5 weeks.

Atlanta, like most US cities, is sprawling. I would think this would make street cleaning less economical (although not to the degree of quarterly sweepings).

For instance, bike paths. If a city is not doing enough maintenance on the paths, then it proves that bike transportation is unsustainable. Or does it mean that the city should spend more money on bike paths and roads? reply xyst 18 hours agorootparentNo … as mentioned it shows how car centric transportation is unsustainable. City should reinvest into downtown core. Build up, redesign city with bike lanes while reducing car lanes. Remove parking lots, parking garages. Slowly get rid of highways running straight through downtown cores. Cities need to stop subsidizing suburban living. Recapture more funds that was previously invested in “road/street” maintenance into more sustainable and environmentally friendly infrastructure (bikes, walking, improving bus services/lanes, rail). reply duxup 18 hours agoparentprevI'm not sure I understand the \"car centric transportation is unsustainable\" in this case.

We should be encouraging it, while finding a solution that is sustainable. Imagine if the city identified this as an issue today. It would take minimum of months to potentially years to start implement a solution. We had an issue of too much rapid development in our town and dump trucks were littering the streets with gravel debris, making the roads unsafe (it's difficult to stop on a dime if you slide on gravel, as I unfortunately found out recently). We had a local Lions den club decide to take action and start sweeping up the gravel. reply xyst 18 hours agorootparent [–] So not only do people pay taxes for city services but now we rely on free labor to pick up the slack when those paid services can’t cover every area? I encourage people to do what they feel is right to clean up the environment around them. But to EXPECT people to go out of their way to cleanup the streets and make them “safe” is not sustainable. Probably poses a significant road hazard as well. I wouldn’t trust 3/4 drivers on these streets to obey posted signs/yield at crosswalks , let alone react appropriately to objects or people in street. A solution that is sustainable is not relying on cars as a primary mode of transportation. Heavy vehicles (almost everyone has a SUV or truck) cause significant road wear and contribute a significant amount to local environment pollution via tire wear particles and brake dust. Cities need to be redesigned to support multiple modes of transportation. Get rid of the parking lots. Get rid of the massive highways running straight through cores of cities. Get rid of mandatory parking requirements. Stop subsidizing suburban living where few people live. This benefits a very small amount of people while straining the local resources (expansion of fire, police, EMS, water, electrical services at heavy expense and decrease in quality of service) reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade. Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth's geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial \"global thermostat\" to keep Earth habitable — but it normally takes millenia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales. On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We're looking for founding full-stack engineers and data scientists to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the \"operating system\" for enhanced weathering at scale. There's a diverse set of challenges spanning interactive geospatial tooling, map and document digitization, laboratory sample management, logistical routing and optimization, and scientific modeling.

I work with a small group of developers doing custom software development and consulting for small/medium businesses. We have enough work where it would be nice to have someone else in our team so we can maybe think about more clients. This is a great opportunity for SAHMs, new parents, etc. who want to get back into the workforce in a very flexible way and don't _need_ a full time job, or people who are looking for some supplemental nights and weekend work or maybe transitioning into software development from a different career.

    "title": "Old vs. New Growth Wood: Quality and Longevity Compared",
    "originLink": "https://hullworks.com/wood/",
    "originBody": "WOOD Old vs. New Growth Trees and the Wood Products they Make It’s true what they say, “they don’t make ‘em like they used to.” We know, because our company restores historic windows. Many of these windows are still working well after 100 years. Most brand-new windows will not be in service 100 years from now. Why? Because wood windows made with “new wood” aren’t made like they used to be. Historic windows made with “old growth” wood, from trees 100 years ago, are the most durable windows there are. The difference between old growth wood and new growth wood The difference between old growth wood and new growth wood is like the difference between granite and paper. Old growth wood has better stability, durability and longevity. New growth wood and the windows they’re made of, begin to rot and warp after only twenty years. “Virgin Wood” refers to first -cut wood, or wood harvested for the first time. As early America grew and expanded, we harvested wood from virgin forests as we moved west. Wood harvesting started in New York, then Pennsylvania and into Ohio, then on to the Great Lakes region of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Tree harvesting then turned to the south and finally, after the early 1900’s out west. The virgin wood forest harvesting era lasts from the 1870’s into the 1940’s. The value of virgin growth wood is that it has grown very slowly over a long period of time. Because of this slow growth, the growth rings are very tight. Tight growth means more stability. In this photo there are 2 pieces of wood 100 years apart. The wood from 1918 has 20-25 growth rings per inch. The wood from 2018 has only 7. Stability isn’t the only advantage. This slow growth also yields more heartwood. Heart wood is the longest lasting part of the tree, whereas sap wood which will rot very quickly. Note too in the picture above, the wood from 1918 is all heart wood, the wood from 2018 is all sap wood. This sketch highlights the key differences between old vs new wood. Most wood used today, by contrast, is grown very fast. The wood for a great deal of new millwork today is grown on plantations. Sixty- years ago, timber companies began to grow Radiata Pine in countries like New Zealand and Chile. Grown for quick production, these trees produce very little heartwood and these trees have fewer growth rings per inch. The effects of new vs. old wood If you have used finger jointed wood, you see the effects of new vs. old wood. Starting in the 1970’s lumber manufacturers began using finger-jointed wood to compensate for poor wood quality; the warping, twisting, and knots in their new growth wood. They took a board of wood, cut out the defects and then rejoined the pieces with finger joints. Finger joining wood in doors windows, moldings, and framing lumber is necessary because the new growth wood quality isn’t as good. Old growth timber is generally free of knots while plantation grown wood is riddled with them. The value of old growth lumber is the reason we should NOT throw out old windows. These old windows are structurally superior and can be restored instead of replaced. An old window will last another 100 years if properly cared for. It’s true, “they don’t make ‘em like they used to.”",

Old growth timber is generally free of knots while plantation grown wood is riddled with them. For normal construction tasks, I don't care one bit about this one bit. And you shouldn't either. We've found more sustainable ways to quickly grow trees and use machines to turn them into usable construction lumber. This is amazing! Basic construction doesn't need to have the finest, densest, knot-free lumber. It just needs to work and hold up for a useful lifetime. We don't use this lumber for windows or weather-exposed areas. It's placed neatly inside of your dry home and protected from the elements. Combining multiple boards into a single, more stable board isn't unique to cheap new growth lumber. It's a technique that is even used with more expensive woods to produce a hybrid board that has better properties than could be easily achieved with a single board. Modern adhesives can be stronger than the wood itself, so the existence of a joint shouldn't scare people. If you're doing a high end woodworking project, you're generally not using this type of wood anyway. You're picking a hardwood or one of the fancier softwoods. I love old growth lumber and its properties, but modern construction lumber and the processes that produce it are a great accomplishment. Regardless, it doesn't matter because old growth lumber is a very finite resource and it's not repeatable to reproduce forever anyway. reply Arrath 13 hours agoparent> For normal construction tasks, I don't care one bit about this one bit. The only thing about it that I care about is the sheer amount of time wasted as a kid standing around the lumber yard as my dad rummaged through the entire bin grumbling about how shit wood was these days, full of knots, not a straight board in sight, etc. Well, yeah, dad, you (literally, he was a logger) cut down all the good shit! reply ChoGGi 9 hours agorootparentThe wood is shipped wet, you have to let it dry out while strapped, or it'll be hockey sticks.

With what some might say is proper respect for the forests. You will get wildlife, and recreation, and cultural values, and food gathering, and hunting, and strategic timber harvest that provide physical/monetary value.

I guess the lighter wood would need to be pressed more, to match the same resistance, but I suspect the costs are cheaper with wood grown faster. reply JAlexoid 11 hours agorootparentAs a European in US owning homes on both sides of the Atlantic - we are too fast to judge wood frame construction. After all the wood frame construction techniques came to the US from Europe. I can safely say that there's little difference between a good wood frame and masonry house, today. Modern concrete isn't as long lasting as Roman concrete from 2000 years ago. Modern concrete doesn't play well with water. reply hx8 15 minutes agorootparent> there's little difference between a good wood frame and masonry house, today The wood frame will do better in an earthquake. The masonry will do better in a flood or high winds. Consider the natural disaster risks of your local area when picking a home. reply coryrc 8 hours agorootparentprevSteel-reinforced concrete does not perform well in salt water. You can use modern concrete without steel and build things about as good as Roman concrete. You'll pay a whole lot more than reinforced because you'll use at least 3x more concrete and limit the shape -- only arches. Compare Prague's Charles bridge[0] to Seattle's West Seattle bridge. Or compare the windows of the Roman Pantheon (uh, none) to those in any skyscraper. You won't have as much self-healing in salt water as some Roman concretes. But modern concretes also have far more compressive strength. You can still buy lime mortars and build brick masonry houses, if you want to pay for the labor; the materials themselves have never been cheaper. [0] Yes I know it isn't Roman nor especially made of concrete but there's a lot of good information on its construction and it's basically the perfection of Roman-style bridge building, and without reinforcement you need to build just like that. reply pfannkuchen 3 hours agorootparentprev> After all the wood frame construction techniques came to the US from Europe. As did the musket. reply sfn42 10 hours agorootparentprevModern concrete is what you need it to be. We know much more about concrete production today than the Romans did. We make compromises, it's not all about quality. If you're building a garage you're fine with it lasting 100+ years, you don't give a shit about 1000+ years. So you don't pay for the stuff that will last for ever. If you're a civil engineer designing a huge dam you go for the good concrete. You also test the concrete before pouring to make sure it's up to spec. Because your budget and priorities make that make sense. reply mannyv 9 hours agorootparentAnd yet, Frank Lloyd Wright made the wrong concrete choices at Falling Water.

But to be honest the rot resistance is more important. Most wood buildings fail because of rot issues, not because the wood wasn't strong enough. reply turtlebits 11 hours agorootparentWater management is more important than rot resistance. Wood will easily last for 100 years if let it dry. (you'll never be able to keep any part of your house 100% dry). reply ok_dad 10 hours agorootparentI hope longer because my house is 70 years old and all wood. It’s single wall construction, also. I’m really enjoying not having to worry about plaster wallboard or anything since the wall boards are all actually wood, too. I do see boards that need to be replaced soon in the eaves but I live where it rains a lot so that’s expected. reply MarkMarine 10 hours agorootparentprevThere are some old ideas about water management that are A LOT different than the modern techniques. I live in a 120 year old house framed with old growth redwood. As wood goes, it's rock solid, but also everything in it breathes. It's painted with linseed oil paints, the lathe and plaster walls breathe moisture, and frankly it's not sealed well anywhere, including my original double hung windows. If this was a modern house, it would be covered in 5 different layers of plastic with the intent on keeping any moisture out, then sheathed in OSB that basically sees water and just melts away. Like you said, there is no way to keep it all the way dry, but energy efficiency (and cheap materials and quick building techniques) have also driven a housing design that is so tight that if there is moisture intrusion, it's got no good way to vent out. reply hattmall 8 hours agorootparentWell the fundamental difference is that homes today are expected to be climate controlled year round. That negates pretty much any issues with normal moisture control. That being the case efficiency is a much larger concern. reply turtlebits 9 hours agorootparentprevModern techniques include rainscreens behind cladding, so air can flow behind siding and/or roofing as well as dimple mats to allow drainage for your foundation. reply MarkMarine 9 hours agorootparentYeah, and those rain screens have a million staple holes in them right? Unless you seal every fastener hole with some sealant that will last 100 years, which I'm pretty sure would be a magical product, I sincerely doubt a modern house will be standing as long as mine is. Modern plastic paint, modern plastic building wrap, all these ideas of basically living inside a plastic hamster cage, they suffocate the living material (wood) that needs to breathe, and that allows rot and mold. The water eventually finds its way in because rain screen tape can't hold up for 50 years, the water gets in and has no good way to get out. reply coryrc 8 hours agorootparentLots of houses were built using poor techniques you reference. Nowadays, we're back to emphasizing breathable homes. Vapor barriers are out, vapor retarders are in. You use an air barrier because air movement is far more effective at moving moisture into a wall than vapor drive. We actually engineer the amount of drying to be optimal in your climate and reduce the amount of energy the home uses. reply sarchertech 8 hours agorootparentprevYou know there are buildings built with OSB and wrapped in Tyvek that are older than 50 years and are still standing right? reply ok_dad 10 hours agorootparentprevDo you have any good sources of info for your any my type of home; old and wood? I’m worried that some of the upgrades and paint done to this house is preventing as much “breathing” as it was designed for, and I don’t want my house to rot away. It’s really wet here! reply MarkMarine 9 hours agorootparenthttps://linseedpaint.com - This is where I get my paint, lots of information about why latex paint (and generally wrapping in plastic) ruins the wood of a house. Past there, I really like a timber framer who does YouTube called Mr. Chickadee, guy was a Marine who decided to live a simple life. He hand makes everything, but don't let the old timey hat and pants fool you, he's spent a ton of time thinking about how the old methods work and why, and picking through multiple cultures that have had old wooden structures that last hundreds or even thousands of years for the techniques he's using. reply ok_dad 7 hours agorootparentI love watching Mr chickadee. Thanks for the paint link! reply turtlebits 6 hours agorootparentprevMisconception - you don't want your house to breath (ie outdoorindoor air mixing). You want it to be as airtight as possible, while allowing the exterior surfaces to dry if they get wet. However, leaky houses probably contribute to their longevity as those areas are able to dry from the outdoor air flowing indoors instead of rotting. reply ok_dad 4 hours agorootparentThere ain’t no way my house is getting airtight, I open the windows every day, and in the summer most of the night. I am very careful about leaks and such so the wet tends to stay outside except for some condensation occasionally which I can’t avoid. reply VHRanger 9 hours agorootparentprevCheck out stuff by Joe Lstiburek (build science expert) and Brent Hull (linked in OP, historic restoration expert, has YouTube channel) reply bertil 16 hours agorootparentprevWould treating the wood (presumably with chemicals you might not want inside your house) be enough to avoid the rot? Traditional wood houses in Scandinavia have tar and seem well preserved: is that usually enough, or did they survive because it’s so cold to six months a year that bugs don’t even try? reply jnellis 14 hours agorootparentSure temperature is big factor but water is always the enemy of wood, regardless of the treatment. You can slow it down with chemicals but bugs and microorganisms find a way if water is present. Humidity is water. Primers and paint do wonders against it. But the wood has to be dry first. Tar is pretty darn good at keeping out water but also good at trapping it in. Old growth and just 'old' wood is naturally termite resistant because wood gets harder as it ages and the bugs just don't like to chew on it, they will look elsewhere. You don't see many 60+ year old houses getting new termite infestations unless it was in areas of recent repair (fascia boards, brick moldings). But if it's wet, it's softer to chew. It's always comes down to water. reply VHRanger 15 hours agorootparentprevYes, treating wood does work, but what use to treat depends on the application. For instance railroad ties were treated with creosote or tar. Similar for the underground part of telephone poles. There was a Copper-Chromium-Arsenic mix also that would kill bugs and mold but is extremely toxic, so isn't EPA approved anymore. I would not want creosote or tar-treated wood in a house I live in, though. It's all toxic. In the exterior-treated SPF (think what we use in America for a deck or exterior staircase) there's a durability limit to the rot resistance. And the wood is tough to restore. Better woods (not necessarily old growth, just white pine or high quality cedar) are easier to restore. They also look nice, so people are more inclined to take care of them. In the end, nothing lasts forever without maintenance. reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentprevHouses survive because they tend to be dry enough that the wood doesn't rot. Let the roof fail and soon the rest of the house will rot away. Similar for let the siding on the outside fail and the house will soon rot away (not as fast as when the roof fails). Keep those in good shape though and the inside is dry enough that wood won't rot. reply hattmall 8 hours agorootparentprevUnless you have major water issues, like roof leaks or something where water is accumulating consistently up against wood. For example a deck that slopes toward the house or something, rot isn't really an issue. Termites can be an issue, but it's not super common. reply nf3 14 hours agorootparentprevSome species of wood are naturally resistant to rot: black locust, chestnut, cedar, cypres, Douglas fir. Other methods of preventing rot exist such as charring the end of a post before sticking it in the ground, protecting end grain from contact with water, etc. reply JCM9 9 hours agorootparentprevProvided it’s kept free of moisture wood is an amazing construction material and super strong relative to weight.

Nonetheless, the general progress in wood processing technologies does feel remarkable. I remember discussions on somehow pre-processing softer wood like alder or aspen (or maybe it was still birch) to make it stronger, and then and then using it for building structures.

I suppose that a denser MDF will last longer, it certainly is heavier and stronger. reply coldbrewed 17 hours agoparentprevModern building construction is cheaper and doesn't demand old growth timber, but it's also much less resilient during a house fire. We use smaller dimensional lumber, it has less densely packed tree rings causing it to burn faster, and we use I beams made out of 2x3s and OSB instead of solid lumber. A house made in the 30s could survive a long time before collapse in a fire; what we have now collapses much faster. There are definite benefits to modern techniques that are less resource intensive and protecting our remaining old growth forests is important, but we're sacrificing a lot of valuable properties as well. reply RyanCavanaugh 17 hours agorootparentWe've more than compensated for this in other building materials, processes, and codes. Your odds of dying in a house fire are far lower than they were even in the 1970's, let alone the 50's or 20's. reply tlavoie 3 hours agorootparentThat's probably more because of smoke detectors (and perhaps fewer smokers) than anything else. I'd love to get a sprinkler system retro-fit though, as that would make an impressive difference. All the lighter-weight joists made with OSB burn far faster than the 2x8s or whatever they replaced, and home furnishings are made with large amounts of flammable synthetics. At a live-fire course I was on, the scenarios we worked on were fueled by stacks of wooden pallents, lit by an instructor's tiger torch. One of the instructors asked us if we knew the fuel equivalent of a typical love seat with synthetic foam, in pallets. We all figured it was lots, but not the real answer: NINETY. reply RyanCavanaugh 3 hours agorootparentThey've done the research and, well, the newer houses really are just better at having fewer fire deaths.

This implies that, in counties with newer housing stock, all else equal, the fire death rate is lower. Interestingly, when identical regressions to model 1 were run using different cutoff points for new stock, such as the percentage of houses built after 1979 or 1969 or 1959, the coefficients were of roughly similar size, were always negative, and the associated t-statistics were at least as significant. reply tlavoie 2 hours agorootparentInteresting paper, thanks. It does make some of the same distinctions I did, around smokers and smoke alarms. Another thing mentioned about newer construction is the improved blocking and stopping. For example, one old style of framing was \"balloon frame\" construction, where you would have gaps that might run vertically from basement to attic. That gave fire a channel to rip vertically through a structure, and is clearly a terrifying idea once it catches. [Edit] Oh, I forgot to mention, it also discusses what conclusions can't be inferred. \"Regrettably, much of the available data is not helpful. For example, no data are collected on the age of the structure where a house fire death occurs, despite the obvious link between the two.\" The starting point of this though, was the idea that the materials in the house are actually better than in the past. To the extent that they'll tolerate fire longer before collapsing, they aren't, and the gases from the foam cushions, carpets and drapes are more toxic than ever. The reason this was drilled into our heads is that it means less time to get into a fire, and someone out, before we all have to leave for our own safety. reply nordsieck 8 hours agorootparentprev> Your odds of dying in a house fire are far lower than they were even in the 1970's, let alone the 50's or 20's. I am very surprised by this. I'm sure that building codes ensure that the actual houses are more fire resistant. And fire fighting has probably come a long way.

The reasoning is that old growth lumber handles repeated compression better as they are denser, harder, and firmer. New growth timber is squishier due to it being softer with less tightly grouped growth rings. At first I thought that made no sense, then I realized building a house out of sponges is not ideal. Fighting collapse is sometimes more about rigidity in the correct place rather than absorbing all shakiness everywhere. reply xnx 17 hours agorootparentprevDo new building codes account for this? Even given the worse materials, I would expect a house built today to be much safer (from fire, hurricane, tornado, etc.) than one built 100 years ago. reply bluGill 16 hours agorootparentYes. We now use engineering standards to design houses. Looking at 100 year old houses as an engineering is enlightening (you don't even have to be a good engineer, just look and think). Old houses are often way over built in places where there is no stress and so paper would work - but those places are visible. Meanwhile places that do matter are often under built and it is amazing they are still standing at all - but those places tend to be not easily seen. Which is while people say modern houses are built from cardboard - in many ways they are - but those are all places where strength isn't needed so why waste money. What you won't see in the above is things that are hidden. Modern code requires you to have a firestop in all walls every 10 feet - old houses were often balloon framed which means the inside of the walls becomes a chimney in a fire and will help feed the fire. New houses the inside of walls do not become a chimney because of that fire stop. Modern houses also are insulated to much better standards. Something else that often isn't seen but makes a big difference. Even when it is seen nobody thinks about it - those old windows the article is singing the praises of are universally single pane windows that should have been scrapped 40 years ago. Sure there frame is still like new, but the standards for new back then are not acceptable. The bigger lesson to take from the above: don't build to last too long. What people want out of a house changes over time, and you never correctly anticipate what people will want in the next decade. Eventually that old house will have enough things \"wrong\" that cannot be retrofitted and the best thing to do is tear down and rebuild from scratch to modern standards. reply VHRanger 13 hours agorootparent> The bigger lesson to take from the above: don't build to last too long. Disagree. Build to last long, but accomodate modification. Old houses are built to last a very long time, because they weren't commodities being bought and sold on a 10 year timeframe. But old houses are also very difficult to modify. As you noted, no structural engineering, also lathe & plaster walls are a nightmare to take down, etc. etc. reply JAlexoid 13 hours agorootparentI don't know which houses you're referring to... or maybe you're conflating survivorship bias with quality... but old houses most definitely weren't built for \"a very long time\". Even fancy mansions from 100-200 years are all but falling apart in most countries across the world. I live in a house built before structural codes were made mandatory(1964) - and just yesterday we had to replace a third of the true 2x4s because they were rotten and a corner of the house was liable to just come crumbling down. If you want more proof - look at the remains of civilizations that built primarily from wood... but there isn't much to look at at all! reply oooyay 7 hours agorootparentYou commented further down mentioning \"siding\", but if I'm following this conversation correctly many of y'all are talking about different periods of construction as if they're all the same, or even linear in quality over time. For instance, timber framing is a very old practice and the beams used are so thick they do indeed last hundreds of years. However, timber framing refers to the structural beams themselves, not fascia like siding. You could still use OSB and new growth finger boards to do the non-structural framing, and many modern houses do. Then there's houses like mine from the 1950s. They use solid maple beams, but oak and elm are also common to that time period. They're structurally more load bearing that way. Unlike timber framing they take advantage of both proper joints and things like hangers. More modern construction doesn't really do much jointing from what I've seen, but I may be wrong or have a limitation of exposure here. They rely mainly on structural forms like hangers. I'm not sure that any one is better than the other. They do have different considerations though. A timber frame is going to be tough to modify once it's stood up. A house like mine will probably also be tough to modify, but they could by introducing forms. The newer homes are probably the easiest to modify, but probably are somewhat weaker than the frames of my house. Strength like that doesn't really matter until it does, though, imo. reply turtlebits 11 hours agorootparentprevWater intrusion is a maintenance problem, not a quality problem. The old growth framing in my 1950's house feels like it will last forever. reply JAlexoid 11 hours agorootparentIf you have to replace your siding wholesale every 20 years to prevent water intrusion - you're not building for \"a very long time\". reply bjt 12 hours agorootparentprevSelection effect here.

It is best to think of software as under continuous remodels. Very few houses survive for 40 years without a major remodel - adding rooms, moving walls. (much less \"minor remodels\" like replacing the kitchen cupboards - and the paint will not last for 40 years no matter how hard you try). If you continuously remodel your house like software is, then by the time it is 50 years old there should be zero original walls left. But software is a lot cheaper to make changes to. reply turtlebits 11 hours agorootparentprev> What people want out of a house changes over time. Hard disagree. At it's essence, a house is a shelter from the environment. The need for walls and a roof doesn't change.

Thermal insulation is mainly about creating a continuous skin and filling the void with something as close to a vacuum as you can get. reply xyzzyz 11 hours agorootparentHome insulation doesn’t work by making walls close to vacuum. You insulate walls by stuffing more (but not too much) of stuff into them, not by pumping out air or anything silly like that. Vacuum is a great insulator, because it blocks two fastest ways of heat transfer, conduction and convection, leaving only radiation. House insulation tries to do the same thing: filling up the wall with fluff blocks air from moving around, which impedes convection. Fluff itself is made from materials of low thermal conductivity, like cotton or mineral wool. At the end of the day, though, filling walls with fluff makes them less like vacuum, not more. reply BizarroLand 14 hours agorootparentprevEven something as simple as granite countertops are a good example of that. A stone countertop is hundred of thousands or millions of years old. They would likely last until the planet itself was swallowed up by the sun as it swells with age. But, granite countertops installed in the 90's and 2000's are considered \"old\" and \"dated\" and are being torn out for a different stone often at great expense. It was a waste that they were ever installed to begin with.

It is, but there are nuances. For example, modern houses have additional requirements on energy efficiency, which mean thermal insulation.

While cost cutting has continued, engineering is more involved in standards and so the cost cutting is not possible unless engineering determines that the cost cutting doesn't effect something important. Note that what you think is important to lay people and what engineering thinks is important are very different things. Engineering cares about fire safety, insulation, and your house standing up to wind. Engineering doesn't care if you kick a hole in your walls - that is your own stupid fault (engineering cares that you cannot get pushed through the walls cartoon style, but a small hole is not a problem). Laypeople often reject great engineering because the marketing on bad engineering is better - old houses is one of those cases. reply RoyalHenOil 12 hours agorootparentIn some places, the problem is that scammy builders are not building homes to spec. I'm talking about very serious flaws: not like drywall being thin, but more like joists that are thinner than the engineer specified or incomplete flashing that lets water leak into the insulation whenever it rains. A few years ago, I worked in a brand new building, and we had issues like windows being installed inside out, pipes not being connected together, and rainwater trickling down walls under the paint.

They were immediately disenfranchised a few years into their careers when they saw the corruption of the “construction cartels” in my city.

I agree, and I'd go as far as to say that the author is a bit confused and showing some confirmation bias. Let me explain. Engineered wood indeed creates elements from imperfect timber that are free from defects and exhibit the same engineering properties, if not better. This has absolutely zero to do with old vs new growth trees. It is exclusively due to the need to maximize the amount of wood you can take out of a tree. Old growth trees might have more wood to pick and choose from, but nothing stops anyone from using the exact same techniques with timber from old growth trees. The only reason why you don't see as much old growth trees in this process is the fact that there aren't that many anymore. Another reason why you see new growth trees being used extensively in engineered wood products is that you can put together massive structural elements from smaller lumber elements, and they are far cheaper and plentiful. There's a story on how the renovation of Oxford's dining halls required massive oak trees which were hard to come by, but it turned out those who built Oxford's dining halls had the foresight of planting oak trees when they built the structure. They did so because they knew the beams would eventually have to be renovated. https://longnow.org/ideas/humans-and-trees-in-long-term-part...

Let me explain. The author mostly cares about rot resistance in a window, though? New engineered wood products rarely help with this. We have treated wood, but if someone is making an exterior window they'll generally resort to using a rot resistant species (white oak, sapeeli, cedar in budget applications) that isn't the SPF we use in engineered lumber. I see this with my wooden windows from the 1990's - they're rotting and will have to be replaced wholesale. My wooden windows from pre-1960 on the other hand are restorable. reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentAnd in both your 1990s windows and your pre 1960s windows modern windows are so much better that you should replace those windows just for the better insulation value. reply VHRanger 15 hours agorootparentYou replace the glass for the insulation value. You don't need to (and shouldn't!!) replace a wooden frame. Replacing good wooden windows with vynil/aluminium windows is basically signing up to a subscription to the window company. You can't really restore that vynil crap, and the lifespan has a hard limit at 15 years when the double seal breaks. I'm just replacing the panes and restoring the wood. On the parts where the wood rotted out, I'm replacing the crappy cheap wood with rot resistant hardwoods. Modern windows aren't that much better. Window companies have good marketing. A 200 year old single pane window is R-1. Double pane is R-2, and with argon maybe R-3 or R-4.5 Triple pane is R-3 to R-6 depending, and vacuum sealed glass is R-4 to R-14(!!! But no one buys that). Changing an old window to a new one is often a stark difference because the old window leaked air. Not because the R-value is much lower. You can fix that with reglazing. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentI consider leaked air part of the r-value, but you are correct that is the real problem. It isn't just the windows, it is the seal between the window and frame, and the frame itself that are also problems. If you can fix old windows to be good - then good. I fully agree modern windows are not great, but R-2 is still better than 1. reply rootusrootus 13 hours agorootparentprev> the double seal breaks That's the seal between the panes of glass that make up the cartridge, has nothing to do with what the frame is made of.

I live in Ontario, I also have proper winters. It's not so much the plastic windows I bought than the ones previous owners did. The argon seal eventually fails with enough cold/hot cycles, or wear on the silicon seal, etc. If you're a diligent homeowner, you probably minimize the temperature cycles and take care of the seals, they might last 25-30 years (especially if it's good quality units). If I'm buying a new window I want something that I can repair and maintain for a long time.

Because it had 15years of lack of maintenance I can see which are repairable, which aren't, and how fast each degraded. The really old windows aren't much of an issue (as OP said). Reglaze, reseal, performance is decent. Cheap wooden windows are more of a problem, but repairable and upgradeable. Cheap plastic windows have not fared well all. The plastic frame isn't in place due to heat/cold/UV exposure and they're a full replacement. They leak tremendous air and let bugs in. The aluminium windows have fared a lot better. reply madaxe_again 7 hours agoparentprevEventually, you do find yourself caring, when you can’t find a single decent bit of construction lumber in the country. Wood in Portugal is laughably bad - they cut down all of their domestic stock of commercially viable construction lumber decades ago, and the domestic lumber industry feeds pulp and pellets exclusively, as there’s not much other use for eucalyptus and soft, twisted white pine. Where this then leaves one is with imports - and it appears lumber producing companies sell their waste to Portugal to be sold as the only product available - honestly, everything has huge bark inclusions, pith, rotted out chunks, knots that bisect the entire piece, you name it. Can’t dry it either - leave it loose and it twists through 180 degrees. Strap it and it splits into splinters. Do it slow and it grows mushrooms. I ended up importing everything from Estonia, where they know how to manage slow-growing forestry reserves.

Modern 'new growth' forestry is very sustainable, but old growth poaching still happens quite often in the US. I have friends on the regulatory side of logging and I've see illegal activity first hand. I know that this article is not advocating for the logging of old growth trees, but focusing on the idea that 'old growth is better' can cause customers to value it enough that the extra profit incentivizes illegal harvesting. Personally, I would like to see densified wood become a viable option.

It reminds me of the struggle with the ivory trade. If you want to stop ivory poaching, the logical step is to ban the sale of ivory. Unfortunately, if the demand is still there, this new scarcity will drive up the price and incentivize more aggressive poaching. The solution is to also target the demand. When billiards had a boom in popularity during the 1860's, a firm put out a $10,000 reward for anyone that could make a better alternative to ivory billiard balls. This led to the invention of the first synthetic polymer. The firm was able to corner the growing billiards ball market while undercutting the demand for ivory. The invention, for better or worse, also created the synthetic/polymer/plastic industry. The problem is that old growth wood is better. This is why I would like to large scale densified wood product production take off. In theory, you can take a cheap sustainable product and turn it into a superior, stronger, longer lasting alternative. reply VHRanger 15 hours agorootparentGlulam is rocketing in popularity, though.

Demolition crews do recover the most valuable wood (large beams, planks and panels of rarer wood species that are no longer available). Safety and speed also matter. Meanwhile the market for the recovered wood is limited. I've never seen someone use second hand wood for framing commercially (and I would suspect trying to do so would cause code or inspection issues). People building for themselves might - but they also often recover the wood themselves too. Just my observations from watching many houses get demolished (still happening over a decade after earthquake here in Christchurch). Recovered wood of nice old wood (particularly Rimu) does get used in furniture. reply ortusdux 10 hours agorootparentI caught up with an old friend a few weeks ago that just started a new career as a reclaimed wood salesman. Thanks to Pinterest, home improvement shows, etc, demand is at an all time high. According to my friend, the largest seller of reclaimed wood in the US is a subsidiary of a fencing company that happens to have a significant number of government contracts to fence in federal grazing land. They replace their fencing every ~5 years and then sell the wood as reclaimed at a significant markup. It is technically reclaimed, but he said that they have to spend a lot of time removing those stapled on lumber yard price tags. Less reputable operations force age lumber in the sun or use hydrogen peroxide, and then just lie about it being reclaimed. His company mostly sources their wood from the demolition of old barns and warehouses. The senior sales people that trained him said that their job use to be much easier as they could just offer demo companies free removal. Now the DIY crowd is going around offering to buy boards off structures, and owners are starting to view that old eyesore of a barn as a cash cow. They had to bring on more sales people just to do the leg work and negotiate with owners.

Trees growing in full sunlight grow quickly and have more widely spaced rings. Balsa wood for example, which is very light and soft, comes from balsa trees that have evolved to grow very quickly in sunny gaps caused by fallen trees in tropical forests. reply njarboe 16 hours agoparentThe main reason old growth trees have tight rings is not that the tree is growing slowly (in mass) but that the diameter and height of the trunk is so large that the rings are very narrow. A 200ft tall tree with a 8ft diameter trunk with a 50 foot sunny top will put on a lot of mass but it is spread out over the surface of the truck. The added ring each year will be thin. Old growth forests are rare and I think people don't have a good idea of how big old growth trees can be. The old growth redwoods are admired for their size but other trees also get very large. At a small museum in the northern Sierra foothills I saw a photo of a 16ft diameter Douglas fir. It's too bad none of these trees survived (that I have found). Many pictures of logging trucks with just one log on them. You do definitely get thin rings when the trees are shaded but the monster old growth trees, the thin rings are usually due to the size of the trunk. reply RoyalHenOil 12 hours agorootparentLarger trees grow more slowly due to increasing competition (especially for canopy space) with their neighbors. If trees are planted with sufficient spacing, an old tree's outer growth rings will be the same density as the inner growth rings. Trees grow to the water, sunlight, and nutrients that are available to them -- up until they become diseased or they grow so large that they struggle to support their own weight (at which point they start losing branches, which means they no longer get enough sunlight). To counteract the pull of gravity, older trees stop gaining height and instead focus on adding girth (i.e., thicker growth rings). Tree plantations achieve a higher wood output by progressively thinning the plantings as the trees mature. This allows the remaining trees to keep growing at a fast clip and results in more even grain in the lumber. reply mlsu 14 hours agorootparentprevI know nothing about wood but does this mean that the heartwood has relatively wide ring spacing (since it grew when the tree was low and small? reply RoyalHenOil 11 hours agorootparentYou see this in trees that have grown up in forest conditions. They sprout in a patch of sunlight, but then they eventually fill the space and can't grow as quickly anymore. In trees that are grown in more open conditions with plentiful sunlight, water, and nutrients, the growth rings are more even because there is nothing holding back their growth and forcing them to slow down. reply nemo44x 14 hours agorootparentprev> The main reason old growth trees have tight rings is not that the tree is growing slowly No, it really is. Old pine from and some hardwoods grew in densely populated forests and there was a fight for sunlight. This severely limited how quickly the trees could grow per year resulting in tighter rings and far superior lumber. Tree plantations are specced out to plant trees the perfect distance from each other so they can grow super fast. Spiked with fertilizers a pine can be harvested in year 15 for modern lumber. It's amazing how fast they can grow trees with enough sunlight and food. reply fireflash38 17 hours agoparentprevGreat explanation of why certain species of trees are both fast growers and 'fast fallers'.

Your 100 year old window probably has single paned glass, lead paint (which is an unmitigated disaster on a double hung window, possibly exceeding the degree of hazard from every other lead painted part of a house combined), and is likely installed in an uninsulated wall without a proper sill flashing. That last point is worth some consideration. Essentially every window ever made either leaks or will leak. A small leak from a protected window [0] into an uninsulated wall cavity may not be terribly damaging. Add insulation and it’s a different story. Fortunately (per code! although many contractors completely ignore it for residential construction), newly installed windows are installed over a sill pan or other flashing that collects the water that leaks through the visible sill and directs it toward the outside. So, sure, maybe it’s worth the money to remove a double hung window, carefully and safely remove all the paint, retrofit an insulated glass unit into it, and reinstall it with proper flashings. Or you can buy a new window and trash the old one. [0] Old architecture was generally much better than new architecture at having little details that direct rain away from walls, windows and doors. reply VHRanger 14 hours agoparentThe problem with the new window is that people are most likely to buy a window that is unrepairable and will fail in 15 years. So changing a wood window for vynil/plastic/aluminium is signing up to a subscription to the window company. Also, the nice thing is that everything you described above is easily DIY'able (yes, even the lead paint). reply amluto 11 hours agorootparentFor the amount of money you’ll pay a competent contractor to strip, re-glaze, repaint, and replace the sash in an old window, you can buy a nice new window. With an engineered and tested sealing system that will keep drafts out a lot better than whatever you retrofit into your old window. Also, in cold climates, you’re up against physics. The inner surface of the glass, especially around the edges, gets cold. If you keep your interior air at a comfortable humidity level on a cold night, water will condense onto the glass. Some of it will drip onto the frame. Over the course of a few years, even really nice wood will not really appreciate this. So maybe don’t get a window with wood around the glass in a cold climate. reply VHRanger 10 hours agorootparentMy point is you can DIY that strip/reglaze work. If you contract it out it will be expensive, yes. Wood windows on the old property have fared much better than plastic or aluminum. Plastic fared the worst. Condensation will happen, but wood won't rot unless it can't dry out. It can dry out because you heat the house for one. That said any material will take damage if you let water intrusion (plastic frames too!) If water gets behind paint in painted wood, it'll rot. Some windows have better details for this - the trim and sill are sloped so that any water will naturally drip out instead of gathering. The windows that survived a long time tend to have those trim details that seem esthetic but are really functional. reply amluto 6 hours agorootparentThe condensation issue isn't necessarily water intrusion -- the cases I've seen on windows in otherwise good condition were repeated wetting of the inside surface of the wood at the bottom of the glass. This won't rot most wood, especially in cold weather.

Other than that, lead and its common compounds as used in paint are solids and are ordinarily pretty good at staying put. Unless you chew on the wall or the paint is damaged, lead painted surfaces may not be immediate hazards if you leave them alone. reply ipqk 11 hours agorootparentPaint can flake off in other areas too (like corners where pets & humans brush constantly against it).

I worked in the factory building wine racks for a couple of years after graduating high school in the 1980's, and then infrequently helped install cellars until he retired in the 2010. (It was a great opportunity to travel the world and install cellars in exotic places like Japan, Singapore, & etc.) The early cellars were all constructed using redwood, which was at that time plentiful and inexpensive ($0.20/lineal foot for 1x2). Redwood is easy to work with because it's harder than pine but softer than walnut and oak, so easy to saw and pin. \"Clear heart\" wood from the center of the tree doesn't warp much if stored well. It's also absorbent and so takes glue well. We particularly liked using redwood for wine cellars because it's resistive to mold due to the high tannin content. Wine cellars are susceptible to mold because the cellar's refrigeration is designed to keep a high humidity level (70-80%) so as to prevent \"ullage\" (loss of liquid due to evaporation). Corks are semi-permeable, and so wine evaporates through the corks due to osmotic pressure. Because I visited my dad's factory infrequently, I found the changes in wood noticeable -- the same way it's surprising how much my friend's kids have grown since I last saw them, unlike my kids who I see daily! Over time redwood became increasingly expensive, and the quality lower, with more \"A grade\" wood containing sapwood instead of the clear heart wood we preferred, and fewer tree rings. Wine racks use quite a large number of small pieces -- lengths of 1x1, about 0.75\" x 0.75\" -- and at that small size the lower quality of the wood meant more pieces were unusable due to issues with the grain. It's important to select for good wood grain so that folks don't stick their hands in a wine rack and pull back a bleeding stump filled with redwood splinters, which are nasty because the tannin in the wood also prevents the body from disolving them easily. Over time we switched to other sustainably-farmed wood like jarrah and mahogany, though those woods were super hard to work with -- they chewed up saw blades and were hard to get pins through. reply DudeOpotomus 18 hours agoprevThis is also the case with guitars and other musical instruments (pianos, violins etc.).

    "originBody": "How we applied advanced fuzzing techniques to cURL Post March 1, 2024 Leave a comment By Shaun Mirani Near the end of 2022, Trail of Bits was hired by the Open Source Technology Improvement Fund (OSTIF) to perform a security assessment of the cURL file transfer command-line utility and its library, libcurl. The scope of our engagement included a code review, a threat model, and the subject of this blog post: an engineering effort to analyze and improve cURL’s fuzzing code. We’ll discuss several elements of this process, including how we identified important areas of the codebase lacking coverage, and then modified the fuzzing code to hit these missed areas. For example, by setting certain libcurl options during fuzzer initialization and introducing new seed files, we doubled the line coverage of the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) handling code and quintupled it for the Alt-Svc header. We also expanded the set of fuzzed protocols to include WebSocket and enabled the fuzzing of many new libcurl options. We’ll conclude this post by explaining some more sophisticated fuzzing techniques the cURL team could adopt to increase coverage even further, bring fuzzing to the cURL command line, and reduce inefficiencies intrinsic to the current test case format. How is cURL fuzzed? OSS-Fuzz, a free service provided by Google for open-source projects, serves as the continuous fuzzing infrastructure for cURL. It supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, and Java codebases, and uses the coverage-guided libFuzzer, AFL++, and Honggfuzz fuzzing engines. OSS-Fuzz adopted cURL on July 1, 2017, and the incorporated code lives in the curl-fuzzer repository on GitHub, which was our focus for this part of the engagement. The repository contains the code (setup scripts, test case generators, harnesses, etc.) and corpora (the sets of initial test cases) needed to fuzz cURL and libcurl. It’s designed to fuzz individual targets, which are protocols supported by libcurl, such as HTTP(S), WebSocket, and FTP. curl-fuzzer downloads the latest copy of cURL and its dependencies, compiles them, and builds binaries for these targets against them. Each target takes a specially structured input file, processes it using the appropriate calls to libcurl, and exits. Associated with each target is a corpus directory that contains interesting seed files for the protocol to be fuzzed. These files are structured using a custom type-length-value (TLV) format that encodes not only the raw protocol data, but also specific fields and metadata for the protocol. For example, the fuzzer for the HTTP protocol includes options for the version of the protocol, custom headers, and whether libcurl should follow redirects. First impressions: HSTS and Alt-Svc We’d been tasked with analyzing and improving the fuzzer’s coverage of libcurl, the library providing curl’s internals. The obvious first question that came to mind was: what does the current coverage look like? To answer this, we wanted to peek at the latest coverage data given in the reports periodically generated by OSS-Fuzz. After some poking around at the URL for the publicly accessible oss-fuzz-coverage Google Cloud Storage bucket, we were able to find the coverage reports for cURL (for future reference, you can get there through the OSS-Fuzz introspector page). Here’s a report from September 28, 2022, at the start of our engagement. Reading the report, we quickly noticed that several source files were receiving almost no coverage, including some files that implemented security features or were responsible for handling untrusted data. For instance, hsts.c, which provides functions for parsing and handling the Strict-Transport-Security response header, had only 4.46% line coverage, 18.75% function coverage, and 2.56% region coverage after over five years on OSS-Fuzz: The file responsible for processing the Alt-Svc response header, altsvc.c, was similarly coverage-deficient: An investigation of the fuzzing code revealed why these numbers were so low. The first problem was that the corpora directory was missing test cases that included the Strict-Transport-Security and Alt-Svc headers, which meant there was no way for the fuzzer to quickly jump into testing these regions of the codebase for bugs; it would have to use coverage feedback to construct these test cases by itself, which is usually a slow(er) process. The second issue was that the fuzzer never set the CURLOPT_HSTS option, which instructs libcurl to use an HSTS cache file. As a result, HSTS was never enabled during runs of the fuzzer, and most code paths in hsts.c were never hit. The final impediment to achieving good coverage of HSTS was an issue with its specification, which tells user agents to ignore the Strict-Transport-Security header when sent over unencrypted HTTP. However, this creates a problem in the context of fuzzing: from the perspective of our fuzzing target, which never stood up an actual TLS connection, every connection was unencrypted, and Strict-Transport-Security was always ignored. For Alt-Svc, libcurl already included a workaround to relax the HTTPS requirement for debug builds when a certain environment variable was set (although curl-fuzzer did not set this variable). So, resolving this issue was just a matter of adding a similar feature for HSTS to libcurl and ensuring that curl-fuzzer set all necessary environment variables. Our changes to address these issues were as follows: We added seed files for Strict-Transport-Security and Alt-Svc to curl-fuzzer (ee7fad2). We enabled CURLOPT_HSTS in curl-fuzzer (0dc42e4). We added a check to allow debug builds of libcurl to bypass the HTTPS restriction for HSTS when the CURL_HSTS_HTTP environment variable is set, and we set the CURL_HSTS_HTTP and CURL_ALTSVC_HTTP environment variables in curl-fuzzer (6efb6b1 and 937597c). The day after our changes were merged upstream, OSS-Fuzz reported a significant bump in coverage for both files: A little over a year of fuzzing later (on January 29, 2024), our three fixes had doubled the line coverage for hsts.c and nearly quintupled it for altsvc.c: Sowing the seeds of bugs Exploring curl-fuzzer further, we saw a number of other opportunities to boost coverage. One low-hanging fruit we spotted was the set of seed files found in the corpora directory. While libcurl supports numerous protocols (some of which surprised us!) and features, not all of them were represented as seed files in the corpora. This is important: as we alluded to earlier, a comprehensive set of initial test cases, touching on as much major functionality as possible, acts as a shortcut to attaining coverage and significantly cuts down on the time spent fuzzing before bugs are found. The functionality we created new seed files for, with the hope of promoting new coverage, included (ee7fad2): CURLOPT_LOGIN_OPTIONS: Sets protocol-specific login options for IMAP, LDAP, POP3, and SMTP CURLOPT_XOAUTH2_BEARER: Specifies an OAuth 2.0 Bearer Access Token to use with HTTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3, and SMTP servers CURLOPT_USERPWD: Specifies a username and password to use for authentication CURLOPT_USERAGENT: Specifies the value of the User-Agent header CURLOPT_SSH_HOST_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256: Sets the expected SHA256 hash of the remote server for an SSH connection CURLOPT_HTTPPOST: Sets POST request data. curl-fuzzer had been using only the CURLOPT_MIMEPOST option to achieve this, while the similar but deprecated CURLOPT_HTTPPOST option wasn’t exercised. We also added support for this older method. Certain other CURLOPTs, as with CURLOPT_HSTS in the previous section, made more sense to set globally in the fuzzer’s initialization function. These included: CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE: Points to a filename to read cookies from. It also enables fuzzing of the cookie engine, which parses cookies from responses and includes them in future requests. CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR: Allows fuzzing the code responsible for saving in-memory cookies to a file CURLOPT_CRLFILE: Specifies the certificate revocation list file to read for TLS connections Where to go from here As we started to understand more about curl-fuzzer’s internals, we drew up several strategic recommendations to improve the fuzzer’s efficacy that the timeline of our engagement didn’t allow us to implement ourselves. We presented these recommendations to the cURL team in our final report, and expand on a few of them below. Dictionaries Dictionaries are a feature of libFuzzer that can be especially useful for the text-based protocols spoken by libcurl. The dictionary for a protocol is a file enumerating the strings that are interesting in the context of the protocol, such as keywords, delimiters, and escape characters. Providing a dictionary to libFuzzer may increase its search speed and lead to the faster discovery of new bugs. curl-fuzzer already takes advantage of this feature for the HTTP target, but currently supplies no dictionaries for the numerous other protocols supported by libcurl. We recommend that the cURL team create dictionaries for these protocols to boost the fuzzer’s speed. This may be a good use case for an LLM; ChatGPT can generate a starting point dictionary in response to the following prompt (replace with the name of the target protocol): A dictionary can be used to guide the fuzzer. A dictionary is passed as a file to the fuzzer. The simplest input accepted by libFuzzer is an ASCII text file where each line consists of a quoted string. Strings can contain escaped byte sequences like \"\\xF7\\xF8\". Optionally, a key-value pair can be used like hex_value=\"\\xF7\\xF8\" for documentation purposes. Comments are supported by starting a line with #. Write me an example dictionary file for aparser. argv fuzzing During our first engagement with curl, one of us joked, “Have we tried curl AAAAAAAAAA… yet?” There turned out to be a lot of wisdom behind this quip; it spurred us to fuzz curl’s command-line interface (CLI), which yielded multiple vulnerabilities (see our blog post, cURL audit: How a joke led to significant findings). This CLI fuzzing was performed using AFL++’s argv-fuzz-inl.h header file. The header defines macros that allow a target program to build the argv array containing command-line arguments from fuzzer-provided data on standard input. We recommend that the cURL team use this feature from AFL++ to continuously fuzz cURL’s CLI (implementation details can be found in the blog post linked above). Structure-aware fuzzing One of curl-fuzzer’s weaknesses is intrinsic to the way it currently structures its inputs, which is with a custom Type-length-value (TLV) format. A TLV scheme (or something similar) can be useful for fuzzing a project like libcurl, which supports a wealth of global and protocol-specific options and parameters that need to be encoded in test cases. However, the brittleness of this binary format makes the fuzzer inefficient. This is because libFuzzer has no idea about the structure that inputs are supposed to adhere to. curl-fuzzer expects input data in a strict format: a 2-byte field for the record type (of which only 52 were valid at the time of our engagement), a 4-byte field for the length of the data, and finally the data itself. Because libFuzzer doesn’t take this format into account, most of the mutations it generates wind up being invalid at the TLV-unpacking stage and have to be thrown out. Google’s fuzzing guidance warns about using TLV inputs for this reason. As a result, the coverage feedback used to guide mutations toward interesting code paths performs much worse than it would if we dealt only with raw data. In fact, libcurl may contain bugs that will never be found with the current naive TLV strategy. So, how can the cURL team address this issue while keeping the flexibility of a TLV format? Enter structure-aware fuzzing. The idea with structure-aware fuzzing is to assist libFuzzer by writing a custom mutator. At a high level, the custom mutator’s job comprises just three steps: Try to unpack the input data coming from libFuzzer as a TLV. If the data can’t be parsed into a valid TLV, instead of throwing it away, return a syntactically correct dummy TLV. This can be anything, as long as it can be successfully unpacked. If the data does constitute a valid TLV, mutate the fields parsed out in step 1 by calling the LLVMFuzzerMutate function. Then, serialize the mutated fields and return the resultant TLV. With this approach, no time is wasted discarding inputs because every input is valid; the mutator only ever creates correctly structured TLVs. Performing mutations at the level of the decoded data (rather than at the level of the encoding scheme) allows better coverage feedback, which leads to a faster and more effective fuzzer. An open issue on curl-fuzzer proposes several changes, including an implementation of structure-aware fuzzing, but there hasn’t been any movement on it since 2019. We strongly recommend that the cURL team revisit the subject, as it has the potential to significantly improve the fuzzer’s ability to find bugs. Our 2023 follow-up At the end of 2023, we had the chance to revisit cURL and its fuzzing code in another audit supported by OSTIF. Stay tuned for the highlights of our follow-up work in a future blog post. Share this: Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Telegram Facebook Pocket Email Print Like this: Like Loading...

The problem is that the space of invalid inputs is far larger than the space of valid inputs. Sometimes orders of magnitude larger, say billions or more invalid inputs to one valid input. Naive fuzzing will hit so many error cases that it will hardly produce a valid input. For the ratio that I mentioned, you might run a fuzzer for a billion runs and only get one valid input in the bunch. Using a custom mutator and returning a dummy value will give the fuzzer a starting point from a valid input and makes generating other valid inputs more likely. For my part, I prefer to use custom mutators to generate valid test cases most of the time, but I want some invalid inputs because error handling is where most bugs are. reply vlovich123 5 hours agorootparentI personally would separate that into two separate fuzz cases - one that generates only valid inputs and one that generates only invalid inputs and spend more resources on verifying the latter because validating invalid inputs is more important. I didn’t read the article but I like property testing for this where your mutator takes random values and uses that to generate a valid input somehow rather than stubbing in a static value. Where I can use a static value is where I wouldn’t be fuzzing the validation of that value.

Code can only be as reliable as what it's leaning on. So, to answer your question, a lot of time. In a business-oriented project(at most jobs), code may undergo frequent changes due to requests from business, thus too much focus on testing could potentially slowing down development speed if extensive testing is implemented for each change. However, regression tests can still provide valuable insights and allow for faster development later in the life of the project. While many projects only focus on happy path testing, the use of such tests might not be as high. Coupling them with Negative Testing, and even better, implementing boundary testing, compels developers to consider both valid and invalid inputs, helping to identify and address potential edge cases before they become bugs or security issues in production.

All that said, your reaction is totally understandable. reply tonyarkles 12 hours agorootparentLink to how SQLite is tested, for anyone who's curious: https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html There's also an interesting thing where formal verification requires a formal specification, which afaik there isn't one for SQLite. One of the toughest problems that someone would run into trying to put together a formal specification for code as widely deployed as SQLite boils down to Hyrum's Law[1]: on a long enough time scale, all observable behaviours of your system become interfaces that someone, somewhere depends on. That massive suite of test cases isn't a formal specification but given that it achieves 100% branch coverage that implies to me that it: - pretty tightly bounds the interface without formally specifying it - also pretty tightly constrains the implementation to match the current implementation Which, when you have as many users as you do with SQLite, is probably a fair way of providing guarantees to your users that upgrading from 3.44.0 to 3.45.1 isn't going to break anything you're using unless you were relying on explicitly-identified buggy behaviour (you'd be able to see the delta in the test cases if you looked at the Fossil diffs).

If you are at a startup, the growth of your startup is often largely dependent on how quickly you can add features / onboard customers. In that context, writing tests not only slows you down from adding new features, it might make it harder to modify existing features. In addition, early customers also tend to be accepting of small bugs -- they themselves already have \"taken a risk\" in trusting an early startup. So testing is not really valuable -- you want to remain agile, and you won't lose much money because of a bug. On the other hand, if you are Google, you already have found a money-printing firehose, and you /don't/ want to take on any additional unnecessary risk. Any new code needs to /not/ break existing functionality -- if it does, you might lose out of millions of revenue. In addition, your product becomes so large that it is impossible to manually test every feature. In this case, tests actually help you move /faster/ because they help you at scale automatically ensure that a change does not break anything. While cURL does not make any money, it is solidly on the mature/Google end of the testing spectrum. It has found a footing in the open source tooling \"market\" and people rely on it to maintain its existing functionality. In addition, it has accumulated a fairly large surface area, so manual testing is not really feasible for every feature. So testing similarly helps cURL developers move faster (in the long run), not slower. reply epistasis 15 hours agoparentprevThere's a tradeoff for sure, but to fully evaluate that tradeoff you must also take into account the future time spent on the code base, including the amount of time needed to debug future features, adopt a new build environment, allow new team members to muck around and see what does and does not work... If it's a small project that won't be extended much, then perhaps then re-runnable unit tests may not make the bar as a net positive tradeoff. But some time must still be spent testing the code, even if it's not tests that are written in code. reply dogcomplex 11 hours agoparentprevI would generally double whatever your expectations are for the initial feature development. Tests are essentially a second implementation from a different angle running in parallel, hoping the results match. Every feature change means changing 2 systems now. You save a bit of subsequent time with easier debugging when other features break tests, but that's somewhat eaten up by maintaining a system twice the size. There are reasons many MVP developers and small teams whose focus is more on rapid feature implementation than large team coordination or code stability forego writing tests. It doesn't make sense in all circumstances. Generally, more complex, less grokable, more large-team-oriented or public library code is when you need testing. reply vlovich123 5 hours agorootparentTests are only a second implementation if you use test doubles incorrectly. Test doubles should only be used for I/O outside of the program under test that you can’t really run locally / is a network dependency (eg mocking a SaaS service or something) or for performance (mocking database responses vs spinning up a test database instance). If you do it write, most of your tests are just testing each layer and everything below it. I have yet to see a case where omitting tests actually helps you move meaningfully faster - you’re probably generating more heat than light and that makes you feel like you’re moving faster. reply avgcorrection 15 hours agoparentprevThe best-case IMO is a test suite where writing the test is almost as easy (or maybe easier?) than doing the equivalent manual test. The test code is maybe 2–4x longer than the change. The worst case is… arbitrarily bad, to the point of being impossible. Test setup is hell because there are too many dependencies. You have to mock the “real world” since (again) things depend on other things too much and you can’t really do a simple string-manipulating change without setting up a whole environment. Also you introduce bugs in your tests that take longer to debug than the real change you are making. What I feel that we (current project) have fallen into the trap of is that there wasn’t a test suite from the start. Just manual testing. Then when you get to a stage where you feel you need one, the code base is not structured to make automated testing simple. reply burnished 13 hours agoparentprevGenerally speaking, yes. Its not like most code isn't changed as a consequence of writing those tests, so the practice has immediate benefit, but future changes can be made swiftly and securely due to the confidence those tests should be giving you. But also your time estimate does sound wonky, 2-3x sounds extreme.

If you're developing a new indie game with $10k revenue expectation in its lifetime, then probably it's not worth your time. But if it's a core infrastructure of multi-billion dollar business, then yes it's worth your time since any non-trivial security incidents may cost more than your annual salary. reply evil-olive 7 hours agoparentprev> Every new feature can take 2-3 times longer to deliver due to adding tests. alternate framing: you can have a feature done in half or a third of the time, if you don't care whether it actually works or not ...or whether it will continue working, as other new features are added to the system and the codebase evolves and grows. that sort of maintainability is one of the key things you get from investing in writing tests - you can refactor without fear of breaking some existing feature. it also allows you to hire engineers and give them a \"safety net\" where they can make changes and be confident they're not breaking some crucial functionality of the unfamiliar codebase. done correctly (an important caveat, because lots of people do testing poorly and then conclude that all testing is bad) that time spent writing tests is not wasted effort. cutting corners by skipping tests is very much a false economy in the long term. reply cpill 15 hours agoprevnext [4 more] [flagged] Jtsummers 15 hours agoparentThrow random inputs at a system and see what happens.

    "originBody": "← cgad.ski 2024-02-29 Where Is Noether's Principle in Machine Learning? This post accompanies a poster to be presented at the MLSS 2024. Physics likes optimization! Subject to its boundary conditions, the time evolution of a physical system is a critical point for a quantity called an action. This point of view sets the stage for Noether's principle, a remarkable correspondence between continuous invariances of the action and conservation laws of the system. In machine learning, we often deal with discrete \"processes\" whose control parameters are chosen to minimize some quantity. For example, we can see a deep residual network as a process where the role of \"time\" is played by depth. We may ask: Does Noether's theorem apply to these processes? Can we find meaningful conserved quantities? Our answers: \"yes,\" and \"not sure!\" Noether's Principle in Physics In 1630, Fermat observed that the trajectory a beam of light takes through a lens is a path of least time. Formally, where 𝑣 ( 𝑞 ) v(q) gives the velocity of light at a point 𝑞 , q, a trajectory 𝑞 ( 𝑡 ) q(t) taken by a beam of light between two points 𝑞 ( 𝑡 0 ) q(t0) and 𝑞 ( 𝑡 1 ) q(t1) will be a stationary point for 𝑆 [ 𝑞 ] = ∫ 𝑡 0 𝑡 1 1 𝑣 ( 𝑞 ) ∥ 𝑞 ˙ ∥   𝑑 𝑡 , S[q]=∫t0t1v(q)1∥q˙∥dt, in the sense that 𝑑 𝑑 𝜖 𝑆 [ 𝑞 + 𝜖 ℎ ] = 0 dϵdS[q+ϵh]=0 for any \"perturbation\" ℎ h verifying ℎ ( 𝑡 0 ) = ℎ ( 𝑡 1 ) = 0. h(t0)=h(t1)=0. Furthermore, this condition turns out to characterize the paths that light can take. In fact, all fundamental physical theories can be written in the form 𝛿 𝑆 = 0 δS=0 for a suitable \"action\" 𝑆 , S, where 𝛿 δ denotes a (variational) derivative with respect to the process trajectory. Such an equation is called a stationary action principle. Given a physical system, a function 𝐹 ( 𝑞 , 𝑞 ˙ , 𝑡 , …   ) F(q,q˙,t,…) of the system state is called a conserved quantity when its value is constant over any given physical trajectory. For dynamics expressed by a stationary action principle, Noether's principle gives a remarkable correspondence between conserved quantities and certain invariances of the action 𝑆 . S. For the purposes of this article, we will not give more details on Noether's principle. The interested reader is invited to seek out Chapter 4 of Arnold's Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics for a concise description from the point of view of Lagrangian mechanics. (For a much more complete reference, including the more subtle \"off-shell\" version applicable to local gauge transformations, see Chapter 5 of Olver's Application of Lie Groups to Differential Equations.) However, as a guide for the imagination, we illustrate two examples. In physics, the famous two-body problem is described by the action 𝑆 = ∫ 1 2 ( 𝑚 1 𝑞 ˙ 1 2 + 𝑚 2 𝑞 ˙ 2 2 ) − 𝑚 1 𝑚 2 𝐺 ∥ 𝑞 1 − 𝑞 2 ∥   𝑑 𝑡 , S=∫21(m1q˙12+m2q˙22)−∥q1−q2∥m1m2Gdt, where 𝑞 1 q1 and 𝑞 2 q2 are the positions of our two bodies and 𝑚 1 m1 and 𝑚 2 m2 are their masses. The integrand does not change if the trajectories 𝑞 1 ( 𝑡 ) q1(t) and 𝑞 2 ( 𝑡 ) q2(t) are translated or rotated, so these transformations are invariants for 𝑆 . S. Applying Noether's theorem gives us three conserved quantities—one for each degree of freedom in our group of transformations—which turn out to be horizontal, vertical, and angular momentum. In the illustration above, we consider two bodies with equal mass. Conservation of linear momentum means that the sum of the arrows is constant, while conservation of angular momentum means that the sum of highlighted areas is constant. For a less familiar example of a conservation law, consider a ray of light passing through a rotationally symmetric lens. Rotating a trajectory about the center of the lens does not affect the time needed to traverse it. What conserved quantity does this symmetry produce? Conventional Luneberg Annular At each instant, let 𝑝 p be a vector pointing in the direction of 𝑞 ˙ q˙ with norm equal to 1 / 𝑣 ( 𝑞 ) . 1/v(q). (We've drawn this vector in the widget above.) This vector can be seen as the gradient of 𝑆 S with respect to 𝑞 ; q; it gives the marginal price we would pay to move 𝑞 q in a certain direction at a particular instant. Noether's principle tells us that 𝑝 ∧ ( 𝑞 − 𝑐 ) p∧(q−c) is conserved, where 𝑐 c is the center of the lens. In our illustration, this conserved quantity is represented by the area of the triangle. Noether's Principle in ML: A Toy Example In machine learning, we routinely deal with processes whose control parameters are chosen to minimize some quantity. For example, say we are trying to solve a supervised learning problem by choosing parameters ( 𝜃 1 , … , 𝜃 𝑁 ) (θ1,…,θN) so that a composition 𝐹 = 𝜑 𝑁 ( 𝜃 𝑁 ) ∘ ⋯ ∘ 𝜑 2 ( 𝜃 2 ) ∘ 𝜑 1 ( 𝜃 1 ) F=φN(θN)∘⋯∘φ2(θ2)∘φ1(θ1) minimizes some expected loss 𝐸 [ 𝐿 ( 𝐹 ( 𝑥 ) , 𝑦 ) ] E[L(F(x),y)] with respect to some random variables 𝑥 x and 𝑦 . y. Let's view the sequence of random variables 𝑥 0 = 𝑥 𝑥 1 = 𝜑 1 ( 𝜃 1 ) ( 𝑥 0 ) ⋮ 𝑥 𝑁 = 𝜑 𝑁 ( 𝜃 𝑁 ) ( 𝑥 𝑁 − 1 ) x0x1xN=x=φ1(θ1)(x0)⋮=φN(θN)(xN−1)as the states of a discrete-time \"process.\" After optimization, the trajectory ( 𝑥 0 , … , 𝑥 𝑁 ) (x0,…,xN) is approximately a critical point for a loss function. As we saw above, physical trajectories are also characterized as critical points of certain functions. Can we think about our trajectory of intermediate values 𝑥 𝑖 xi from a physical point of view? Of course, several things are different. Most obviously, \"time\" is now discrete rather than continuous. Furthermore, our trajectory of intermediate values is constrained in a different way. In physics, we specified boundary conditions and allowed the intermediate states of the process to vary, but in machine learning we specify an initial condition and constrain the trajectory ( 𝑥 0 , … , 𝑥 𝑁 ) (x0,…,xN) to be driven by some parameters 𝜃 𝑖 . θi. Fortunately, Noether's principle continues to apply! To see how, let's consider a toy example that's easy to visualize. First, we'll define a family of \"deformations\" of the plane, as depicted below. (Click the screen or drag the sldier to change the parameters of the deformation.) Next, we'll set up some simple optimization problems. In each case, we'll try to find a sequence of small deformations that work together to send some \"clusters\" to their corresponding \"destinations.\" This is easy to do by initializing randomly and optimizing our parameters with gradient descent. In the following widget, a composition of 50 maps is able to swap the positions of three clusters. Show grads Hide grads Now, observe that our family 𝐹 F of deformations is invariant under conjugation by translations and rotations. This means that, where 𝑄 Q is a translation or rotation, we have an equality 𝐹 = { 𝑄 ∘ 𝑓 ∘ 𝑄 − 1 ∣ 𝑓 ∈ 𝐹 } F={Q∘f∘Q−1∣f∈F} of sets. In other words, our family 𝐹 F \"looks the same\" from a translated or rotated coordinate system. Moreover, conjugating a map 𝑓 f by a transformation 𝑄 Q near the identity can be realized by making a small change to the parameters that define 𝑓 . f. As it turns out, this is the right notion of invariance to apply Noether's principle. What conserved quantity do we get? For each data point, let ( 𝑔 𝑖 ) 𝑖 = 1 𝑁 (gi)i=1N be the backpropagated gradients of the loss function with respect to the intermediate positions ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑖 = 1 𝑁 (xi)i=1N that this data point takes through our \"process.\" Applying a certain discrete Noether's principle, detailed at the end of this post, will turn invariance of 𝐹 F under translations into conservation of the expected value 𝐸 [ 𝑔 𝑖 ] E[gi] from one layer to the next. (You can display the individual vectors 𝑔 𝑖 gi in the widget above.) Invariance under rotation gives a conserved quantity reminiscent of angular momentum, namely 𝐸 [ 𝑔 𝑖 ∧ 𝑥 𝑖 ] . E[gi∧xi]. In this particular example, it turns out that 𝐸 [ 𝑔 𝑖 ] E[gi] is also approximately conserved (and nearly zero) over each individual cluster. In the next widget, we add some examples where the per-cluster gradient is not conserved. (Each cluster now has its average gradient drawn with a single arrow. For simplicity, we are not visualizing \"angular gradient.\") Swapping Pushing Pulling Disentangling In the physical world, interactions are often accompanied by transfers of conserved quantities. Think, for example, of particles in a gas exchanging momentum and energy. Conversely, if two systems are not interacting with one another, then conservation laws will hold for each system in isolation. In mechanics, this is known as Newton's first law. In our first toy example, the subgoals of bringing each cluster to its respective destination could be achieved without compromise between clusters, meaning that each cluster acted like an independent subsystem. This lack of interaction explains the conservation of gradient within each cluster. (In other words, we can apply Newton's first law.) In our next examples, \"transfers\" of average gradient indicate \"interactions\" between clusters, meaning that the trajectory of our process is no longer a stationary point for each subgoal considered in isolation. On the other hand, we can sometimes identify subset of clusters over which gradient is approximately conserved. In general, if the layers of a deep model have meaningful \"Noether equivariances,\" then we can build conserved quantities and perhaps study a physically-inspired notion of \"interaction.\" However, I don't know if this idea works in practice! Can you think of interesting equivariances that we might find on real-world machine learning models? (Keep in mind that they might only be valid near the actual parameters of the model.) Proof of a Discrete Noether's Principle In the above, we've been intentionally vague about the details of Noether's principle and how it applied to our toy example. We end this post with a general proof of our \"discrete\" Noether's principle. We'll focus on a single step of an \"optimized process.\" Let 𝜑  ⁣ : Θ × 𝑋 → 𝑌 φ:Θ×X→Y describe some family of functions parameterized over Θ , Θ, and define the action 𝑆 = ⟨ 𝑔 𝑥 , 𝑥 ⟩ − ⟨ 𝑔 𝑦 , 𝜑 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) − 𝑦 ⟩ S=⟨gx,x⟩−⟨gy,φθ(x)−y⟩ where 𝑥 x and 𝑦 y are understood to be random variables, 𝑔 𝑥 gx and 𝑔 𝑦 gy are their associated loss gradients, and inner products are taken in expectation. In the typical context of supervised learning, 𝜑 φ will parameterize a layer of a deep model, and ⟨ 𝑔 𝑥 , 𝑥 ⟩ ⟨gx,x⟩ (for example) stands for a sum 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 ⟨ 𝑔 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) , 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) ⟩ n1i=1∑n⟨gx(i),x(i)⟩ where 𝑖 i indexes over a dataset and ( 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) , 𝑔 𝑥 ( 𝑖 ) ) (x(i),gx(i)) are activation and gradient vectors for the 𝑖 ith data point. The \"forward pass\" 𝑦 = 𝜑 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) y=φθ(x) and \"backward pass\" 𝑔 𝑥 = ( ∂ 𝜑 / ∂ 𝑥 ) 𝑇 𝑔 𝑦 gx=(∂φ/∂x)Tgy are encoded by the stationarity of 𝑆 S with respect to 𝑔 𝑦 gy and 𝑥 , x, since ∂ 𝑆 ∂ 𝑔 𝑦 = 𝜑 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) − 𝑦 , ∂ 𝑆 ∂ 𝑥 = 𝑔 𝑥 − ( ∂ 𝜑 ∂ 𝑥 ) 𝑇 𝑔 𝑦 . ∂gy∂S=φθ(x)−y,∂x∂S=gx−(∂x∂φ)Tgy. Similarly, first-order optimality of the parameter 𝜃 θ can be expressed as ∂ 𝑆 ∂ 𝜃 = 0. ∂θ∂S=0. In practice, this will hold only approximately, so our conservation law will also be approximate. We ignore this detail for simplicity. Now, suppose that ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝜃 ) (x,y,θ) are made to depend on a real-valued parameter 𝜖 ϵ and that ∂ ∂ 𝜖 ⟨ 𝑔 𝑦 , 𝜑 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) − 𝑦 ⟩ = 0.∂ϵ∂⟨gy,φθ(x)−y⟩=0.(1)For example, when we have a Lie group 𝐺 G acting on 𝑋 , X, Θ Θ and 𝑌 Y such that 𝜑 𝑔 ⋅ 𝜃 ( 𝑔 ⋅ 𝑥 ) = 𝑔 ⋅ 𝜑 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) , φg⋅θ(g⋅x)=g⋅φθ(x), then any one-parameter subgroup of 𝐺 G gives rise to such a variation of ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝜃 ) . (x,y,θ). This is the case for our toy example, where 𝐺 G is the group SE ⁡ ( 2 ) SE(2) of translations and rotations of the plane. I'm calling this kind of symmetry a Noether equivariance. Let's compute ∂ 𝑆 / ∂ 𝜖 . ∂S/∂ϵ. Applying ( 1 ) , (1), we find ∂ 𝑆 ∂ 𝜖 = ⟨ 𝑔 𝑥 , ∂ 𝑥 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ . ∂ϵ∂S=⟨gx,∂ϵ∂x⟩. On the other hand, if 𝑆 S is stationary with respect to 𝑥 x and 𝜃 , θ, then ∂ 𝑆 / ∂ 𝜖 ∂S/∂ϵ can be explained entirely by the variation of 𝑦 , y, which is ∂ 𝑆 ∂ 𝜖 = ∂ 𝑆 ∂ 𝑦 ∂ 𝑦 ∂ 𝜖 = ⟨ 𝑔 𝑦 , ∂ 𝑦 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ . ∂ϵ∂S=∂y∂S∂ϵ∂y=⟨gy,∂ϵ∂y⟩. Overall, we conclude that ⟨ 𝑔 𝑥 , ∂ 𝑥 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ = ⟨ 𝑔 𝑦 , ∂ 𝑦 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ . ⟨gx,∂ϵ∂x⟩=⟨gy,∂ϵ∂y⟩. This is quite analogous to the conservation law 𝑑 𝑑 𝑡 ⟨ 𝑝 , ∂ 𝑞 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ = 0 dtd⟨p,∂ϵ∂q⟩=0 that Noether's principle implies for a Hamiltonian system invariant under a family of canonical transformations. One simple kind of Noether equivariance is a relationship like 𝜑 𝑔 ⋅ 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑔 ⋅ 𝜑 𝜃 ( 𝑥 ) , φg⋅θ(x)=g⋅φθ(x), meaning that our family of maps is expressive enough to be closed under the action of 𝐺 G on its outputs. In this case, since the action on 𝑥 x is trivial, ∂ 𝑥 / ∂ 𝜖 = 0 ∂x/∂ϵ=0 and the \"conservation law\" associated with any one-parameter subgroup of 𝐺 G simply reads 0 = ⟨ 𝑔 𝑦 , ∂ 𝑦 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ . 0=⟨gy,∂ϵ∂y⟩. Indeed, this inner product is exactly the derivative of the loss with respect to the transformation of 𝑦 y by a given one-parameter subgroup of 𝐺 . G. If variations to 𝜃 θ can produce these transformations and 𝜃 θ is chosen optimally, the inner product must be 0. 0. (Informally, this explains why the average gradients in our toy example are approximately 0. 0.) The same idea applies to a group acting only on 𝑥 x and 𝜃 , θ, in which case we get ⟨ 𝑔 𝑥 , ∂ 𝑥 ∂ 𝜖 ⟩ = 0. ⟨gx,∂ϵ∂x⟩=0. For example, if 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅 𝑛 x∈Rn is the input to a linear layer, we get a \"Noether equivariance\" in the form of an action of GL ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) GL(n) on 𝑥 x and the layer parameters. Letting ∂ 𝑥 / ∂ 𝜖 ∂x/∂ϵ range over all linear functions of 𝑥 x in the equation above—which we get from the action of one-parameter subgroups of GL ⁡ ( 𝑛 ) GL(n)—shows that the tensor product 𝑔 𝑥 ⊗ 𝑥 gx⊗x will vanish in expectation if the loss is stationary with respect to the parameters of the linear layer. The general principle we proved above can be understood as the \"two-sided\" extension of these kinds of observations. ← cgad.ski",

I'd just like to highlight that the conservation laws proved in that paper are functions of the parameters that hold over the course of gradient descent, whereas my post is talking about functions of the activations that are conserved from one layer to the next within an optimized network. By the way, maybe I'm being too much of a math snob, but I'd argue Kunin's result is only superficially similar to Noether's theorem. (In the paper they call it a \"striking similarity\"!) Geometrically, what they're saying is that, if a loss function is invariant under a non-zero vector field, then the trajectory of gradient descent will be tangent to the codimension-1 distribution of vectors perpendicular to the vector field. If that distribution is integrable (in the sense of the Frobenius theorem), then any of its integrals is conserved under gradient descent. That's a very different geometric picture from Noether's theorem. For example, Noether's theorem gives a direct mapping from invariances to conserved quantities, whereas they need a special integrability condition to hold. But yes, it is a nice result, certainly worth keeping in mind when thinking about your gradient flows. :) By the way, you might be interested in [1], which also studies gradient descent from the point of view of mechanics and seems to really use Noether-like results.

I'm going to have to spend more time digesting the article, but one thing that jumps out at me, and maybe it's answered in the article and I don't understand it, is the role of time. Generally in physics, you're talking about a quantity being conserved over time, and I'm not sure what plays the role of time when you're talking about conserved quantities in machine learning -- is it conserved over training iterations or over inference layers, or what? edit: now that i've read it again, I just saw that they described in the second paragraph. I'm now wondering if in something like Sora that can do a kind of physical modeling, if there's some conserved quantity in the neural network that is _directly analagous_ to conserved quantities in physics -- if there is, for example, something that represents momentum, that operates exactly as momentum as it progresses through the layers. reply nostrademons 18 hours agoparentIn physics, the conserved quantity isn't always time. Invariance over time translation is specifically conservation of energy. Invariance over spatial translation is conservation of momentum, invariance over spatial rotation is conservation of conservation of angular momentum, invariance of electromagnetic field is conservation of current, and invariance of wave function phase is conservation of charge. I think the analogue in machine learning is conservation over changes in the training data. After all, the point of machine learning is to find general models that describe the training data given, and minimize the loss function. Assuming that a useful model can be trained, the whole point is that it generalizes to new, unseen instances with minimal losses, i.e. the model remains invariant under shifts in the instances seen. The more interesting part to me is what this says about philosophy of physics. Noether's Theorem can be restated as \"The laws of physics are invariant under X transformation\", where X is the gauge symmetry associated with the conservation law. But maybe this is simply a consequence of how we do physics. After all, the point of science is to produce generalized laws from empirical observations. It's trivially easy to find a real-world situation where conservation of energy does not hold (any system with friction, which is basically all of them), but the math gets very messy if you try to actually model the real data, so we rely on approximations that are close enough most of the time. And if many people take empirical measurements at many different points in space, and time, and orientations, you get generalized laws that hold regardless of where/when/who takes the measurement. Machine learning could be viewed as doing science on empirically measurable social quantities. It won't always be accurate, as individual machine-learning fails show. But it's accurate enough that it can provide useful models for civilization-scale quantities. reply empath-nirvana 17 hours agorootparent> In physics, the conserved quantity isn't always time. Invariance over time translation is specifically conservation of energy. That's not what i meant. When you talk about \"conservation of angular momentum\", the symmetry is invariance over rotation, but the angular momentum is conserved _over time_. reply jedbrown 17 hours agorootparentprev> It's trivially easy to find a real-world situation where conservation of energy does not hold (any system with friction, which is basically all of them) Conservation of energy absolutely still holds, but entropy is not conserved so the process is irreversible. If your model doesn't include heat, then discrete energy won't be conserved in a process that produces heat, but that's your modeling choice, not a statement about physics. It is common to model such processes using a dissipation potential. reply nostrademons 17 hours agorootparentRight, but I'm saying that it's all modeling choices, all the way down. Extend the model to include thermal energy and most of the time it holds again - but then it falls down if you also have static electricity that generates a visible spark (say, a wool sweater on a slide) or magnetic drag (say, regenerative braking on a car). Then you can include models for those too, but you're introducing new concepts with each, and the math gets much hairier. We call the unified model where we abstract away all the different forms of energy \"conservation of energy\", but there are a good many practical systems where making tangible predictions using conservation of energy gives wrong answers. Basically this is a restatement of Box's Aphorism (\"All models are wrong, but some are useful\") or the ideas in Thomas Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". The goal of science is to from concrete observations to abstract principles which ideally will accurately predict the value of future concrete observations. In many cases, you can do this. But not all. There is always messy data that doesn't fit into neat, simple, general laws. Usually the messy data is just ignored, because it can't be predicted and is assumed to average out or generally be irrelevant in the end. But sometimes the messy outliers bite you, or someone comes up with a new way to handle them elegantly, and then you get a paradigm shift. And this has implications for understanding what machine learning is or why it's important. Few people would think that a model linking background color to likeliness to click on ads is a fundamental physical quality, but Google had one 15+ years ago, and it was pretty accurate, and made them a bunch of money. Or similarly, most people wouldn't think of a model of the English language as being a fundamental physical quality, but that's exactly what an LLM is, and they're pretty useful too. reply jcgrillo 14 hours agorootparentIt's been a long time since I have cracked a physics book, but your mention of interesting \"fundamental physical quantities\" triggered the recollection of there being a conservation of information result in quantum mechanics where you can come up with an action whose equations of motion are Schrödinger's equation and the conserved quantity is a probability current. So I wonder to what extent (if any) it might make sense to try to approach these things in terms of the really fundamental quantity of information itself? reply jerf 10 hours agorootparentApproaching physics from a pure information flow is definitely a current research topic. I suspect we see less popsci treatment of it because almost nobody understands information at all, then trying to apply it to physics that also almost nobody understands is probably at least three or four bridges too far for a popsci treatment, but it's a current and active topic. reply Aardwolf 17 hours agorootparentprevIs there any way to deduce which invariance gives which conservation? I mean for example: how can you tell that time invariance is the one paired with conservation of energy? Why is e.g. time invariance not paired with momentum, current, or anything else, but specifically energy? I know that I can remember momentum is paired with translation simply because there's both the angular momentum and the non-angular momentum one and in space you have translation and rotation, so for time energy is the only one that's left over, but I'm not looking for a trick to remember it, I'm looking for the fundamental reason, as well as how to tell what will be paired with some invariance when looking at some other new invariance reply chunky1994 17 hours agorootparentThe conserved quantity is derived from Noether's theorem itself. One thing that is a bit hairy is that Noether's theorem only applies to a continuous, smooth (physical -> there is some wiggle room here) space. When deriving the conservation of energy from Noether's theorem you basically say that your Lagrangian (which is just a set of equations that describes a physical system) is invariant over time. When you do that you automatically get that energy is conserved. Each invariant produces a conserved quantity as explained in parent comment when you apple a specific transformation that is supposed to not change the system (i.e remain invariant). Now in doing this you're also invoking the principle of least action (by using Lagrangians to describe the state of a physical system) but that is a separate topic. reply Cleonis 10 hours agorootparentprevIn retrospect: the earliest recognition of a conserved quantity was Kepler's law of areas. Isaac Newton later showed that Kepler's law of areas is a specific instance of a property that obtains for any central force, not just the (inverse square) law of gravity. About symmetry under change of orientation: for a given (spherically symmetric) source of gravitational interaction the amount of gravitational force is the same in any orientation. For orbital motion the motion is in a plane, so for the case of orbital motion the relevant symmetry is cilindrical symmetry with respect to the plane of the orbit. The very first derivation that is presented in Newton's Principia is a derivation that shows that for any central force we have: in equal intervals of time equal amounts of area are swept out. (The swept out area is proportional to the angular momentum of the orbiting object. That is, the area law anticipated the principle of conservation of angular momentum) A discussion of Newton's derivation, illustrated with diagrams, is available on my website: http://cleonis.nl/physics/phys256/angular_momentum.php The thrust of the derivation is that if the force that the motion is subject to is a central force (cilindrical symmetry) then angular momentum is conserved. So: In retrospect we see that Newton's demonstration of the area law is an instance of symmetry-and-conserved-quantity-relation being used. Symmetry of a force under change of orientation has as corresponding conserved quantity of the resulting (orbiting) motion: conservation of angular momentum. About conservation laws: The law of conservation of angular momentum and the law of conservation of momentum are about quantities that are associated with specific spatial characteristics, and the conserved quantity is conserved over time. I'm actually not sure about the reason(s) for classification of conservation of energy. My own view: we have that kinetic energy is not associated with any form of keeping track of orientation; the velocity vector is squared, and that squaring operation discards directional information. More generally, Energy is not associated with any spatial characteristic. Arguably Energy conservation is categorized as associated with symmetry under time translation because of absence of association with any spatial characteristic. reply chunky1994 17 hours agorootparentprevI'm a bit skeptical to give up conservation of energy in a system with friction. Isn't it more accurate to say that if we were to calculate every specific interaction we'd still end up having conservation of energy. Now whether or not we're dealing with a closed system etc becomes important but if we were to able to truly model the entire physical system with friction, we'd still adhere to our conservation laws. So they are not approximations, but are just terribly difficult calculations, no? Maybe I'm misunderstanding your point, but this should be true regardless of our philosophy of physics correct? reply nyrikki 15 hours agorootparentIt is an analogy stating that dissipative systems do not have a Lagrangian, Noether's work applies to Lagrangian systems Conservation laws in particular are measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. It is important to remember that Physics is about finding useful models that make useful predictions about a system. So it is important to not confuse the map for the territory. Gibbs free energy and Helmholtz free energy are not conserved. As thermodynamics, entropy, and entropy are difficult topics due to didactic half-truths, here is a paper that shows that the nbody problem becomes invariant and may be undecidable due to what is a similar issue (in a contrived fashion) http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13175/ While Noether's principle often allows you to see things that can often be simplified in an equation, often it allows you to not just simplify 'terribly difficult calculations' but to actually find computationally possible calculations. reply sdenton4 18 hours agorootparentprevA nice way to formulate (most) data augmentations is: a family of functions A = {a} such that our optimized neural network f obeys f(x) ~= f(a(x)). So in this case, we're explicitly defining the set of desired invariances. reply nurple 17 hours agoparentprevI think the most profound insight I've come across while studying this particular topic is the insight that information theory ended up being the answer to conserving the 2nd law with respect to Maxwell's demon thought experiment. Not to put too fine a point, but essentially the knowledge organized in the mind of the demon, about the particles in its system, was calculated to offset the creation of the energy gradient. I found the thinking of William Sidis to be particularly thought provoking perspective on Noether's benchmark work, in his paper The Animate and the Inanimate he posits--at a high level--that life is a \"reversal of the second law of thermodynamics\"; not that the 2nd law is a physical symmetry, but a mental one in an existence where energy reversibly flows between positive and negative states. Indeed, when considering machine learning, I think it's quite interesting to consider how the organizing of information/knowledge done during training in some real way mirrors the energy-creating information interred in the mind of Maxwell's demon. When taking into account the possible transitive benefits of knowledge organized via machine learning, and its attendant oracle through application, it's easy to see a world where this results in a net entropy loss, the creation of a previously non-existent energy gradient. In my mind this has interesting implications for Fermi's paradox as it seems to imply the inevitibility of the organization of information. Taken further into my own personal dogma, I think it's inevitable that we create--what we would consider--a sentient being as I believe this is the cycle of our own origin in the larger evolutionary timeline. reply Jerrrry 15 hours agorootparent>at a high level--that life is a \"reversal of the second law of thermodynamics\"; Life temporarily displaces entropy, locally.

Because it is. Randomness combined with a sieve, like a generator and a discriminator, like the primordial protein soup and our own existence as a selector, like chaos and order themselves, MAY - but DOES NOT have to - lead to temporary, localized areas of complexity, that we call 'life'. This \"energy gradient\" you speak of is literally gravity pulling baryonic matter foward thru space time. All work requires a temperature gradient - Hawking's musings on the second law of thermodynamics and your own intuition can reason why. >In my mind this has interesting implications for Fermi's paradox as it seems to imply the inevitibility of the organization of information.

In fact, because that symmetry does not include an action on the parameters of the layer, your conserved quantityshould hold whether or not the network is stationary for a loss.

Fascinating. Regarding the role of time, the idea of a purely conserved quantity is that it is conserved under the conditions of the system (that's why the article frequently references Newton's First Law), so they're generally held \"for all time that these symmetries exist in the system\". Specifically on time: the invariant for systems that exhibit continuous time symmetries (i.e. you move a little bit forward or backward in time and the system looks exactly the same) is energy. reply dustingetz 19 hours agorootparentHere's my ELI5 attempt of the time/energy relation: imagine a spring at rest (not moving) strike the spring, it's now oscillating the system now contains energy like a battery what is energy? it's stored work potential the battery is storing the energy, which can then be taken out at some future time the spring is transporting the energy through time in fact how do we measure time? with clocks.

This might be useful for a more rigorous approach to hyperparameter development, and maybe for characterizing the data being learned. We say that some datasets are harder to learn, or measure difficulty by the overall compute needed to hit a quality benchmark. Something more essential would be a step forward. Like in ANN backprop, the gradient descent algorithm can use a momentum to overcome getting stuck in local minima. This was heuristically physical when I learned it.. perhaps it's been developed since. Maybe only allowing a \"real\" energy to the momentum would then align it with an ability to do work calculation. Might also help with ensemble/monte carlo methods, to maintain an energy account across the ensemble. reply irchans 17 hours agoprevI liked the article and I hope that I can understand it more with some study. I think the following sentence in the article is wrong \"Applying Noether's theorem gives us three conserved quantities—one for each degree of freedom in our group of transformations—which turn out to be horizontal, vertical, and angular momentum.” I think the correct statement is \"Applying Noether's theorem gives us three conserved quantities—one for each degree of freedom in our group of transformations—which turn out to be translation, rotation, and time shifting.” I think translation leads to conservation of momentum, rotation leads to conservation of angular momentum, and time shifting leads to conservation of energy (potential+kinetic). It's been a few decades since I saw the proof, so I might be wrong. reply cgadski 16 hours agoparentHi, thanks! In that sentence I was only talking about the translations and rotations of the plane as a group of invariances for the action of the two-body problem. This group is generated by one-parameter subgroups producing vertical translation, horizontal translation, and rotation about a particular point. Those are the \"three degrees of freedom\" I was counting. You're right about the correspondence from symmetries to conservation laws in general. reply nostrademons 17 hours agoparentprevI think your last paragraph is correct, but the statement in the article is referring to the specific 2D 2-body example given, and its original phrasing is also correct. Translation, rotation, and time-shifting are transformations (matrices), not quantities. Horizontal, vertical, and angular (2D) momentum are scalars. The article is saying that if you take the action potential given in the example, there exist scalar quantities (which we call horizontal momentum, vertical momentum, and angular momentum) that remain constant regardless of any horizontal, vertical, or rotational transformation of the coordinate system used to measure the 2-body problem. reply kurthr 17 hours agoparentprevThe application of Noether's theorem in this case refers only to the energy integral shown (KE = ME - GPE for 2D Kinetic Mechanical and Gravitational Potential Energies) over time. It's really only for that particular 2 body 2 dimensional problem. More generically in 3 dimensions a transformation with 3 translational 2 rotational and 1 time independence would provide conservation of 3 momenta 2 angular momenta and 1 energy. reply chunky1994 17 hours agoparentprevRight, the rephrasing of the sentence is a tad more accurate.

The main problem I see with it is that most of the time you don't want the optimum for your objective function, as that frequently results in overfitting. this leads to things like early stopping being typical. reply cgadski 5 hours agoparentThanks so much! And yes, that's quite true. When parameter gradients don't quite vanish, then the equation=becomes=-where g_theta is the gradient with respect to theta. In defense of my hypothesis that interesting approximate conservation laws exist in practice, I'd argue that maybe parameter gradients at early stopping are small enough that the last term is pretty small compared to the first two. On the other hand, stepping back, the condition that our network parameters are approximately stationary for a loss function feels pretty... shallow. My impression of deep learning is that an optimized model _cannot_ be understood as just \"some solution to an optimization problem,\" but is more like a sample from a Boltzmann distribution which happens to concentrate a lot of its probability mass around _certain_ minimizers of an energy. So, if we can prove something that is true for neural networks simply because they're \"near stationary points\", we probably aren't saying anything very fundamental about deep learning. reply klysm 7 hours agoprevCompletely irrelevant but I love the way the color theme on this blog feels like a chalk board reply r34 19 hours agoprevAs a complete amateur I was wondering if it could be possible to use that property of light (\"to always choose the most optimal route\") to solve the traveling salesman problem (and the whole class of those problems as a consequence).

Abstract: Progress in machine learning (ML) stems from a combination of data availability, computational resources, and an appropriate encoding of inductive biases. Useful biases often exploit symmetries in the prediction problem, such as convolutional networks relying on translation equivariance. Automatically discovering these useful symmetries holds the potential to greatly improve the performance of ML systems, but still remains a challenge. In this work, we focus on sequential prediction problems and take inspiration from Noether's theorem to reduce the problem of finding inductive biases to meta-learning useful conserved quantities. We propose Noether Networks: a new type of architecture where a meta-learned conservation loss is optimized inside the prediction function. We show, theoretically and experimentally, that Noether Networks improve prediction quality, providing a general framework for discovering inductive biases in sequential problems. reply platz 19 hours agoprevhow do you direct what the network learns if it all comes from supervised learning training sets?

    "originBody": "That Time I Accidentally Deleted a Game From MAME Mar 1st, 2024 3:25 am Awhile back, I had the chance to dump a game for MAME. I told myself that if the chance ever came up again, I’d contribute again. Luckily, it turns out I didn’t have to wait too long—but the story didn’t end like I expected it to. When I bought my PGM arcade motherboard, the #1 game I wanted to own was a one-on-one fighting game called Martial Masters. It’s a deeply underrated, gorgeous game—and judging from the price it goes for these days, I’m not the only one after it. It took quite a bit of hunting until I found a copy within my price range but my usual PGM game dealer in China finally tracked down a copy to sell me a few months ago. I was excited to finally play it on the original hardware, but also to see if I had another chance to contribute a game to MAME. When it arrived, even before I had the chance to check the version number, I was surprised to see it was a Taiwanese region game. All of IGS’s games have simplified Chinese region variants for sale in China; it’s unusual to see a traditional Chinese version from Taiwan show up over there. It could just be a sign that the game was so popular they brought over extra cartridges from Taiwan when there weren’t enough for local arcades. Once I booted the game and made note of its version numbers, I checked MAME and saw that there was a matching game in its database: martmasttw, or a special Taiwanese version of revision 1.02. That also surprised me—IGS typically didn’t produce entirely separate builds for different regions. Instead, each of their games contains the data for every language and region in its ROMs, and the region code in its copy protection chip determines what region it boots up as. The other thing I noticed about MAME’s martmasttw was a comment in the source code noting that it might be a bad dump—that is, an invalid read that produced corrupted data. This isn’t that uncommon when dumping these sorts of games. Whether it’s due to dying chips or hardware issues with the reading process, sometimes a read just goes wrong and it gets missed. Once I booted it up in MAME, I confirmed it looked like a bad dump. It instantly crashes with an illegal instruction error, a clear sign of corrupted program code. Now that I owned the game, I had a chance to dump the correct ROMs and fix MAME’s database. As soon as I opened the cartridge, I noticed something interesting: these weren’t the chips I was expected. Like with The Gladiator, I only needed to remove and dump two socketed chips, but these were a completely different model. Other PGM games using the same hardware typically use 27C322 (4MB) and 27C160 (2MB) chips, which were common EPROMs in their time period. Here, though, I saw something much more exotic: an OKI 27C3202 soldered into a custom adapter. The game board itself is essentially the same one that’s in The Gladiator, so it was clear that the adapter was presenting them as 4MB 27C322 chips. I haven’t been able to figure out why it was designed this way. It can’t have been cheap to design and manufacture these custom adapters, and other PGM games that were made both before and after this one all use the more common chips without any adapters. I’ve only seen a single other game built this way. Was there a 27C322 shortage at the time this specific game was being made? Were they experimenting with new designs and ended up abandoning this approach? It’s hard to tell. I only have an EPROM reader adapter for chips in the 27C322 family, so I hoped it would would be able to handle reading them just fine. On my first attempt, it rejected it; as far as I can tell, it was trying to perform “smart” verification of the chip, which failed since the underlying chip underneath IGS’s adapter isn’t actually the chip it’s trying to query. I ultimately tricked it by inserting a real 27C322 first and reading that before swapping over to the chip I actually wanted to read. Once the reader’s recognized at least one chip, it seems happy to stick in 27C322 mode persistently. My first read seemed fine, and the dumped data did have a different hash from what MAME recognized. Success! …or so I thought, until I tried actually booting the game, where it crashed again. I went back to the EPROM reader to make sure the chip was seated correctly before doing a new test read. From the physical design of the adapters, I knew that getting it seated might be a challenge. The reader uses a ZIF socket which usually makes it easy to insert and remove chips. This time, though, there was an interesting complication. Because of how it’s constructed, the socket has a “lip” at the end past the final set of pins. With a normal 27C322, that’s not a problem; the chip ends right at the final set of pins, so nothing hangs over the end of the chip. This adapter has a very different shape from a real 27C322 chip, however—there’s a dangling “head” that contains the actual chip, as seen in the photo above showing the underside of the adapter. On the real board it hangs harmlessly over the end of the socket, but on a ZIF socket it ends up actually making contact with the end of the socket and keeps the pins from being able to sit as deeply as it would normally sit. I haven’t spoken to the person who originally dumped this revision, but I suspect that this is the issue behind the bad dump. I ended up holding the apdater with one hand to stabilize it and keep all of the pins as even as I could while I locked the ZIF socket’s lever a second time; this time, it seemed as though I’d been able to get it sitting as even as possible. I then performed several more reads and, before trying to boot it again, compared them against each other. This time, I saw that these new reads were different from the first attempt—and that they were byte-for-byte identical to each other. Once I had what seemed like good dump of both chips, I booted them up in MAME to see if it would work. Unlike MAME’s ROMs, it booted right away without issues and worked perfectly. After I played a few rounds without a single crash or unexpected behaviour, I was satisfied that my new dumps were fine. As I was getting ready to submit a pull request to MAME to update the hashes in its database, however, I happened to grep the source for them and noticed something funny—they were already there. In another version of Martial Masters. I mentioned earlier that I was surprised that MAME had labelled the Taiwanese 1.02 version of Martial Masters as a separate revision from the Chinese 1.02. Well, as it turns out, once the ROMs are dumped correctly it’s not a separate revision. The ROMs are actually byte-for-byte identical; it’s only the bad dump that had made MAME consider martmasttw a separate revision this whole time. This is the point where I’d intended to open a pull request to MAME just updating a few hashes for the correct dump, but with everything I’d learned the final pull request deleted martmasttw entirely. I had set out to fix a revision of the game in MAME, and make one more verison of it playable. Instead, I’d proven it didn’t exist in the first place. This wasn’t where I expected to end up, but it does teach an important lesson: corrupted data can go unnoticed for years if it’s not double and triple checked. And, more than that, it’s a reminder that databases are an eternal work in progress. MAME’s list of ROMs is also as close as there is to a global catalogue of arcade games and their revisions, but it’s still fallible. Databases grow and, sometimes, they shrink; proving a work doesn’t exist can be just as important as uncovering new works.

For anyone else: The lid of the PS had a small protusion which pressed down a button when the lid closed. The game could not be started with the lid open. So a piece of blu-tac was used to depress that button. The first thing the PS did when loading a game was to check somewhere on the game disc for some code. This code confirmed the disc was genuine so the trick was to put any genuine game in the drive, use the blu-tac, start the console and at a certain point, after the code had been read but before the game loaded and at that point pull the genuine disc and insert the pirate disc you had. reply slyn 12 hours agorootparentIt’s been ages so I don’t recall the exact details but you could pull a similar trick with the PS2 version of Guitar Hero to play custom songs on an unmodded console. You would burn a copy of the game with custom songs, insert and start a legit copy of the game, and then physically pull open the DVD tray and quickly replace the legit copy with the burned DVD at a specific time between when the PS2 had authenticated the disc as legit but before the game had actually loaded. It was a little finicky but with some practice it would work like 2/3rds of the time. reply kipchak 11 hours agorootparentYou could use a similar method to play burned PS2 disks using a Datel (of Action Replay fame) \"Swap Magic\" disc and a card to pull the tray out. the Swap disk appeared as a genuine PS2 disk with bad sectors, which would cause the drive motor to stop and give some time for the swap to occur. reply crtasm 10 hours agorootparentprevI got a dongle that plugged into the back and let me enter cheats, Action Replay style. It also happened to stop the CD spinning after it'd been confirmed as legitimate - swap at your leisure then press X to continue. reply dataflow 12 hours agorootparentprev> pull the genuine disc and insert the pirate disc you had Confused... so you'd pull out a spinning CD? And the insert one while the spindle was still spinning? And you'd do this safely, and fast enough that the game wouldn't have time to start reading the disc contents before the swap? And you'd do this every single time you're trying to play the game? This sounds pretty impossible to pull off without hurting yourself and damaging everything... what am I missing? reply ssl-3 9 hours agorootparentThe PSX's CD-ROM drive was a pretty sleepy thing compared to the screamers that came at peak CD-ROM in the PC space. The PSX's 2x drive can spin, at most, at about 1,000 RPM. There just isn't much momentum (kinetic energy) there. And IIRC, the wobble-track detection happened at 1x (or a maximum of about 500RPM). There was nothing particularly iffy about the hit-swapping with PSX's CD-ROM. It could have, at most, less than 0.2 Joules of stored kinetic energy. You can just put your finger on it and stop it with no particular danger. The PC drives, meanwhile, generally topped out at around 8,000RPM. That's getting into the realm of scary, with something in the realm of 64x the kinetic energy -- which is more energy than a rather competent air rifle might provide. (Beyond 8,000RPM, CDs often had disintegration issues, and exploding CD-ROMs were also sometimes reported at somewhat slower speeds. But at 500 or 1,000 RPM? Nah. It's a really boring amount of kinetic energy.) reply razodactyl 3 hours agorootparentYeah I've had CDs explode before. My sister was heavily into mixed tape burning with her friends. When I got a CD burner she used it all the time. I'm not sure on the why? But the tray eventually would eject with the CD still spinning? Bad braking system? You could hear the drive go nuts and speed up to weird speeds and one day a disc exploded inside. Remember the warnings about not inserting X format discs into Y drives. Does anyone know why this happens? reply dtech 12 hours agorootparentprevYou're severely underestimating the robustness of CD systems.

You can stop a spinning CD with a light touch of a finger. reply razodactyl 3 hours agorootparentprevYes. You may damage things if not careful but the PS1 disc has obvious feedback when the lid is open while reading the disc. When authenticating it slows down considerably then displays the PS logo screen. You would watch it slow down then speed up then slow down (happens for a few seconds) and you'd simply grab the disc and replace it. reply dataflow 3 hours agorootparentAh, thanks, this makes way more sense. reply spydum 12 hours agorootparentprevThey didn't spin that fast and it's not as sensitive as you think.

But it's certainly convenient for verifying a good dump. reply nubinetwork 44 minutes agoparentIt's pretty hard to calculate that checksum if you're writing homebrew, since the checksum is written to the rom file, which changes the checksum again... reply 0xcde4c3db 12 hours agoparentprevMost systems/formats/protocols were not robust against data corruption ca. 1990, so it might have been to detect corruption of the master copy in transit to the factory (whether that be via floppy, tape, EPROM, modem, etc.). reply mattl 14 hours agoparentprevMaybe for the Nintendo Power kiosks? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Power_(cartridge) reply actionfromafar 17 hours agoprevI read with dread waiting for the moment where the only chip in existence was accidentally destroyed.

But really a good dump but something else was wrong. It is why they keep bad dumps in there. Sometimes it is a resistor on the board tagging something in the code. I have one device that I do not think is in MAME yet. It has 4 games inside it. But it is sold as 4 different units and they just change the board config to make it boot different games. But the binary is the same on all 4 units. It is also good to go re-checking things. As new dumps show up sometimes. The problem people are starting to see though is MAME is see as a 'golden copy' and people are using it to make fixes/changes to real board. Then those boards end back up in the hands of people doing dumping and it becomes unsure if it is a verified dump or something else. Or people see the game in the list and say 'good enough' but it is actually a revision of the game. There is a whole site dedicated to that (not sure how up to date it is) unmamed. reply toast0 12 hours agorootparent> In this case it looks like it was marked bad dump. But really a good dump but something else was wrong. No, it sounds like it was a bad dump. This writer found that they were able to get a different bad dump from the same game, but then when they ensured good contact with the reader, they managed to get a good dump that was a duplicate of another rom. It seems that for this arcade system, the roms for Taiwan and Mainland China are usually the same, with some system board setting? triggering use of Traditional vs Simplified writing, but when the taiwainese packaged game was dumped with errors, it didn't match; when dumped properly, it does match the mainland rom. reply mewse-hn 18 hours agorootparentprevI'm presuming the title refers to the bad dump of the \"Taiwan romset\" being deleted from the MAME database, since the good dump is a dupe of the China romset. reply RichardCA 15 hours agoprevYes, there are many challenges in reverse engineering these classic games.

They aren't quite versioned like on mame, but if you don't use their special checksummed ROMs they will run, but try telling you that you have a bad dump... only problem is that most NES ROMs have bad headers altogether. (I've seen a lot that say they have 8k of battery-backed SRAM when they infact don't. I wound up spending a week rewriting the headers on my ROMs from scratch, referencing the pcb pictures online. Edit: this also includes bad Disk Dude overdumps that still haven't been fixed ~40 years later...) reply chungy 13 hours agoparentprevShort answer: They don't all need updating. Many of the most popular games go on for years without needing any updates, and usually if you already have settled on specific games and revisions thereof, you won't need to update. Longer answer: Every MAME update changes things, which includes adding, removing, and changing the definition of ROMs. Due especially to the nature of arcade games, there aren't convenient de facto wrapper formats (like, say, .nes or .sfc files), and MAME just defines each independent ROM as their own files, with MAME's own idea of what the names should be and accompanying sha1 hashes. If MAME developers/contributors have discovered that a game revision previously dumped was incorrect (as is the case in TFA), it might be replaced with a known good dump. In that case, you are expected to redump the game from your arcade board, this time the right way (or well, pirate the game, which most MAME users do...). It may seem annoying, but it's the nature of game preservation. It'll never be in a perfected and finished state. reply ksherlock 13 hours agoparentprevBased on dates in the merged ROM set I checked, there were 170 new/updated ROMs in MAME 0.263 (Feb 2024) and 90 for MAME 0.262 (Jan 2024). Those were from merged rom sets so every zip file has 1-20 individual ROMs inside The denominator here is 14,566 so that's 0.6% to 1.1% per month which is substantially less than all. These would mostly be ROMs for machines that weren't previously supported, replacing high level emulation with low level emulation, new ROM dumps, and replacing bad dumps. reply ZFH 12 hours agoparentprev [–] I agree it's not optimal. It's not like every game changes on every MAME release, but some indeed get re-dumped from time to time. The usual example is encrypted audio data or color palette ROMs. In an earlier version, lacking the ability to decrypt them they would be emulated with samples or code respectively, then once it's possible to dump them they get integrated into the romset for better accuracy. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

If you can trust that every package in JSR has types then you avoid/simplify that current cycle of: npm install a package, find out it doesn't have types, try to install a package of the same name with @types/ in front of it, find out it doesn't exist, look for an alternative library with types or write your own types or give up and `declare module \"thatpackagename\"` any-type it. 2. Just because \"most\" production websites do bundling doesn't mean that needs to still be the status quo in 2024. Bundling is increasingly a \"premature optimization\" and you might not need it. It can be worth investigating if your site/app works well enough with just ESM delivered straight to browsers in 2024 versus what you \"gain\" from bundling. You might be surprised at how well current browsers can load ESM and the optimizations they already do for you. But even if you do still need bundling ESM is a huge advantage over other formats (especially CommonJS) and every current bundler produces better, more optimized output the more ESM you provide. Their outputs also increasingly look like ESM, and if that isn't the current default it is the \"soon\" default. esbuild in particular (which also backs some of vite's tools and others) has an ESM bundle output that is delightful, isn't yet the default (\"soon\") but is a simple \"format\" switch away. Those ESM bundles are great in today's browsers. ESM matters a lot to bundlers, bundlers are increasingly ESM in their internals and output. Browsers are great with ESM. The \"web-standard\" part is pretty meaningful today and getting stronger. reply wruza 15 hours agorootparentWhere can one read up on [2.]? reply WorldMaker 14 hours agorootparentI got into some details on how I do light-weight apps (especially during development) without bundling in a nearby comment as well: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39564986 To resummarize: sometimes it is fine to prune and ship node_modules to your web server, you can use import maps to handle \"node-style 'bare' imports\", and you may only need to \"spot bundle\" to ESM a single dependent library or two that doesn't ship ESM that will directly work in the browser (which should be a decreasing list). After that it's a matter of using your browser's Dev Tools to tell you what your performance looks like and where your bottlenecks are. That can tell you a lot to help you determine if you really need to bundle more of your site/app or if you can spot-bundle/adjust an import map for just a specific sub-graph. With HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 the \"per-file\" \"penalty\" is a lot less, though still somewhat exists. Even some properly configured HTTP/1.1 servers it is not always as bad as history tells us it was (properly configured HTTP/1.1 did support some connection sharing). About the only remaining thing a bundle might buy you on HTTP/2+ is maybe better behavior with compression on the bundle as a single whole, but even that isn't a given because Brotli's dictionary was designed to work at the whole connection level and that's often the default compression in HTTP/2+. But again, your conditions may vary based on your real code and the specific servers and browsers you need to support, so leverage your browser Dev Tools and check the real numbers. reply mhagemeister 18 hours agoparentprev> This makes the already complicated module resolution logic in most bundler/packaging tools even more complicated as they must account for the intricacies of another package manager. A house of cards being stacked on another house of cards... JSR is a registry, not a package manager. npm allows you to add multiple registries and JSR provides an npm API endpoint. From npm's point of view packages coming from JSR are the same as those coming from the npm registry itself. The only difference is where the package is coming from, but all semver resolution, etc are done as usual by whatever package manager you use.

My only thing is that TypeScript has no spec, standard, or competing implementations so it seems a bit risky to treat it as a first-class citizen as far as publishing packages goes. Add to that the frequent compilation issues that happen as TypeScript adds or removes types in the global imports, changes language conventions, and updates compilation checks whenever a new version gets released. reply lucacasonato 18 hours agorootparentLook at the comment under the comment you mention - those issues are about the TS type system, NOT the TS syntax.

TypeScript itself will ship with a new `isolatedDeclarations` option in the next release which is the same thing. The point is that no inference other than simple literal inference needs to be done to get the type of the public API.

I understand this. The problem is the following: npm is owned by GitHub/Microsoft, and GitHub/Microsoft does not care about npm. To GitHub, npm is a cost center. npm has no dedicated product manager at GitHub. Last I heard, npm has _two_ dedicated engineers working on it. The last real new feature npm shipped was package provenance (last year). It took npm 5 years to ship the file browser (because GitHub/Microsoft did not care about npm, and thus effectively froze all feature dev work on npm). If we want innovation in the space, we need to do it in a way that a) keeps backwards compat with npm (which JSR does, both ways), but b) we need to move away from npm in the long term. JSR is an attempt at this (while trying to stay within the constraints posed). reply m3h 17 hours agorootparentThank you. I stand corrected on some points. The messy ecosystem of npm, yarn, pnpm, JS, TS, ES, and ESM has all cost me a good amount of white hair. A good source of my confusion came with not immediately recognizing that a new package registry does not require a new package manager to work with. I think the \"jsr\" commands in the code samples and the jsr.json make it feel like there's a new package manager in play here. If the team has made it so that npm works with \"jsr\" and vice versa, kudos to them because that's a big win for the users. reply AgentME 8 hours agorootparentAs far as I can tell, the \"npx jsr add @luca/flag\" command given for using JSR with Node itself calls \"npm i @luca/flag@npm:@jsr/luca__flag\" and is equivalent.

It looks like JSR re-publishes all of its packages translated into JS + .d.ts files onto npm under the @jsr scope.

Looks like it does indeed: > Unlike with native JSR imports, you are not directly importing TypeScript code. Instead JSR transpiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript before it is installed into your node_modules directory.

So yes, you'll need to use the npm compatibility layer if you don't use Deno, but those are the only supported use case.

Side rant: not at all a fan of the decision to punish libraries (\"slow types\") that use type inference by reducing their score. reply kwhinnery 16 hours agoparentIn terms of \"when you would use it\" - it doesn't necessarily solve a different problem than npm. I think it arguably solves the same problem more effectively (though it is certainly early days and npm still does a lot of things JSR doesn't). I also don't know that we're segmenting the ecosystem, as JSR packages interoperate with npm packages, and you can use one from the other. JSR will end up being additive to npm. For module authors, we're hoping JSR will be helpful in the following ways: 1.) You can develop and publish TypeScript source, and let JSR handle transpilation and generating .d.ts files for runtimes that don't natively support TypeScript. Especially nice if you are using Deno or Bun (that do natively support TypeScript), and don't have tsc in your workflow otherwise. 2.) JSR generates API docs for you on your package page based on your source code and comments. 3.) JSR has a great DX around publishing packages from GitHub Actions using OIDC (no juggling tokens) 4.) JSR automatically provides provenance for published versions of packages For module consumers, it helps too: 1.) Compatible with both Deno and existing npm-based projects 2.) Package info and docs provided centralized on the jsr.io site 3.) Quality scores that encourage authors to make their packages fast and well documented 4.) Access to TypeScript source for packages (not just transpiled output) Absolutely more to be done, but we're hoping that JSR will provide enough extra value to both module authors and consumers that both will prefer to use it when possible. reply simpaticoder 15 hours agorootparentSounds like a good value prop. One thing that I'm hoping is to reduce dependency on a single private company, npm inc., in publishing and distributing modules. But you didn't list this as a value prop.

Do you feel that using type inference doesn't actually reduce performance, or just that it's not a big enough problem to warrant a reduced score? reply mhagemeister 3 hours agorootparentThe performance of type inference matters for runtimes which work with TypeScript files directly, rather then using the transpiled .js + .d.ts files like Deno. This has several benefits in that we can jump to the source on \"go to definition\" rather than some random .d.ts file among other things. Deno uses the original TS files for type checking as well and that's why inference also affects type checking performance in some runtimes. By ensuring explicit return types in the public API, the generation of .d.ts files is turned into a mere syntax transform, rather than requiring the tsc compiler. This is something TypeScript will ship with in the next release itself. They're adding a new `isolatedDeclarations` option which is the same thing. reply lakpan 7 hours agorootparentprevType inference in dependencies does not reduce performance for users, but just for JSR. Here they’re going “the Google way” by adding some random metric that benefits them, not users.

We have reserved some obvious scope names already, but in the future, we'd likely entertain requests to reassign ownership of scopes for the benefit of the broader user community (as in the case of a brand owner requesting ownership of their brand name). So in the case that a user published \"@cocacola/foo\", previously published versions of \"@cocacola/foo\" would remain available indefinitely (unless they were found to be malicious), but we would likely be willing to assign ownership of the \"@cocacola\" scope to a representative from that brand/company if they asked for it and we could verify their identity.

However, as we observed their usage in the wild, a couple problems became clear: 1.) Duplicated dependencies - projects would often download multiple versions of the same dependency, because there was no deduplication happening based on semantic versions. 2.) Disappearing dependencies - under some circumstances, an HTTPS import URL would be unavailable, causing code dependent on these modules to break. A central package repository could solve for both of these problems. We considered (and very nearly chose) to just use npm, but it introduced functional and UX problems we wanted to solve for users.

As for deno, I think if you publish ESM you’re mostly covered since deno can install from the npm registry. reply j-krieger 18 hours agoparentprevYou can't, and for good reason. Deno has slightly different API's than Node. Bun also has subtle differences between their STL implementation and Node's, but afaik, they're getting there. reply apitman 18 hours agorootparentI think maybe I was unclear. I'm talking about writing libraries that abstract across these differences and provide a single API, as sibling describes. I already know it's possible. I made a simple filesystem abstraction here[0] and a very simple HTTP library that uses it here[1]. They both work in Node/Deno and the browser. Unfortunately I ran into issues with Bun's slice implementation[2], but that should be fixed eventually. My overall question is that I suspect there's a much better way of detecting and using the different backends, and I'm wondering what techniques are out there.

Reading the title (\"JSR: The JavaScript Registry\" at the time of writing) I had high hopes this might be what I'm looking for: Dependency management for JavaScript in the browser. It's something entirely different. I tried to look for something lately that: 1. Makes it easy to download specified versions of JS libs. 2. Exposes these libs as proper ES6 modules. I get why (2) is a bit tricky, it'd be fantastic but more of a nice to have anyway. I don't really get why there's no popular tool for (1) yet. Sure, I can just fetch the files I want from a CDN and commit them to a vendor directory, or I can write a little script that downloads them from a CDN. Or hey, I can fetch frontend dependencies via NPM and have a script that builds/copies the stuff. But that's a bit much labour for something that I thought would be a relatively common requirement. Am I in the minority to occasionally want to build web apps _without_ bundlers? Being able to skip the build step is very powerful both for keeping things simple and turnaround times fast, IMHO. reply lucacasonato 18 hours agoparent> Exposes these libs as proper ES6 modules.

It's probably \"huge\" so you probably want to clean out dev dependencies first (`npm prune --omit=dev` is one way to clean that) and you might find it useful to search for big binaries to filter out and redundant directories that you don't need (libraries that still include all of UMD and CommonJS and ESM builds even though you only need one), and there may still be libraries that don't directly load in the browser and you need to spot bundle with a tool like esbuild to a vendor directory. Mostly the only other glue you need after that is an import map. I find this flow useful (ship an optionally pruned node_modules, spot build specific vendor libraries, add import map), especially for lightweight development/testing, and so I did document it specifically from start to finish for one of my libraries (which is sort of a \"framework\"), it includes a vendor build one-liner: https://worldmaker.net/butterfloat/#/getting-started?id=setu...

Someone else who checks out your code will get different results. I was hoping for something like Go’s minimum version dependency resolution. A lock file does solve the immediate issue. reply lakpan 7 hours agorootparent> Someone else who checks out your code will get different results. > I was hoping for something like Go’s minimum version dependency resolution. Uh and that’s different how? The default semver range is “minimum dependency version” with an upper bound in the current major. reply darepublic 17 hours agoprevOne solution to the package dependency swamp is to make a project with little to no dependencies? I'm rambling but I would curious to experiment with an approach where, when I needed a bit of code to solve a problem the \"package manager\" (more like code procurer) would just find a snippet of code I need, perhaps reference it's origin, perhaps add related unit tests and then I would copy paste it into my own code base. reply apitman 16 hours agoparentI've experimented[0] with something along these lines. The basic idea is that it's desirable to be able to reuse snippets/functions across projects, but you shouldn't need to go full left-pad. So basically you run tuplates.py on your project, it goes through all files and any line comment that includes \"tuplate_start(URI)\" it goes out and fetches the URI (local filesystem or HTTP supported), and replaces everything until it finds a line comment with \"tuplate_end\". Nice thing is it enables basic templating in any language, and instead of checking templates into source control, you're committing working code. Also combines really nicely with jsdelivr where you can import specific versions of files directly from GitHub. [0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/tuplates reply cumwolf 17 hours agoparentprevi think this could function in a small project scenario and i like the idea. Don't think that would be super maintainable in larger enterprise applications.

Can’t wait to use it) but the fact that we still have a “node_modules” folder as a standard for the ecosystem. This sucks. I get it. I know why. Node is king. However there are other runtimes out there that use this pattern simply because they don’t want to reinvent a package management system (I’m with them on this) but have to use “node_modules” as their module folder simply for compatibility. I decided not to follow suit and use @modules instead. :P I like JSR, and this in no way reflects my opinion of js,ts,jsr, or you all. I just think it’s time to move on from some dahl-isms (decisions made while getting node production ready). reply franky47 20 hours agoprevI get their stance on TypeScript \"exported types must be explicit and not use inference\", but I feel like this is going to cause a lot of friction in adoption. reply lucacasonato 19 hours agoparent1. You can bypass slow types checks during publishing. You will just get a lower JSR score. 2. TypeScript is shipping features in the next release (TS 5.5) has quick-fixes in the editor to make it super easy to add explicit types :) The TS feature is called `isolatedDeclarations` reply dragomirtitian 19 hours agorootparentI would just like to add some of my findings around the developer friction with isolated declarations. The whole reason isolated declarations is taking so long is because we also worry about making the requirements of this too onerous. To this end with isolated declarations, you do have to specify most types, but not all. For expression where we can reasonably infer the type from local context, we do so. This should ease some of the developer friction. Not all of it. Some things will not be inferrable, but things like primitive types, object literals, tuples will be so it should make it easier. We also worked on a code fixer that adds explicit type annotations where this new flag would raise an error, again to help people migrate if they choose to do so. reply dsherret 18 hours agoparentprevTo be clear for people reading wondering what this is about, this is only a hard recommendation for the public API types. The reason for it, is by adding explicit types to the boundary of your package, the package becomes way faster for users to type check because every user's machine doesn't need to do all the inference work and type check internal types or packages not related to the types. Additionally, it makes the published code more resilient to changes to TypeScript's inference in the future because it's not doing inference. It also becomes way easier to generate documentation for the package (also, the ability to generate .d.ts or bundled .d.ts files without a type checker becomes easier). Right now, the publish command errors and asks you to fix the issues or bypass it entirely via `--allow-slow-types`. In the future there will be a `--fix` flag to write the explicit types for you. reply smusamashah 14 hours agoprevIs there a similar site but for browser only javascript libraries?

Most READMEs worth a damn should tell you how to use their libraries without npm if possible. Unfortunately, a lot of library authors suck. reply lakpan 6 hours agorootparentUnpkg just serves the raw files, which may contain require() calls or import from other npm packages. That won’t work.

They're essentially mirrors of NPM but they automatically bundle packages up and serve it via http like a normal web JS file. Some things still won't work because they rely on some server side library, like loading files or something, but you won't want those for web development anyway. You might also find that some libraries don't handle being included as a script very well, but you can instead use the import statement and that will probably work better - useand inside that use import something from \"\". For production usage this isn't ideal because you're not as in control of the code you're depending on, it's less reliable, and it's more requests than if you just bundled everything together, but not everything needs to be for production usage! reply mhagemeister 3 hours agoparentprevI think you're looking for esm.sh .

JSR already stands for \"Java Specification Request\" which is basically an RFC or standard for Java (not JavaScript). This is going to make Google searches even more difficult. Searching for Java jobs and getting JavaScript jobs is already bad enough. This name is just making a big mess with semantic name collision in our mental namespaces.

I very much like the added TypeScript support (which the standard NPM registry does not have.) and that it's open-source. I'll see about getting my packages uploaded onto here, too -- just having built-in support for TypeScript makes packaging x100 easier. Regarding NPM, it's absolutely insane that we've been depending upon a closed-source, monolithic nightmare with poor UX for so long. You can't even use comments in package.json -- overall, it feels like a holdover we haven't figured out how to replace. Furthermore, it's scary that Microsoft, through GitHub, now hold so much power over the JavaScript industry -- enshittification will most likely ensue. reply seniorsassycat 17 hours agoparentI'm not sure jsr fixes comments in package.json, and I wouldn't blame npm for the miss feature. package.json is used at runtime by node.js and strictly parsed as json. Npm or just could strip comments on publish, but local development of the package would break. Not sure if bun or demo use pjson at runtime or if they allow comments.

Why reinvent the wheel when you have a perfectly good one that's beed around for 12 years and is proven in production? reply WorldMaker 15 hours agorootparentprevTechnically ES did introduce types already: in the \"lost version\" ES4. Typescript's syntax was partially inspired from ES4 and while not \"compatible\" with the previous type system there is more compatibility in the syntax than you might expect. The Type Annotations [0] proposal that TC-39 (in charge of ES standardization) has kept in front of them (at Stage 1 so far) takes the \"Python approach\" of standardizing the syntax but not the type system still leaving that to external tools (in part because of the lessons from the mistakes of ES4 and the type system that was standardized but never really adopted). The proposal basically assumes that most types will (still) be in the Typescript type system (and would still need Typescript or compatible tool to type check) and maximal (but not complete) compatibility with Typescript syntax is a goal of the proposal. But you don't don't have to take my word on that, the FAQ at the bottom of that Type Annotations proposal is well written and quite detailed. [0] https://github.com/tc39/proposal-type-annotations reply ascorbic 22 minutes agorootparentI used ActionScript 3 back in the noughties and was so excited for ES4 in the browser. Adobe open-sourcing Tamarin made it seem it was a done deal (I didn't follow the politics). I was so disappointed when it was killed.

The proposal might have compat types with TS but what about all the other TS features like generics. Now more than ever, it seems risky to bet the house on TS. reply digging 17 hours agorootparentprevIs that a good reason to write in raw JS today? I'm not betting anything on TypeScript. It was released 11 years ago, and it's incredibly valuable to me. If it takes another 5 years for ES to implement first-class types, and it's a good implementation, I'll start using ES for new work at that time. What's lost here? TS won't just stop compiling. reply pier25 16 hours agorootparentI'm not referring to end users like yourself but projects like Deno who have invested a fair amount of resources into supporting TS. reply digging 15 hours agorootparentOh, yes, that makes more sense. Still, native typing is not even on the horizon for ES, so I think my point stands for businesses that are heavily invested in supporting TS. TS is what we need today, it doesn't make sense to ignore it because theoretically it could be obsolete in 5-10 years. reply usrusr 19 hours agoparentprevConsumers don't touch any ts, outside the (technically optional) .d.ts Thecwayvi understand it in theory, the typescript version a library uses could disappear forever the day after a library had been published to JSR and all would be fine. Until someone wants to maintain the code of course, but then you'd have the exact same problem with the elusive typescript version if the repository only took compile output. What JSR would break (or make a deliberately difficult path?) is using some private fork of typescript that isn't even available on the day of publication. The benefit of JSR, as far as I understand it, is offering an easy path to publication that makes type parts not an extra that some might skip but a reliable default. It does make me wonder however, how long-term reliable the finding will be: JSR promises more service than registries before, while also being more tool agnostic. I'm not sure if it's true, but my impression was that in many cases, the registry was primarily bankrolled by however the tooling was funded, e.g. effectively becoming a marketing expense to selling tooling expertise. JSR appears particularly removed from any of that and it's bad enough when the repository fades away in terms of static hosting, it's worse if it also leaves your library without a build process. reply addtej 17 hours agoprevI didn't understand the purpose of this even after browsing the site. reply wiseowise 18 hours agoprev> JSR isn't a replacement for the npm registry Shame. reply laluneodyssee 18 hours agoprevNot to sound overly critical but what value is Featured PackagesNew Packages etc...? reply lucacasonato 18 hours agoparentPRs welcome: https://github.com/jsr-io/jsr reply evbogue 19 hours agoprevCan JSR also be used as a CDN for browser module imports? reply kwhinnery 19 hours agoparentNot yet, but esm.sh mentions they have experimental support now to check out: https://twitter.com/jexia_/status/1762516242626416750 reply hamuraijack 18 hours agoprevObligatory xkcd reference. https://xkcd.com/927/ reply xalava 18 hours agoprev [–] _ s reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "title": "FastUI: Python-Powered Fast Web UI Building",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/pydantic/FastUI",
    "originBody": "FastUI Please note: FastUI is still an active work in progress, do not expect it to be complete. The Principle (short version) You can see a simple demo of an application built with FastUI here. FastUI is a new way to build web application user interfaces defined by declarative Python code. This means: If you're a Python developer — you can build responsive web applications using React without writing a single line of JavaScript, or touching npm. If you're a frontend developer — you can concentrate on building magical components that are truly reusable, no copy-pasting components for each view. For everyone — a true separation of concerns, the backend defines the entire application; while the frontend is free to implement just the user interface At its heart, FastUI is a set of matching Pydantic models and TypeScript interfaces that allow you to define a user interface. This interface is validated at build time by TypeScript and pyright/mypy and at runtime by Pydantic. The Practice — Usage FastUI is made up of 4 things: fastui PyPI package — Pydantic models for UI components, and some utilities. While it works well with FastAPI it doesn't depend on FastAPI, and most of it could be used with any python web framework. @pydantic/fastui npm package — a React TypeScript package that lets you reuse the machinery and types of FastUI while implementing your own components @pydantic/fastui-bootstrap npm package — implementation/customisation of all FastUI components using Bootstrap @pydantic/fastui-prebuilt npm package (available on jsdelivr.com CDN) providing a pre-built version of the FastUI React app so you can use it without installing any npm packages or building anything yourself. The Python package provides a simple HTML page to serve this app. Here's a simple but complete FastAPI application that uses FastUI to show some user profiles: from datetime import date from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse from fastui import FastUI, AnyComponent, prebuilt_html, components as c from fastui.components.display import DisplayMode, DisplayLookup from fastui.events import GoToEvent, BackEvent from pydantic import BaseModel, Field app = FastAPI() class User(BaseModel): id: int name: str dob: date = Field(title='Date of Birth') # define some users users = [ User(id=1, name='John', dob=date(1990, 1, 1)), User(id=2, name='Jack', dob=date(1991, 1, 1)), User(id=3, name='Jill', dob=date(1992, 1, 1)), User(id=4, name='Jane', dob=date(1993, 1, 1)), ] @app.get(\"/api/\", response_model=FastUI, response_model_exclude_none=True) def users_table() -> list[AnyComponent]: \"\"\" Show a table of four users, `/api` is the endpoint the frontend will connect to when a user visits `/` to fetch components to render. \"\"\" return [ c.Page( # Page provides a basic container for components components=[ c.Heading(text='Users', level=2), # renders `Users` c.Table( data=users, # define two columns for the table columns=[ # the first is the users, name rendered as a link to their profile DisplayLookup(field='name', on_click=GoToEvent(url='/user/{id}/')), # the second is the date of birth, rendered as a date DisplayLookup(field='dob', mode=DisplayMode.date), ], ), ] ), ] @app.get(\"/api/user/{user_id}/\", response_model=FastUI, response_model_exclude_none=True) def user_profile(user_id: int) -> list[AnyComponent]: \"\"\" User profile page, the frontend will fetch this when the user visits `/user/{id}/`. \"\"\" try: user = next(u for u in users if u.id == user_id) except StopIteration: raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"User not found\") return [ c.Page( components=[ c.Heading(text=user.name, level=2), c.Link(components=[c.Text(text='Back')], on_click=BackEvent()), c.Details(data=user), ] ), ] @app.get('/{path:path}') async def html_landing() -> HTMLResponse: \"\"\"Simple HTML page which serves the React app, comes last as it matches all paths.\"\"\" return HTMLResponse(prebuilt_html(title='FastUI Demo')) Which renders like this: Of course, that's a very simple application, the full demo is more complete. Components FastUI already defines a rich set of components. All components are listed in the demo app. The Principle (long version) FastUI is an implementation of the RESTful principle; but not as it's usually understood, instead I mean the principle defined in the original PhD dissertation by Roy Fielding, and excellently summarised in this essay on htmx.org (HTMX people, I'm sorry to use your article to promote React which I know you despise 🙏). The RESTful principle as described in the HTMX article is that the frontend doesn't need to (and shouldn't) know anything about the application you're building. Instead, it should just provide all the components you need to construct the interface, the backend can then tell the frontend what to do. Think of your frontend as a puppet, and the backend as the hand within it — the puppet doesn't need to know what to say, that's kind of the point. Building an application this way has a number of significant advantages: You only need to write code in one place to build a new feature — add a new view, change the behavior of an existing view or alter the URL structure Deploying the front and backend can be completely decoupled, provided the frontend knows how to render all the components the backend is going to ask it to use, you're good to go You should be able to reuse a rich set of opensource components, they should end up being better tested and more reliable than anything you could build yourself, this is possible because the components need no context about how they're going to be used (note: since FastUI is brand new, this isn't true yet, hopefully we get there) We can use Pydantic, TypeScript and JSON Schema to provide guarantees that the two sides are communicating with an agreed schema In the abstract, FastUI is like the opposite of GraphQL but with the same goal — GraphQL lets frontend developers extend an application without any new backend development; FastUI lets backend developers extend an application without any new frontend development. Beyond Python and React Of course, this principle shouldn't be limited to Python and React applications — provided we use the same set of agreed schemas and encoding to communicate, we should be able to use any frontend and backend that implements the schema. Interchangeably. This could mean: Implementing a web frontend using another JS framework like Vue — lots of work, limited value IMHO Implementing a web frontend using an edge server, so the browser just sees HTML — lots of work but very valuable Implementing frontends for other platforms like mobile or IOT — lots of work, no idea if it's actually a good idea? Implementing the component models in another language like Rust or Go — since there's actually not that much code in the backend, so this would be a relatively small and mechanical task",

I know a lot of backend developers who are backend developers specifically because they don't enjoy frontend work and prefer to leave that work to people who actually enjoy it. And I know a lot of frontend developers who feel the same way, only from the other side. The tagline of FastUI is \"Build Better UIs Faster,\" but I think this will likely end up being \"Build Passable UIs Faster,\" because yes, for simple cases, you can represent HTML components as Python or Javascript or whatever other language you want, but once you need to build something complex on the frontend, it becomes very irritating very fast when you have to work like this -- and good luck getting your frontend buddies to help you, because now they have to get up to speed on a new framework to understand what it's doing. reply anonzzzies 17 minutes agoparent> to build something complex on the frontend But, unlike frontend devs, designers and product managers believe these complex things are needed, they almost never are and actually bring a lot of issues with them instead. I rarely see a complex component/combination (in a SaaS, let alone on some landing/public page) and think, \"well, that adds real value over just a standard component\". If you can point some out, please do; there are very obvious cases where something else than standard is needed, but that also depends on your definition of standard; if I can buy complex off the shelve somewhere, you are not building something complex in the frontend and so you can use simple means to hook them up without the complexity. reply whazor 1 hour agoparentprevYou would be surprised how far a company can get with a Django admin for customer service or sales teams. reply devjab 2 hours agoparentprevI’m primarily a backend developer these days, because that’s just how it’s played out where I work. But we’ve made the choice to do most things with Typescript since it lets us share resources, libraries and cooperate better with code reuse/reviews and such. So I can fairly easily switch to working on our React frontend, what I can’t do, is to make quick frontends for the services which will sort of need an “excel” type frontend. We even have a fairly generic component for it, but it very rarely does the job because our business is… well demanding things they might not really need. This looks like a good thing. In that regard. Maybe not for us, but definitely a very useful tool for all developers because it can potentially let you deliver business value rapid. Which is what I read from the lines you quote. I see no backend vs frontend discussion here, I only see a useful tool. Even if you want to eventually build it into your React frontend, a tool like this will offer immense value for internal testing by users who won’t be able to do it through something like Postman, which is basically 99% of the employees in non-tech enterprise. reply manojlds 1 hour agoparentprevYeah for this kind of simple UIs fast I might as well use something like Streamlit. Edit - someone who has built with this has commented that they found things snappier than using Streamlit https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39568486 reply bornfreddy 2 hours agoparentprevThis. In my experience frontend is not for everybody. There is a reason why FE and BE are often separated - because it makes sense in most non-trivial apps. Related, I never understood the appeal of isomorphic apps either. It's not like the code for UI and data access is very similar. reply regularfry 34 minutes agorootparentIt looks to me like FastUI is literally the BFF pattern with a pre-supplied front-end. If that's true, then complaints about it should be viewed through the lens of who has control over the application, who is gaining control, and who is losing it. I've had quite vocal arguments from front-end devs which, when we stripped back what they were actually complaining about, came down to the front end being in service of the back end, rather than vice versa as they were used to. reply xtagon 6 hours agoparentprevInterestingly, you could accomplish a similar thing with GraphQL if the frontend uses the type introspection GraphQL provides and the backend graphql schema implements HATEOAS-like principles to let the frontend become a UI that's agnostic to different backends. That might not be how most GraphQL implementations are used, but it's kind of a cool pattern. reply ipaddr 5 hours agorootparentThe kind of site that gets all of their data stolen.

Remember how you could just \"add\" a database connection to your project, plop a data source on a form, then a datagrid or a bunch of text/check/comboboxes and the standard control, wire it all up in a couple clicks, and things just magically worked?

Bad language and horrible ecosystem :D Seriously, I first tried it in 2013, used it for work from 2014-2016 and here and there for odd projects later, and the amount of churn and complexity of the ecosystem has been surprising every time I check back on it. My Obj-C from even longer ago pretty much all runs fine and is fairly understandable even for most iOS devs who started after Swift was the default. reply krawczstef 9 hours agoprevWe built an app with it -- https://blog.dagworks.io/p/building-a-lightweight-experiment. You can see the code here https://github.com/DAGWorks-Inc/hamilton/blob/main/hamilton/.... Usually we've been prototyping with streamlit, but found that at times to be clunky. FastUI still has rough edges, but we made it work for our lightweight app. Note: we generally found it snappier than streamlit. reply japhyr 9 hours agoparentCan you share anything specific about what was clunky/ not snappy about streamlit? I've been exploring streamlit, and it took a little bit to figure out how to use it well, and deploy it appropriately. reply elijahbenizzy 8 hours agorootparentOn the same team — I’ve really enjoyed strsmlkt and built an app (that made it to the HN front page!) https://share.streamlit.io/-/auth/app?redirect_uri=https%3A%.... That said, I’ve found it to be clunky in a few ways: 1. State management is not intuitive — anything that involves rendering complex state/reacting at it changes requires a ton of session state type stuff. 2. I’ve very often had to go into css/markdown hacks 3. The control flow of when it’s running/executing makes for clunky interactions 4. Some API decisions are painful. For instance, a block str comment in the file will render as st.write 5. Long running (or even not instant tasks) make for some annoying engineering challenges — the UI is tied to the compute, so you have to be smart about juggling it 6. Caching is not smart — it’s quite useful, but it’s easy to get lost in caching/state I’ve been dreaming about streamlit but a little more state/function oriented. E.g. react-based. Not far from fastUI These are both great tools for prototyping, but I’ve found that I’ll pull up tailwind + some UI framework when I want something slick and it’ll take a few times as long. reply jairuhme 7 hours agorootparentThe first point you made is what myself and my team have struggled with. We have built simple apps for customers to upload a document to interact with and having the state be accurate to the document that the user uploaded was a major pain. Felt easier at that point to build something from scratch than to keep messing around with streamlit's session states reply jcheng 1 hour agorootparentWould you consider giving Shiny (for Python) a try? https://shiny.posit.co/py/ It's (I hope) pretty close to Streamlit in ease of use for getting started, but reactive programming runs all the way through it. The kind of app you're talking about are extremely natural to write in Shiny, you don't have to keep track of state yourself at all. If you decide to give it a try and have trouble, please email me (email in profile) or drop by the Discord (https://discord.gg/yMGCamUMnS). reply spinningslate 3 minutes agorootparentHaven't used Shiny on Python yet, but we use the R version a lot. It's been a good experience: solid, reliable framework, good set of widgets, decent styling out the box. The Python version is a port from its R stablemate (well, maybe more than a port: a re-engineering). If it's as solid as its R parent then it'll be a very useful addition to the Python UI landscape. enoch2090 6 hours agorootparentprevStreamlit's state management is so painful, feels like constantly writing hacks. reply PufPufPuf 10 hours agoprevThis isn't a new concept, other examples include Solara (React-based) and NiceGUI (Vue-based).

Gonna check it out. reply qudat 9 hours agoprevIt seems the big selling point is building websites without JS. To each their own but typescript is one of the best programming languages I’ve used.

I wrote a post recently about how I feel like this loathing of all things FE/JS is overblown: https://bower.sh/front-end-complexity reply petesergeant 7 hours agoparentI love TypeScript, and I think React is mostly very elegant, and I still find front end work to be a real chore. Fucking around with forms and CSS and responsive breakpoints is not my idea of a good time! reply 8n4vidtmkvmk 4 hours agorootparentYou shouldn't need breakpoints 98% of the time. Use flex box and grid. Failing that, try container queries. A really good form is still a PITA.

Much like Pydantic, good use of TypeScript types involves shape validation on input. (I have worse news for you about C or C++ or anything that isn't typed exclusively based on how wide its register is, but that's nitpicking.) reply petesergeant 7 hours agorootparent> I have worse news for you about C or C++ or anything that isn't typed exclusively based on how wide its register is I would be interested in hearing this nitpicking, I know little about C or C++ reply eropple 7 hours agorootparentHonestly, if I'm going to nitpick myself, even that isn't a true statement. You might have an integer/float divide for your registers, like amd64 does, but even past that it's squishy and becomes human bookkeeping or compiler magic. Is %rax an 8-byte integer, or is it a pointer? Or is it garbage because you used %eax (the lower 4 bytes of %rax) for storing a 4-byte integer, and the top half is whatever(tm)? Ditto again for %ax (2-byte) or %al (1-byte). You have widths, but me calling them types was really even a stretch there. And then everything else is just built from that, really. Strings/arrays? Either length+bytes/charpoints (hope you counted correctly) or \"bytes/charpoints until you hit a NUL\" (hope you put the NUL in or now your buffers are spewing somewhere they shouldn't). Structs? Pile of bytes, each of them special-cased by the compiler. (A polymorphic class would then have some virtual function tables somewhere too.) And if your language has a fixed-point decimal class, it's time to get weird. Types are a really convenient, really helpful concept, but to sniff at them being compiler-only in something like TypeScript or typed Python is IMO misguided--because compilers have gotten pretty smart and it allows us to reasonably make flexibility tradeoffs because those compilers are good at doing things. Java will scream at runtime if I cast an object to something it can't be, and that's great, but also, I just won't do that if I validated my inputs in Python with something like Pydantic or TypeScript with something like Zod or Typebox or whatever, because an illegal action with a type becomes a compiler error. So, IMO, let's get over the argument and get back to making stuff. (Even the Golang people. All is forgiven, mostly.) reply int_19h 1 hour agorootparentThe problem with Python specifically is that the type system is such a massive bolted-on hack. It has to be, because it's such a dynamic language that all declarations and imports are executable statements - and it's hard to reconcile it with type declarations, which often need to be mutually recursive. TypeScript is much better in that regard, though. reply com2kid 7 hours agorootparentprevIt is all an illusion. Unicode, ASCII, base 10 numbers, are all lies. Our CPUs know binary registers of certain sizes, ints and floats, and nothing else. Everything else is a lie that we make work by throwing a lot electricity at a lot of fancy sand and out the other end comes something that looks reasonable. That said, TS has a really nice type system that is absurdly flexible and at times quite fun to use. reply from-nibly 7 hours agorootparentprevHate to break it to you but that's how all languages work. And if they don't they are just wasting CPU cycles checking types anywhere but the edges of the app. reply frde_me 8 hours agorootparentprevYou can basically say that about everything running on a computer. The types in any language aren't a thing, it's all just bits going back and forth. reply madeofpalk 9 hours agoprevFor something called \"FastUI\" it sure does seem pretty slow at making a basic website with simple 2000s-era HTML... reply LtWorf 9 hours agoparentWell FastAPI was originally based on pydantic 1.x, which was extremely slow (so slow in fact that they removed the benchmarks from the website). I am the author of typedload, a similar library written in pure python. Mostly for fun I started to see how much I could improve performances, benchmarking against other libraries. I was very surprised to find out that pydantic2, despite the rewrite in rust, wasn't overwhelmingly faster… in fact it is still slower than my pure python library in some cases. But, I guess having \"fast\" in the name sounds good! https://ltworf.github.io/typedload/performance.html (I re-run them every time I release). reply 0cf8612b2e1e 9 hours agorootparentI am certainly not in love with how the FastAPI team handles comparisons or development. Hiding superior benchmarks. Immediately closing Github issues (they refile as Discussions to keep the issue count low). So on and so forth. reply LtWorf 9 hours agorootparentI suspect that part of the problem is that they got VC money to do the rewrite in rust, and it took very long and the results aren't as amazing as expected. But that's just my own conspiracy. I have no idea. Perhaps things changed since I last ran the benchmarks. Benchmarking isn't easy. I know that my software using my library mostly loads Unions, so that's a focus in my benchmarks. However I have absolutely no idea of what the other users are doing with it, and my benchmarks might not be relevant to them. In the end I wrote them for myself mostly, to check for possible regressions in performances. reply manojlds 1 hour agorootparentprevFast for me was about the DX rather than performance. reply __jonas 9 hours agoparentprevI’m assuming “Fast” here is the same as in “FastAPI”, meaning fast for developers comfortable with python to build with and not fast in the sense of performance. reply boxed 9 hours agoprevThis seems way slower (in dev time) and more verbose than iommi https://docs.iommi.rocks/ reply manfre 5 hours agoparentIt's customary to mention when you're promoting your own project. reply IceDane 7 hours agoprev [–] Oh No. Is it that time again? Someone who isn't really a front-end developer reinventing front-end development. I can't wait to be handed an application by my data scientists that uses this and is a complete trash fire that I need to rebuild from scratch... Again. I guess streamlit has competition. reply screye 7 hours agoparentIt comes from a place of necessity, not want. In many product engineering teams, a solution doesn't exist until there is a UI experience to interact with it. It allows data scientists to showcase the benefit of their model as a full experience. I wouldn't use it for a large scale app. But tools like these are excellent for quickly mocking up a sample UI to sell an idea to your leadership. Too often leadership does not get the benefits of a ML/AI/DataScience driven feature if they can't see it inside something that resembles a UX. Front end people don't get this pain, because their work has immediate visible impact. Backend work doesn't need to be sold because it naturally emerges out of the needs of supporting a certain number of users. ML work, lacks visibility just like backend but isn't as self evident as backend work. Tools like streamlit fill that gap. reply bormaj 6 hours agorootparentThis is probably the best summarization I've seen that describes this space. Even outside of ML, there's a real use case for building small, contained UIs for non-technical people to use in place of CLI tools. The focus of these products should be 0 to 1 rather than 1 to Inf. reply wruza 6 hours agoparentprev [–] While the sentiment is relatable, I think it’s too harsh. Frontend devs would better thought why people ignore their mainstream and use simpler tools instead. For what’s worth, the scenario you described assumes they did something useful behind that trash fire and for some reason avoided dealing with a frontend team/guy. Explanation through pure incompetence fails to see and meet their needs. reply wiseowise 2 hours agorootparent [–] I’m not a frontend dev and even I don’t understand why would you use this over vanilla html + css + JS.

    "title": "Choosing Ethical FOSS Chat Tools Over Discord",
    "originLink": "https://drewdevault.com/2021/12/28/Dont-use-Discord-for-FOSS.html",
    "originBody": "Six years ago, I wrote a post speaking out against the use of Slack for the instant messaging needs of FOSS projects. In retrospect, this article is not very good, and in the years since, another proprietary chat fad has stepped up to bat: Discord. It’s time to revisit this discussion. In short, using Discord for your free software/open source (FOSS) software project is a very bad idea. Free software matters — that’s why you’re writing it, after all. Using Discord partitions your community on either side of a walled garden, with one side that’s willing to use the proprietary Discord client, and one side that isn’t. It sets up users who are passionate about free software — i.e. your most passionate contributors or potential contributors — as second-class citizens. By choosing Discord, you also lock out users with accessibility needs, for whom the proprietary Discord client is often a nightmare to use.1 Users who cannot afford new enough hardware to make the resource-intensive client pleasant to use are also left by the wayside. Choosing Discord is a choice that excludes poor and disabled users from your community. Users of novel or unusual operating systems or devices (i.e. innovators and early adopters) are also locked out of the client until Discord sees fit to port it to their platform. Discord also declines service to users in countries under US sanctions, such as Iran. Privacy-concious users will think twice before using Discord to participate in your project, or will be denied outright if they rely on Tor or VPNs. All of these groups are excluded from your community. These problems are driven by a conflict of interest between you and Discord. Ownership over your chat logs, the right to set up useful bots, or to moderate your project’s space according to your discretion; all of these are rights reserved by Discord and denied to you. The FOSS community, including users with accessibility needs or low-end computing devices, are unable to work together to innovate on the proprietary client, or to build improved clients which better suit their needs, because Discord insists on total control over the experience. Discord seeks to domesticate its users, where FOSS treats users as peers and collaborators. These ideologies are fundamentally in conflict with one another. You are making an investment when you choose to use one service over another. When you choose Discord, you are legitimizing their platform and divesting from FOSS platforms. Even if you think they have a bigger reach and a bigger audience,2 choosing them is a short-term, individualist play which signals a lack of faith in and support for the long-term goals of the FOSS ecosystem as a whole. The FOSS ecosystem needs your investment. FOSS platforms generally don’t have access to venture capital or large marketing budgets, and are less willing to use dark patterns and predatory tactics to secure their market segment. They need your support to succeed, and you need theirs. Why should someone choose to use your FOSS project when you refused to choose theirs? Solidarity and mutual support is the key to success. There are great FOSS alternatives to Discord or Slack. SourceHut has been investing in IRC by building more accessible services like chat.sr.ht. Other great options include Matrix and Zulip. Please consider these services before you reach for their proprietary competitors. Perceptive readers might have noticed that most of these arguments can be generalized. This article is much the same if we replace “Discord” with “GitHub”, for instance, or “Twitter” or “YouTube”. If your project depends on proprietary infrastructure, I want you to have a serious discussion with your collaborators about why. What do your choices mean for the long-term success of your project and the ecosystem in which it resides? Are you making smart investments, or just using tools which are popular or that you’re already used to? If you use GitHub, consider SourceHut3 or Codeberg. If you use Twitter, consider Mastodon instead. If you use YouTube, try PeerTube. If you use Facebook… don’t. Your choices matter. Choose wisely. Discord had to be sued to take this seriously. Updated at 2021-12-28 15:00 UTC: I asked a correspondent of mine who works on accessibility to comment: I’ve tried Discord on a few occasions, but haven’t seriously tried to get proficient at navigating it with a screen reader. I remember finding it cumbersome to move around, but it’s been long enough since the last time I tried it, a few months ago, that I couldn’t tell you exactly why. I think the general problem, though, is that the UI of the desktop-targeted web app is complex enough that trying to move through it an element at a time is overwhelming. I found that the same was true of Slack and Zulip. I haven’t tried Matrix yet. Of course, IRC is great, because there’s a wide variety of clients to choose from. However, you shouldn’t take my experience as representative, even though I’m a developer working on accessibility. As you may recall, I have some usable vision, and I often use my computer visually, though I do depend on a screen reader when using my phone. I didn’t start routinely using a GUI screen reader until around 2004, when I started writing a screen reader as part of my job. And that screen reader was targeted at beginners using simple UIs. So it’s possible that I never really mastered more advanced screen reader usage. What I can tell you is that, to my surprise, Discord’s accessibility has apparently improved in recent years, and more blind people are using it now. One of my blind friends told me that most Discord functionality is very accessible and several blind communities are using it. He also told me about a group of young blind programmers who are using Discord to discuss the development of a new open-source screen reader to replace the current Orca screen reader for GNOME. ↩︎ Discord appears to inflate its participation numbers compared to other services. It shows all users who have ever joined the server, rather than all users who are actively using the server.

If your intent is to have your code reach the maximum amount of people to benefit them, and you want your project to benefit from networks effects.. then GitHub and Discord, the two proprietary platforms used by the largest portion of people for modern OSS project development, are basically a non-choice. Every other option results in far less people discovering and interacting with your project, by orders of magnitude. In a project I run, we forced everyone into Matrix as much as possible and refused to operate a Discord for over a year. Once we relented, and decided 'we would run both' - over 95% of people in under a month stopped participating in the Matrix channels and instead went to Discord. The number of people in the community grew orders of magnitude larger, in a shorter time period, as well - even with us pushing it less on our docs/etc. It sucks. Wish it wasn't true - but that's where people are. reply iforgotpassword 1 hour agoparentI get GitHub - it's proprietary, but also just git, so moving somewhere else is just a pull and push away. The same can't be said for issues/discussions/wiki, but at least it's still the web, so it is googleable, archivable, curlable, you name it. It has happened more than a dozen times that I googled a weird error from eg libssl, ended up in a random issue of a random tool I never heard of, but someone still explained the underlying issue well enough while debugging that I was able to solve my problem. This requires a browser and nothing else. None of this is true for discord. It isn't indexed by anything, even \"servers\" are walled gardens to each other mostly. Anything shared on discord will be lost to time in a decade or two. Nothing discovered or solved within $project's discord will possibly benefit anyone outside that project. And sure, we already had that problem with IRC, but I think the text-only nature of it helped that anything a bit more involved moved to forums or mailing lists which again both were web accessible and searchable. And even then some projects did have logbots which just dumped text files into a web server. reply LightFog 3 hours agoparentprevIsn’t ’giving up convenience in the name of freedom’ one of the core trade-offs you’re expected to make with free software? People buy into the ‘free’ bit of FOSS to varying degrees of course but it is disappointing that so many FOSS projects seem ok contributing so much to a proprietary product from one of the most anti-freedom corporations out there. reply andai 3 hours agorootparentStallman said (paraphrasing) \"If free software were inferior, using it would still be the right thing to do. Fortunately, it is also superior in terms of features and experience.\" That being said, Stallman (still?) uses mostly terminal based software, so that take is a bit biased. reply vaylian 1 hour agorootparent> Stallman (still?) uses mostly terminal based software, so that take is a bit biased. The Linux terminal is fairly comfy and depending on the task, it can be vastly superior to graphical applications. The opposite can also be true for other tasks. It really depends on what someone wants to do with their computer. reply LightFog 2 hours agorootparentprevI think that might be wishful thinking on his part - I remember hearing about him consuming some types of web content via a friend downloading html and emailing it to him! He has spoken plenty about confronting the convenience-freedom trade off that anyone consuming software will be confronted with though. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agorootparentprev> \"If free software were inferior, using it would still be the right thing to do. Fortunately, it is also superior in terms of features and experience.\" It blows me away just how out of touch one otherwise-intelligent man can be. FOSS often has severe usability issues compared to popular proprietary counterparts -- just look at any article here talking about trying to use Matrix or get friends/relatives to use it, it's basically always a big dumpster fire. Yet somehow you still have people recommending it. reply rapnie 2 hours agorootparentIt is true that highest quality FOSS is found at the level of libraries and frameworks, not on the end-user app level. There's still a lot to win by improving the practices on this level, which require more than pure technical focus. And other people than devs getting involved with their skills. Requires better FOSS tools and practices to make that happen. That is a challenge for the future of FOSS. It's also one tackled by people using the FOSS apps, prepared to bear with inconveniences, give their feedback, and not ditching them on a whim for the first proprietary competitor that is better. Yes, that is not for everyone to be involved with. I am quite happy to see more people who do. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agorootparentA lot of FOSS enthusiasts want the UX to be bad, because to them the UX that is bad for most people is actually fine. I think the issue is less getting a designer interested, and more that it would be really hard to get consensus. Changing UX is more subjective AND intrusive compared to adding more features or improving performance. Changing the UI means changing people's existing flows, as opposed to a new feature that can just be one more button somewhere. reply rapnie 1 hour agorootparentIt is understandable, since the majority of FOSS enthusiasts consist of developers, techie folks. An audience of power users that indeed have different preferences for their UX. There's a lack of people involved in FOSS projects (e.g. designers) that inform these developers on the expectations of the user base that their FOSS project is targeting. FOSS devs want to see their project get uptake and use, and need different voices that tell them (with good arguments) how to achieve that. Lacking that biased UX hampers project objectives. reply hx8 41 minutes agorootparentI don't think there is a consensus among developers of front-end FOSS that becoming the market leader is a high priority. Non-power users will never submit a PR, and rarely even write a useful bug report. They effectively give very little back to the project, except maybe some clout that comes with a large user base. There are some exceptions, but the ones that care the most about market share either have a corporate backer that is profiting from the project (Microsoft, Chromium) or require large numbers for the project to be successful (Firefox, Fediverse). reply rapnie 22 minutes agorootparentBefore striving for market share and leadership, there's product-market fit. The ambitions of FOSS projects needn't be (and often aren't) to become a leader. Offering a good alternative to some proprietary product is already a good start. FOSS projects are predominantly started and maintained by developers and this is reflected in both the tool choices and the organization / governance model of the project, which makes it hard for other stakeholders to have a proper say in it. Those are areas to focus on and where much can be improved. And with the help of said stakeholders to encourage that trend. reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentprevYes, but it's not constantly trying to trick you into paying, or locking you in to some format/platform that will lead to you paying. Those are also big usability issues. reply TulliusCicero 1 hour agorootparentNo, not really. I mean, those are issues, but more of monetization than usability. The usability decrease from those things is fairly small. reply the_gipsy 1 hour agorootparentYes, they are usability issues, if I can't trust the software and need to evaluate every step it makes, because it might do something against my interests. That's quite the cognitive overload. I'm not saying that it's strictly worse or the same as with FOSS software. Just a different tradeoff. reply tasuki 3 hours agorootparentprevI use FOSS because it's convenient, not for some higher philosophical principle... reply ajb 0 minutes agorootparentFine, but then your opinion is not important to the development of FOSS, because you won't be contributing back much. rapnie 2 hours agorootparentprevIf use is the only thing you do it may contribute to the Tragedy of the Commons and you undermine FOSS. If you also contribute back in some ways, even for very practical purposes, you are also serving the higher philosophical principle of FOSS. reply roenxi 3 hours agorootparentprevNo. Freedom includes the freedom to do what is convenient. The tolerance of inconvenience is a practical argument. If you have non-free dependencies, the most likely scenario is that sooner or later the dependency will kill support for the project and you have no legal recourse. Eg, if a project uses Discord, at some point it will have to move away to some other technology/protocol. If it uses git, the project won't ever have to move away from git. Those predictions can be made purely from analysing the license. Since a move is inevitable, it really should make more sense to use FOSS protocols and clients from the get go. People don't though, and I don't pretend to understand the reasons. But what I can confidently say that Discord is going to become inhospitable for the project eventually. reply LightFog 3 hours agorootparentThis doesn’t seem to cover the ‘social’ or community side of software freedom though. Sure you have the freedom to make life tough for your future self for short term gain - but by embracing non-free software you are ultimately limiting the freedom of others via network effects and lock-ins. Exactly what has happened with GitHub. reply rapnie 2 hours agorootparentExactly, ones convenient choice undermines and erodes collective freedoms. In FOSS you 'vote' with your choices. In an analogy with politics this lack of consideration of freedoms and values, and applying of critical thinking may lead to freedom eventually being eradicated for good (or a very long time). In politics unfortunately we see people time and again voting democratically for their own oppression and lack of choice. reply raverbashing 2 hours agorootparentprevYes Discord eventually won't be a good choice. Eventually. Then people will just move People are talking about Discord like Freenode didn't crap on everyone recently Meanwhile, sure, feel free to use an OSS solution then realize nobody cares reply pillusmany 2 hours agorootparentprevAccording to this logic FOSS projects should not support proprietary OSes like Windows or macOS. reply LightFog 2 hours agorootparentIt seems there are plenty that don’t - although that may also be for practical reasons. But yes, I do think that free software ideals discourage supporting those platforms - however some may support them to give their users at least some freedom, eg when they are forced to use the platforms due to some work policy. reply rapnie 2 hours agorootparentprevThat's different. These OS'es are more bottom of the stack. Below that they run on proprietary firmware, even Linux. reply Buttons840 3 hours agoparentprevCommunity over tools. Hopefully if the tools fail the communities will move to new tools. Ultimately, a huge hacker culture built on proprietary tools might lead to more freedoms, both political and technical, than a tiny hacker community built on other tools. The size and political influence of a larger community matters. reply rapnie 1 hour agorootparentMaybe. But I wonder how much of a healthy community collapses when you are forced to make a switch from, say, Discord to some alternative tool. Building and maintaining healthy communities requires tremendous amount of effort, especially when they are large. So you should weigh the benefits of a convenient tool to the amount of effort that may go to waste if that tool no longer fits the bill. reply advael 2 hours agoparentprevAs someone also running FOSS projects on discord because it's a non-choice, hard agree. Boycotting proprietary platforms is a good end-goal, but it's about as feasible to convince people not to use dominant organizing tools like discord and github as it is to get them off the mobile duopoly right now. reply alwayslikethis 2 hours agorootparentI maintain a semi-popular project [1] with a support chat which is bridged between Matrix, Telegram, and Discord. The decision to bridge it to Discord was made having thought long and hard about it some time after reading this post. My stance is that it is okay to use proprietary platforms as long as it does not negatively impact the users not willing to use them, i.e. all channels must be bridged to non-Discord, so that it does not \"partition the community\" in any way. Discord-specific features should be avoided to not affect the usability of users on Matrix. So far it works well and I get to basically have the cake and eat it too. 1. https://github.com/FreeLanguageTools/vocabsieve reply YoshiRulz 4 hours agoparentprevDid you consider bridging Discord channel(s) into Matrix? reply slimsag 3 hours agorootparentYes. But the bridge looked fairly difficult to run and configure properly, requiring a yarn/npm dev environment (which I don't want installed on my machine) At the time (still?) it seemed impossible to bridge Discord channels (which are viewed very much as 'create as you please') to Matrix rooms without painfully doing it one-by-one via a config file and managing/creating both on each side (Matrix really seems stuck on the idea of preferring its 'one room' model and has not really embraced channels in the Discord sense.) Discord had also just gotten forums with no way to bridge them. Additionally, our Matrix rooms were seeing a good amount of spam that Discord was not, which would then get relayed to Discord via the bridge and would require moderating in both sides. Finally, our strongest Matrix advocates firmly disliked the idea of a bridge because it meant their Matrix messages would go to the proprietary Discord company. In the end, we let them run side-by-side for a little while then the Matrix quickly died. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agorootparent> Finally, our strongest Matrix advocates firmly disliked the idea of a bridge because it meant their Matrix messages would go to the proprietary Discord company. > In the end, we let them run side-by-side for a little while then the Matrix quickly died. The Stallman mentality is a plague. reply herewulf 3 hours agorootparentprev> requiring a yarn/npm dev environment (which I don't want installed on my machine) I don't like / trust that stuff either but it's often necessary and easy enough to run in a container (e.g.: Docker/Podman, LXC, Guix Shell) or VM (e.g.: Vagrant, QEMU/libvirt). I actually run most of my software dev stuff that way these days because all these tools are routinely pulling hundreds of deps from the internet that are doing who knows what in their build systems. reply alwayslikethis 2 hours agorootparentprevYou can use this Ansible playbook. It worked well for me for bridging Discord and Telegram, among other things, running off a Hetzner box. https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy Personally I've never seen any significant amount of spam on Matrix. reply watwut 58 minutes agoparentprevI dunno about GitHub now. Ever since it requires two factor authentication, it is not really suitable if you want people to be active in any way. reply cokeandpepsi 2 hours agoparentprevI'm not surprised, matrix is not easy or enjoyable to use at all; maybe the protocol itself is sound but every implementation I've tried both server and client is seriously bad reply bachmeier 11 minutes agoprevI want to point out the arguments at the beginning of the post, which are generally ignored by those commenting, with the focus on total user count: - Those most passionate about free software are treated as second-class citizens. - Discord is bad for users with accessibility needs. - Users with old computers are excluded, as are those with an unusual OS or device. - Users in countries like Iran are excluded. - Users concerned about privacy are excluded. reply zzo38computer 2 hours agoprevI agree with what it says; however, using Discord is even worse than using GitHub, since GitHub is a git-based service which others (even if you do not have an account) can still download the repositories and the files (and it can be mirrored on multiple services). If for contribution and discussion of your project has mandatory requirements to send issues and/or pull requests to GitHub, or to host something on GitHub, or to use Discord, then this can be a problem. However, if you just make a mirror on GitHub and on multiple other services (or have the GitHub issue trackers as one of many), then this can be less of a problem (although there is still the problem of others who wish to comment on issues which have been posted on GitHub, even if there are other issue trackers and/or discussion forums, since they will be separated). (IRC is better; however, a few projects have bridged IRC with Discord (or with Matrix) and you could use that if necessary. NNTP would also be helpful; I have set up a NNTP server, but hardly anyone uses it.) (Another advantage of IRC is that it is usable even without a specialized IRC client, since it is mostly plain text anyways. This is especially true if TLS is optional rather than mandatory, and the character set is printable ASCII rather than Unicode; but, even then it is still more usable than Discord.) reply rapnie 2 hours agoparent> I agree with what it says; however, using Discord is even worse than using GitHub, since GitHub is a git-based service which others I think Github is worse. The pervasiveness of this centralized platform leads to a way more insidious form of lock-in. Look at the vast landscape of developer tool vendors who offer some kind of Github integration features out of the box. These aren't even unique selling points, they are expected functionality. Bringing Micosoft Github in a very luxurous position where they can pick'n choose nuggets into their platform to slowly bring more value to their products and services. It is all seemingly open, but you are a frog in boiling water, getting more dependent on the platform. This goes much further than git vs. github. The Github product suite offers real productivity gains, that cover many aspects of the software development lifecycle. And more added all the time. Hyper convenient, click and go. It is their strategic direction to cover ever more of this SDLC and intertwine with other products and services along the way. From that regard git is just the data export format, your data takeout if you decide to leave. And good luck to find comparative services elsewhere. reply zzo38computer 1 hour agorootparent> Look at the vast landscape of developer tool vendors who offer some kind of Github integration features out of the box.

Of course, some people do; as long as they are not mandatory, you could still use the program being made by the project, elsewhere. > From that regard git is just the data export format It is import as well as export.

But.. > Of course, some people do I would say most people that have their stuff on Github use many of the power features and conveniences they bring without much deliberation on the lock-in aspects, and also use the Github integrations of a range of additional 3rd-party developer tools too. Companies make these choices, often as a no-brainer, since it is a logical choice for what are simply the 'best tools' on the market. And then devs start using those too for their own personal projects. reply charcircuit 2 hours agoparentprevDiscord doesn't necessarily require an account and it can be opened with open source clients like chromium and firefox reply zzo38computer 2 hours agorootparentPossibly it can, but it is overly complicated and requires software upgrades; both the browser and the Discord software itself is; and apparently it uses up a lot of RAM, and has other problems. IRC doen't have these problems; you can write your own (and make one which is much simpler than Discord, Firefox, and Chromium), or just use it directly. reply jedberg 3 hours agoprevEvery time the idea of using discord for support comes up, I like to retell this story: I was trying to get support for a commercial product which I paid for. They only offered support through Discord. They had set up their channel to require phone number verification. I put in my phone number that I've had for the last 24 years and it said it was invalid. I messaged support, and instead of fixing their system, they suggested that I just borrow a phone from someone who doesn't use discord to verify my phone number. They told me \"it's ok we only do it that one time so it doesn't matter\". This was from their official support. What exactly is the point of phone number verification if they officially encourage you to circumvent it? I never did get support on that product. And it never worked again. reply nicetryguy 2 hours agoparentGosh, of all people, i'm interested in your thoughts particularly on using a subreddit as an official support / forum alternative. reply PUSH_AX 12 minutes agorootparentReddit search is even worse than discord. reply jedberg 2 hours agorootparentprevWell, we did consider that use case when we added the ability to make private or restricted Reddits. I think it's a great way to do it, except for one thing -- you have to make a reddit account to get help. That would probably be barrier for some. Also given that the reddit sorts prioritize newness, it may not be the best resource for support since there is a good chance some old posts might cover a common problem. Overall there are probably better support platforms. But using a private reddit for an internal support forum would probably work really well! reply pierat 3 hours agoparentprevWhat is this product, so we can avoid them? reply jedberg 3 hours agorootparentYou're going to laugh, but I can't post the name.

The moment I see \"join our Discord\" I close the tab. It is embarrassing. reply schacon 3 hours agoprevI know that this isn't the point of this post exactly, since this is more of the \"free as in speech\" argument, but I just want to say that I dislike Discord for lots of reasons but it's _amazing_ as a community engagement tool. When GitHub was young and we were just starting out, we didn't really have anything like this. We had Campfire for internal chat, but not an external IRC like tool for engaging with our early users. The problem with IRC is mostly that nobody used it, it's just not an easy to use platform. We would mostly just use Twitter or something for user conversations. I remember Leah Culver launching Convore (based on IRC tech) to try to make this easier, but for whatever reason it didn't take off. But somehow, Discord took off and there are _so many_ people there. We opened a server for GitButler and it's been so fantastic for connecting with and supporting our users. But more importantly, it's amazing to have when you want to engage in a community as a _user_. We started using Planetscale and I had an issue and was able to join their server, ask my question and get a real answer from real PS employees and users almost immediately. Rather than dumping an issue into GitHub and watching it linger. Real time chat is so much more powerful. Discord has done _so much_ for the open source community. Just look at great projects that embrace it. Go into the ohmyzsh channel and get _anything_ answered, there are like 1000 active users in there all the time. I just can't imagine the concept of throwing that away because \"it's not FOSS\". reply alwayslikethis 2 hours agoparentA lot of people use FOSS because they value control and self-ownership. Discord is the antithesis to that, being controlled by an external entity which places itself in a privileged position to both be the speech police and shut you down at will. Unlike Github, a community is much harder to move than a code repository + CI system because it is more than a technical problem. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agoparentprevDiscord is both powerful and easy to use. A lot of FOSS software is the former but not the latter, and the community often come across as, well, not really giving a shit about that (or sometimes being completely unable to perceive any usability differences). Yeah there are some downsides compared to IRC, but the average user will likely have a MUCH better nicer experience using Discord...which is a big part of why it's exploded in popularity. reply pistoriusp 2 hours agorootparentTo be fair this was always the prevailing attitude on IRC. Try to fix it yourself, RTFM, and ask good questions. Maybe IRC was a litmus test of sorts. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agorootparentRight, and that's not wrong. It's fine to have software like that. But it'll probably never be as popular as software that gives a shit about decent UX design. reply pistoriusp 2 hours agoparentprevWe even stopped using Slack for our internal conversations, and instead use private Discord rooms, to me it means that everyone who cares about our product is focused on the same space. reply tomnipotent 2 hours agoparentprevI recently took a dive into the world of Wayland compositors, and ended up trying out both Sway and Hyprland. Sway just happens to be a Drew DeVault project, and unsurprisingly relies on LibreChat/IRC while Hyprland is Discord. The Hyprland Discord was both more active and easier to get my questions answered, in no small part thanks to chat history and decent search. It felt like a world of a difference, and played a huge role in my going with Hyprland despite finding Sway source code better written and a slimmer running process. reply lukeschlather 3 hours agoprevDiscord is a much more usable version of IRC. And most IRC channels didn't log, they have always been a black hole. For the moment (and I don't expect this to last forever) Discord is far less of a black hole than IRC used to be. Increasingly I don't really think decentralized open source is what we need, we could really use a centralized nonprofit mission-driven org that is committed to operating something like Github along with a chat service and a social network. Every project trying to operate their own, we get a bunch of poorly secured, poorly backed up projects, all of which are doing a ton of duplicative work where if all of those distributed teams were working on one project they could scale to orders of magnitude what they're scaled to independently. reply ducktective 3 hours agoparent>Discord is a much more usable version of IRC Requires a phone number to even sign up.

People who actually think these things. If you actually bother to engage with features in IRC and Discord, it is 1000% apparent how Discord is vastly more usable for the average user. Discord matches expectations for how an app or service will behave, and has a powerful set of features that are easy to grasp and require minimal or no setup. That's why it wins.

Toxicity seems to increase with total user count. reply Intralexical 1 hour agorootparentIt's not the total user count, but the flattening of different groups that didn't need and frankly didn't ask to be constantly smushed together: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse In real life interaction happens in short term and long term physical and social bubbles where the way you act and present information naturally takes into consideration the people you're interacting with. How you talk to a customer is different from how you talk to to your friend, is different from how you talk to your partner, is different from how you talk to your boss, and is different from how you talk when all four relationships are in one conversation together. On the Internet— and basically only on the Internet— you'll say something meant for your knitting discussion group, and then Rocky, Steve, Gwen, and Stacy from the guitar, farming, volcanology, and motorcycle communities will butt in and take offence— because the geniuses in charge of the platform have decided that human progress is best measured in terms of how many people they can blindly jam into the same room at once. reply darthrupert 2 hours agoparentprevYet every time I try to force myself to try Discord, I turn back in disgust as the UX is the worst I have seen in a chat application.

I wish Discord just allowed alternative clients, it would nicely fix the problem without affecting the boring part of their users. Since they fight against it so much, I guess they're doing their data mining in the client. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agorootparentI think it's more likely that they just make money off of their client via Nitro and other random features. Having other clients would let people get around that while still using Discord's servers/bandwidth. And there's definitely technical issues with supporting other clients. Can make it hard to change things without breaking those other clients. reply chillfox 2 hours agorootparentprevI think it's just different people having different preferences. For me, Discord is the best group chat app I have ever used. The UI is fantastic. reply ChrisArchitect 3 hours agoprevMany posts over the years related to this where there are some mentions lamenting the old forum days and the value of those independent platforms and the way they organize and provide archived history of your project/your community. Discord, a realtime chat platform, still isn't that right? The reasons ppl moved away from forums weren't entirely legit - the gaming community origin as a fast paced attn-deficit platform for rapid meme sharing, the rapid switch to mobile-first mentality needing UIs to match, a gap in generations of users not used to the forum posting / email like UX etc..... but I mean, look where we are right now here on HN, a classic forum by most standards, and even what Reddit is, a platform of a million forums,... The forum still holds a lot of merit no? It's just been pushed down under the weight of the rush to popularity and the mentioned issues. reply drooopy 6 minutes agoprevThe fact that the process of deleting your discord account does not also delete all of the comments that you've posted on different servers or private chats should be a good enough reason to avoid using discord for any purpose. reply alwayslikethis 2 hours agoprevI maintain a semi-popular project [1] with a support chat which is bridged between Matrix, Telegram, and Discord. The decision to bridge it to Discord was made having thought long and hard about it some time after reading this post. When you chase purity, you sacrifice pragmatism and strategic flexibility, limiting your options. It is sometimes necessary to compromise to achieve your goals. My conclusion is that it is okay to use proprietary platforms as long as it does not negatively impact the users not willing to use them, i.e. all channels must be bridged to non-Discord, so that it does not \"partition the community\" in any way. When a compromise needs to be made, FOSS users are prioritized. Discord-specific features should be avoided to not affect the usability of users on Matrix. So far it works well and I get to basically have the cake and eat it too. The bridges are set up using an Ansible playbook [2] which required relatively little effort on my part. 1. https://github.com/FreeLanguageTools/vocabsieve 2. https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy reply rapnie 15 minutes agoparentThis can be a good approach, and indeed pragmatic. I wonder how your experience will be on the longer term wrt partioning the community, as each tool introduced adds frictions and maintenance burdens. Would people flock to the lowest friction tool? Maybe you could encourage adoption of the FOSS tools of the project, e.g. by using Matrix as your main channel where the core devs post, and considering other channels purely as mirrors. reply theanonymousone 42 minutes agoprevDiscord still forces me to install the mobile app and does not allow using the web app on mobile devices. Isn't that a very dark pattern? I'm by no means a \"warrior\", but I deleted my Quora account for the same reason, and will not \"embrace\" Discord until they fix this. reply pmontra 21 minutes agoprevIn my case I don't want to interact with a project through a chat. I want to search the issue I'm facing and find a solution in a web page. It's usually in Stackoverflow or in a GitHub issue. Sometimes it's in some kind of forum / FAQ / wiki. When I see the Discord UI starting, I click back and start again. If the project insists to use only Discord or something equivalent and there are no other ways to find a solution, I stop there and pick some other project. Sometimes I do some investigation in advance and if I find out that all the support is through a chat I stop right there without downloading anything. reply TulliusCicero 2 hours agoprevIt's hilarious to see comments talking about how nobody in their community wants to use Matrix alongside comments recommending that you should obviously just use Matrix. The reality is 1. FOSS alternatives have awful usability compared to Discord for the average person 2. Advocates for those FOSS alternatives are frequently utterly blind to those usability issues (which partially explains why they're present in the first place -- can't fix what you can't see!); they literally cannot even perceive what the problem is reply LightFog 1 hour agoparentIt’s true - it’s a frustrating side of free software projects that user experience isn’t taken seriously. I think those that push back at criticism on that side aren’t considering that a key point of ‘free’ software is evangelism and encouraging adoption and are letting something else (eg ego) get in the way. reply chillfox 1 hour agoparentprevUsing Discord also results in a lot of zealots who are unpleasant to interact with self-filtering by staying away. reply ejj28 4 hours agoprevIRC is not a suitable platform for anything in 2024 in my opinion. I've also never used Matrix and it doesn't seem to be catching on either. I gave up on using forums years ago as well, because why would I want to make a forum post asking for help, only to get a single response hours later, when I can chat with other users in real-time on Discord. Personally I think that as valid as some of the issues with using Discord for FOSS are, there isn't a better platform for a community to interact with each other on. Sure, projects shouldn't be using Discord for everything, there should be documentation and stuff available online, but for fluid discussion and getting help from others users, I don't see any decent alternatives. reply skydhash 4 hours agoparent> why would I want to make a forum post asking for help, only to get a single response hours later, when I can chat with other users in real-time on Discord. Because when someone else encounters the same issue, the answer there may help him as well. Just like surveying the opened issues may reveal problems about the project. It seems to me that every project that has opened a discord is suffering from stale or lack of documentation. A group can use whatever it likes for collaboration, but pointing users to a discord server feels like being asked to first be initiated to the club, before having the privilege of receiving information. There is a strong aura of exclusion. reply ericjmorey 2 hours agorootparentI suspect that people who prefer the instant feedback from a chat room also aren't interested in researching the questions first and therefore place no value on what can be found in research. There's such a high preference for instant feedback that people are choosing ChatGPT knowing that the information will not be correct in ways they cannot identify. reply buovjaga 2 hours agoparentprevI am introducing over a 100 people to IRC per year by using it for FOSS mentoring. It has a much lower threshold than anything else as you can start with a web client without registration (I share the first chat log via email). Once Libera Chat switches to https://github.com/Libera-Chat/sable registered users will have 24/7 logs (especially great for flaky mobile connections). reply unsignedint 3 hours agoparentprevThe primary issue with IRC is that its design presupposes a persistent, always-on session, which is not conducive to users who switch between multiple devices. While it functions adequately on one or two PCs, integrating mobile devices complicates the experience. Although it is possible to bridge and proxy connections to mitigate this, it introduces an additional layer of management, leading some users to prefer alternative platforms. Furthermore, IRC's notification system is less robust and feature-rich compared to contemporary messaging solutions. reply bee_rider 4 hours agoparentprevIs discord profitable yet? For some reason I think people are hoping they’ll break the chat app treadmill (gain users and community by giving service away for free, try to monetize these communities, go out of business because chat is a solved problem and you can’t offer anything comparable to your competition who is still in the “give away service” stage).

Any serious question goes to whatever the project’s most significant async message board is (Reddit, Discourse, etc). The main problem with Discord, to me, is that in any popular project, you have about 15 seconds for the right person to read your message before emojis push it off the screen. reply 15457345234 1 hour agorootparent> The main problem with Discord, to me, is that in any popular project, you have about 15 seconds for the right person to read your message before emojis push it off the screen. It's like... this defines the issue. I don't see why this point isn't always mentioned front and center when it comes to discussion of Discord as a help vector. It's transient. It's ephemeral. Forum posts persist, they're asynchronous. People visit forums and catch up, it's considered acceptable to reply to a post that's a couple of weeks old. Yes, you shouldn't necro a thread from a year ago but forums are designed for casual access which is always going to be the majority of a userbase. You can drop in and help as and when it suits you. If you get abused or a toxic reply, there's a good chance you might not even see it because the admin will clean it up before you log in again. They're searchable and open. Compared to that, everything about discord appears, to me, to make it completely unsuitable as a support platform. I've tried a few times to use some subreddit discords and they're just bizarrely fast-moving with multiple channels, memes and stuff popping up all over the place - I fail to see how you can get any real value out of that. It's hugely interactive and feels like - to use a very old metaphor - having a boxing match with your computer in which you're constantly ducking stuff being thrown at you. It's a bit exhausting. It seems... discord, like tiktok, is something you do - it's a two-way street. You use discord, you install the app, the app pings you up when _it_ wants to and you respond to the app, which is a really unhealthy way to interact with technology, having an app endlessly jerking your chain. Forums, on the other hand are a passive place _you_ visit when _you_ want to - which is a much more human-centric way to interact with technology. reply nurettin 3 hours agoparentprevIRC was fine.

That's open to change, though. reply zaik 1 hour agorootparentprevWhy not? reply vaylian 1 hour agorootparentNot GP, but I think the biggest flaw in XMPP is that doesn't define a reasonable baseline for what features need to be supported. XMPP has extensions, but you can't really be sure that all clients and servers implement them all. This is especially important when you want to use end-to-end message encryption, where both parties definitely need to support the same modern standards. I wouldn't mind if XMPP became more successful again. But for that to happen it needs to move some XEPs into the core protocol. reply MattJ100 1 hour agorootparentFor what it's worth this issue is not as big as people generally make it out to be. Everything doesn't need to support everything for communication to be successful. The XMPP Standards Foundation publish an annual compliance baseline for different categories of XMPP application. There are also projects such as Snikket (disclaimer: I work on this), which remove the confusion entirely. At the end of the day the solution is not for end users to \"use XMPP\", but for good products to build on and use XMPP. I wrote on this topic at https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/ reply vaylian 37 minutes agorootparentThank you. I didn't know about Snikket. This looks promising.

I personally couldn't care less about idealism, but the practical implications of depending on a business that's seemingly still living on mostly investor money to be the sole provider of a service you depend on shouldn't be overlooked. How practical will Discord be once enshittification accelerates? How practical will it be after it reaches EOL for failing to convince investors that it'll ever turn a profit? Can I run my own Discord infrastructure when that happens? Can someone else? If and when Discord says goodbye, can I easily export the data that is otherwise walled into the product?
