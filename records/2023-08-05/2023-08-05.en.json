It’s been thrilling to see Clojure and Datomic successfully applied at scale. I look forward to continuing to lead ongoing work maintaining and enhancing Clojure with Alex, Stu, Fogus and many others, as an independent developer once again. We have many useful things planned for 1.12 and beyond. The community remains friendly, mature and productive, and is taking Clojure into many interesting new domains. I want to highlight and thank Nubank for their ongoing sponsorship of Alex, Fogus and the core team, as well as the Clojure community at large. Stu will continue to lead the development of Datomic at Nubank, where the Datomic team grows and thrives. I’m particularly excited to see where the new free availability of Datomic will lead. My time with Cognitect remains the highlight of my career. I have learned from absolutely everyone on our team, and am forever grateful to all for our interactions. There are too many people to thank here, but I must extend my sincerest appreciation and love to Stu and Justin for (repeatedly) taking a risk on me and my ideas, and for being the best of partners and friends, at all times fully embodying the notion of integrity. And of course to Alex Miller - who possesses in abundance many skills I lack, and without whose indomitable spirit, positivity and friendship Clojure would not have become what it did. I have made many friends through Clojure and Cognitect, and I hope to nurture those friendships moving forward. Retirement returns me to the freedom and independence I had when originally developing Clojure. The journey continues!

Damn I&#x27;m old.The company I founded uses full stack Clojure for our product development (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kpow.io).We&#x27;re a small team pushing through a big product roadmap at pace, love programming every day, no chance we&#x27;d have made it in Java (and I quite like Java).Thanks Rich! reply zbobet2012 Rich&#x27;s simple made easy is the best programming video I&#x27;ve ever seen, and is ultimately I think what so many engineers need to \"grok\" to unlock better coding. I&#x27;m the \"most senior\" engineer (chief architect) in a company of more than a thousand engineers, and I recommend it to every junior who asks how to get better.I will also say I used clojure + aleph to write the only significant application I ever released which never had a reported bug or outage. It ran for seven years and that application was under constant heavy load (more than 10k TPS). reply seer The other essential talk I usually recommend is “beyond PEP8” by Raymond Hettinger.Its was one of those things that was always on my mind, but couldn’t express it well to my peers, before encountering this talk. Plus its about both python and java, so increases the chances to be heeded by non-fp people.A lot of programmers I’ve worked with either don’t want to learn well the environment they are working in, thus repeating stuff that doesn’t fit well, or over-engineer abstractions to force their environment to behave the way they like, and both approaches can leave the codebase in shambles. reply chollida1 1I wrote my first trading system in Clojure because a few of the libraries we relied on were in java.It was 2011 and I&#x27;d had about 3 years of lisp experience. I got a bit of side eye from people when I told them I was using a relatively new programming language but the fact that it was based on the JVM, which alot of HFT firms were using helped make the case.We didn&#x27;t use if for more than a few years before it was retired and rewritten, though that was due to new requirements that included C++ interop.In the end tracking memory usage and allocations got too hard and if you&#x27;ve ever written something that is time sensitive you&#x27;ll know just how slow memory allocation is, so you could argue I made a poor choice but for the rewrite was easy to reuse the java libraries when we moved to java.The harder part was porting the algorithm implementation code. The reason was that I chose a common lisp trick of first writing a DSL in Clojure that was then used to write the algos.That was the one part that seemed worse in the rewrite as it became far more verbose and clunky.But man was it fun, I learned more in a month than I often do in a year now.Thanks Rich!! It&#x27;s not often you get to experiment with cool tech and make lots of money doing it. I appreciate your work. reply kaba0 1> you&#x27;ll know just how slow memory allocation isJust a small nitpick, but allocation is definitely not slow in case of the JVM, it is often faster than manually managed languages. It is a pointer bump only.All the necessary mechanisms of a GC does have an overhead, so your point stands, but not for the mentioned reason. reply chollida1 Ok sure that’s fair.Typically in HFT We just want to avoid any full sweep garbage collection between 8am and 6pm reply nerdponx 1I suppose you couldn&#x27;t convince your employer to let you use an embeddable Scheme interpreter for the DSL? reply chollida1 1Well the performance hit alone would be a non starter. reply uxcolumbo 1So you had to switch to C++ because Clojure &#x2F; Java wasn&#x27;t performant enough? reply chollida1 1> So you had to switch to C++ because Clojure &#x2F; Java wasn&#x27;t performant enough?Clojure yes, java no. Many HFT firms build their systems in java and run on the jvm(specialized hardware aside), its plenty fast if you avoid memory allocations.It is also possible Clojure is more than up to the task now and its also reasonable to believe that I wasn&#x27;t a strong enough clojure developer to fix those issues at the time and a more competent developer could have made it work.But like almost all things if you chose a very out of the mainstream language and start to have issues, most developers will point fingers at the language first.Side note, its a miracle that Jane Street kept using OCaml after the first few years and points to how strong their core tech team was.C++ was an external dependency brought on by other systems that needed to be integrated and is a far safer language to use. I&#x27;d imagine that if you say HFT to most developers, their first thought would be C++ even if they haven&#x27;t worked in the domain before.It&#x27;s like choosing Julia for your machine learning platform and then switching to python. reply Jach 1It&#x27;s a shame you couldn&#x27;t have pitched Common Lisp. Maybe could have ported your DSL pretty quickly and wound up having SBCL output nice compiled assembly instructions and shown x% speed improvement without much effort by using a \"sister language\" of sorts? ABCL in 2011 would have been a harder sell, it only had its 1.0 release that October.A few years ago another commenter noted they had developed a trading system in Lisp and C https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25222297 (further comments elaborate a bit) before being asked to rewrite it in Java. What keeps less popular languages alive at companies, when there&#x27;s no forcing reason to get rid of it like really unacceptable performance, is a conviction (borne out as far as I can tell) that it&#x27;s ok to hire people who don&#x27;t know the language -- they&#x27;ll get up to speed more than fast enough. reply WinLychee 1For extremely low latency, Clojure can be an awkward fit. By default there&#x27;s a lot of sugar in the syntax, so if you need to be precise about the underlying types of your data and the exact datastructure, you need to toss out most of the standard datatypes and datastructures. It&#x27;s small details like: \"I definitely have an array of unboxed integers, and I need to be sure this one operation won&#x27;t accidentally allocate a new list of boxed integers, and that this function I&#x27;m calling doesn&#x27;t dispatch dynamically\" or things like that. You start using `deftype` everywhere, sometimes dipping into Java, etc. You may as well just write java at that point. However from a pure Clojure standpoint, the author of Neanderthal has done great work on making Clojure viable for high performance numerical computing. reply jwr 1> because Clojure &#x2F; Java wasn&#x27;t performant enoughLanguages aren&#x27;t \"performant\". You can write good or bad code in most languages, or code that isn&#x27;t a good fit for a language.That said, there are languages which will make you incur certain penalties, as there is a price to be paid for automatic memory management with garbage collection, for example. These penalties generally do not matter except for edge cases (and HFT trading might very well be one!).There are also languages which help you write much faster code, but on a higher level. Clojure transducers are a good example: pipelines built of composable transformations, where data sequences are not fully realized between the transformations. These can provide significant performance (and memory allocation) improvements, while still letting you write high-level code. reply moomin There is “the expected performance of idiomatic code”, though, which is what most people mean when they talk about the performance of a language. reply behnamoh 1> The harder part was porting the algorithm implementation code. The reason was that I chose a common lisp trick of first writing a DSL in Clojure that was then used to write the algos.Doesn&#x27;t it mean that Lisp macros should really be avoided at all costs? reply chollida1 1Can&#x27;t say for sure, given that my sample size is one.The upsides of DSL(Domain specific languages) and macros in general is that they cut down on code duplication and give everyone using them a common language and set of tools on which to build an app. That part is awesome and I think really helped to speed up development of the algos that were built on top of the DSL.The downside is, that you need to learn the DSL but that&#x27;s a very small impact in my experience. THe larger downside as you and I point out is that those tools aren&#x27;t really there for other languages so if you do plan on porting the code base to another language then maybe steer clear of macros.But again, I wouldn&#x27;t say I have anywhere near enough experience to claim to be an expert in that. reply yawaramin I remember Rich talking about how much time and money he put into Clojure–some of that money taken out of his retirement funds! I hope he has a long and fulfilling retirement with lots of happiness. reply netbioserror 1I made two large projects in Clojure: One abandoned startup SaaS and one internal system. Both were a damn joy. They taught me the immense value of loosely coupled components that exchange simple data with each other, from large server components all the way down to module-level coupling. I can only ever view gigantic, monolithic, opinionated web frameworks with a strong degree of skepticism from now on.Lisp in general was probably the most fulfilling programming rabbit hole I ever followed down, and I don&#x27;t regret a moment of it. A true gold mine of skill, ability, and thought training that changed the way I program, even in imperative&#x2F;procedural languages. reply jonahbenton 1The word congratulations came into English from Latin, where it was formed by combining prefix com-, meaning with, to gratulari, meaning \"give thanks\" or \"show joy.\" Gratulari is derived from gratus, as is gratitude. Gratus means \"pleasing,\" \"thankful.\"Having only had the good fortune to meet you in person a few times:Congratulations, Rich. You have my deepest gratitude. It fills me with great joy to know you are taking this step. I look forward to what your next stage brings. reply tbalsam 1Few people capture this spirit like the classic \"Congratulations\" video from Big Man Tyrone.While it has gone through the revolutions from sincere, to sarcastic in intent, to back again, I believe the inherently joyful attitude underpinning the original video carries the buoyishly optimism of sincere joy. reply brundolf 1Hah, very fitting way to put it :) reply magicinky 1Agree. For those not familiar with Rich&#x27;s famous use of etymology, see his 2011 presentation \"Simple made Easy\" as a good example: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoq.com&#x2F;presentations&#x2F;Simple-Made-Easy&#x2F;Side question: Rich seems to use etymology as a tool for original thinking and clear explanations. Are there other people who do this as well as he does? reply aporetics 1I don&#x27;t know about technologists who use it in writing or speaking like Rich, but you can trace writers&#x27; use of etymology to provoke thinking at least back to Plato. More recent, prominent examples would be Hannah Arendt&#x27;s acceptance speech in 1975 receiving Denmark&#x27;s Sonning Prize, in which she uses the etymology of \"person\", and at least Martin Heidegger&#x27;s essay The Question Concerning Technology in which he plays with several, including the etymology of \"technology\" itself. reply KingMob And yet, the word Hickey coined, \"complect\", is silly at best, and a gatekeeping obstacle to outsiders&#x2F;newcomers at worst. reply fnordsensei 59 Coined? https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;complect reply notduncansmith I’ve always been fascinated with language, and long had a hobby of looking up etymologies (my high school Latin teacher was great at pointing these out in class), but Rich’s style definitely pushed me to use it as a tool for thinking. Naming things is (famously) hard, but a strong command of language (and willingness to dig through the thesaurus) has lit the way through many difficult situations. reply Raticus79 I use etymonline for this kind of thing often. Our complex words are compositions of lots of forgotten meaning... I find it helps to retrace those steps.e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;system - see how it&#x27;s about composition, not so much about ways of doing things. reply agumonkey 1we see what you did there ;) reply culi 17 hours ago[flagged]| next [6 more] thanks for the lesson etymonline reply nordsieck 1> thanks for the lesson etymonlinePerhaps you&#x27;ve never listened to a Rich Hickey talk before but he&#x27;s notorious for riffing on the meaning of words. reply culi 1I got downvoted heavily but I genuinely do enjoy etymology. Wasn&#x27;t at all a negative remark, just a playful jabAnyways thanks for the explanation. I wasn&#x27;t in on the meme reply mattdeboard 1Go watch the classic Simple Made Easy and you&#x27;ll understand the comment.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;SxdOUGdseq4 reply capableweb 1It might have started with Rich, but by now starting a Clojure talk with the destructuring (heh) of a word is basically a meme at this point. reply koito17 1Quite literally a meme: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;jlPaby7suOc?t=75One of the funniest Conj talks ever. replyphillipcarter 1Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks inspired me to explore Clojure and functional programming in college. That led to a part of my career where I got to help advance an FP language (F#). Can&#x27;t say it was a raging success, but it wasn&#x27;t a raging failure either. Really happy things worked out the way they did, though. I still look back at my senior project, written in Clojure, from time to time and find it elegant in a unique way. reply neoncontrails 1My experience was similar. I&#x27;ve built far more impactful things since then, but at the end of the day, the software that I&#x27;m most proud of was a calculator, of all things, that I made in Clojurescript. It was loosely based on the final chapter of SICP, and implemented an hilariously metacircular approach to transitioning the state of the register machine. Since the implementation was way more interesting than the actual application, I used Processing to visualize the register machine as if it were a rudimentary ALU (which it basically was).If it hadn&#x27;t been for Rich Hickey, or Clojure, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d have the slightest inkling of how joyful and creative it can be to write software. It was an A+ experience, even if I&#x27;d be swiftly fired for trying to push logic like that into production. reply waffletower 1I pushed another build of a Clojure service into production a few minutes ago. There are companies that use it as a primary language you know :) reply pluijzer 1Second that and just to add, working fulltime with Clojure, apart from all the features and practical aspect is, really enjoyable. reply owenm 1FWIW, I started programming F# during your tenure at MS and in a couple of years it became a really capable cross platform option - partly MS, partly community, but definitely helped out by you. Thanks! reply lukashrb Picking up Clojure was the best learning experience I&#x27;ve had in my professional life. Rich is inspiring; I wish him all the best. reply chubot 1FWIW the original announcements in 2020:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cognitect.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;23&#x2F;Cognitect-Joins-Nubankhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23926407https:&#x2F;&#x2F;building.nubank.com.br&#x2F;welcoming-cognitect-nubank&#x2F;Very interesting story! reply rashkov 1next [3 more] one year ago today. I&#x27;m guessing the waiting period is over for Richedit: not one year ago at all reply apgwoz 1What year and month are you living in? In my timeline these links are 3 years, 12 days old. reply rashkov 1Whoops, yeah my mistake! reply adityaathalye 1This is awesome! One, it reinforces the ongoing maturing of Clojure, the language as a team project. Two, it portends cool new things to come; the kind that can only come from a place of personal liberty. Three, BDFL is retiring from an employer, headlong into his life&#x27;s work. I for one am cheering.(edit: typos, formatting) reply mdaverde 1This was exactly my take. This language just got a whole lot of significant focus behind it reply kaliszad 1Without Clojure and the immense effort of the community around it and ClojureScript, OrgPad would not be possible and the individuals on the team would probably be stuck in some academic or corporate structures instead of having basically a two-families startup&#x2F; company. So thank you Rich and thank you to everybody else, who supported You on the journey to create something that makes coding predictable, productive and almost fun instead of laborious work. ;-) reply cmiles74 Rich presented Clojure to our local software development group in 2008, I&#x27;ve been working with Clojure (both as a hobbyist and eventually professionally) ever since.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=dGVqrGmwOAwAt that time I had been working with Java for years, both the conciseness of the code and the interactivity were flat-out amazing to me. It&#x27;s saved me time and made me 100 times more productive.Congratulations to Rich, I am also extremely grateful for his work! reply loumf What a great event —- we were lucky to get in on clojure when it was just getting started, and he was looking for places to promote it.I reached out to him to come to our meeting because I met him when I took his Advanced C++ class at NYU continuing education in the 90’s. The class culminated in some advanced usage of his C++ functor library.http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tutok.sk&#x2F;fastgl&#x2F;callback.html reply yayitswei 1Congrats Rich! I met you at Stu&#x27;s house during a rousing game of Marvel Champions. Thank you for Clojure, Datomic, Cognitect, and your talks. Your creations have enriched my life in many ways. I hope retirement affords you ample hammock time! reply nathanyz 1Hammock time seems to be when the best ideas come around. Wishing Rich much more hammock time to ponder the life, universe, and Clojure. reply Jach 1Well deserved, I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what Rich does next in his free time. Clojure made me love programming again the same way Python once did (the whole Py3k fiasco soured that). I haven&#x27;t used it in quite a while (switched to Common Lisp) but I&#x27;ll always be happy to see more Clojure success. reply josefrichter 1I’m a designer and barely ever write production-grade code (coz I suck at it), but Rich has been my inspiration for years and I shared his talks available online across pretty much all design teams I’ve ever worked with, because they’re just full of invaluable experience and wisdom. Excited about Clojure future! reply drewr 1I was about to give up on a career in software development when I found Clojure in 2007.Rich, I&#x27;ll always be grateful to you for creating a language and community that got to the root of so many problems our industry still faces today. I&#x27;m confident it will continue to change the world as it has my own life. reply tmountain Congratulations Rich! Your talks are a wellspring of inspiration, and I consider you a software “hero” (the good guys vs the locking concurrency monster).I’ve been enjoying the fruits of your labors for more than a decade, and I have since introduced my daughter (a budding computer science student) to “simple made easy” and a bunch of your other talks.Thanks for everything you’ve contributed to the software world. It’s a happier place to be as a result of your efforts.Enjoy your retirement! reply runevault 1I remember being curious about Lisp and then seeing a new Lisp-style language was coming out for the JVM. I think back in the 0.2 days (unless I&#x27;m confusing versions with Phoenix but I feel like I started using both at that version number).I didn&#x27;t end up sticking with Clojure because I don&#x27;t enjoy the JVM tools&#x2F;ecosystem, but Rich&#x27;s talks gave me a lot to think about and I&#x27;ve been spending time in more FP and FP adjacent languages like Common Lisp and F# because of his thoughts and ideas.Thanks for everything and enjoy your retirement from professional development! reply tru1ock 1Simple made easy is the most impactful talk I have watched. Made a very big impact and I still think of it frequently. I never got into clojure but I am so glad it is around. reply michaelsbradley I feel the same. I was there in the room when he gave the talk: it was the first software-devs conference I&#x27;d attended and I was so green that I struggled to understand if he was making references to Haskell or another lang I&#x27;d been introduced to in the conference&#x27;s previous days by various presenters.Some days later I started learning Emacs, Clojure, et al. and I was&#x2F;am definitely the better for it. reply koito17 1Well-deserved retirement! I recall a history of Clojure paper mentioning that Rich was using his retirement savings in the years spent to build Clojure[0]. This provides a lot of context as to why he has wanted to maintain ownership and tight control of Clojure. Overall, Clojure is a brilliant piece of work and it has made software development fun and productive. Many great talks were also given by Rich over the years, and Datomic, though the licensing was restrictive up until very recently, has so much synergy with Clojure that it&#x27;s tough going back to Postgres. :)Congratulations, Rich.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.clojure.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;clojure-hopl-iv-final.pd... reply rryan 1Thanks for everything, Rich. You inspired me repeatedly. reply ignoramous 1Don&#x27;t think Rich Hickey is \"retiring\" retiring, just that he&#x27;s retiring from Nubank and \"commerical software development\".TFA: I look forward to continuing to lead ongoing work maintaining and enhancing Clojure with Alex, Stu, Fogus, and many others, as an independent developer once again... Retirement returns me to the freedom and independence I had when originally developing Clojure. The journey continues! reply lawrencehong88 Your work on Clojure and other projects has been truly influential, and your talks are some of the best out there. I remember watching your \"Simple Made Easy\" presentation and being blown away.The impact of Clojure cannot be overstated. It&#x27;s amazing to see how far it has come since its inception. You&#x27;ve inspired so many developers, including myself, to explore functional programming and think differently about software design. reply zengid 1Hey idk if Rich reads HN but if you do thank you for being a huge inspiration to me when I first started programming around 2014. You&#x27;ve helped change the world for the better. Cheers! reply aag Congratulations to Rich. Thank you for your immense contributions, especially in code, in software design, and in inspirational and thoughtful public speaking.I attended your presentation on Clojure at the International Lisp Conference at MIT in 2009, where we were celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of Lisp. After your talk, you were surrounded by admiring Lispers, including several of the elder statesmen of the community. These were people who, to put it mildly, were not known for being quick with praise. But one after another, they were saying things like \"This is the future of Lisp!\"By the way, I love the title. It reminds me of what I wrote when I started my last job: (call-with-current-continuation employer) reply datadeft 1Clojure was hugely inspirational to me and I could finally enjoy programming (focusing on algorithms). Rich has many great ideas, the database as a value is my all time favorite from him. reply buybackoff 1There are 16 \"talks\" mentions as of this writing, yet I want to reiterate how important, insightful, useful and fun his talks are and watching them have been. They move a listener to a (next level). Good luck, Rich! Have a nice time in a hammock :) reply JamesLeonis 1Clojure has changed my whole career, and many of Rich&#x27;s talks directly inspired my thinking about large systems. I hope retirement gives Rich the best Hammock Time! reply red_hare I got to work in clojure for two years and it was one of the most useful experiences of my career. I still \"think in clojure\" even now writing Python, Java, and Go. I can&#x27;t wait to use it professionally again someday. reply whitepoplar i&#x27;ved only dabbled in clojure&#x2F;lisp, but i&#x27;ve heard many lisp programmers talk about \"thinking in lisp\". can you share some of the particulars of what that means and why thinking in lisp&#x2F;clojure is beneficial? reply nlitened From my experience with Clojure, and how it changed my thinking:1. I stopped thinking about OOP, classes, “patterns”, frameworks, and mostly think about what data flows through the program, how it’s (they’re?) transformed and stored. It’s a much clearer view of a system, I think.2. I started being very conservative about mutable state. I keep mutable parts few and mostly on the top level, and compose program logic from practically pure functions. It helps with debugging issues immensely, and fewer issues arise because pieces can’t interact unpredictably.3. I stopped caring about types&#x2F;shape of data inside modules, and spec the hell out of it on module boundaries. IMO static typing is too strict for the former use case, and too loose for the latter. It allows more flexibility in implementation without actual breaking changes.4. I now enjoy developing in REPL, updating a running program, adding features in real time. It feels so natural. reply jwr 1Rich, thank you for creating and maintaining a tool that has helped me build a successful SaaS business. I could not have done this without your work and your insights. I also learned a lot from your talks, and I do hope to meet you again at one of the Clojure conferences. reply devgoth 1Curious, what SaaS space are you in where you found Clojure was a good fit? Would love to add this info to my brain-base for future ideas :) reply stefcoetzee PartsBox https:&#x2F;&#x2F;partsbox.com&#x2F; — an app that lets you take control of electronic parts inventory and electronics production. reply Clever321 1This is probably great news for clojure devs. It sounds like Rich just wants his autonomy back. Being able to choose exactly what you do, and do not, work on is precious. reply jturolla 1Problem-solving by Cognitect&#x27;s standards has transformed Nubank and my approach to work. Thank you for your time here, Rich. I greatly appreciate the knowledge I&#x27;ve gained while collaborating with your Cognitect colleagues. reply braza 1For whom is interested in some of the Rich&#x27;s talks, this is a great compilation[1].[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;changelog.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;rich-hickeys-greatest-hits reply WinLychee 1Thanks a ton Rich, Clojure is a real breath of fresh air in programming languages. I hope it continues to influence progamming for years to come, looking forward to seeing what you come up with in the future! reply elamje 1I, for one, and super excited to see how Rich and Clojure evolve post-Nubank. Clojure and Rich&#x27;s talks greatly inspired me and improved my software thinking skills - I can&#x27;t say thank you enough! reply mrcwinn 1I am personally grateful to your contributions and talks, Rich. Thank you for everything so far. reply cfcfcf 1A lot of people have mentioned Rich&#x27;s inspiring talks over the years.

I&#x27;ve only dabbled in Clojure but like many others I&#x27;ve found the language and your talks and ideas inspirational and exciting. A rare example of successfully simplifying things, referring to your deservedly famous talk. reply elwell Clojure(+Script) is a most illuminating language. It teaches (forces) you to structure the flow of data in a refreshingly simple way. reply nXqd 1with the new wave of languages emerging, and now the return of Rich being active with Clojure, I&#x27;m super excited and welcome back :) reply slifin 1Rich changed my whole career, I owe him a big debt! reply adamgravitis 1Orig article has lowercase ‘n’ in ‘next’, which makes more sense… reply seabass-labrax 1Agreed; this is a reference to the &#x27;next&#x27; function in the Clojure language. @dang, please could you change the title? Thank you. reply BaculumMeumEst 1i’m very grateful to rich for clojure, cognitect’s libraries&#x2F;tooling, and datomic. all of these have been well maintained, stable, and backwards compatible over the years.although he’s no longer working on datomic, i really hope cognitect values growing it. it feels like such an improvement over sql to work with. reply __jem 1Could not disagree more strongly that Datomic is well maintained. I&#x27;d view it as a significant liability in any organization using it without very good reason. My experience operationally supporting Datomic at even a moderate scale was a total nightmare and soured me on the Clojure ecosystem as a whole. reply BaculumMeumEst 1may i ask what you consider moderate scale in terms of daily&#x2F;concurrent users? i’ve had no issue with small projects, but i’m curious to know where it starts falling over reply bjoli 1I look in envy at what Rich has achieved. I think we all have ideas of how we would like a language to be, but actually sitting down and doing it to Rich&#x27;s extent is something else.As a schemer there are so many small things I would like to change that put me off using it for my personal projects, but regardless I have really enjoyed contributing to other people&#x27;s Clojure projects. It is not far away from what I would consider a good starting position for my own perfect language. reply germandiago Rich has become a legend for me. Btw, he is a remarkably good person at doing conferences. One of my favorites together with Andrei Alexandrescu. reply shriphani Thank you very much for your work Rich. I&#x27;ve seen your talks in person a couple of times and really admired the immense clarity of thought in every one of your ideas. And thank you very much for giving us Clojure - lots of fun memories. reply munro 1Amazing news. I saw a video cast of Rick during a meeting @ NuBank, and it looked like corporate life had sucked the life out of him [1]. So, I&#x27;m glad he got out of there, and I hope he&#x27;s able to shake it off like a bad dream. Building something like Clojure require radical thinking, and creative freedom. I can only imagine how trying to fit that into your weekly scrum sprint would be draining. And in the monthly meetings where they recite the corporate values.. shivers[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34781607 reply frou_dh 1Maybe you&#x27;re just used to seeing him in \"on\" mode (giving legendary conference presentations) and he&#x27;s more subdued when doing everyday work.It&#x27;s a bit distasteful to virtually follow him around and speculate about his mental health. reply KingMob After two years at Cognitect (pre-nubank), I can say that his talks are more subdued than his usual way of speaking (in slack, at least). He&#x27;s not as mild-mannered as he appears. reply munro Observing a public figure and expressing concern that their workplace doesn&#x27;t align with their passions isn&#x27;t prying into their personal life, or speculating about their mental health. What I&#x27;m saying is: NuBank is where hopes and dreams go to die, and corporate life more generally. It&#x27;s not about being \"on\" or \"off\" but about being in an environment one can thrive. reply meeuwer 1Funny, I too thought of that very video the moment I’d read the news. Rich was barely managing to feign just enough engagement without appearing rude. Happy he has escaped. reply javajosh 1Congrats Rich! You&#x27;ve been a big inspiration to go off and try new things, and to not be afraid to explain and explore the nuanced underpinnings of your design. reply aardvark179 1Thank you Rich for everything you&#x27;ve done over the years, and I&#x27;m really happy to see that Clojure continues to have a future. reply usgroup 1Best of luck in what follows! Clojure was the first Lisp I had ever learned. It was really easy to pick up and be productive with. It was data science I tried to use it for where it quickly runs into a myriad headwinds but it is a beautiful language all the same. reply err4nt 1Congrats Rich, and thanks for everything you&#x27;ve done, including being in inspiration for so many! reply brundolf 1Rich has to be my favorite thinker in this space, absolutely love his talks and the way he articulates things, and I often draw from his philosophies in my workBut, I&#x27;ve always been turned off to Clojure by the lack of static typing (I know spec exists, but it&#x27;s not really the same thing). I did a little project once to try it out, and even there I found myself spending time debugging basic issues like passing the wrong number or wrong kinds of arguments to functionsCan somebody sell me on it? I feel like I&#x27;m the target audience reply delegate 1It&#x27;s a matter of habit. Once you get used to it, you quickly know how or why it happens and where (especially when you follow the correct workflow, see below). Modern editors&#x2F;IDEs help a lot with the typos and wrong number of args.Some advice I would give myself when I started learning Clojure:Think not in types, but in data. It&#x27;s a different model that requires an &#x27;aha&#x27; moment, but it&#x27;s revelatory when you do get it.If you come from an OO language, think not in objects (Elephant), but in information about objects (elephant&#x27;s record, a map).Clojure is best served REPL driven.You can technically compile and execute, but this is not how the language shows its power. Here&#x27;s how I use it:I evaluate code in the REPL as I write it, reload definition on every change. Inside a `comment` block, I call the function I&#x27;m writing with the required arguments. I can quickly test how my function behaves in corner-cases. You then construct another function, which calls the first. You evaluate&#x2F;execute the function as you write it.So your program keeps growing, while you keep running&#x2F;changing individual parts of it.Once you get the hang of immutability and working with maps&#x2F;collections, this process becomes very engaging because of the short feedback loop between thought and result. reply Ketan-fullstack 1yeah REPL driven development is pure joy. Even back when i was a JS developer i was developing a lot of my algos in devtools and then copying them to code.It’s like having a conversation with your program while you are developing it. reply kaba0 1I am myself not 100% sold on it, except immediately after any Rich talk (honestly, that man could sell me anything :D), but it was eye opening to me that static typing is not an end goal in itself -- it might be a local optimum, but there are many more things it can&#x27;t express than it can.Also, in case of Clojure you usually handle FP code with no side effects, written in a REPL-driven, interactive style. This combination is not as prone to typing errors in my opinion than \"traditional\" dynamic languages like Python and JS.Another aspect might be the one being touched in the &#x27;Maybe Not&#x27; talk: Static types operate on a closed-world basis, where the sum of all relevant code is available at the same time. While this is common for certain kinds of programs, it is not really true of systems which have to interoperate with services owned by different companies alltogether, having to support many different versions of other interfaces at the same time. In that case you want to be liberal in what you accept, and arguably, dynamic types are better fit for this job. I am not 100% sold on this part, mostly just reiterating what I&#x27;ve seen others claim, notably Oilshell&#x27;s author is a big proponent of this thought. reply tumdum_ I have the same reactions to his talks. Yet, long term, I&#x27;ve never been able to convince myself that clojure, common lisp or more popular ruby&#x2F;python, are good choices for me in case of long running projects.I&#x27;m not sure how being liberal in what you accept is at odds with static typing. Static typing is about encoding the rules and shapes of the data that your program *knows* how to work on. It&#x27;s not preventing some other data that you don&#x27;t care from existing alongside.Even if I&#x27;m missing something, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that in most static typed languages you can fallback to some sort of \"any\" types. Seems to me it&#x27;s better to have option to use static or dynamic types in the same program, instead of being forced to do *everything* in dynamically typed way. reply kaba0 Well, spec is there, so it is not only typed vs untyped but static types vs contracts. With the added ability to generate test data, I think the field is much more equal, but as I said, I also tend to fallback to statically typed languages, but that’s mostly just out of conform. reply joshlemer 1It is difficult to explain why, but there is actually a positive case to be made for dynamic typing. Their benefits are real but a lot less immediately apparent than the benefits of static typing. I think this article from Eric Normand captured some of it https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ericnormand.me&#x2F;article&#x2F;clojure-and-types. In my opinion languages like TypeScript where the type system is only a verification system and has no effect on the runtime, combined with its emphasis on structural types, existence of union&#x2F;intersection types, etc, go a long way towards reducing the downsides of static types but not completely. reply kudokatz > I found myself spending time debugging basic issues like passing the wrong number or wrong kinds of arguments to functionsYou&#x27;ll get over that pretty fast. The bigger issue is looking at some code and wondering \"just what in God&#x27;s name is in that 10-level map and why?\" reply bokchoi 1clj-kondo helps with catching those types of errors. it works really wellhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;clj-kondo&#x2F;clj-kondo reply globular-toast 1As someone who&#x27;s written at least as much code in dynamically typed languages (Lisp, Clojure, Python) as static, I find this question interesting because I really don&#x27;t know how we know what types to pass. I think a big part is naming and following conventions. But honestly, somehow, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had problems figuring out or passing the wrong types to anything. reply nenadg 1Being an independent developer is much more fulfilling than any other personal accomplishment reply shove 1“just slip out the back, Jack Make a new plan, Stan You don&#x27;t need to be coy, Roy Just get yourself free!” reply the-alchemist 1Very smart guy, can&#x27;t wait to see what he comes up with next. reply nateburke Godspeed and thank you for the inspiration! reply valbaca (inc hammock-time) ; Congratulations! reply dudul 1While I never took the time to learn Clojure in depth or use it for any serious project, I feel like I&#x27;ve been deeply inspired by Hickey&#x27;s talks. A lot of the principles he promoted helped me so much in my career as a developer. reply User23 I’ll always have a soft spot for Clojure. It’s the only Lisp I’ve been paid to write applications in. Naturally I’ve written plenty of Elisp. I also use SBCL for personal scripts and data exploration, but that’s always been in support of delivering a solution in some other language.While, as is to be expected, I don’t agree with every decision made for Clojure, I find it to be an entirely pleasant Lisp to work with.So, kudos to Mr. Hickey, and thanks for sneaking Lisp back into corporate America! reply quantum_state 1Wish you all the best, Rich. reply smrtinsert 1I had a lot of fun in Clojure in the years I used it. Congratulations on your retirement Rich, well deserved for sure. reply fnord77 1we used clojure on a pretty big project. We made the decision to rewrite in java after it became clear that some fairly big libraries we were using weren&#x27;t being maintained.It was contentious, but I&#x27;m glad we dumped clojure.No matter how good a project is, it needs loads of support behind it reply typon 1Watching Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks turned me from a \"software is a grind\" kind of a guy into a \"software can be beautiful\". Highly recommend watching every single one of his talks if you are a young programmer. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you end up using Clojure or not - his philosophies and enthusiasm are infectious. reply draw_down 1I wonder if he’ll still give talks. I don’t blame him if not, but he’s really good at it.“Simple made easy” was a classic even if everyone proceeded to ignore the practical advice contained therein. And “Maybe not” is my personal favorite, a great discussion of requirements&#x2F;provisions and the downsides of option types. reply w-m 1I think Hammock Driven Development[0] deserves a spot in the classics![0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc reply justin_oaks 1Because of your comment, I watched this for the first time. I agree that it deserves a spot in the classics.For those who haven&#x27;t seen it, in the presentation Rich talks about figuring out the problem before you work on a solution. It&#x27;s definitely something that could be improved in myself and in a lot of people and organizations involved in software development. reply amelius 1Somehow this reminded me of Joel Spolsky, who apparently is still blogging. reply girishso 1He specifically said in the post that he intends to work on next versions of Clojure. Hope we have many more talks to hear from him. reply cutler 1I&#x27;ll never forget \"gem install hairball\" during his talk \"Simplicity Matters\" at Ruby Conf 2012 where he basically told the Ruby community they were doing it wrong. reply cwilper 1Yep, the guy has a gift. I&#x27;ve never touched a line of Clojure or looked at Datomic, but I&#x27;m repeatedly inspired by Rich&#x27;s talks, which I come back to often. reply colonwqbang 1This comment didn&#x27;t really deserve to die, did it? reply Jtsummers 1It wasn’t flagged. The user’s comments are all dead for a while now. reply zbobet2012 Maybe Not is an excellent video in some ways, but I just watched it a few years later and it reminded me that as much as I love almost every Rich video, I do wish he&#x27;d spend some time reading a little deeper on type systems and theory.For example his note about \"Categorical descriptions\" and then the explanation about maps&#x2F;and spec at 25:00[1] seems to indicate he&#x27;s unfamiliar with the difference between extensional and intensional type theory.The core difference between the two is extensional type systems decide equality on the observable behavior of the output. For example if two functions take the same input, and produce the same output extensional type systems&#x2F;theories say they are the same. The problem with this is type equality is then undecidable.Extensional type systems also struggle because there are more than one way things might be equal! For example two string might be equal if you ignore case, but unequal if you don&#x27;t. So if we want our type system to check if two functions are equal under case insensitivity an extensional type system will struggle with this.[2][3]Now in fairness to Rich, these concepts come more from the math community, especially the notion of types being equal under different paths, and in the case of Homotopy type theory are burred in unapproachable language and concepts... even by mathematicians standards.He also talks about select from spec, and it not preventing you from passing types broader types, and the necessity of specifying deeper type.[4] But, that&#x27;s just an eliminator defined on the type[5].Now most strongly typed programming languages suffer from the issue he identifies when talking about not making brittle systems [6] and the issues you get with coupling around taking a map&#x2F;struct&#x2F;product type C = A X B (e.g a map C = {A: something, B: something}), and you require A so you&#x27;re function should be good but you fail to compile because the function says A, and now you&#x27;re passing C.It&#x27;s frankly pretty annoying in places like Java that if you have a Point = Int x Int y you can&#x27;t use it in functions which take a Tuple = Int x Int y. I&#x27;d actually say that&#x27;s the common observation that both Rich, the Go Inventors, and the TypeScript folks have all made. You need to care about the extensional type of your input (and output) fairly often. And carring around the intensional type causes both dependency issues and just some general PITA&#x27;s.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug&t=1504s [2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4486995&#x2F;what-is-an-...

That includes the city of Bountiful, Utah, which earlier this year voted to build a $48 million fiber network to deliver affordable, gigabit broadband to every business and residence in the city. The network is to be open access, meaning that multiple competitors can come in and compete on shared central infrastructure, driving down prices for locals (see our recent Copia study on this concept). As you might expect, regional telecom monopolies hate this sort of thing. But because these networks are so popular among consumers, they’re generally afraid to speak out against them directly. So they usually employ the help of dodgy proxy lobbying and policy middlemen, who’ll then set upon any town or city contemplating such a network using a bunch of scary, misleading rhetoric. Like in Bountiful, where the “Utah Taxpayers Association” (which has direct financial and even obvious managerial tethers to regional telecom giants CenturyLink (now Lumen) and Comcast) launched a petition trying to force a public vote on the $48 million in revenue bonds authorized for the project under the pretense that such a project would be an unmitigated disaster for the town. (Their effort didn’t work). Big ISPs like to pretend they’re suddenly concerned about taxpayers and force entirely new votes on these kinds of projects because they know that with unlimited marketing budgets, they can usually flood less well funded towns or cities with misleading PR to sour the public on the idea. But after the experience most Americans had with their existing broadband options during the peak COVID home education boom, it’s been much harder for telecom giants to bullshit the public. And the stone cold fact remains: these locally owned networks that wouldn’t even be considered if locals were happy with existing options. You’ll notice these “taxpayer groups” exploited by big ISPs never criticize the untold billions federal and local governments throw at giant telecom monopolies for half-completed networks. Or the routine taxpayer fraud companies like AT&T, Frontier, CenturyLink (now Lumen) and others routinely engage in. And it’s because such taxpayer protection groups are effectively industry-funded performance art; perhaps well intentioned at one point, but routinely hijacked, paid, and used as a prop by telecom monopolies looking to protect market dominance. Gigi Sohn (who you’ll recall just had her nomination to the FCC scuttled by a sleazy telecom monopoly smear campaign) has shifted her focus heavily toward advocating for locally-owned, creative alternatives to telecom monopoly power. And in an op-ed to local Utah residents in the Salt Lake Tribune, she notes how telecom giants want to have their cake and eat it too. They don’t want to provide affordable, evenly available next-generation broadband. But they don’t want long-neglected locals to, either: Two huge cable and broadband companies, Comcast and CenturyLink/Lumen, have been members of UTA and have sponsored the UTA annual conference. They have been vocally opposed to community-owned broadband for decades and are well-known for providing organizations like the UTA with significant financial support in exchange for pushing policies that help maintain their market dominance. Yet when given the opportunity in 2020, before anyone else, to provide Bountiful City with affordable and robust broadband, the companies balked. So the dominant cable companies not only don’t want to provide the service Bountiful City needs, they also want to block others from doing so. Big telecom giants like AT&T and Comcast (and all the consultants, think tankers, and academics they hire to defend their monopoly power) love to claim that community owned broadband networks are some kind of inherent boondoggle. But they’re just another business plan, dependent on the quality of the proposal and the individuals involved. Even then, data consistently shows that community-owned broadband networks (whether municipal, cooperative, or built on the back of the city-owned utility) provide better, faster, cheaper service than regional monopolies. Such networks routinely not only provide the fastest service in the country, they do so while being immensely popular among consumers.

EruditeAardvark says: August 4, 2023 at 6:46 am 4th amendment issues? So, anything you tell the government can be used against you in a court of law, right? If the government owns the local internet, you’ve already told the government what you’re doing online. Or, you’ve told their computers what you’re doing online. Using municipal broadband to search for “good barbeque recipes” would be no different than going down to the local library, or city hall, or the police station and saying, “I’m looking for good barbeque recipes.” There would then be no 4th amendment protections when you’re online with municipal broadband? Never mind that most ISPs are so embedded with the government, and the 3rd party doctrine is so overgrown, that you don’t have any 4th amendment protections ANYWAY, but at least you could TRY to argue it in court.

It’s common for ISPs using common infrastructure (e.g., third-party cable and DSL providers in Canada) to not encrypt. Even long after the infrastructure providers such as Bell were found to be fucking with the traffic (throttling BitTorrent), they can still read all the traffic passing over their infrastructure. There really should be a standard form of encryption that’s supported by every home router and doesn’t limit packet size.

You should be more worried about corporations stealing your information with no rules or regulations to speak of beyond their own impossible to read “terms” or “privacy policies”. And these corporations have demonstrated to hand over your data all nicely organized at anytime that the government requests it. In addition, encryption works. This website, it’s encrypted. Your ISP and all the intermediaries along the way cannot read this page. Only the source and the destination can do so. If this weren’t the case, the government would not need to actually go to telecoms to demand your data. If you’re that spooked, you need to invest in a tinfoil hat. You should absolutely be using a VPN or TOR access point, you should not be posting comments to techdirt, and you should never login to any site. You should probably disable javascript and block all ads and other trackers. No doubt, because of the naivety of your post, you don’t understand much or any of what actually happens to your data and what you should actually be concerned about.

It is the subscribers to the service that will be paying for it. If you are interested you can go to the City’s web site and read their published FAQs. It details how the bond will be funded as well as how it will be repaid. Bountiful City already runs their own power company which has incredible reliability. I think over the past decade I have had less than 120 minutes total without power. The last major disruption I had was after a windstorm in the fall of 2011.

The idea is you can then decide whether to vote for that city councilor again. The city decides to invest in it’s infrastructure because the city was being harmed by a lack of internet. They intend to fund it by charging less for better service because that would still allow them to pre-pay the bonds off before they mature.

Internet options have always been an absolute joke here.I think a lot of people are going to be surprised in the near future (once the network rolls out to residents) just how cheap fast internet can be. And many people don&#x27;t realize just how awful Comcast&#x27;s uplink speeds are (1 Gb down won&#x27;t save your Zoom calls if you only have(1 Gb down won&#x27;t save your Zoom calls if you only haveif it&#x27;s truly 20Mbps up.I agree, though \"if\" is kinda key. And the number of concurrent users in your household. It can be easy to accidentally saturate your uplink if you have multiple users in your family and you aren&#x27;t coordinating. Or at least that&#x27;s been my experience. reply linsomniac 1Can&#x27;t say specifically for Zoom, but I do know that during the pandemic lockdowns, with me on Google Meet or BlueJeans, and my two kids on Teams for their school, our Xfinity 500Mbps service really struggled, and going to their Gigabit service was needed. ISTR that 500Mbps had 20Mbps up and gigabit had 30Mbps, but I might be off there.Switched to city fiber as soon as it was available and that&#x27;s been a blessing. reply Peanuts99 1Sounds like your local exchange couldn&#x27;t cope with the additional traffic rather than your line. reply mox1 1Yea that upgrade caused something else to happen, because like OP said 20mbps of actual bandwidth will support 3-4 people on Zoom,Netflix(non 4k!),gaming just fine.You probably got a different modem, with more channels, that opened up more actual bandwidth for you. reply linsomniac That&#x27;s true, I did upgrade from a 3-4 year old DOCSIS 3.0 Surfboard to a 3.1 Surfboard at the same time. I didn&#x27;t run any metrics to see what actual bandwidth usage was, I was just waiting for symmetric gig fiber at the time. reply cavisne A significant amount of issues that people have with cable internet is the bad modem&#x2F;router combination the ISPs ship.Outside the US coax based internet is rarer (its fibre or copper) so there isn’t a lot of good modem&#x2F;routers.So if you can’t get fibre, get an Eero or similar and at least replace your router. reply martinald 41 The actual issue which is often blamed on routers&#x2F;modems is that DOCSIS can be horrendously overcontended, especially on the upstream. It can really vary depending on the CMTS you are on, which means it can change street by street. When the upstream is contended your TCP ACKs get lost&#x2F;delayed which absolutely hammers performance.When people replace modems they often get an upgraded one that can support more&#x2F;better channels or DOCSIS versions. These new channels usually are much less contended (as only a tiny fraction of people have them at first), so it seems like a huge improvement, then as bandwidth demand grows and more people get new modems which can support the additional channel it begins to degrade.However, I would say that with DOCSIS3.1 and DOCSIS4.0 you are starting to get to a point where there is so much more capacity available and bandwidth growth has slowed down so much you are starting to see a lot less capacity problems IMO. replygibspaulding 1I was thinking the same.

As far as I understand, Comcast splits a small amount of bandwidth between a ton of homes, and then applies QoS based on how much people pay. If you buy the 200Mbps up tier, then you might get 200Mbps up for a little bit as a “burst” speed while they take away from the rest of the neighborhood, but not continuous.If it was comparable to fiber, then they would advertising the upload prominently like fiber ISPs advertise it. reply kortilla Fiber is not immune to this problem either.

Same with EV charging.Places like this should require property owners who rent out their properties to get with the beat or leave. Property managers who don&#x27;t install gigabit fiber, EV charging, and induction stoves aren&#x27;t welcome in this community. This is Silicon Valley, not Utah, yet the Utahans have us one-upped already. reply greggyb 1I have had great experiences with home internet from the likes of Comcast and Verizon for a decade now. What became true a decade ago? I moved to a city where there were two viable broadband providers (Comcast + municipal fiber, then Comcast + Verizon in two different locations). My conclusion: it doesn&#x27;t matter who is offering the service, it matters that there is more than one viable option.Municipal fiber is not special due to the ISP being municipal government. It is special because it is a path for a community to force a second option into existence.Lest anyone misunderstand this post: this is an observation in wholehearted support of the linked article. It is wonderful that a community is able to move forward with getting better internet service.Additionally, I am not trying to brag. I am very lucky to have been able to relocate as I have, and that my locations have had multiple viable options. I recognize that most of the US does not have this flexibility. Again, I offer these observations as full throated support for communities pursuing municipal fiber.Edit, summarizing: Competition works. In my experience, the dominant factor determining ISP quality is the presence of another ISP with a substitutable offering. reply troyvit 1I agree with you to a point, but man there are ways that Comcast and Verizon just can&#x27;t compete with Municipal. If I want to upgrade a modem I can read some reviews of the best Wifi6 routers or whatnot, or I can ping the guy I know who works for my provider (who also basically introduced me to my partner of 8 years) and get his take on it. The closest thing I&#x27;ve gotten to that with a Comcast person was shooting the breeze about easement rights for his van and how that neighbor calling the cops on him is going to be disappointed.When I call for support it&#x27;s some lady a mile away who answers on the third ring, and if I break my modem she apologetically asks if it&#x27;s OK if somebody&#x27;s there in an hour to fix it for me for $35.It&#x27;s like buying local vegetables except its internet and cheaper. You can&#x27;t beat it. reply greggyb You make some good points. I was very focused on speed&#x2F;price&#x2F;quality of network service in my post.This also reflects my own biases and preferences. All I want from an ISP is a reliable uplink at a decent price. The last piece of equipment that is the ISP&#x27;s is the ONT. I built my own router. I used to have my own DOCSIS modem, but I gave that to a family member a while ago and have had fiber since.Ideally, I never talk to someone from my ISP. I have had Fios since 2017, and I have only had to talk to them once, to cancel service when I moved. So, as long as I have had Verizon (importantly, in homes that were already wired for Verizon and a competitor), they have been an ideal ISP.I recognize that my preferences are far from universal, but my original post did not reflect that. reply Accujack 1>Competition works. In my experience, the dominant factor determining ISP quality is the presence of another ISP with a substitutable offering.Yes. This is the root of the problem with Internet access in the US. The post-Reagan relaxation of antitrust enforcement has allowed many monopolies to grow, and combined with lobbying at all levels of government has created the stagnant environment we have now for Internet and wireless services. reply leshow > Municipal fiber is not special due to the ISP being municipal government.Sorry but that&#x27;s not true, it is special because it can do things a large profit-maximizing ISP can&#x27;t. It can give free internet to schools and libraries, it can give subsidized rates to lower income neighborhoods, it also brings control of the ISP under democratic control.By removing from it the need to be an entity seeking to extract maximum profits, a whole host of other things can be done. reply loufe 1I understand your point, and to that effect I&#x27;d opt for a duopoly over a monopoly ten times out of ten. That said, even duopoly for internet options sucks. Here in Canada your choice between Bell&#x2F;Rogers, or Bell&#x2F;Vidéotron, or Bell&#x2F;Shaw, etc. makes almost no difference vs the choice between a single one of them. They just bought out almost all independant providers in the country (we&#x27;re all enjoying huge discounts right now that are obviously temporary, and were used as a tool to undercut them to make the purchases pass more easily).I would argue it&#x27;s more important to have more than one option, but it still DOES matter who those options are. reply glitcher 1My experience has been similar. After many years of only having one viable choice of ISP, once another upgraded their lines and could compete suddenly things changed very quickly.I recall a tragically comic phone call to cancel service with Cox (of course you were required to do all cancellations over the phone). I told them the speed and price I was getting from their competitor, which was already installed and confirmed, and they tried to convince me those numbers were not possible! Hahahaha! Bonus, the new provider&#x27;s downtime also proved to be far less over the next few years. reply slaymaker1907 Yes, a few years ago I was paying half of what my mom paid for internet through affinity, despite only living 15mi away, because I also lived extremely close to Google Fiber. They’re well aware of when they have actual competition and will tune prices accordingly. I’m surprised there haven’t been massive lawsuits about it considering how obviously they are abusing their regional monopoly status. reply boredpeter I disagree, it’s special because it’s owned collectively by the people living in the community without some for-profit middleman rent seeking inflated payments for sub-par service. This isn’t some victory for capitalism and free markets. This is the government having to step in because of the failure of the market to provide a basic 21st century service to the people at a reasonable price. The same way the market has failed to provide healthcare access at a reasonable price in the US.I think your conclusion is also incorrect. A for profit corporation only has incentive to maximize profit for their shareholders so if they are the only provider in town they will likely jack prices up. But a municipality&#x2F;town does have incentive to improve the lives of their constituents and even if you don’t believe that argument, there is always the argument that a fast reliable internet at a reasonable price could spur economic investment in the community. So a single municipal owned internet provider could be a decent option without competition but that’s unlikely to be the case for a for profit business. reply oblib 1We had CenturyLink for over 20 years here. They recently sold us to Brightspeed who raised our monthly fee to $60 for what&#x27;s really the very lowest end of \"Highspeed\" access (if that). The first thing Brighspeed did was throttle our bandwidth.Our local electric co-op (White River Valley Electric Cooperative) is currently laying fiber optic lines to all the homes and businesses they serve now and will be offering real high speed internet (gb both up&#x2F;down) next year for $30 a month to all their customers first, and then those who are not that live in the area.When we moved here in the 90s and bought our home we really didn&#x27;t think about who was providing our electricity, but we&#x27;ve learned since there is a huge difference.Just this week we had a vicious storm that blew power poles down and 1000s were without power. Our power was back on in around 36 hours, others nearby were down for 3+ days.Those who live outside the co-op are paying more than twice as much for power depending on the time of day and load on the grid.We have a flat rate that&#x27;s lower than their lowest rates.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whiteriver.org&#x2F;fiber&#x2F; reply jedberg 1You don&#x27;t even need a co-op for this. Local, municipal, non-profit power companies are like this too. The city of Santa Clara, in the heart of Silicon Valley, has its own power company. Their rates are less than 1&#x2F;2 of PG&E (which they are surrounded by) and they were for example offering green energy back in 2005. And as you point out, were much better about maintenance.I really miss being served by SVP. reply eppp 1Munis will almost always beat any other electric provider including rural coops because their customer per mile is a multiple of a rural operator. It ends up making the coops look terrible because we have to cut an order of magnitude more vegetation for the same amount of customers. reply hedora 1With PG&E, all of that is rounding error. They’ve been hollowed out by decades of fraud and infrastructure neglect.In addition to dealing with inflated California construction costs, they also routinely block construction projects and urgent home repairs. reply labcomputer 1Add corruption to that. PG&E was insolvent (liabilities >> assets) and required a bailout from the state (because nobody would pay more than zero dollars for the company).That the state didn&#x27;t simply take the assets and indemnify the previous owners for the liabilities (thus turning it into a giant \"municipal\" power company) speaks to corruption in CPUC and the state in general. reply oblib We may pay more than urban areas around us, I&#x27;m really not sure, but not all rural areas around us are serviced by the co-op and they do pay quite a bit more.We have 3 damns generating power very close by us, two that are pretty big, but I doubt that has much to do with our rates. If anything it&#x27;s slowed the need for a natural gas or coal fired power power plant nearby, but there are those within 50 miles near the bigger metro areas around us. No nukes close by though. reply labcomputer 1> Their rates are less than 1&#x2F;2 of PG&EAnd their website is approximately 3141 times better than PG&E&#x27;s. Electrical reliability and customer service are better, too.It&#x27;s hard to overstate how much better municipal power companies are compared to for-profit ones (LADWP is better than SoCal Edison). reply bombcar 1Co-op utilities (and other forms of small local utilities) can have problems, but in general I prefer them.

We had a fiber ring around town since &#x27;96 or something, used for traffic light management I guess?

I&#x27;m pretty sure that a big part of the cost is funded by a U.S. gov grant designed to get rural areas high speed internet. reply sschueller 1Corruption and attempts to control markets are everywhere and if you don&#x27;t fight them they will win.In Switzerland fiber needs to be accessible to all providers which results in many places having fiber run by the local power providers and the large state owned telephone company. This is what allows providers to offer 25gbit synchronous for under 70 USD per month.However this did not stop the large state owned communication provider to attempt to kill competition by no longer running p2p (1 or 4 fibers directly from a home to the local exchange bulding) fibers but p2mp (1 fiber to a splitter in the street with a backbone to the exchange) which requires active splitters (the environmental impact of this was completely ignored). This automatically limits any other provider from offering a faster service than the phone company.Even after a court case and then an injunction they spent millions to expand this network thinking they can somehow perswaid the courts and use people complaining that they can&#x27;t have fiber because of an injunction (they told customers on the phone that fiber is available but can&#x27;t be connected due to a court case). In the end they however back peddled and it appears they will loose the case now.Thanks to the small provider that took this to the courts (init7) it appears we will keep a network open for competition and future proof.There are fines pending but those are a 2 edges sword. The tax payer effectively pays it since the majority stake belongs to the tax payer. So a large fine is bad and a small fine is bad because it&#x27;s not a deterrent. The executives that caused the mess&#x27;s are already mostly gone (hence the back peddling) but the correct action would be to claw back their pay and bonus or something like that so the next \"hot shots\" don&#x27;t try such shit again. reply throw0101b 1> providers to offer 25gbit synchronousWhat use cases are there for residential (or even most business) connection to be 25Gb&#x2F;s (or even >10 Gb&#x2F;s)?

These days the average new AAA games approach 100GB. the biggest ones like Ark Survival are 400GB.A 5 minute download vs a 50 minute download is a totally meaningful difference in quality of life.

That was an upgrade I did from 50 down about five years ago. The reason we upgraded was because at night when everyone was streaming things would slow down and we&#x27;d be fighting with each other. The 1g stopped that issue.Right now the 1g is more than enough. But I&#x27;m sure there will come a time when it won&#x27;t be. Maybe we&#x27;ll have 8k streaming from AR headsets that require one stream for each eye. Or who knows what else.I&#x27;d rather get ahead of it.And right now it still takes a few minutes to download a movie at full quality. I have to say that when we went from 50m to 1g it was nice to be able to download TV shows in seconds. reply RajT88 1High latency is not the same thing as low throughput.It is wild how many people do not understand this.Latency can inform throughput if your windows do not scale. But the whole reason we have window scaling schemes is to optimize throughput in the face of latency.With regards to remote server performance - yeah - CDN&#x27;s exist for this reason. I may not saturate my gigabit connection while downloading game patches, but I get close enough. I have also had the experience on a different ISP of having spent more time downloading and installing updates than I ever did playing my PlayStation. reply oefrha High latency means low throughout in the beginning in addition to the latency itself, and for most things on the web by the time the window is scaled up the request is already done. Sure, if you download 100GB games every day or have other special needs like torrenting pirated movies Linux ISOs all day, 10GbE (which also requires expensive equipment) helps, but for 99.9% of people, once you hit 1Gbps, latency is what affects your Internet experience the most, bandwidth is hardly ever an issue. reply tw04 1Latency drives throughput for a single session - but most people that want that kind of bandwidth don&#x27;t care about a single stream going at the full 25Gbit. Things like torrents or lftp will allow you to create multiple data streams for a single file if you need higher throughput than you can get through a single session.If you&#x27;re self-hosting something like a web server, no one user is ever going to hit you with 25Gbit of requests, it&#x27;ll be coming from multiple sources. reply nickstinemates 1Peaks.

Swiss GDP per capita is ~20% higher and most importantly, the population density of Switzerland is 213 people per sq km versus 34 in the US (and undoubtedly that number is even lower in Utah which has one of the lowest population densities in the US). reply monocasa 1That doesn&#x27;t explain why dense, high GDP parts of the US don&#x27;t have Switzerland&#x27;s speeds. reply sschueller 1You could make the same statement when it was time to wire the US for power or telephone lines.

Pre-2021 your options may have been more limited. reply babypuncher 1This still reads like a success story of municipal networks to me. It is much easier to hold public institutions like this accountable than private regional monopolies. A private company is not subject to the whims of the Democratic process, and regional monopolies ensure that free market forces have a much harder time cultivating competition or disruption. The fact that your courts were able to put an end to these practices and the executives responsible are gone while Comcast continues to operate unchecked throughout large swaths of the US really demonstrates this.In Utah, we&#x27;ve been fighting the corruption and anti-competitive practices of Comcast and CenturyLink for over two decades. And despite many small victories like the recent one in Bountiful, many residents are still getting screwed over with no viable recourse. The city my parents live in fell for Comcast&#x27;s intense lobbying a few years ago and now they have no real path towards getting a meaningful alternative. reply paradox460 I&#x27;ve got Utopia 10Gig at my house, and its honestly the best, most consistent internet I&#x27;ve ever had. Bountiful&#x27;s new fiber will be an expansion of Utopia, which is awesome.Fun bit of information: Utopia (Utah&#x27;s fiber+wireless broadband network) is 100% Ethernet. Which leads to some really interesting circumstances. During a period there was construction somewhere upstream of me, my internet got cut a couple of times. It would always fairly quickly come back, but sometimes my IP would change, as would my promised speeds. Investigating why it was slow once, I discovered that I had a Comcast IP address. Called up the support and asked what was going on, and we eventually tracked it down: Someone had bridged a Comcast business network and Utopia connected network somewhere, and when my router couldn&#x27;t get DHCP from the ISP, it grabbed one from this Comcast network, and happily sent my traffic through their network. Got that fixed pretty quickly. reply martinald 35 That&#x27;s a horrendous security defect. Your network connection should be isolated from other customers on the network via a vlan or similar. reply ronsor > Someone had bridged a Comcast business network and Utopia connected network somewhere, and when my router couldn&#x27;t get DHCP from the ISP, it grabbed one from this Comcast network, and happily sent my traffic through their network.It&#x27;s called unofficial redundancy.

I will literally skip an otherwise perfect property if it doesn&#x27;t have access, or the ability to add access forToo bad Sonic doesn&#x27;t have fiber in my office area, but I hope they will at some point.Aerial (telephone pole) deployment is vastly cheaper than trenching (and many business parks and newer neighborhoods were built with conduit buried with AT&T&#x2F;Comcast already in them), so Sonic&#x27;s deployment generally has followed where there are aerial options to utilize. That said, I think (micro)trenching is becoming more viable, so I believe plans to start delivering to some areas through that are moving ahead. reply dylan604 1This aerial deployment maybe cheaper, but there is on going rent for having your line on someone else&#x27;s poles. I have no knowledge of those rental agreements other than they exist. I wonder if the trenching style deployment also has some sort of agreement with the city?? Whenever I do see the trenching teams installing fiber lines, I&#x27;m always curious why such a small amount is being installed. I know there are many many fiber strands in the \"cable\" they are burying, but why just the one. Every connection needs a pair, so how ever many strands are in that \"cable\", there&#x27;s half that number of connections. reply kbenson 1> This aerial deployment maybe cheaper, but there is on going rent for having your line on someone else&#x27;s poles.I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s much, if anything, depending on the location. My understanding is it&#x27;s governed by public use policies, since it&#x27;s public infrastructure. I do know it requires some work for those putting more infrastructure on there to figure out the new load and stress and submit plans for required work, and sometimes poles are identified that are degraded to the point that it requires replacement or retrofitting, but I can&#x27;t recall whether that&#x27;s a burden taken by the public utility, the company looking to utilize the space, it&#x27;s shared, or it&#x27;s situational and depends.> I wonder if the trenching style deployment also has some sort of agreement with the city?? Whenever I do see the trenching teams installing fiber lines, I&#x27;m always curious why such a small amount is being installed.You do need to get permits in both cases. I think microtrenching is easier to get permitted because it causes less issues with the road. You&#x27;re cutting a line an inch or so wide, so there&#x27;s less worry about car tires compacting the filling material and making the road bumpy. Since it&#x27;s deep but not wide, it could also be they&#x27;re stacking multiple runs one on top of each other, which at any one point in time may look like a very small amount being inserted (I don&#x27;t know, not my department).> Every connection needs a pair, so how ever many strands are in that \"cable\", there&#x27;s half that number of connections.Depending on what you mean by \"connection\", they don&#x27;t. Fiber strands are split out with optical splitters, one or more times, so a single strand back to the CO can handle multiple actual installation locations (but not too many). Planning out how many you allow generally and how much you&#x27;ll allow max is a balancing act. Sometimes you deliver to a building with multiple units and you don&#x27;t want to drop a line to every unit but you don&#x27;t want to serve twenty units off a single strand that might be split once upstream already). reply jp191919 1$600&#x2F;mo?!?

Because of Mormonism, I&#x27;d bet Utah simply has more community than most other places. reply BryanLegend 1We have a decently well run state government here. reply macintosh-hd 1Municipal ISPs are banned in cities with populations over 50k by the state of Utah so it&#x27;s not that great. reply barbazoo 1Is there an actual practical reason for this that would explain it or is it just lobbying? reply yamazakiwi 1Most places in the valley already have Google Fiber and it&#x27;s still expanding, if that&#x27;s valuable information to you. replysharts 1Why would capitalist enterprises want to derail others? It is unfathomable reply jmyeet 1I used to think that almost nobody who opposed socialism actually knew what socialism is. That&#x27;s true but what I&#x27;ve realized more recently is that almost nobody who defends capitalism actually knows what capitalism is. It&#x27;s just a kneejerk reaction without thought.The fight by large telcos against municipal broadband is the perfect representation of capitalism vs socialism.Municipal broadband is a fundamentally socialist idea. The people of a town, city, county or whatever essentially own the means of production, being the Internet connectivity in this case.Comcat, AT&T, Spectrum, etc perfectly exemplify capitalism: these companies exist solely to extract as much value from the end-consumers as possible while doing the least possible, all for higher profits for shareholders. it is pure rent-seeking and using the political process and the courts to create and maintain monopolies to keep those profits as high as possible.All of this is entirely obvious within the context of the labor theory of value [1] and dialectical materialism [2].The last mile should be muncipally owned, operated and maintained and Internet access should be a basic utility like water and electricity.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Labor_theory_of_value[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dialectical_materialism reply manicennui 1prev [–] Corporations should have no fucking say in things like this. The blatant corruption in the US is incredible. reply dang 1Maybe so, but please don&#x27;t post unsubstantive comments to Hacker News. reply _joel 1Not just the US, this kind of lobbying and weaponisation of PR happens all over the world, unfortunately. reply polygamous_bat 1Except when it happens in Bangladesh people have the guts to call it \"corruption\", unlike US where it&#x27;s \"lobbying and weaponisation of PR\". reply rzazueta 1\"Lobbying and weaponisation of PR\" is just artisinal, organic, farm-to-table corruption. reply polygamous_bat 1IMO it&#x27;s the opposite, like everything else we have optimized corruption, packaged it in a shiny package, and convinced the populace we either can&#x27;t live without it or there&#x27;s no way around it. reply larkost 1I think it is a little more nuanced. The case in this article is pretty bad, and I am certainly inclined to call it both a bad, and an inappropriate influence. But that is mostly because of how they are trying to disguise it as not being from the internet companies. But they are not handing money to a government official (personally) in order to get what they want, and I want to reserve the word \"corruption\" for things like that.However, I do think that companies should have a voice in how they are regulated. Not control by any means, but a voice. This voice needs to be out in the open (so no backroom deals), and clearly labeled what it is. And regulating this sort of thing is really difficult to get right (in part because of legislators self-interest in these things).Part of the problem here is that money, and the advertising it buys, has become so necessary in our politics. So if money is necessary for people to be able to hear \"free speech\", how can you prevent or limit people from spending that money? And if the only way candidates can get their message heard is to spend a lot of money, of course they are going to listen to those people and corporations who can provide that money (directly or indirectly). And if that is the way they are going to be listened to, then of course rich people and corporations are going to spend the money. It is a nasty cycle.More generally, the vast majority of the opinions people hear (through advertising and also on various media) are presented in forums where only one side is speaking. To take the case of (Former) President Trump&#x27;s indictments, his supporters are simply not hearing any voices talking about the merits of the cases. They are only hearing people talk about the potential politicization. Yes, there are lots of places where the merits are being debated, but most people have no interest in broadening their horizons. And the gatekeepers on the political Right have found it is easier to capture attention through rage, and being fair or balanced does not engender the rage they are selling. reply tremon 1they are not handing money to a government official (personally) in order to get what they want, and I want to reserve the word \"corruption\" for things like that.Can we call it institutionalized corruption then, when the handing of money to policitians is made legal through PACs? reply specialist 1Lobbying (petitioning one&#x27;s government) is fine. Bribery and corruption are not.When spending cash money to garner influence is considered Freedom Speeches™, something is very, very broken.Further, great wealth inequity and democracy are incompatible. Sure, there&#x27;s a balance to be worked out. All reasonable observers will agree our current setup is way out of balance. reply geodel 1Right. I am seeing tons of people who want to speak truth to power are moving to Bangladesh from US reply datadeft 1prev [–] Just like making high fructose corn syrup legal in the EU? reply extraduder_ire 1This seems tangential, how is it related?I&#x27;m pretty sure HFCS is legal, and I&#x27;ve even eaten products containing it. reply larkost 1The argument is that it is U.S. companies that are insanely competitive at making high-fructose corn syrup, and that the EU has largely banned it as a shield to European companies making other sweeteners (e.g.: sugar).I would argue that the ban on genetically modified organisms (GMO) is a cleaner example of European protectionism (not that all other countries, the U.S. included, do not also practice protectionism).You can find lots of sources for the fact of this near-ban, but this one is nice and pointed: \"Because of its low cost and long shelf-life, HFCS is used widely in manufacturing many food products, including candy, throughout the United States. However, due to strict EU regulations, HFCS is banned in much of Europe\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sugarjoy.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;hfcs-gmos-and-trans-fats reply Accujack 1>U.S. companies that are insanely competitive at making high-fructose corn syrupThey&#x27;re competitive because it&#x27;s subsidized, which is what makes it cheaper than sugar in the US. reply babypuncher 1The whole reason soda tastes better outside the US is because bottlers in most other countries still use real sugar. HFCS is cheaper in the US because we heavily subsidize corn production for some reason.So it seems weird to me that people would complain that the EU made it harder for Coca-Cola to make their product taste shittier. There is a reason there is a huge market for \"Mexican Coke\" throughout the US. reply martin8412 prev [–] HFCS is not banned in the EU. There&#x27;s just no reason to use it. Sugar is cheap as is. reply",

It&#x27;s what makes their results so much better than Google&#x27;s: where Google&#x27;s results are usually drowning in garbage websites, Kagi comes built-in with a great set of spam filters, and on top of that you can adapt your own personal list of good and bad domains as you go! reply scarmig Didn&#x27;t Google have this feature like two decades ago (blocks, at least)? It&#x27;s not quite a search innovation, more like a \"caring about your users as a business strategy\" innovation. reply jsnell Yes, they had it for a few years a decade ago.If you think through the feature, it&#x27;s not at all obvious that it&#x27;s a good idea for an established search engine targeting the general public [0]. But even then it might be a great idea for a search engine that&#x27;s trying to establish an initial niche. It doesn&#x27;t even matter whether the idea actually works well in practice: if 100k people think that manual curation of search result domains is a high value feature and are willing to pay for it, the feature has done its job.[0] I wrote a more detailed comment on why a few months ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=34294800 reply nine_k I think you miss he point.The usefulness of a per-user block list is not fighting outright spam. The statistical filters, etc, as applied by the search engine, work best here, as you correctly state.The point is to remove certain well-known sites with information about well-known topics, which is unhelpful for the particular user, me. That information is technically not spam, but it&#x27;s on a wrong level, badly presented, etc.That is, if I search some info about a particular CSS trick, I want MDN be on top, some professional blogs be near top, and w3schools be on the third page. For someone else, priorities may be different, but I know what to expect for the search queries I issue, and I&#x27;d be glad if the search engine helped me.Equally, certain domains are known to be more rich with information I happen to seek, like reddit.com, so I&#x27;d like to give them a boost. Some other people may prefer something else, or not give any boost at all.So, this is personalization, not anti-spam. If Google kept it, it could even bring important insights into what ads I would skip and what would click :)Maybe 90% of users would ignore this feature. But the 10% of power users maybe disproportionately important: with more disposable income, more clout on social networks, more decision-making power. I suppose that the shutdown of Google Reader, which affected a relatively small number of users, affected all the wrong people, and destroyed so much goodwill that the losses from it are many orders of magnitude larger than whatever savings from not supporting it any more. reply jsnell > That information is technically not spam, but it&#x27;s on a wrong level, badly presented, etc.I&#x27;d count that kind of low quality site as spam, and the problem is that there&#x27;s a basically an infinite supply of them. The boost feature is more interesting in that the curation is at least not a never-ending task. New high quality sites that I know about don&#x27;t pop up all that often!It&#x27;s still not an entirely robust feature since you&#x27;ll need to do a lot of quality work to prevent mediocre results from a boosted site from shadowing better results from unboosted sites, especially for users with a ton of boosts. But that quality work is much easier to justify when the manual curation is one of your core selling points and used by a large proportion of the customers vs. when it&#x27;s a feature in a dusty context menu that basically none of the userbase interacts with.> Maybe 90% of users would ignore this feature. But the 10% of power users maybe disproportionately importantI&#x27;d be shocked if the number of users for this kind of feature was anywhere near 10% of all search engine users. Something like 0.1% seems much more likely. But again, if those 0.1% really want that feature it&#x27;s a great fit for a power user search engine.It still doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s a feature every search engine should obviously have. reply catach > you&#x27;ll need to do a lot of quality work to prevent mediocre results from a boosted site from shadowing better results from unboosted sitesThat strikes me as a non-goal. As the search engine, you can&#x27;t know what attributes a user is valuing when they boost, and so you can&#x27;t know when it&#x27;s appropriate to override that boost. \"Better\" is subjective, contextual, and comes in thousands of different flavors. reply viraptor > New high quality sites that I know about don&#x27;t pop up all that often!But when they do, how are you going to know if all you see is the mediocre spam instead? No, I want to block the domains which are never going to be a good result. This may actually surface things I will want to boost. reply ajsnigrutin > The point is to remove certain well-known sitesLike pinterest.Goddamn pinterest.Just the amount of times i&#x27;ve used \"-pinterest\" in search is staggering. reply lelanthran > I think you miss he point.I don&#x27;t think he did. He did say \" it&#x27;s not at all obvious that it&#x27;s a good idea for an established search engine targeting the general public\"And looking at the data from the link, other than wikipedia and reddit, all the pinned domains are for developers or technical folk.So it looks to me that kagi is not popular to the general public. If it was, programming-related sites wouldn&#x27;t so heavily top the popular list. reply PhilipRoman Is w3schools still that bad? I know that it used to be awful in the past, but IIRC they managed to do a complete 180 in this regard. I&#x27;m not into webdev but I occasionally check how to use a particular feature on there and it always delivers a pretty good reference. reply mattmanser It is better than it was, but I&#x27;d still much prefer to see the mdn, it&#x27;s much better. reply zarzavat 12 I can see a certain kind of absolute beginner enjoying w3schools more than MDN, it’s a little less intimidating.When you’re first learning a subject you often want simple lies more than complicated truths. reply hobofan w3schools garnered a reputation for stating outright wrong facts. I think they rectified that part, but I think the way they break down information is still far inferior to MDN on basically every topic. reply jjoonathan Get back in line, citizen! You will read the blogspam, and you will like it. reply bambax From your original comment:> Third, some people will probably block domains they shouldn&#x27;t have blocked, and then have a bad user experience in future searches as the sites with genuinely best results is blocked. And then you&#x27;re only left with only bad options: ignoring the users&#x27; stated preferences which they&#x27;ll hate, or serving bad results that they&#x27;ll also hate.That&#x27;s a real possibility, but it can be addressed by presenting a block that would say, for example \"results from blocked domains\" or some such. reply cabalamat > that&#x27;s trying to establish an initial nicheWhich suggests to me that while kagi might be good now, if it gets popular it may undergo enshittification in an effort to monetise its popularity. reply pokeymcsnatch It&#x27;s a paid service and all their competitors are &#x27;free&#x27;. Enshittification doesn&#x27;t fit their business model, they&#x27;d go under in a heartbeat. reply rchaud Cable TV didn&#x27;t use to have ads, until somebody figured out you could charge the customer and have other streams of revenue as well.For Kagi, it&#x27;s a matter of when, not if. Capitalism guarantees it. reply yakubin An even sadder example of it: Windows. reply esafak No, it does not. They are free to create adjacent products to boost revenue as long as they want without debasing existing ones. reply TeMPOraL And the oxygen in the room you&#x27;re in is free to concentrate in a single corner of it, making air in the rest of the room unbreathable.Both are technically possible, but so extremely unlikely, that you can rely on them not happening. reply yard2010 35 My ML prof in university used this as an example for something that could happen but is highly unlikely. Each particle of oxygen can be in either half of the room so it&#x27;s like 1&#x2F;2 to the power of the number of particles (avogardo?) chance that all the particles are in one half suffocating the ppl in the other half. He was such a great guy. reply SQueeeeeL See also, Whatsapp reply ocdtrekkie A key point is that Kagi raised its prices already so it was sustainable. The reason most services get worse is because they are downright unprofitable and it is impossible to get them there without either making them drastically worse, or raising prices, which free sites can&#x27;t do.Kagi has already put itself on a path where it doesn&#x27;t have to make itself worse to cover its expenses, because it is already covering them. reply Nextgrid People would use it to block all the spam sites that host copious amounts of (potentially Google&#x27;s) Ads&#x2F;Analytics, and since they might actually start finding what they&#x27;re looking for this will reduce engagement on the search results page and with the sponsored links.This is bad for Google&#x27;s bottom-line thus why such a feature was removed and will never be coming back. reply 7839284023 Use this: \" uBlacklist is a Google Search filter for Chrome, Firefox and Safari. \"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iorate.github.io&#x2F;ublacklist&#x2F;docs reply alternatex 20 Interestingly not supported on Firefox Android. It&#x27;s the first time I come across an add-on that doesn&#x27;t work on both. reply deadbunny 4 Firefox on Android only supports a handful of curated add-ons. You can apparently create your own collections or install anything with Firefox Nightly but I&#x27;ve not done this. reply nomat it works for duckduckgo as well. reply sam1r Yes, but 99.9 percent of its users do not know these filters&#x2F;features exist. Still don&#x27;t.Google didn&#x27;t prioritize it&#x27;s visibility [intentioally] over the past 2 decades as well. Maybe it&#x27;s time to do so.I can&#x27;t imagine how tedious the process may be to make very small changes on the main google home page. reply r00fus Ah, but then they acquired Doubleclick (or was it the other way around?) and a monopoly was formed. reply captn3m0 The feature definitely existed after the DC acquisition. reply davidmurdoch They did. And w3schools was in my list back then. reply scarmig And can&#x27;t forget about expertsexchange. reply delfinom Even 2 decades later, you can never unsee it reply p1mrx It&#x27;s only obvious when you format it that way.They primarily used \"Experts Exchange\" and http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experts-exchange.com&#x2F; reply mmh0000 Yeah, now they use that, but back in the good old days of the internet, they did not. reply scarmig Nowadays that&#x27;s the domain, but only after they did a migration from expertsexchange.com awhile back. reply stock_toaster and penisland reply JKCalhoun therapist.com reply tmpX7dMeXU Yeah. Engineers hate when something isn’t a technical feat. The best innovations are usually software people working with the right people from other disciplines to make a thought out CRUD app. reply codezero when google first came out it had nothing to do with that, it was that they offered as strong algorithmic ranking in the feed. Before that the search providers ran in a few ways (by my memory):1. Sell the first few results but make it look organic (this all happened behind closed doors and I knew a few people who paid for such results)2. Hierarchical&#x2F;topic based collections of links (This is what Yahoo was famous for in the 90s if I remember correctly, I&#x27;ll keep saying that because it was a long time ago!)The whole \"google cares about you\" was an outcropping of the organic flocking to google because of their reliable and algorithmic results that just seemed trustworthy, they capitalized on that and it honestly lasted a lot longer than I expected before they really started being evil. reply yosito 28 This is the feature that I originally started using Kagi for, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best innovation. Their default search results are already dramatically better than Google&#x27;s, and their AI tools which can summarize individual results or give you a quick answer for your question based on the first page of results are way more innovative. All of those features combined and their subscription-based business model make Kagi by far the most innovative player in search at the moment. reply belkinpower Yeah, this is _the_ reason I started using Kagi. The default results aren’t significantly better than Google&#x2F;Bing&#x2F;DDG, but being able to block and boost domains is a killer feature. reply resolutebat I find the default searches already superior for the sole reason that they&#x27;re not sold to the highest bidder. reply int_19h Indeed, the sheer amount of sponsored links on some Google searches is such that you have to scroll a full page down to get to actual results. reply lamontcg I was just about out of my free searches on Kagi before I ever realized it could do this. That feature converted me to a paying user (although I&#x27;ve got browser plugins to block domains from Google search, but boosting is something I can&#x27;t do there). reply xbmcuser I have been using this with ublock for a long time. It actually makes me wonder if that is the reason I dont have the complains about google search that I read about herehttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;quenhus&#x2F;uBlock-Origin-dev-filter reply mnmalst Wasn&#x27;t aware of these list, thanks for mentioning it. It&#x27;s a nice addition to ublock origin. reply eviks You can exclude garbage on google with a browser plugin (can&#x27;t boost, though, and Safari) reply lolinder Yeah, boost and pin are just as important to me. Google inexplicably doesn&#x27;t show Wikipedia on the first page much of the time anymore, and I can fix that with Pins in Kagi. reply karaterobot Pinterest was certainly the first site I blocked.I&#x27;ve never understood the hate for w3schools. No, it&#x27;s not MDN, but it&#x27;s not offensively bad either, and it&#x27;s been a helpful reference from time to time. If w3schools comes up first in a search, I trust that it probably has the answer to whatever very simple question I must have asked, unlike something like Pinterest, which will just be spam no matter what. reply joshspankit 0 I’ll still click on w3schools but it’s not bringing much to the table and usually I’ll end up back at MDN anyway (big respect to the MDN teams).Given the choice I’d probably block w3schools just so I save those couple seconds a month when I click back and in to MDN. reply matsemann See https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3fools.com&#x2F;It&#x27;s more a historical thing. Over a decade ago they were always on top, with often wrong&#x2F;misleading&#x2F;bad practice&#x2F;insecure&#x2F;simplified stuff. And lots of people thought of them as some kinde official entity because of their name similarity with W3C &#x2F; w3.orgIt&#x27;s much better now, though. But for lots of old school frontenders the reputation stuck. reply Avamander 37 It still heavily lacks in quality in some areas, while making it seem like it is well-written. I just recently started blocking it. reply jraph It has probably improved a lot. It seemed like garbage a few years ago. Today it feels trustworthy and useful. I don&#x27;t know what changed.I still prefer MDN. I trust it to have up to date information. It was always very good and it has also improved, including the interactive examples. reply CrimsonChapulin 56 They had functional but inaccurate articles (in terms of best practices and long term solutions). I avoided them for a time but I must admit they listened and amended their tutorials, which is more than a lot of websites can say. reply mouzogu > hate for w3schoolsw3 usually just gives me the answer i need to get shit done asap.mdn is a technical reference. useful. but irritating when you just need a quick explanation.w3schools = :&#x2F;mdn = :O reply zacmps It was offensively bad and incorrect, and while I&#x27;ve heard it has improved since I think a lot of people just remember how it used to be and don&#x27;t use it. reply navanchauhan I never knew W3Schools had such a bad reputation. I learned HTML from that site almost a decade ago and found it pretty helpful.I loved their Try it Online! reply 0x073 I knew many developers that used w3schools that thought it was official source because w3c, I know it&#x27;s not completely the sites fault but they named the domain. That&#x27;s one reason I dislike, additional the quality of w3schools is compared with mdn for beginners that are not interested into the details. reply int_19h Historically, at least, it had a lot of examples that technically did what they were supposed to do, but in ways that you really, really, really shouldn&#x27;t be doing them. reply dvh I just remember them gluing strings in how to use MySQL in PHP article. reply forgotmypw17 I agree, I love w3schools.They provide real examples for real-world uses right on the page. reply bunga-bunga > it&#x27;s not offensively bad eitherIn your opinion. W3fools only pulled an “it’s ok now bro, don’t sue us” update. Anytime I give it a go, I’m still presented with inaccurate and harmfully incomplete results.Want to learn from a “for dummies” website? Be my guest. But my hate is fully justified. reply catsarebetter w3 schools was a good resource, but to me it often feels like fluff. reply MrVandemar The top-ranked sources really show Kagi&#x27;s current demographic. It obviously is attractive to programmers and IT professionals.I wonder if they are interested in attracting users with more diverse searching requirements, and if so, how they would be able to actually reach them. reply freediver > It obviously is attractive to programmers and IT professionals.I would say this is a blessing as it allows us to focus on things that matter to tech-savvy users (Kagi founder here).> I wonder if they are interested in attracting users with more diverse searching requirements,Yes, we are :)> if so, how they would be able to actually reach themThrough our family plan [1], most likely. This is how I got my family members on board a paid search product.I might add that \"Kagi for Kids\" is the first true attempt at having a search engine made specifically for kids, with a host of parent controls, which was never a thing in the last 25 years for some reason.We are also seeing more and more users who are not techies (but are tech-savvy) becoming members. This may be followed by non-tech savvy users in the future. I do see the first signs of the age of ad-supported, \"free\" search, coming to an end [2].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kagi.com&#x2F;family-plan[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.kagi.com&#x2F;age-pagerank-over reply int_19h One thing that I don&#x27;t quite get about your family plans: why is the smaller plan ($14 for 1.5k queries) cheaper per query than the larger one ($20 for 2k queries)? Not that it&#x27;s a big difference, but it feels off somehow. reply Gareth321 Product prices are determined by the willingness for consumers to pay for them. Families (especially kids) have different priorities and search habits to IT professionals, for example, which appears to be a common persona for them. It is likely that they bet that the four extra users and child friendly options are what families care about, rather than a high number of searches. It&#x27;s also likely that families simply don&#x27;t need that many searches, and in limiting them to 2,000, they discourage abuse (six professionals purchasing one family plan). reply eloisius The work you all are doing is incredible. Thank you, and I’ll be a paying customer as long as you keep the show going. I’m notoriously stingy about paying subscriptions for tech services, but the money I pay for Kagi directly impacts my productivity. It feels like a distant nightmare when I think back about the days when I spent time sitting through blogspam results on Google :p reply jonReadingNews I was hesitant to configure my partner’s devices (family plan) to set as default engine but eventually convinced them and they haven’t even brought it up once since. I assume no news is good news! I would be less hesitant to recommend to other non-tech friends&#x2F;family if it were easier to configure as default on Safari. Heck, I’d even entertain gifting subscriptions. The quality of results for me has been incredibly reliable. Enjoyable, even. And, I didn’t even take the time to start configuring these kinds of rules. Love this. Great product.

And please make it based on Firefox preferably.Thank you. Lots of love to Kagi, though I&#x27;m not a paying user yet but I do love what you folks are doing and want to f*ck Google. reply latexr 42 > And please make it based on Firefox preferably.The macOS browser is based on WebKit. If the team can’t justify the Linux version yet, changing it to a whole different engine (and one which is notoriously hard to embed, by admission of Mozilla itself) is even less likely. reply saagarjha 54 Why Firefox? What’s wrong with the WebKit they’re using already? replyradicality Hi. Thanks for the great service!Any chance you would consider adding cryptocurrency payments as an option? You would load up the account with these prepaid credits, and then use whatever plan you want until the credits run out. This is how I pay for Mullvad and works well for me.I think would be nice as I see kagi is aiming to be privacy-forward. And it’s nice knowing that such a payment is a one-off and won’t forever keep renewing. reply freediver We have a discussion on our forum [1] about this.

You’re all doing such good work and I’d much rather not see it wasted on indulging some techno-anarchist nerds reply Gareth321 56 There is a lot of value currently tied up in crypto around the world, with increasing difficulty in using it on products and services. Offering a way to use this value would open additional revenue streams for Kagi. The challenge is in conversion, as many banks do not support the practise, and laws are becoming tougher with regards to crypto payments. reply omnimus 43 So it would be useless to Kagi… reply ajkdhcb2 Yikes, that thread reflects so badly on Kagi to me. Over a year of people explaining why Monero is needed if you actually cared about user privacy, with no results. Weird claims that it is difficult to implement. Can only conclude that the company doesn&#x27;t actually care about user privacy reply dehugger Or, more likely, they didn&#x27;t want to take on the additional burden of transacting in funny money of dubious worth. reply ajkdhcb2 Hope you enjoy linking all your search queries to your credit card, really. This attitude is unbelievable to me. reply nottorp And pray tell, how does one acquire this Monero that you&#x27;re defending with religious fervor? By linking your credit card to some \"currency\" exchange that may or may not already be under investigation for fraud? replySemaphor > We are also seeing more and more users who are not techies (but are tech-savvy) becoming members.I’ve seen quite a few marketing people and researchers in (their discord channel) #introduce-yourself reply sundarurfriend > The top-ranked sources really show Kagi&#x27;s current demographic. It obviously is attractive to programmers and IT professionals.And specifically, American programmers and IT professionals. reply phreack I feel that programmers are the main audience that knows life can be better in software. A typical programmer might be so offended by Pinterest&#x27;s awfulness that they&#x27;ll look for any way to prevent it, knowing it can be done. Some might go for an extension like uBlacklist, others might be so furious that they want to pay money to stop this somehow.But seriously, I do think that unless you work with software, it&#x27;s hard to even imagine alternatives to the big players could exist. reply sockaddr Ok wow, seeing these lists might have just made a customer out of me. I’ve been vaguely aware of Kagi and know the general premise but this made it real. reply OJFord Similarly, I had no idea about this feature, but I now know I want it... I think I just need it to be cheaper, maybe $5 unlimited (or enough for me, which I think is certainly higher than 300, probably higher than 1000, at least without behaviour change) and I&#x27;d be inI assume it&#x27;s a bit chicken and egg - marginal costs of new customers&#x2F;extra searches is relatively low, it&#x27;s the crawling & development&#x2F;SRE that&#x27;s expensive - so should (or at least could) come down as more people adopt it, driving further adoption from relative cheapskates like me?It seems great, but I use DDG &#x27;bangs&#x27; (which are also a Kagi feature) loads of times a day, rather than going directly to websites - especially !w & !wikt, !arch & !aur & !archpackages only slightly less - I&#x27;d blow through the monthly limit in no time on that alone. (Which also seems a bit unfair, they&#x27;re just redirects, not using index, there&#x27;s an argument they shouldn&#x27;t be included? I suppose if you&#x27;re so motivated you can work around by using Firefox&#x27;s feature for it instead of search engine anyway.)Edit: oh wait, I just found in the FAQ that &#x27;bangs&#x27; actually aren&#x27;t counted as searches. I may have to trial it, see how many searches I actually use how quickly. (And how reasonable the 1.5ç overage seems in my usage.) reply slaughtr I was worried about the 1000 search limit, and it has so far (since beta) proven not to be a problem. I use Kagi for all my searches on all machines and my phone and average 800 or so a month. I haven’t modified my behavior at all, and consider myself a heavy search engine user.I have a theory that I would actually need to do twice as many searches with Google or DuckDuckGo or whatever, since the SEO spam would force me to do more term refinement. With far less of that (and a tiny tiny bit of settings tuning) I get better results much quicker. I’d test it but I have a job to do and can’t swallow the idea of going back to how bad the other viable options really are. reply ericbarrett That sounds appealing, but there are so many $10 and $15 monthly warts on my balance that the burden of adding another (with even a minor overcharge fee) feels pretty high. I wish their lower tiers had double the current limits. reply Semaphor > I have a theory that I would actually need to do twice as many searches with Google or DuckDuckGo or whateverFWIW, I counted searches I made with DDG (by parsing my FF history export) before joining the beta, and it was slightly over 1k, with Kagi my searches are in the 700-800 range. reply abtinf I’m a former DDG user and current paying Kagi customer. One critical difference I’ve noticed is that frequently used bangs with DDG, but almost never with Kagi.I think this is because over a very short period of usage, I applied block&#x2F;lower&#x2F;raise&#x2F;pin to various domains, and now my search results are almost always perfect.That said, I understand the value of going directly to a site. On that front, Kagi makes it trivial to define new bangs. reply _delirium > Kagi makes it trivial to define new bangsLately I’ve moved to doing this at the browser level instead of via a search engine. It’s not a huge speed difference, but in principle it seems wrong to have an extra round-trip out to a search engine to redirect me to another site, when I can set up the keywords locally and go directly. Firefox makes it easy to do: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;kb&#x2F;how-search-from-address... reply eloisius Same. I never hit the limits of my Kagi plan, but it motivated me to add Firefox @searches for things like PyPI, where I know exactly what I want. reply Semaphor > One critical difference I’ve noticed is that frequently used bangs with DDG, but almost never with Kagi.I use bangs all the time and wouldn’t even use Kagi without them. It’s so convenient when I know I want results from a specific page. reply antoniojtorres This matches my experience as well. Kagi has useful results much more often. reply elxx Kagi doesn&#x27;t charge you for bangs. (Disclaimer: Happy paying Kagi user here, just FYI) reply eloisius Oh really? I just commented about how this misconception made me change my behavior. Wish that was more clear, or that I had higher reading comprehension. reply freediver In general, assume that we pass down the savings to the user whenever we can.Redirecting a bang costs us basically nothing, so it does not count as a search.Also reloading the same search within a short time (~2 minutes, for example coming back in browser after clicking through a search result) does not count as an additional search as we served cached results.Another tip: We have decent documentation (that is also open source and editable) and you can access it quickly from Kagi with the !help bang, for example!help how are searches countedwill land you onhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.kagi.com&#x2F;kagi&#x2F;plans&#x2F;plan-types.html#how-searche... reply jackson1442 yeah since it’s not actually doing a search and is just making a redirect based on the pattern it doesn’t have a cost associated with it.more info: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.kagi.com&#x2F;kagi&#x2F;getting-started&#x2F;faqs.html#how-are... reply jon_richards Defaulting to DuckDuckGo and using a bang for kagi when I don’t immediately get what I want would be nice.

Soooo many stack overflow scraper sites too god I hate those. reply TillE It&#x27;s incredibly annoying to be searching for a thing, and get a result from Pinterest that&#x27;s just a bookmark of that thing.As far as I know, this is more a failure of Google&#x27;s inexplicable algorithm than Pinterest doing anything specifically bad. reply munk-a Pinterest does a whole lot specifically bad - they tend to trap users with login prompts on entry and make it impossible to see the full image. If I&#x27;m searching for a meme to DM to someone or a photograph of a landmark Pintrest is something I avoid like the plague. It&#x27;s essentially a black-hole for images - people pin them and then they are lost forever. reply ricardo81 Pinterest could simply tell robots to &#x27;noindex,follow&#x27; the page to help search engines understand there is no utility in it appearing for a search. But agree, perhaps it shouldn&#x27;t rank first anyway.Guess it depends on whether it&#x27;s UGC entirely or whether the CMS could note these kind of pages. Again, shouldn&#x27;t be hard if it&#x27;s just a simple link as the main content of the page. reply WillPostForFood I like Pinterest, it is a useful site. But it is basically a (image) search engine itself, so it&#x27;s pages shouldn&#x27;t be in Google results.

I get why you block it - so MDN is shown first. That’s fair. Im just saying its not a fault of W3. Because I tend to agree with that guy. W3 really isnt bad. A bit simplistic, and MDN is better, but its not bad. reply junon W3 has a bad reputation because, at least a long while ago, it was rife with blatantly false or misleading information. reply rchaud There&#x27;s literally working code demos for everything on the site that&#x27;s front-end or client-side. reply int_19h Yes, and historically those code demos were often wrong in many important ways (like not working in all browsers, or insecure). They are much better now but reputation is hard to recover. reply lotsoweiners Yeah the simplicity is what I prefer about W3schools. A lot of times I want a quick code example and don’t really want to go in depth about how something works. reply rascul > Nothing about that makes w3 a poor source.I&#x27;m sure you meant w3schools but w3.org is where a lot of the official documentation for web technologies is and not affiliated with w3schools. reply ocdtrekkie That&#x27;s why Kagi&#x27;s personalization is so cool here. Kagi doesn&#x27;t have to block it, and neither does the user. The user can just lower it, and raise MDN, because that&#x27;s what they want in their search, and it helps them more. reply thayne I have similar feelings about baeldung.com. It isn&#x27;t that the content is inherently bad, but it is super annoying that when I search for a java class the first few results are from baeldung instead of the official javadocs. reply ktosobcy How wonderful to differ - I actually love bite sized, \"tldr\" or baeldung and almost always get what I need. (not to mention that quite often javadocs of many project are just empty or severely lacking... ) reply cuteboy19 I think the java official docs are rarely explanatory, they are just plain description with a lot of fluff and useless information reply deely3 17 Yeah. Search for class, open official docs, read very short description. And still have absolutely zero idea is where this class is used, and how it should be created, and what alternatives. reply lolinder From what I understand a lot of it is residual. W3schools has always been directed at beginners, but it also used to be wrong rather frequently.This site [0] used to be the hub for the hate and now has a message saying that w3schools has gotten better. If you&#x27;re curious, they still have a link to the web archive that has all the mistakes documented.The most egregious of their mistakes to me:> […] professional web developers often prefer HTML editors like FrontPage or Dreamweaver, instead of writing plain text.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3fools.com&#x2F; reply chocolatkey W3Schools was essential in helping me get to where I am today. Learning HTML and PHP through it was great, my favorite feature being their \"Try It Yourself\" button, which opens up a sandbox where you can play around with PHP, HTML, CSS, JS etc (note it&#x27;s not just client-side languages like MDN does). For beginners, this kind of thing is essential, and this was before MDN was good. And even now, I compare MDN vs. a W3Schools page, and the overall design and content is more welcoming for beginners. reply version_five As others have said, it&#x27;s t least in part because of the beginner orientation. I&#x27;m not a web developer and I found it useful when looking up some html&#x2F;css stuff for a project years ago. But for example in python I find it infuriating to see geeksforgeeks or whatever at the top of my search results. I want SO or documentation for most stuff and consider the rest spam.All that to say, I think beginner oriented well SEO&#x27;d content is going to be polarizing, which makes Kagi&#x27;s approach great for everyone, if you want it it&#x27;s there, if it annoys you, quickly block it reply zvolsky w3schools used to be one of the best resources ~15 years ago. Today I intuitively avoid it because1. The ads make the fan on my laptop spin (I prefer to avoid ad-heavy websites over using adblock)2. The &#x27;Try it yourself&#x27; button is fake. It doesn&#x27;t actually run the code and doesn&#x27;t let you edit it.3. It is not a good reference. To give an example, the last time I visited w3schools was upon searching \"react ul li\", which landed me on the page https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3schools.com&#x2F;react&#x2F;react_lists.asp . Ironically, the reason why I was searching the term, was to find advice on setting the \"key\" prop in on list items. The w3schools example doesn&#x27;t even mention the prop and produces errors. Compare that to the official reference which ranks much lower in Google search: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;react.dev&#x2F;learn&#x2F;rendering-lists#where-to-get-your-ke... . reply dixie_land my 2 cents:w3schools tend to oversimplify the concepts to the point of technical inaccuracy.and the tone of the articles read more like tutorials instead of reference manuals. reply ghayes Yeah MDN is the de-facto reference guide for web frameworks. W3schools feels like beginner tutorials. For me, I want “what happens if I pass undefined as the second arg to this function” and w3schools doesn’t answer that. It’s fine as a site, I suppose, it was insane when it outranked more complete websites. Off topic I see this more and more with Stackoverflow where semi-related questions outrank official docs. reply phyzome In the 2000s, it was very often egregiously wrong. People remember. reply drewtato I&#x27;m also a fan of the CSS selectors page, but it&#x27;s an exception. Especially for JS stuff, MDN is usually better. reply nonethewiser It used to be worse. But overall I agree with you. Its accurate albeit often a bit simplistic. reply bobmaxup I learned from w3schools in the early 2000s, and helped instruct my high school web design course with it.I wish I hadn&#x27;t. There were many innacuracies, outdated advice, and over simplifications.I came up on a slew of weird and inconsistent sources, and that bit me when discussing things in college. I often felt over confident because of these type of sites.W3schools (used to at least) gave a very shallow intro to programming languages (PHP, ASP, etc), and I remember a professor basically laughing at me once because of that misinformation.So, maybe others had experiences like mine.EDITThey also had these weird \"certifications\" for technologies that were basically really dumbed down quizzes. They were made to make people feel special, I think. Dunno, I did them all, and I almost got laughed out of class. reply malikNF Yep. W3schools is one of those sites that helped me begin my career. I still find it useful to look up something in a hurry. No idea why so many people hate it. reply CobaltFire w3 schools is on several of those lists, including \"raise\", so your opinion is shared by others. reply jasonpeacock I love that they also provide, in the same page, the option to update your own configuration. Easy pre-emptive blocking&#x2F;boosting :) reply deepspace Yes, that forward-thinking UI design immediately stuck me, and reminded me again why I am a loyal customer. reply mbork_pl I might be tempted to use Kagi (especially for my family), but the thing I&#x27;m afraid of is the quality of search in non-English (specifically Polish) internet. Anybody knows how does that work? reply smodo 2 It works well enough for me, can’t say I’ve really looked back since I signed up. reply pzmarzly 30 It has a quick region switcher like DDG (a must-have for me), and the results are way better than DDG. Give it a try!I just did a Google vs Kagi vs DDG test on \"grzyby marynowane\" (pickled mushrooms, usually pickled champignons, a common snack on Polish family gatherings).Google: Starts with recipes, then there is Allegro (\"Polish Amazon\") where you can buy jars of them, then Google page ends (10 results&#x2F;page).Kagi: starts the same, but there is more (20?) results&#x2F;page. It continues with some podcast episode about pickled mushrooms on Soundcloud, a Wikipedia page, some more recipes in Polish and English and finally a Pinterest page (:rage:).DuckDuckGo: first page is just recipes. I decided to give it a bigger chance, so I checked out a second page. There you have pretty unrelated articles like \"where to pick wild mushrooms\" and an Allegro link in between.However, as happy Kagi user I still have to note that they are using Apple Maps for maps&#x2F;POI search. As you well know, they are quite useless to us compared to Google Maps, so I keep using !gm bang to get redirected. Bangs work almost like DDG, the only difference is that they must be at beginning or end of your search (DDG lets you put it in between words too). reply ptrrrrrrppr I started using Kagi specifically because of more accurate results in Polish comparing to other search engine.A teraz jestem płacącym użytkownikiem, już chyba z pół roku :) reply developer93 The first 100 searches are free, just need an email address that can be a throwaway to sign up, so you can check it for yourself with just a bit of time expended. reply iamflimflam1 35 You have to feel for anyone who works at pinterest - they just be getting that “are we the bad guys vibe”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;ToKcmnrE5oY reply abtinf The single biggest deficiency of Kagi is Apple’s exclusive control over the list of selectable default search providers in iOS Safari.It is infuriating and is the one thing that has caused me to seriously try other browsers on mobile. The problem is, they are all terrible in some small paper cutting ways (including Orion, though that has been rapidly improving). reply S201 > The single biggest deficiency of Kagi is Apple’s exclusive control over the list of selectable default search providers in iOS Safari.Seems like a deficiency of Apple products to me. I know it&#x27;s beating a dead horse, but this is what happens when people willingly buy into a closed system they have no control over. reply abtinf Yup. My guess is all the search providers in the list are paying Apple to be there. Kagi will never make the list. reply nottorp Funny thing is, people are buying Apple products because the alternative is Google, and why are you paying for Kagi, because you trust Google? reply justintoon I realize this is probably not the solution you want, but there is an official iOS Safari extension that will intercept all address bar searches and route them to Kagi. I don’t remember how much it costs, and it doesn’t seem to work super well with private browsing, but it’s better than nothing and works well for what it is. Ymmvhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;kagi-search-for-safari&#x2F;id16077... reply abtinf I should give it another try. I believe the last time I tried it, I was frustrated because of the private browsing login issue. Maybe one day (probably not) Apple will allow setting a simple URL for custom search engines.Orion needs a lot of polish, but I am hopeful they will get there. reply justintoon I took a closer look and the iOS extension supports entering a “session link” which allows the Kagi redirect to work in private windows. Entering it is a bit cumbersome—you have to first open a private window and then any random page so you can see the extension button in the address bar, at which point you can tap it and then the Kagi icon to get to the session link field—but it appears to stick after that and the redirect works as expected (although you do get a brief flash of Google or whatever — they suggest changing it to DDG which looks a bit smoother).Agree that it feels hacky, but sometimes you just have to take what you can get. reply deviantintegral You can generate a Kagi login link with a token and save that to your favourites. Then, click that link in the new private tab window before searching. reply Nextgrid The Kagi Search app&#x2F;extension linked above can persist your session link in its settings and thus works in private mode or after clearing all cookies. reply chronicsonic 49 I use XSearch to replace the default Safari search engine, it also supports bangs.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;gb&#x2F;app&#x2F;xsearch-for-safari&#x2F;id157990206... reply freediver Would you be kind to document the top 3 pet peeves you have with Orion iOS on OrionFeedback [1]. We are keen to improve.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;orionfeedback.org reply abtinf Every time Kagi comes up, a lot of folks say it is too expensive. That it should be unlimited. That if it was just $x per month, then it would be worth it. That they feel uncomfortable about the limits.I will simply say that I cannot imagine going back to being a “user” of a “search provider” over being a paying Kagi customer. It is the single most critical service I worry about losing.If they octupled the price tomorrow, I would murmur an expletive under my breath, then thank god that they didn’t choose to go down the path of fucking me over by materially changing the business model to adtech, and continue paying them.I am actually not sure what at what price point I’d drop the service. I’d probably start looking at canceling less used subscriptions first. Another shitty Gal Gadot Netflix movie has negative marginal value for me.If you haven’t tried it for an extended time and used its core features, then you don’t get it and no one can explain it to you. “Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.”Edit to add: this is search we are talking about. It is literally your entry point to the world’s entire body of knowledge and ultimately affects your decisions and actions both daily and over the long term. And nearly everyone is perfectly happy to let it be run by companies that make more money when they lead you astray to click bait, hot take, content farm, and AI generated sites. Garbage in, garbage out, both in software and the knowledge you depend on to live a thriving life. reply deepspace Funny story: Earlier this week, my Kagi results when to shit. If I made the slightest spelling mistake in a query, it would return nothing. Often it would just return nothing for a query where google would return millions of results.It got so bad that I started getting in the habit of typing &#x27;g&#x27; in front of searches to go straight to google, but then I was hit with the usual google issues of SEO sites, spam sites and low-quality results.I wanted to cry in frustration because my wonderful Kagi experience was suddenly gone, and was furiously typing up a support ticket when I noticed that the \"verbatim\" choice was somehow permanently selected, after I tried it a few days ago.Lessons learned:1. Kagi really is hugely superior to google as a daily search engine2. \"Verbatim\" should not be a sticky choice, or at least Kagi should enclose \"verbatim\" results (or lack thereof) in a bright pink frame or something. reply vluft 38 yup. I pay $25&#x2F;mo happily but would go up to at least $100 without blinking. I do between 1k and 2.5k searches per mo, and also use the summarizer a bit. Compared to DDG (which I was using before), I haven&#x27;t done a bang to fall back to google in months at least. DDG searches were better on some topics but on average slightly worse than google for me, Kagi is fairly consistently better and being able to block domains is fantastic. reply unshavedyak Sidenote, i&#x27;m a very happy $5-10&#x2F;m Kagi user. However i also happily pay $20-$30&#x2F;m for ChatGPT or Phind. I hope one day Kagi consumes some of these shares too (to convert my $30 to Phind into $30 for Kagi).That might sound insane, i&#x27;d think so too, but FastGPT[1] is pretty damn good. It&#x27;s not trying to be Phind, but still, quite surprising to me that it exists. reply Dah00n Not all HN users are US tech employees though. How much US$25 is differs a lot. reply nottorp 2 Starbucks lattes i think?Elsewhere the lattes are much cheaper though.Common problem with a lot of SaaS offerings.I made a Kagi account when they had a free tier, thinking I&#x27;ll test and then decide on paying or not. Then they dropped the free tier and with the # of trial searches limited, I&#x27;d need to make a conscious effort to use it to test instead of just trying it when DDG fails me, which was the initial plan. Somehow that&#x27;s not very enticing.And I&#x27;m in the demographic that would indeed block pinterest and w3schools. It&#x27;s just that my lattes aren&#x27;t $12 each...Edit: Btw @freediver, you should turn this top blocked list into a public indepth report every 3 months or so. Just like Backblaze does that hard drive reliability thing. It would be great for your marketing. reply berdon Yep. As a developer my life is infinitely better because of Kagi. The product is wonderful, the team is wonderful and responsive - it’s everything I want from a company I pay money to.I sound like a shill but I’m not. I’ve just been a happy user since their private beta and have had genuine, kind, and personable email back and forth with Vladimir. reply silisili Quite the glowing review... enough to get me interested.Do you have any specific examples or reasons you can share that might help force my hand?I&#x27;m definitely tired of Google search, but not sure I&#x27;m tired enough to take on another monthly sub just yet. reply metadaemon I feel the same way. I&#x27;ve been a very happy customer without any desire for going back to other search providers. reply josephcsible > That it should be unlimited.Isn&#x27;t that what their $25&#x2F;mo plan gives you? reply jackson1442 Yep. They’re trying to drop the price as well—users on an annual Legacy Professional plan have been given unlimited searches again (which is the $10&#x2F;mo pricing). Really hoping this is sustainable because Kagi is night-and-day for me compared to google and ddg. reply int_19h Is that a different thing from \"early adopter professional\"? Because that one still shows \"$10&#x2F;mo - 1,500 searches included\" for me on the billing page. reply slaw I don&#x27;t see any people say Kagi is too expensive, where do you find them? I don&#x27;t use Kagi as I found it useless. It is only UI for Google search. Yandex and Bing works better than Kagi. reply microflash I&#x27;d say it is expensive in countries where dollar conversion rates are very high due to inflation. I did ask about introducing different prices based on purchasing power parity in different geographies but got a very polite rebuff :) reply int_19h They claim that the prices are largely defined by the actual cost of the search, with fairly slim margins. In which case they literally can&#x27;t do what you asked without becoming unprofitable. reply 0x073 They spend 5% of their profit for donations. It&#x27;s ok as a company for general, but for payment with this low rates of search results and the argument that they can&#x27;t reduce the price because of the cost. I get mixed feelings. reply slaw So if buying search result from Google is too expensive, Kagi should use another provider, Brave search? replyHavoc Interesting yes, but feels more like a measure of their very niche userbase than a reflection of the websites value.The average human out there is not boosting developer.mozilla.orgStill...I&#x27;m thankful that they publish the stats. It&#x27;s a useful mental reference point if nothing else reply tschumacher Anecdotally when searching for Python standard lib docs on Google, python.org is never at the top. I think this is because they have a single page titled \"Built-in types\" instead of dedicated pages titled e.g. \"str.split\".Above python.org I get links to w3schools.com, programiz.com, python-reference.readthedocs.io (some inofficial project abandoned 2015), geeksforgeeks.org, codegree.de and freecodecamp.org. reply rchaud Reminder that W3Schools is good now (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP) and has been good for several years. In the pre-Flexbox, pre-grid days, I used W3schools to build a framework-less mobile site as part of a JS bootcamp admissions test. The explanation on W3Schools about creating multiple floats with media queries was so clear, I stuck around. reply account-5 As a beginner w3schools.com is likely my first port of call for something that it covers. Easy to navigate and use, and covers a wide range of things. I&#x27;m aware of its history but it&#x27;s never steered me wrong.MDN I only use if I can&#x27;t find the information elsewhere. I need ELI5, MDN is harder to understand when trying to grasp a subject, at least for me. reply atrudeau Similar alternative for Google Search: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrome.google.com&#x2F;webstore&#x2F;detail&#x2F;search-filter&#x2F;eidh...Even the defaults match this Kagi top list. reply rosywoozlechan This third party browser extension looks like it hides UI contents whereas with Kagi your preferences are used in what is actually returned from the search engine and in what order. I don&#x27;t think these things are all that similar. reply slaw Kagi used Google behind. If results are the same, what is the difference for the end user? reply enduku Kagi search is brilliant in this aspect. There used to be a similar service [0] not too long ago that blocked many spam sites from the search results.[0] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;millionshort.com&#x2F; reply jrflowers It is wholly unsurprising that a website that seems to exist solely to fuck up search results (Pinterest) is at the top of the block list. The existence of it is genuinely mind boggling in a way that’s similar to face tattoos or Toddlers and Tiaras. Why would anyone want that to exist? At all? What is wrong with humanity? reply Nextgrid Pinterest is a successful product that provides value to its users (I&#x27;m not the target market and I guess most of us aren&#x27;t either, but there is a segment of people that do get value out of it). I don&#x27;t believe they have any malicious intent to explicitly go out of their way to ruin image search. I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t mind the free SEO but I don&#x27;t believe there is an explicit effort to mislead search engine crawlers (especially considering other engines correctly ignore such pages).The problem is that their pages unintentionally trigger a flaw in Google&#x27;s crawler (it&#x27;s unable to detect that the content is actually obscured by a JS-based login wall) and Google is unwilling to implement an override because this spam contributes to their bottom-line (increases \"engagement\" on the search results page). reply jrflowers > I don&#x27;t believe they have any malicious intent to explicitly go out of their way to ruin image search…And> The problem is that their pages exploit a flaw in Google&#x27;s crawler…Don’t seem to be statements that really make any consistent sense.It’s like if you ordered soup and instead got a bowl of human shit, a thousand times, and then felt compelled to explain that nobody wants you to eat shit, it’s just that bowls are a really convenient place to shit in. reply Nextgrid Pages are primarily written for display & human consumption. Whatever was left of the \"semantic HTML\" went out the window when everyone switched to the JS SPA fad.As far as I know there is no \"right\" way to design a JS SPA overlay&#x2F;loginwall in a way that search engines ignore it - it&#x27;s not like Pinterest is intentionally ignoring a spec or designing a page that misleads search engine crawlers (other engines seem to handle Pinterest just fine). Outright denying access to search engines could be wrong because logged-in Pinterest users may actually want those results, so that&#x27;s not a good solution either.The fault is ultimately on Google for ignoring this high-profile issue for such a long time because it contributes to their bottom-line, even though a very simple, low-tech fix (easier than making the crawler recognize such loginwalls reliably) could be to just allow users to make their own decision as to whether to block the domain, like Kagi has done. reply jrflowers > it&#x27;s not like Pinterest is intentionally ignoring a spec or designing a page that misleads search engine crawlersAnd> The problem is that their pages exploit a flaw in Google&#x27;s crawler…I apparently misunderstood your phrasing of “exploit” to mean something intentional. You submit that Pinterest is unintentionally exploiting a flaw in a way that both drives traffic to them and ruins search.I suppose in my shit soup analogy, the thing you’d explain is that there’s shit in the bowl because the laws of physics coincidentally allow shit to rest in a bowl. reply Nextgrid Apologies - I&#x27;ve edited my original comment to make it clearer that I meant \"exploit\" in a non-intentional way. reply jrflowers Is there a possibly extant universe wherein Pinterest is acting both intentionally and destructively to the detriment of everyone else?I’d like to add that Hanlon’s razor is a fun bit of internet lore wherein we pretend humans do not act intentionally that’s based on, uhhh… replyhairofadog The thing about Pinterest is that it seems to be offering something that it never delivers. A few years ago I was doing an image search and I was like, fine, I’ll sign up, I just want to see this image I’m looking for so I went through the whole process and they still wouldn’t show me the image I wanted to see. Have you ever had one of those dreams where you’re trying to run forward but you’re not getting anywhere? That’s Pinterest, at least in my experience. reply internetter > Pinterest is a successful product that provides value to its usersLike me! I use it to get outfit & interior design inspiration. Haven&#x27;t found nothing quite like it reply WarOnPrivacy > The problem is that their pages exploit a flaw in Google&#x27;s crawlerNot sure it&#x27;s still a flaw when it&#x27;s so trivial to derank, Google could manage it on the barest of whims. reply Dah00n Exploit is likely the wrong word as it isn&#x27;t Pinterest doing something shady. It is more of a Google flaw and I&#x27;m sure Google sees it for what it is and hence they don&#x27;t de-rank a site for doing nothing wrong.But yes, they could fix it. However if it keeps you searching maybe they don&#x27;t want to. reply Eisenstein I would love to see a history and expose of Pinterest. reply WarOnPrivacy Doxing isn&#x27;t doxing if it&#x27;s part of a documentary. reply Eisenstein Not sure what you are implying but doxing has a specific meaning. reply Jaygles It goes to show how hard of a problem searching for relevant information is, when some of the world&#x27;s smartest engineers can&#x27;t help but return the world&#x27;s most useless website in their web search. reply Nextgrid There&#x27;s no reason to believe those smartest engineers&#x27; incentives are to give you good search results. If this was a technical problem this would be solved long ago by a simple \"if domain == &#x27;pinterest.com&#x27;: skip()\".The problem is that the company employing those engineers is acting maliciously and benefits from you wasting your time with irrelevant&#x2F;unusable search results as it contributes to \"engagement\" on the search results page and makes the sponsored results (aka spam) more likely to be clicked (even if by accident). They can get away with it since (besides Kagi) the competition is no better due to having the exact same business model. reply nfriedly I find it amusing that reddit managed to make all of the lists!I personally still find it to be a useful source of information - I wonder if all of their recent drama with third-party apps has led to it earning a place on the negative lists, or if it was there all along. reply developer93 I think it might be more understandable if you could block individual subreddits, I found experience to vary greatly depending on your topic since the moderation isn&#x27;t uniform. reply malikNF I an part of the former. I do miss it. Glad to see there’s more people who are doing this. You shouldn’t be allowed to treat your community this way and get away with it. reply xlbuttplug2 Either they&#x27;ve filtered out porn sites or they have a long way to go in terms of adoption. reply slaw I think porn sites are already filtered by Google. Kagi doesn&#x27;t have it&#x27;s own search, it is just layer over Google search. reply JopV 48 Kagi does have its own search index of niche sites, they even have an API for it. This is combined with Google results; they used to combine with Bing as well but stopped due to Microsoft charging too much money.Very different from DuckDuckGo and Startpage which are still just a Bing proxy and a Google proxy respectively. reply slaw 20 You are correct. Kagi is more than a Google proxy.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.kagi.com&#x2F;kagi&#x2F;search-details&#x2F;search-sources.htm... reply RGBCube Not just Google, they use Bing and Yandex(?, might be something else) too, I think. reply munk-a I&#x27;m surprised Reddit isn&#x27;t higher on the list. Either I&#x27;m on a desktop and Reddit&#x27;s website is a bit clunky to use - or I&#x27;m on mobile and I have to click past several attempts at them to funnel me into their app.It is a true shame that so much useful information gets trapped within their ecosystem. reply black_puppydog As siblings have pointed out, reddit is actually popular for raising.For me, what distinguishes it from a stereotypical \"block this please\" site like Pinterest is that, clunky as the UI may be, content on reddit is often relevant and well linked up with other pages on the Web.Compare that with Pinterest which I&#x27;ve taken to describe as \"the universal sink of the Web\" because it seems to get linked to from everywhere but then it&#x27;s a dead end with zero non-repost content 100% of the time.Well actually, come to think of it, Pinterest hasn&#x27;t figured much in my search results ever since I started using kagi a year or so back, and really it didn&#x27;t get linked to very much from anywhere but the Google results page... Guess I&#x27;m getting my money&#x27;s worth in one more way then I realized. :DKagi is so worth the money! reply munk-a I certainly agree about Pinterest being where data goes to die - and for Reddit I agree that it has an extremely high quality of information, it&#x27;s just held back by presentation. If I can find the information I&#x27;m looking for on a blog I&#x27;ll usually prefer that but Reddit usually has a good deal of commentary on whatever the topic I&#x27;m looking for is. reply MostlyStable On reason that Reddit is valuable is that it often contains information that, as far as I can tell, literally doesn&#x27;t exist anywhere else. This is especially true for product category research. Other than Reddit posts, any product that is even vaguely not mainstream, the only information other than Reddit will be obvious marketing blog spam that doesn&#x27;t actually help differentiate anything. Generally, I&#x27;ll check wirecutter, and if Wirecutter doesn&#x27;t have an article about it, then Reddit is the only other useful option. If it&#x27;s the only option, the presentation doesn&#x27;t really matter, although I disagree with you on how bad it is. I still quite like old.reddit on desktop. Although admittedly my mobile experience has been severely degraded since my old preferred app got killed. reply Nextgrid Kagi has another feature that can rewrite search results&#x27; URLs based on regexes: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;help.kagi.com&#x2F;kagi&#x2F;features&#x2F;redirects.html.I successfully use it to automatically link to Old Reddit. I guess it can also be used to rewrite user-hostile websites&#x27; URLs such as YouTube&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;etc to less hostile frontends such as Invidious or Nitter. reply Dah00n 46 This should be higher up. Now I&#x27;m definitely interested! reply _dain_ 24 This is cool but imo it makes more sense to have URL redirection as a browser extension. That way all twitter links resolve to nitter, not just ones from a search engine. I use this one https:&#x2F;&#x2F;einaregilsson.com&#x2F;redirector&#x2F; reply unshavedyak .. holy. I never thought of that, now i&#x27;m adding that. Thanks! reply lolinder A lot of people actually disagree with you—Reddit is number four on the Raise list and on the Pin list, and every few months there&#x27;s a thread on HN talking about how the only way to get useful information out of Google is to add \"reddit\" at the end of the search. reply fyrn_ I think they were talking about the raise list, not the block or lower list reply OJFord Clearly not, they think it&#x27;s clunky and desktop and too annoying on mobile, (I agree but put up with it often) they&#x27;re not saying they want more of it. reply munk-a I was indeed talking about the lower list - simply because of the information presentation is so poor. The information itself is usually quite high quality. reply lcnPylGDnU4H9OF > ... or I&#x27;m on mobile and I have to click past several attempts at them to funnel me into their app.It’s not really less inconvenient in terms of time or screen taps in my experience, but changing the subdomain to “old” will at least skip the app prompts. The day that option dies is a day I put a new 0.0.0.0 entry in my hosts file. reply banana_giraffe It won&#x27;t help the clunky mobile site much, but if you&#x27;re on iOS there&#x27;s a Safari plug in called \"Sink It for Reddit\" that hides the attempts to funnel you into their app. reply WarOnPrivacy > I&#x27;m surprised Reddit isn&#x27;t higher on the list.It&#x27;s on two lists.> Either I&#x27;m on a desktop and Reddit&#x27;s website is a bit clunky to use - or I&#x27;m on mobile and I have to click past several attempts at them to funnel me into their app.I have the old-reddit extension on every device I use. It&#x27;s my 3rd most essential extension, after uBlock Origin and Kill Sticky. reply infinityio Incidentally, Kagi has a URL rewrite feature that integrates this natively! reply barclay Following the API blocking earlier this year, my fear is that the half-life of old.reddit&#x27;s existence is getting ever so small... reply munk-a I strongly suspect that if they kill it off at some point we&#x27;ll have solutions like archive to work around being forced into their UI - even if those solutions are forced to scrap the information out of their web presentation rather than via API calls. reply dfee Feature request: native iOS safari support. I have a redirect set up, an extension.But the ability to change it for real (ie without redirect) would be huge.(I believe this feature request is targeted at Apple!) reply warpspin Starting to try kagi now after this. I knew the diverse browser add-ons for blocking results, but being able to lower instead of all-out block something seems nice.Just wished they made it easier to block&#x2F;lower all the international versions of pinterest though, lol. reply LAC-Tech I actually did a smaller thing for HN. I have client side JS that blocks results from a few domains that seemed to promote low quality discussions and&#x2F;or irrelevant submissions. const boringDomains = [ \"newyorker.com\", \"nytimes.com\", \"economist.com\", \"wired.co.uk\", \"bbc.com\", \"aella.substack.com\", \"hecolumn.substack.com\", \"wsj.com\", \"kqed\", \"voanews.com\", \"wusa9.com\", \"noemamag.com\", \"arstechnica.com\", \"independent.co.uk\", \"axios.com\" ] Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(\".titleline > a\")) .filter(elem => boringDomains.some(domain => elem.href.includes(domain))) .map(elem => elem.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement) .flatMap(elem => [elem, elem.nextElementSibling, elem.nextElementSibling.nextElementSibling]) .forEach(elem => elem.remove()) reply LeoPanthera ...BBC? Ars Technica? ...KQED and VOA? You&#x27;re blocking discussion of some of the most reliably factual reporting on the planet. reply LAC-Tech shrugs I don&#x27;t really feel the need to defend the contents of that list. If the resulting conversations suck, aren&#x27;t relevant to me, and clog up the HN front page - in they go. reply Terr_ > I don&#x27;t really feel the need to defend the contents of that list.You were quite willing to promote the specific and lengthy list of disliked-sites to strangers.A sudden switch to fatigue and disinterest does not seem genuine to me. reply LAC-Tech 39 Next time I&#x27;ll edit the source code to spare the feelings of the more delicate members of this community. reply alex_lav There&#x27;s something uniquely social-media-y about a person posting a list of websites they don&#x27;t enjoy the contents of or discussion around, and then posting that they&#x27;ve filtered them out in a way that only impacts them, and then that person getting questioned and challenged on their filtering. reply evilduck > Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, or celebrities, unless they&#x27;re evidence of some interesting new phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures. If they&#x27;d cover it on TV news, it&#x27;s probably off-topic.The domains in question lead to guaranteed uninteresting and routine political bickering where each side is compelled to recite their talking points. It has nothing to do with the reporting and everything to do with how people comment on those topics. I&#x27;d be guilty of it too if I weren&#x27;t busy flagging those posts. reply leesalminen Isn&#x27;t VOA (and BBC for that matter) government owned & funded? That&#x27;s enough right there for me to doubt their \"reliably factual\" reporting. It&#x27;s hardly a political opinion- the owners of these services expect to get some return on their investment. Because they&#x27;re not in it for the money (they can just create more money basically at will), then why are they in it? Likely to help craft a narrative that suits them. reply Dah00n 52 VOA and BBC are not alike at all in my opinion. Many countries in Western&#x2F;Northern Europe have government funded sites run like the BBC and they are mostly in the top of unbiased and free journalism. They also create a lot of high quality documentaries and crime thrillers.Nothing is perfect and of course there&#x27;s a certain kind of culture on each of these workplaces that will mske it either more left or right up or down, but they aren&#x27;t controlled by politicians, just like a hospital isn&#x27;t told how to treat patients by politicians.I&#x27;d rank BBC News above all US news outlets (and I&#x27;ll just add I&#x27;m neither from the US nor UK). reply developer93 At least for the bbc, the government isn&#x27;t directly involved in the editorial. They have to resort to appointing their friends director general & threatening to abolish the licence fee to try to get what they want. reply gruez The parent poster said>... that seemed to promote low quality discussionsMy guess is that these domains are responsible for hot button topics that result in 300+ comment threads. reply MBCook I’m mean they’re not wrong that more general news topics (especially if touching on politics at all) tends to produce horrible discussions. reply nonethewiser The point was they tended to have low quality discussion. Probably because it turned into partisan mud slinging. reply Dalewyn Please tell me you&#x27;re just memeing or being sarcastic. reply abtinf Could this be modified to block comments from a list of usernames too? The last time I looked at HN’s DOM made me sad.There are some prolific users who… while their comments are of normal quality, trigger a strong desire for me to respond. I’d rather simply not see their comments (and reply trees) at all. reply LAC-Tech 10 next [–]const boringPeople = [\"Terr_\"] Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;.hnuser&#x27;)) .filter(elem => boringPeople.some(person => elem.textContent === person)) .map(elem => elem.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement.parentElement) .forEach(elem => elem.remove())This worked to block the actual comment but not the whole thread. reply developer93 Dunno but at least on Glider client, you can block from the username menu. reply kreeben Personally, I never reply. I only lurk. Because every time I reply I get sucked into the social media nightmare that is waiting for a response to my reply.

If LK-99 is a type-II superconductor you should observe flux pinning i.e. you would be able to move the flake with a tweezer and it would be stuck in place as the magnetic flux lines are pinned to defects in the material. I haven&#x27;t seen any details on the supposed properties of the material like the coherence length, but from the original paper it seems the critical field of a small flake is rather low at a few 100-1000 Oe, so a more convincing test than thermal cycling would be to simply use an electromagnet and increase the field strength, the sample should then drop once the (second) critical field is reached. If the critical field strength is too high you can reduce it by heating the sample, but what&#x27;s critical is to observe breakdown of diamagnetism with an increase in field strength without any form of hysteresis, which you won&#x27;t observe in the same way in a diamagnet.The best test would probably be to produce a Josephson junction and measure Shapiro steps at high frequency, that&#x27;s something that cannot be explained by anything except a superconducting quantum material. As the sample is highly impure it could even be enough to irradiate it with a microwave source and measure the reflectivity &#x2F; transmittance, there could even be intrinsic Josephson effect like in high Tc superconductors. Impossible to say though without knowing more details about the material. reply floxy 1There have been some people saying that LK-99 might only be superconducting in one dimension. Does anyone know how that (or even just 2-D&#x2F;planar superconductivity) would effect the levitation of samples? For the 1-D case, maybe there would be issues in creating loops in the bulk material for persistent currents to flow in? It might be hard to make a Josephson junction unless you knew the orientation of the superconductivity direction? Has anybody studied this before? My intuition breaks down here. reply ThePhysicist 1The superconducting wave function can have different symmetry, e.g. most&#x2F;all low-temperature superconductors have s-wave symmetry (meaning the wave function amplitude is the same in all directions), whereas high-temperature superconductors have d-wave symmetry, which means the wave function amplitude has lobes and drops to zero along the diagonal axes. There are no p-wave superconductors to my knowledge (which I guess is meant when they talk about a 1D superconductor, i.e. the wave function has p-symmetry, but not even sure if that&#x27;s what they mean).I know the main researcher has brought forward a modified BCS theory that combines insulator-metal transition physics with superconductivity, no idea though what to make of that. reply marcosdumay 1> which I guess is meant when they talk about a 1D superconductor, i.e. the wave function has p-symmetry, but not even sure if that&#x27;s what they meanI think they mean it only appears on islands that are much longer than they are wide or high. I.E. I understand it as a geometric limitation on the form of the crystals they can make.The theoretical stuff that got here implies it has d-wave symmetry, and so does the original paper. reply pnwcoder 1What would be an explanation for the partial levitation of the LK-99 sample shown in the video? reply ThePhysicist 1Could be normal diamagnetism, or even ferromagnetism. Very hard to say as they don&#x27;t even give any field strengths in the video, it&#x27;s just a Neodym magnet they hold near the sample. If I understand the video correctly they just orient the magnet by hand, so I would not even rule out a ferromagnetic effect. There can be multiple regions with different orientation in such a polycristalline material, which can produce all kinds of weird effects. Not saying that it&#x27;s not a superconductor, just that I would not draw any conclusions from this video. If this was a type-II superconductor and the flux pinning is strong enough to lift the flake up you should be able to drag it across the bottom of the beaker with the magnet as the magnetic flux lines \"impale\" the crystal, i.e. they are in an energy minimum and moving them out of there causes resistance as they need to break the superconductivity in the material surrounding the defect where they are pinned. If it&#x27;s just diamagnetism that&#x27;s not the case. So observing that the flake is completely stationary when the magnet is moved in our out tells me this likely isn&#x27;t flux pinning we&#x27;re seeing.I&#x27;m a bit skeptical how they even know it&#x27;s the right material, getting the doping right seemed quite intricate so it would seem quite extraordinary that they can hit the right process after trying for a few days. Not saying they didn&#x27;t, but so far I&#x27;m rather inclined to believe they just got a ferromagnetic metal flake (which is easy to get following the thermal annealing process they did, or even by banging the material up a bit as they seem to have done for getting it out of the synthesis tubes). reply amluto To me, this video looks like the sample is experiencing a torque, not a force. (Or at least not a force that is sizable compared to the sample’s weight.). The sample is doing a remarkable job of cavorting without actually going anywhere. Magnetic dipoles experience a torque proportional to the applied field, whereas the force is proportional [0] to the field’s gradient. The field gradient may be fairly small near the surface of a big magnet.Plenty of things are magnetic dipoles or can be induced to become dipoles in the presence of a magnetic field. Ever played with iron filings and a magnet? Or a ferrofluid and a magnet?[0] Assuming the dipole moment is constant. reply lr1970 1> Could be normal diamagnetism, or even ferromagnetism.I am curious how one could confuse the two? One leads to repulsion, another to attraction. reply ThePhysicist 1I&#x27;m not even sure they reversed the magnet polarity in this video, it seems they just removed the magnet and put it back, so there&#x27;s no way to rule out a ferromagnetic effect. Again, I just find it really hard to deduce anything from this footage, not saying it can&#x27;t be a superconductor.I&#x27;m not even sure they reversed the magnet polarity in this video, it seems they just removed the magnet and put it back, so there&#x27;s no way to rule out a ferromagnetic effect.I&#x27;m not sure either if LK-99 is a type-II superconductor but I would believe so given the papers I&#x27;ve read. Type-II superconductors aren&#x27;t perfect diamagnets, they allow magnetic flux to penetrate the superconductor once you hit the first critical field, these flux vortices then get pinned at sites of defects where the energy requirement for breaking the superconductivity is lowest. That&#x27;s what keeps a type-II superconductor levitating over a magnet, a type I superconductor or perfect diamagnet wouldn&#x27;t do that. Then again I have never seen how e.g. a tiny YBCO flake (high Tc type-II superconductor) would behave if you put it in a beaker and dragged a Neodym magnet below it, so who knows. reply carabiner 1Damn. It&#x27;s over. reply sashank_1509 2This makes me extremely bullish about Varda Space, they have engineers of high quality and expertise that they could do a decent replication very quickly (if they got access to raw materials earlier, they might have been first to do so, comparable with the Chinese Groups) while working on their off time (from what I’ve seen of their twitter) and not a single big academic lab has managed to complete any sort of replication to date! reply DoingIsLearning 2The first pre-print came out on 22 July (if I am not mistaken). Not enough time has passed pure and simple.If I was an academic working on this, I would be following the Sagan Standard and triple checking my results before claiming anything.I think we are all suffering from 24 hour news cycles. The work in China and now Varda is very exciting but they are warp speed developments. reply anonylizard This is simply what post-peer-review looks like.Instead of a few anonymous peer reviews, you get the entire planet to replicate. Moment you get something meaningful, publish it on arxiv. Quantity, not quality is king. Anomalies are drowned out by large samples. Questionable methods get mass debated in public.Scientists are dependent on public funding, why squander the biggest moment in pop science for literal decades?Now this won&#x27;t work for 99.99% of research. But top tier research will probably get published on youtube and arxiv in the future... reply svara > Questionable methods get mass debated in public.By people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.You&#x27;re seriously underestimating the level of expertise that it takes to professionally assess most research. It wouldn&#x27;t be unusual for there to be a small handful of people with that ability in the world. reply generalizations What matters is the discovery of new things that are true, that we can do engineering with. Publication by youtube & arxiv doesn&#x27;t have to be oriented at public consumption - it works just as well when it&#x27;s by-researchers, for-researchers. Except without gatekeeping, people like McCalip can participate too. Who cares who&#x27;s sitting on the sidelines? In post-peer-review, industry-funded academics rush a paper to a preprint server, a space engineer replicates it, and someone else figures out how to mass-produce it, and we get room-temp ambient-pressure superconductors, and we know we did because the engineering works.This works just as well with less exciting tech, because the point is that we collaboratively learned how to build something. reply MetaWhirledPeas 1Agreed. What I don&#x27;t understand is the gatekeeping. Why would the actions of outsiders have any bearing on \"real\" research? Are they worried that grant money will get redirected toward shallower, more glamorous groups? reply dotnet00 1I think the gatekeeping is relevant because almost every time in recent years that the general completely unvetted, often actively ignorant public has gotten an in on the scientific&#x2F;R&D process, it has been a disaster for the field.NASA can&#x27;t take risks and seriously innovate anymore because even intentional explosions will be passed off as failures, we all experienced the sheer madness of the covid years, similarly anything nuclear brings complete randos out of the woodworks claiming absurd things about its dangers.Not having some amount of gatekeeping just lowers the bar too much and introduces so much more noise. reply MetaWhirledPeas 1> Not having some amount of gatekeeping just lowers the bar too much and introduces so much more noise.I can see how this would be a very controversial subject. Discouraging scientific participation? That&#x27;s a tough pill to swallow without a lot of justification. reply dotnet00 1It isn&#x27;t discouraging participation, it&#x27;s requiring that you meet some minimum level of proficiency to be considered credible. Kind of like how you need to have some experience in programming to have any credibility when talking about how a programming language should be designed. reply MetaWhirledPeas 1> it&#x27;s requiring that you meet some minimum level of proficiency to be considered credibleThat&#x27;s not really the case though is it? Doubting someone&#x27;s credibility would simply mean ignoring their results. But withholding information is something else entirely. reply dotnet00 1Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding, where did withholding information come into this? reply MetaWhirledPeas 1> Maybe I&#x27;m misunderstanding, where did withholding information come into this?When I mentioned gatekeeping I was specifically referring to how there&#x27;s this formula that was kept secret since 1999. At some point the potential significance surely became apparent, and one of the only speculations I can come up with to justify that would be gatekeeping; keeping the information out of the hands of the filthy commoners for reasons.Maybe it wasn&#x27;t gatekeeping. If not I&#x27;d sure as heck like to know what it was. reply nyospe 1In 1999, I was still a student in solid state physics, not far past my bachelor&#x27;s degree, and happened to notice the publication of something that, to this day, I suspect might be (note, load bearing \"might\") a critical breakthrough for desalination. Nothing came of it. Nobody has published any follow-up for it. Nobody has done any research that would contradict it either. It&#x27;s just sitting out there, unnoticed, decades later.Was it withheld from the public? Eh... yes? Kind of? Because it was only ever published in a journal - probably Materials Letters, but this was a long time ago - that you would only have access to if you were a graduate (or ambitious undergraduate) student with plenty of time to read in a university library, or a specialist in the very narrow field that journal was for, somebody with a membership included subscription...This isn&#x27;t gatekeeping, this is, to be blunt, profit motivated hoarding by a handful of publishers in the academic journals business. And this is the thing that arXiv.org and other pre-print venues are actually having an impact on. I, for one, am strongly in favor of academic information being widely available. I&#x27;m not as much in favor of people who have not demonstrated their competencies in something that requires a great deal of both knowledge and skill feeling entitled to being given a platform for their (usually laughably clueless) proposals. If you&#x27;ve done enough work to have a tested hypothesis, that&#x27;s different. reply Vecr 1At least post the citation for the desal thing? reply dotnet00 1Ah, then I completely misunderstood you. Yeah I&#x27;m not in favor of outright withholding information.However, what I think happened here is that they weren&#x27;t able to work on it for a while, and if say, they didn&#x27;t feel confident in their findings back in 1999 and only got around to being able to look at it again in 2017, it would make sense that their intent wasn&#x27;t to gatekeep, it had just become one of those \"we&#x27;ll get around to testing it one day\" type of projects everyone has. In this case it just potentially was a pretty massive thing to put off. reply cycomanic 1They didn&#x27;t keep it, they simply did not work on it and only came back to it 20 years later (somebody posted a bit of history on the other thread currently on the front page, I&#x27;m on mobile so it takes to long to find it atm). They didn&#x27;t know about it&#x27;s superconducting properties either.So no withholding information at all. But on a more general level if everyone would be posting out every little bit of information they produce during their research instead of publishing articles it would be a disaster. The reason we do science is because we are trying to understand things just posting your random results would just give everyone information overload, because you would know what to focus on. Lk99 is actually a great example, the material would have completely been ignored by most (maybe even has been, not sure if they published about it previously?) if not for these recent results. Moreover because the results were published before the authors were confident about what they had, they have been subject to lots of ridicule and accusations of fraud. It might turn out alright in this case, but something like this can be career ending if it turns out to just be an experimental error. reply MetaWhirledPeas 1> They didn&#x27;t keep it, they simply did not work on it and only came back to it 20 years later (somebody posted a bit of history on the other thread currently on the front page, I&#x27;m on mobile so it takes to long to find it atm).

I don&#x27;t see how we could achieve any more bombastic headlines than we already get. replygiantrobot 1My personal opinion&#x2F;reaction likely isn&#x27;t going to affect anyone&#x27;s grant status. I&#x27;m just a random asshole. But there are less random assholes whose opinion might count. If someone sounding authoritative, but is just a random asshole like me, shits on this work on social media it might affect a group&#x27;s grant status if it taints the opinion of someone holding the purse strings.So I don&#x27;t think asking about credentials or asking about references is gatekeeping. It&#x27;s putting a statement into context. If I as a random asshole say \"this isn&#x27;t a superconductor\" you as a reader should want to know where I&#x27;m getting that opinion from rather than just taking my statement at face value. reply MetaWhirledPeas 1I&#x27;m not suggesting we give random people credibility: I&#x27;m suggesting that when we make potentially-enormous breakthroughs that maybe we shouldn&#x27;t keep that information to ourselves for decades.Edit: According to this it was just an unfortunate 19-year hiatus.

At the level of congressional appropriation then certainly. At the program manager level then hopefully the pm knows. reply svara 1No, because funding agencies use external reviewers who are experts in the field of an application. reply bee_rider 1They say you don’t really understand something until you can teach it. I wonder to what extent “can I teach this to the general public, and do they care?” is an indicator of both understanding new results and also whether or not they really matter.Of course, we’re often working on a tool to help make tools for other scientists, so that sort of thing is hard to explain to the general public, but ultimately it should terminate in some results that actually have obvious value to society in general. reply okonomiyaki3000 > > Questionable methods get mass debated in public.> By people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not the only one who finds all these public mass debaters disgusting. reply ironborn123 This kind of public interest and demonstrations is unique only to RTS and few other phenomena- ordinary ppl more or less understand the importance of RTS- a visible and understandable effect (Meissner) can be shown on successful replication- the materials required are easier to understand, but the synthesis procedure is tricky, and purity is important- The skills of chemists comes into play, leading to kind of a Breaking Bad feel reply lamontcg 1> top tier research will probably get published on youtube and arxiv in the future...\"Top tier science\" is already published on arXiv.The future happened back in 1995 or something like that.> Quantity, not quality is king.No, quality is still king. We don&#x27;t need videos of flakes standing on their end we need someone who has been working with superconductors all their lives who is competent enough to measure zero resistance across the sample. If one of the wild theories is right we need someone who actually knows how to prove it and not just sound like they&#x27;re intelligent by talking about 1-d superconductors. reply CharlieDigital Not all meaningful science is this level of groundbreaking for this model to work. Formal peer review is still very much necessary. reply jcranmer 1There is a new claim or two of room-temperature superconductors published on Arxiv every year: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;peternemes&#x2F;status&#x2F;1684483863999827973#m... and yet this is the only one that sets the Twitters afire.The reaction I&#x27;ve seen from most of the scientists has been pretty negative on the papers. The originals aren&#x27;t strong papers. The chemistry has issues: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;Robert_Palgrave&#x2F;status&#x2F;168545015680691814... (unbalanced equations, starting materials have pretty different element ratios to final products). As for the main claim, note that LK-99 seems to be a poorer conductor than copper wire at room temperature: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nitter.net&#x2F;bedoya_pinto&#x2F;status&#x2F;1686848392616423425#m... which is the kind of thing that should really cause a record scratch and make everyone go \"um, I think you did something wrong there\"--it&#x27;s something that absolutely would be caught in peer review. reply likpok 1Your link sort of hints at the reason, I think. There&#x27;s enough posted to make a serious run at replicating it, and it seems to be simple enough that you can do it in a kitchen. At the same time, it&#x27;s not so easy that people have cleanly demonstrated it -- the constant rollercoaster of \"we&#x27;re so back\" and \"it&#x27;s so over\" I think drives some of the hype.It also seems like it has at least pretty strong diamagnetism, which while not a demonstration of superconductivity is both somewhat interesting and gives a vivid demonstration that&#x27;s amenable to social media. reply notfish 1I’m not sure I understand your point. Are you trying to say that people shouldn’t be paying attention to this? I would personally be horrified if I found out that the paper on the synthesis of a room temperature superconductor went through the normal peer review process instead of letting the world know they discovered something huge. reply jcranmer 1My point is why should this unreviewed claim of ambient condition superconductor be exalted as the holy grail and all of the other unreviewed claims of ambient condition superconductor languish in obscurity when they come out? It&#x27;s definitely not for the strength of evidence! reply marcosdumay 1It&#x27;s pretty much due to the strength of evidence.There is no conclusive proof that this is a superconductor on the replications, but the evidence has been on a different level from nearly everything else you&#x27;ll find on Arxiv since the beginning. reply jcranmer 1AIUI, things that float in a magnetic field at ~room temperature are moderately common claims, and this is really the only evidence that LK-99 might be a room-temperature superconductor. The published ancillary evidence in the original paper actually raises red flags that isn&#x27;t a superconductor--the \"0 resistivity\" domain in their temperature-dependent resistivity plot is (when you realize the units they&#x27;re using) actually slightly less resistive than regular copper wire, which suggests that the sharp drop in resistivity may be nothing more than a pedestrian phase change in the material. reply marcosdumay 1> things that float in a magnetic field at ~room temperature are moderately common claimsAt monopolar magnetic fields weak enough to come from a permanent magnet is a lot rarer.Almost all superconductor claims come from measuring magnetic resonance or direct resistance measurements. Both are noisy things to measure, and won&#x27;t get you reliable results. replyWaterluvian 1Only if you’re doing sexy science.The peer review system is broken but I think we still need some sort of structured system in addition to this “hey world, check this out!” method. reply Accujack 1>This is simply what post-peer-review looks like.No, this is a new face for peer review. Existing peer review processes have stagnated in the information age, possibly with good reason. There are a lot of advantages to more immediate review of papers and data, and also to bypassing the systems of qualifications presently used to choose who is a valid reviewer. reply marcosdumay 1> Quantity, not quality is king. Anomalies are drowned out by large samples.Yeah, that&#x27;s not how it works.At practice, anomalies are hyped into everybody&#x27;s attention, and large samples are drowned out by lack of novelty. You don&#x27;t need questionable methods to get bad results, you just need quantity.All the things that are happening are great, and this may be an astonishing discovery. But don&#x27;t put more certainty on it than it&#x27;s warranted. reply codethief 1> Instead of a few anonymous peer reviews, you get the entire planet to replicate.Notably, peer reviews typically don&#x27;t involve reviewers trying to replicate the results. So we&#x27;ve essentially skipped peer review (at least temporarily) and went full speed ahead with the post-peer-review process. reply mcpackieh > This is simply what post-peer-review looks like.Peer review was never a substitute for replication in the first place. In this sense we&#x27;ve been \"post-peer-review\" the entire time. reply lumost Speed is correlated with execution quality. All else being equal, A lab which is better equipped - with better access to materials, and motivated and competent researchers will deliver before the equivalent lab which is deficient in any of the above.A twitter post isn&#x27;t peer review, but it is a nice way of sharing part of the process. A video etc. will help others in their attempts to replicate. reply moolcool 1> If I was an academic working on this, I would be following the Sagan Standard and triple checking my results before claiming anything.Counterpoint: It&#x27;s better that a lot of people know \"Hey, we might be onto something interesting here\" early on. reply TheAceOfHearts 2It&#x27;s really disappointing that no other US lab has engaged with the public in the same manner. Regardless of the outcome, I think seeing things get built and experimented with in mostly real-time is a massive source of inspiration. reply dotnet00 1The National Labs have to be a lot more careful with putting out potentially incorrect results due to their notoriety, being public funded and the public&#x27;s lack of respect for the trial and error involved in the scientific process.So they&#x27;ll quietly slog away trying and retrying experiments, checking and rechecking their data before finally saying anything.As we saw with other previous big things, like the first gravitational wave detection, they took some time to make sure that they were right.I think that if it turns out to be real and national lab experiments prove that out, we&#x27;ll be hearing rumors circulating within the field some time before an official announcement, just like how there were rumors about LIGO&#x27;s detection circulating for a month before the announcement. reply brakedam 1I don’t know what’s going on here, but I can see some guys are trying to make a LK-99 bubble in here. politically, not scientifically. We should be aware that there is still no critical evidence of room-temp superconductors. reply iamshs All I see from US academics on Twitter are debates about this and that. Borderline annoying. This is the first result from mighty US capitalist machine meanwhile 3 Chinese labs have published pre prints and Russian replicated it in her kitchen. reply anonylizard This, its utterly shameful. Hot takes here, hot takes there, skepticism here, tell people to calm down there.Yet not a single replication! China has gone through multiple failed and successful replications so far. And the first US replication is from an amateur.If LK-99 works out, expect some congressmen to use this as a bludgeoning tool against the state of US public science. reply kjkjadksj 1To be fair, no one in the us has a grant to replicate something that came out this week. Its also the academic summer. A good amount of PIs are probably nowhere near their labs on vacation currently. reply _jal 1> To be fair, no one in the us has a grant to replicate something that came out this weekAnd yet researchers in other countries managed to find the money this week. That would seem to point to a real relative weakness that&#x27;s worth thinking about.Whether it is the result of gatekeeping, bureaucracy, academic squabbling, or something else, a cranky (and hilarious) Russian did better, faster work in her kitchen.

Which brings me back to,> Seems kind of stupid to do chemistry in your kitchen.When the institutions in your country become incompetent, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re left with. reply peteradio Hmm I&#x27;m not convinced that the establishment is sitting it out.

If a bunch of amateurs can spook the old guys into violating well established procedure then id be pretty concerned about their competence. replyyorwba Nanjing University physics professor Wen Haihu said in an interview with The Paper that the news was extremely likely to be false and they only assigned a student to it because many groups internationally were working on replications https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepaper.cn&#x2F;newsDetail_forward_24024641\"A researcher from the Institute of Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) declined to comment on LK-99, telling the Post that even taking the issue seriously would be ridiculous.\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;china&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;3229778&#x2F;coul... (It&#x27;s unclear to me whether this was before or after the HUST team published their video.)I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so much \"China good at science, everyone else shamefully bad,\" but that some institutions (including in China) are more risk-averse, because labs who&#x27;re already working on something they expect to succeed are less likely to benefit from dropping it to try something unproven. reply TylerE Not go all conspiracy, but isn’t that also pretty much the playbook you’d run if you were trying to discredit it, to get as much of a jump on the rest of the world as possible? The Chinese government is not exactly known for playing fair. reply yorwba 1That requires a government so competent they immediately notice the significance of a claimed breakthrough by a foreign lab and coordinate an information campaign where their leading scientists act all skeptical just like leading scientists in other countries, denying rumours that the Academy of Sciences is working on a replication etc., ... but completely fail to act on similar rumours sparked at the same time by screenshots of a HUST professor getting all excited about his university&#x27;s replication work in a group chat.Usually, when the Chinese government is confronted with an unexpected development they want to suppress, the opposite happens: official spokespeople clam up, nobody has a statement ready, related keywords get censored more or less effectively on social media, until an official narrative is revealed that doesn&#x27;t withstand further scrutiny but survives anyway because such scrutiny is censored as well.So no, it&#x27;s pretty much not the playbook they&#x27;d run if they were trying to discredit it. reply cryptonector 1Individual lab heads might do this sua sponte. Think: while everyone else is busy playing replication games you can work on reliably making LK-99 and beat everyone else to the punch on the more valuable patents and engineering glory. reply cryptonector 1The other thing is that even if LK-99 is finally conclusively shown to be a room temp & ambient pressure SC, there will be lots of important challenges to work on surrounding LK-99, so not being the first to replicate is no tragedy: - challenges in practical and reliable manufacturing of LK-99 - challenges in engineering w&#x2F; LK-99 - challenges in finding better materials than LK-99 using similar approachesIf I were in a position where I could devote funding and researcher and lab time into LK-99 research, I might well quietly let others to do the replication work while having my team quietly research practical manufacturing of LK-99 so that we could a) beat everyone else to the punch on practical and reliable manufacturing, b) get the patents for (a). reply cryptonector 1> gone through multiple failed and successful replications so farThe \"successful\" replications are partial. No one knows how to make a large enough sample of LK-99 that can be tested to definitely show superconductivity (or not) at room temp and ambient pressure.IMO the most bullish research done yet is the theoretical research. reply mschuster91 1> If LK-99 works out, expect some congressmen to use this as a bludgeoning tool against the state of US public science.I hope for the same here in Germany. It&#x27;s way past time we actually deal with the sorry state of science funding and academia in general across the Western world. reply ncann 1Yeah and it&#x27;s not just the US but also France&#x2F;UK&#x2F;Germany&#x2F;Canada, all the western countries usually held in high regards for science, the lack of enthusiasm (for lack of a better word) is rather disappointing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen a single university lab in these countries announced \"hey we&#x27;re trying to replicate this as well\". reply mschuster91 1They don&#x27;t have the funds to do so any more. Everything is just project based grants, which often enough aren&#x27;t even enough to run a project to completion. And professors have to chase grants and do other bullshit paperwork in an awful lot of their time. reply fragmede 1Given the international reach of the US&#x27; War on Drugs, is red phosphorus also controlled in other nations? Being denied access to the precursors needed makes replication far harder. reply kijin 1It&#x27;s the same in Korea where the research originated.A bunch of professors belonging to a hastily formed academic committee are trying to monopolize the public debate, quibbling about errors in the arxiv paper and demanding that Lee & Kim turn over samples of LK-99 because the big-name professors are obviously too busy to make their own. It seems that their first priority is to avoid a repeat of the Hwang scandal than to touch any novel research. reply username332211 1Any time the material exhibits a properties inconsistent with superconductors, the to-go explanation is that it&#x27;s supposedly extremely difficult to manufacture. Not to mention, the original instructions include stuff like \"The sealed tube containing the mixed powder was heated in a furnace at 925°C for 5-20 hours.\" which sounds a tad bit imprecise.Don&#x27;t you think in those conditions it&#x27;s at least a little bit reasonable to demand samples? reply cthalupa 1>Don&#x27;t you think in those conditions it&#x27;s at least a little bit reasonable to demand samples?No. Because ultimately they don&#x27;t owe anyone anything outside of the standard scientific process. They want to get the peer reviewed article published, and have stated that if people still want samples after that they will provide them.Half of twitter shitposting about FLOAT THE ROCK and a bunch of curious scientists and engineers attempting to replicate this doesn&#x27;t fundamentally change this equation. If it&#x27;s a superconductor now, it&#x27;ll be a superconductor in 6 months.None of the media hype or unwashed masses treating this as science entertainment should significantly impact the process they are going through. Assuming they&#x27;ve got an RTAPS, they&#x27;ll get the Nobel Prize regardless of whether or not they satisfy everyone&#x27;s curiosity right this moment or a year from now. Assuming they don&#x27;t have one, well, that&#x27;ll get found out too. reply zarzavat 1They’ve said they will provide samples after peer review. Which seems fair doesn’t it? How can they complete their paper and peer review without the samples? And if the samples get damaged they will be regret ever handing them over. If you were in the same situation you’d make the same decision.I and everybody else would love them to hand over the samples for external testing, but it’s their samples so they can do whatever they want with it, and the rest of the world just has to pound lanarkite while we wait. reply brakedam 1But I heard that in the interview, Dr. Kim said they have various samples that have different magnetization properties. It doesn’t make sense that they have only a few samples, ironically. I’m sorry, but this makes me think that they are trying to move the public some other way. reply kijin 1Judging from the Korean-language interviews making the rounds today, there seems to be some sort of political tension between the researchers and the so-called verification committee. There&#x27;s disagreement about whether anyone actually demanded samples, or whether it was just a polite request...I have a hunch that this might have something to do with the late professor Chair (Choi?) who came up with the idea back in the 90s, and whose last wish his disciples claim to be following. Chair was a sort of outcast in the superconductor research scene, and the methodology his disciples have been using are also, um, unorthodox at best. Someone might stand to lose a lot of credibility if the verdict goes one way or another. We know there&#x27;s been tension even inside the team, as one of the three men named in the first paper was dropped from the second paper. At this stage, I&#x27;d be more concerned about these internal tensions and personal grudges than any attempt to manipulate the public at large. reply brakedam 1Now I understand what&#x27;s going on in South Korea. Okay, this is more political than I thought. But the problem is, the researchers even didn&#x27;t send the sample abroad to prove it. Even though they had many requests for a week. This doesn&#x27;t make sense, and that kind of background story is not helpful in solving this. reply cthalupa 1It would not be a normal part of the process for people to be demanding samples just because there was a preprint posted on arxiv. It&#x27;s a weird situation and they don&#x27;t owe anyone any of these samples.They say they want to share samples after they get a peer reviewed paper published. That&#x27;s not a weird position to be in. If it wasn&#x27;t for the hype around this, they wouldn&#x27;t be in this position.Let the process play out like it normally does, and if none of the replication attempts pan out, they can provide the samples after the peer review. We&#x27;ll still care about RTAPS even if it takes another year for a sample to be provided. reply brakedam 1This case is something different. Because everyone reviewed their Arxiv papers and found that there’s no meaningful figure for the resistivity. And even magnetization data was not matched between two Arxiv papers. Now, here is where we are. After these reviews, they never updated their data to solve this issue, but they decided to let other guys do their experiment instead of them. The easiest way to solve this is to plot the resistivity data again on a logarithmic scale. And this takes less than a minute because they have raw data. This is a very uncommon situation in the scientific community. reply cthalupa 1Both papers were significantly rushed for reasons unrelated to the science aspect of it.Wait for the peer reviewed paper if you are this concerned about it. replyusername332211 1I assume they have more than one sample, don&#x27;t you? Hopefully, if they had only one, they&#x27;d say that explicitly on one of their papers. reply kijin 1One would think so, if the rest of the world weren&#x27;t already cooking up similarly half-levitating samples in their kitchens and garages. reply brakedam 1This is very ambiguous. So, everyone can make samples in their kitchens, but unfortunately, the researchers don’t have enough samples to provide, right? Researchers have their own primary responsibility to prove it, not the public. And this was not a debatable issue before the LK-99 bomb. reply iamshs They couldn&#x27;t even source Phosphorus! reply nemo44x Yes, but our ESG scores are impeccable. reply foobarian Naturalize the Russian, problem solved. reply iamshs Seeing her tweets, I doubt she wants to exercise this option. reply lucubratory Yes, I laughed when I saw that comment. I believe she would be denied entry to the US based on the questions that screen out communists, although because the particular question mentions a party and I don&#x27;t believe she&#x27;s a CPRF member it&#x27;s possible it wouldn&#x27;t apply. Regardless, not a good fit on either end of the relationship. reply justsomehnguy I&#x27;m more amused by &#x27;grab anyone we want&#x27; stance, along with &#x27;everyone wants to be the US citizen&#x27;.

Things cost money and money is usually already earmarked for other things. The labs that can engage with this have both some sort of a slush fund or another account appropriate to charge these fishing expeditions to, and also a post doc who somehow has plenty of time on their hands to drop everything they are doing and validate a dubious result. reply huijzer 2Okay still stuck in peer review then reply bglazer Nope you can just put a preprint out. Like it or not, academic labs are probably busy doing things like checking their data and doing multiple replicates varying conditions. You know, science. reply huijzer Yes, exactly. And getting approvals from three layers of management. You know, science.I&#x27;m pushing back against academia because I think the system is pretty much a mess. Academics believe that we got all the nice technological innovation because of academia. I think it is despite academia. Most money going there is just wasted on writing not what you think is right but what you think will be published, waiting for peer review, and other bureaucracy. The main problem is that academia works with the belief that science needs to be rigorous since bad science might damage their reputation. However, this is how governments think, but not how scientists should think! Would the world be a better place if any new website, company, or YouTuber should be reviewed by peers first? No. Just like science, these are strong link problems [1].[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experimental-history.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;science-is-a-strong-l... reply bglazer I’m in an academic lab right now. I have never once had to get approval from three levels of management to do any experiment, nor have I ever heard of anyone having to do that. I’m not even sure who would be three levels of “management” above me. reply willis936 Indeed. I&#x27;ve worked at two academic labs and one startup. The talent density at the startup is higher, but the academic labs were far scrappier and resourceful with limited resources. Venture capital makes people fat and lazy. They forget what it&#x27;s like to operate on fumes. reply BaseballPhysics 1I&#x27;m sorry but your facts don&#x27;t comport with my preconceived notions so you are wrong prima facie. reply brainwipe For journal publish, yes but not for doing the actual work. If you find something interesting, you can go fast. reply thepasswordis Don’t forget the DEA.The reason the Varda team even took this long is because they couldn’t get red phosphorus. reply mikeyouse You just have to be registered &#x2F; approved with the DEA — most labs are and can freely order phosphorus and almost other chemicals with no further burden. Seems like Varda didn’t have any prior use for restricted chemicals so they hadn’t registered yet, a not uncommon situation that will be quickly resolved for their next attempts I’m sure. reply TillE 1Indeed, DEA-listed chemicals don&#x27;t even require a DEA license, it&#x27;s just a bit of paperwork for new buyers, so the DEA can later come and ask uncomfortable questions if they suspect your usage is not legitimate. reply DoctorOetker 2Currently out of office, will respond as soon as possible after Impostor Syndrome therapy session is over. reply zamalek 1There is a large degree of luck involved. The original team, who have been working on this for significant time, have only attained a 1&#x2F;10 success rate (one of the better samples came from a test tube being dropped on the floor part-way through annealing). So it&#x27;s part talent, part luck. reply lyapunova 1The word \"bullish\" and fundamental science should stay as far away from each other as possible. reply sanxiyn 2World first replication was done by Iris Alexandra using her own accelerated process and there is no way Varda Space could have beaten her. reply mycologos 1I don&#x27;t understand why people are attaching any weight to Alexandra&#x27;s claims. AFAIK, it&#x27;s a pseudonymous account that has provided no evidence that couldn&#x27;t be easily faked. You might object that the evidence provided by the non-pseudonymous scientists could also be faked, but the key distinction is that they&#x27;re attaching real, professional identities to their claims. There are reputational consequences to making things up. They have skin in the game. A pseudonymous account doesn&#x27;t. Why should we believe them? reply BaseballPhysics 1> I don&#x27;t understand why people are attaching any weight to Alexandra&#x27;s claims.Confirmation bias is a hell of a drug. reply sudosysgen 1Not quite pseudonymous - she says her name is Iris Alexandria and that she&#x27;s affiliated with the IGB in Russia and is now collaborating with the MEPI in producing more and measuring samples and that this is the reason why she doesn&#x27;t publish any data as it&#x27;s not hers and is bound for a publication, and that some of the researchers there are familiar with alternative superconducting theories which LK99&#x27;s late PI was basing off on.Of course it could all be faked, but she is prima facie attaching real, professional identities to her claims. reply sashank_1509 A worthless replication.

Of course it can still be bullshit but it makes sense that a biochemist doesn&#x27;t have the means to test this material and that a credible physics institute wouldn&#x27;t want to rush publication if they aren&#x27;t sure of their results. reply stephenitis 1I believe she said it wasn&#x27;t a replication because she had changed the formula.She seemed to have problems with the efficiency of the original formula, which is why I believe she doesn&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s replication what she produced may in the end not be LK-99.It seems like she&#x27;s in the process of getting X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) done.There has been several fake videos placed out there on the Internet.There is a quote by jay-z I&#x27;ll paraphrase\" Men lieWomen lieBut replicable science don&#x27;t lie. \"The mixture of USSR tweets has patriotic Americans so ruffled that some can&#x27;t see through their disbelief and rage. reply ThisIsMyAltFace 1>I believe she said it wasn&#x27;t a replication because she had changed the formula.

But would they rush to try replicating it immediately after the paper&#x27;s publication? reply stephenitis 1I was impressed by this being an extra time endeavor.It does show genuine scientific curiousity from Andrew and his team(they might just be along for the ride).If more company bonding events could be live streamed&#x2F;tweeted experimental replication attempts of novel compounds instead of happy hours.The world would be a stranger place. reply blackkettle 2100% true and actually a very interesting statement.

I don&#x27;t know anything bout supraconductors but given the number of failing attempts to repicalte (and the number succeeding), I would not be suprised if it&#x27;d take quite some time before we can be certain. Moreover, we&#x27;ll need a consensus among all the people who understand the subject. So, a week or even a month won&#x27;t make any difference.We&#x27;re not talking about a vaccine. reply blackkettle My point was not actually about the ultimate result of replication. This guy undoubtably performed an indirect marketing coup for his company by engaging competently on this tangentially related topic and then following through.In my experience though, if he had made any effort to link those two things prior to doing this - e.g. by proposing this as an internally sponsored marketing stunt - it would probably have been rejected. reply DarmokJalad1701 Eh, I have met the CEO of Varda. They are very much a startup and have that startup energy. One of the founders of Varda has been very vocally supportive of this on Twitter as well. reply mtillman Of course, this is all Varda IP as they’re in California and anything a head of research performs that generates IP is owned by the employer. reply jasonjmcghee 1Is that a law in California? My understanding of the labor law is that California protects employees, so that if they sign a contract assigning IP to the company (which is almost a sure bet today, but not a law afaik- please correct me otherwise) they are actually protected such that it only applies if:- using company resources, such as time, hardware, or office space, unless otherwise stated.Clearly the case here, but my understanding of this law doesn’t align with how you described it. reply Torkel 2As engineers we are given building blocks that we can build things from. Iron, steel, copper, plastic. Every once in a while a new building block arrives. It takes a while for us to figure out how to use it. But when we do, the world changes.- batteries + touch screens => iPhone- batteries got better => Tesla- reinforced concrete => pretty much all the worlds buildings and bridges- neodymium magnets + gyros => dronesA room temperature superconductor... well, that changes things on a completely new level. Order of magnitude smaller losses plus order of magnitude higher magnetic fields? OMFG can we build SciFi things from this if it pans out.So yeah - we are in a hurry. If this pans out, there will be a massive shift in how pretty much anything is made. And the reward for the people who can figure it out first are insane, in terms of potential value created. reply pm215 2We&#x27;re in a hurry in the sense that we don&#x27;t want to leave investigation of this on the back burner for a few months, but we&#x27;re not in a hurry in the sense that it&#x27;s going to make any difference in practice whether a lab group reports today that they&#x27;ve reproduced it, or takes a bit more time to be careful and reports more thoroughly in two weeks time. Any first mover advantages are likely to accrue to the groups who come up with a reliable reproduction method over the next couple of months, not to the ones who send out the first press release and twitter post this week. reply ironborn123 The point is not whether it takes one week or two weeks.But eastern competition is fierce, and the western world is mired in esg and bureaucracy.Something is rotten at a general level, and if its not fixed soon, this trend of lagging behind will also start manifesting where it starts to hurt. reply willis936 Ever felt schedule pressure &#x2F; been on the critical path? This is that concept applied globally. The hurry is that delays in initial research measurably delays potential rollout. I&#x27;d like to see this material meaningfully used in my lifetime for its potential global society wide benefits &#x2F; ease of human suffering &#x2F; margin on total ecological collapse. The pace set now affects the mean and standard deviation of probability of that happening on the timeline. reply Torkel 2From a scientific perspective, you are probably correct.But think about it from a company&#x2F;wealth creation perspective. Are you then really sure the correct course of action is to take it chill? reply pm215 My point partly is that as outside observers we can&#x27;t deduce \"is taking it chill\" merely because we haven&#x27;t seen two press releases and three tweetstorms from any particular lab yet. They might be slogging away but not caring to report every step on the path to the outside world. reply anonylizard This is why Elon takes dumps on competitor companies.He understands how to market in the social media age. replycarabiner 1These are completely different activities...

People who can&#x27;t compete stay as professors doing research because it&#x27;s the easiest and most convenient pathway. reply alsaaro 1Maybe.A better explanation for the slowness of the national laboratories is they their word will be taken more definitively on this issue than anyone else.They are the ones with reputations and have to answer to critics in the private sector, amateur sector, and in Congress.I think their slowness is an encouraging sign, it means LK99 isn&#x27;t easily debunked. reply waihtis 2the difference between doers versus academics has never been demonstrated more beautifully reply dwb 2Oh yeah, the commercial \"doers\" are happy to have a go once academics have slogged away at the hard, risky, expensive, and often thankless trial-and-error before the discovery. Not to do down the people in this particular example, and I&#x27;m happy to assume they aren&#x27;t claiming any credit they shouldn&#x27;t, but the dichotomy really isn&#x27;t as you make it out to be. reply admissionsguy 2The problem is they needed academics to show them what to do. reply sashank_1509 2The story goes, some professor had a theory in 1999 that was rejected by the mainstream regarding creating superconductors. He passed away and as a dying wish asked his students to continue the research work and develop a theory for why it works. The students unable to get “academic” funding set up a company and got funding from industry to do their research in 2017 and the rest is history.It’s very hard to redeem academia in this example. reply kome 2it&#x27;s kinda false: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hackmd.io&#x2F;@lifthrasiir&#x2F;lk-99-prehistory people were working on it since soviet times, in academia.

I suppose a few things I can conclude from this saga:1. The synthesis process is much more complex than the original paper suggests. Every group except the original is unable to create a large piece of sufficient purity.2. It seems like even with a pure sample, the entire structure might not be superconducting which leads it to tilt on one edge instead of completely floating. (Some call it a 1D superconductor, I’m a bit out of my depth here)Should expect all these things to improve soon, but seems like a genuine breakthrough, not a fake or a dud’ reply blackkettle 2The original group also stated that they are preparing another paper specifically about this synthesis process IIRC. This would seem to indicate that the challenge is known and the initial omission either deliberate or another side effect of this absurdly gripping kdrama. reply EvgeniyZh This 1D stuff really confuses me. I was taught that 1D superconductivity is prohibited by Mermin Wagner theorem. You can induce superconductivity on 1D system but that requires higher dimensional SC near it, which is the opposite of proposed scenario?If someone have seen theoretical papers explaining this and&#x2F;or understands it, I&#x27;d love to know.

Of course they&#x27;re wary about cooperations with people they don&#x27;t intimately trust. reply cooper_ganglia 1“Some people are rude to me for reasons entirely unrelated to the issue at hand” isn’t a valid reason to lack any level of humility, or to withhold evidence of your extraordinary claims. reply willis936 1There would have to be a lot of cognitive dissonance to be illegally trans yet self identity as \"ethnically soviet\" on a social media bio. reply aoeusnth1 1It takes a lot of cognitive dissonance to be pro USSR in the first place, so a little more shouldn&#x27;t hurt. reply zarzavat 1USSR means something different to Russians than it does to Americans. To Americans it was the Enemy. To Russians it was the last time that Russia was truly important on the world stage and had some degree of prosperity. reply lost_tourist I think it&#x27;s kind of like the 1950&#x27;s for white supremacists. reply xvector 1just some good ole nostalgia for stalin&#x27;s purges! reply dclowd9901 1You’re making quite a leap here assuming they’re trans, but it’s an inarguable stance to take anyway. If I say “they should reveal to increase the profile of trans folks everywhere”, you’ll say “why is it incumbent upon them to prove their value?” If I say “they should reveal to shut down harassers,” you’ll say that I must be a transphobe.Sexual politics is tiring and pointless, honestly. With all the ad hominem bullshit and disingenuous positioning, no one is even trying to resolve it. reply Tade0 1I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a valid hypothesis anyway.The culture around anime profile pictures is that you pick a character that you at least somewhat relate to - or used to in the past and embraced that.For trans people that&#x27;s usually a character that is at least in some way gender-bending - like being mistaken for the other sex by other characters or people unfamiliar with the franchise. reply ShamelessC That sort of comment is completely unnecessary and ignorant on so many levels. Do better. reply protastus Her methods were improvised and lacking, by her own admission. There are several world class labs working on this today.

People want to see LK-99 being replicated by multiple sources. Aside from that, as I understand it the information in the original South Korean paper leaves out a lot of details on how to fully replicate their findings. reply mholm 1It is documented fairly poorly in the South Korean paper. Not atrociously poorly, but enough that there&#x27;s a fair bit of ambiguity, and several top labs have failed to replicate for this reason. When replication is this difficult, hundreds of labs doing experiments will give tremendous data on the principles behind what create the material, moreso than one lab repeating hundreds of small tweaks. reply ssijak 2not sure what you are saying. other labs are trying to replicate what Koreans published and are documenting the their process of replication reply threeseed Also it&#x27;s great that all of the labs have their own style for how they replicate it. reply lost_tourist That&#x27;s one of the core tenets of science of course: experimental reproducibility given reasonable instructions; the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe, well except for possibly blackholes reply great_psy 1I’m obviously way out of my depth here, But,How is this different than a tiny magnetized piece of iron ?Are they saying this piece showing in the video will always float the same way regardless of orientation ?Also would this effect still work with an electromagnet ? reply xsmasher 1A piece of magnetized iron would flip the other way if you turned over the magnet. That&#x27;s why in the Chinese videos you see them remove the magnet, flip it over, and put it back.The same \"end\" of LK99 floats, no matter which pole of the magnet you put toward the sample. reply amluto 1To me, this doesn’t really look like the little sample is trying to levitate. It looks like it’s trying to rotate, almost like it’s trying to line up with the magnetic field.Magnetic dipoles in a magnetic field experience a torque, and if a little sliver of stuff experiences a torque trying to make it point a particular direction, this could easily overcome the force pulling it toward the magnet.(The torque on a dipole is proportional to the applied field. The force is proportional to the gradient of the field. And the experimenters seem to be using a pretty big flat magnet or a big solenoid, close to the center, which is likely to have a fairly spatially constant field near the surface.)I’m reminded of once holding a bar magnet in a small plasma testbed electromagnet. Small = a few feet long and maybe 2 feet across. (The big one across the room was about the size of a semi truck IIRC.). I naively expected the magnet to be pulled in toward the center. Nope, not so much, but it tried quite hard to twist itself in my hands. reply timinou 2I&#x27;m curious what companies stand to gain the most from this discovery...

Just a decent into people tweeting (in thread) about how great America is, the best country, etc. Really surreal.Think it was in replies here, but not logged in to tell: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;andrewmccalip&#x2F;status&#x2F;1684438158837153792 reply cooper_ganglia 1I don’t think the USA is at the forefront of science, and I’m really disappointed to see discoveries like this originating from South Korea, China, and Russia before we saw results here. But even in light of that, I don’t think it’s very controversial to say that the USA is inarguably the greatest country on the planet.While it&#x27;s true that the USA may not always be the first to every scientific discovery, what it is at the forefront of is global trends and driving forward progress in a multitude of arenas. Silicon Valley has single-handedly transformed the global tech landscape, with pioneering companies like Google, Apple, and Facebook leading the charge.American universities such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford consistently rank among the top in the world, pushing the boundaries of research and innovation. The cultural sphere is heavily influenced by American trends as well. Hollywood and New York City define global standards in entertainment, fashion, and lifestyle.Also, America&#x27;s economic is the largest globally, and has considerable influence in shaping global financial trends. And let&#x27;s not forget the huge strides in space exploration, highlighted by NASA&#x27;s momentous moon landing and Mars missions. I mean, even the Soviets got a man in space! And that was half a century ago! European astronauts have to hitch a ride on an American-made rocket to represent their nations.So yeah, while there&#x27;s always room for improvement, America&#x27;s influence as a pace-setter, innovator, and leader on the global stage sets it apart. This isn’t just a “USA! USA!” chant, I have a seemingly never-ending list of criticisms of my country, but, in terms of advancing the human species, I would take the USA over literally any other country every single day of the week. reply zarzavat 1It’s simply because the US is the richest country on the planet[0]. A lot of money buys a lot of science. Many of those great discoveries are not made by Americans, if you look around at any of those American universities you’ll see people from all corners of the world.So yes, the US is quite good at research, but it’s not due to some intrinsic quality of the country any more than a billionaire’s ability to attract beautiful women is down to their good looks. The US is simply punching at its (very heavy) weight.[0] Why is the US the richest country? It has a lot of arable land to support a large population. Most of the original settlers came from the previous richest country, and it was never colonized (or more precisely it was never decolonized) meaning that the wealth was not diverted away from the people like it was in most of the worlds countries. The real story here is how China has completely mismanaged all the opportunities it’s had, you can thank Mao for that. reply cooper_ganglia That&#x27;s my point exactly. The USA is a melting pot of all other nations. We have some of the most genius minds from around the globe, and it&#x27;s exactly the fact that it&#x27;s the richest nation in the world that makes it the best at many things.\"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, and I&#x27;ll fund all of their research projects.\" reply elkhadiy 2This might just be a joke about how everything&#x2F;everyone in the USA is suboptimally bigger than the rest of the world. reply Levitz 2I think it&#x27;s just a \"everything is bigger in the US\" joke. reply baq 2It&#x27;s jarring for us Euros (I dunno, ghosts of the war are still alive maybe?), but it&#x27;s pretty normal stateside. reply rsynnott 2Also, the Soviet Union, I think; it’s just bad associations all the way down. I realise that Americans have a different background and an American being really into flags and founding fathers and all that usually means something completely different (and less worrying) than someone in Europe doing same, but it’s still hard not to find it offputting. reply thepasswordis Are you saying Europeans dont have any national pride? reply SanderNL 1I think you would be hard pressed to find any Euro seriously and non-ironically proclaiming their country the best in the world. Then again, it&#x27;s not unheard of.It just sounds stupid here, because even when all of us combine we only ever so slightly pass the \"regional power\" mark. And we know it. reply thepasswordis 1Have you met any Europeans?Italians are convinced that Italy is the center of the world, with the best food, home of Rome, etc.French are convinced that France is the center of the world, with the best food, home of Democracy, etc.The British are convinced that Britain is the center of the world...although maybe not so convinced of the food :-P.Germans, same thing.Portugese same thing, but it&#x27;s the \"secret\" version of Spain with better wine, better food, better beaches, etc.Everybody has national pride.

Maybe it&#x27;s partly that I can&#x27;t imagine finding (or any other British&#x2F;western European person finding) this a source of national pride to begin with, but even when it&#x27;s something we do.. I just can&#x27;t see non-Americans talking like that.It&#x27;s not really a problem, just surprised me. reply bandyaboot 1While most of it is probably sincere, it&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that some people do the \"overly patriot American\" as a joke. reply lost_tourist My troll account on twitter is a mishmash of patriotic words that make no sense but I still have 8k followers lol reply bandyaboot 1That sort of cringey, oblivious patriotism has existed here for a long time, but I have a feeling it&#x27;s become more common on Twitter since the average demo of active participants has undoubtedly shifted toward the political and cultural sensibilities of Elon Musk.

You buy only the bread that tastes good, and that shoes that fit, so the market will provide, etc.It&#x27;s a small step from there, to outsourcing part of that to a middle men like Costco. Costco benefits from their reputation with customers they got from those efforts.Similar for product reviews on independent websites or magazines or even on Amazon.It&#x27;s only in exceptional circumstances that &#x27;consumer regulators&#x27; can not be private entities.And much of the time, we get lots of government regulation that could be done by private entities just fine or better. But to be honest, lots of that regulation is still &#x27;good enough&#x27;, so it doesn&#x27;t do that much harm. Two examples to illustrate:Germans like to eat raw minced pork. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mett So there are rules in Germany that all pork sold has to be save to eat raw. In most other countries, people don&#x27;t share that peculiar preference, so the government regulations on pork are less strict.I hold that even in the absence of specific regulation, the German market would provide Germans with pork that&#x27;s safe to eat raw. Companies would just put a little sticker on their meat that tells you, that it&#x27;s safe to eat (and normal existing rules about truth in advertising would make sure the sticker is trustworthy).The second example: thanks to harmonised EU rules you can put palm oil in your chocolate without loudly declaring it and still call it chocolate on the packaging. (You just have to mention the palm oil in the fine-print list of ingredients.) By and large, German customers don&#x27;t like palm oil in their chocolate. So German supermarkets mostly only carry &#x27;proper&#x27; chocolate. So we private companies regulating the German chocolate market, to give consumers what they want. reply JohnBooty next [–]By default, consumers are their own best regulator. You buy only the bread that tastes good, and that shoes that fit, so the market will provide, etc.This only really works if the product is cheap and most people can afford to try lots of competitors, or if the consumer is sufficiently knowledgeable.It works pretty well for bread or chocolate: most people can afford to try different brands until they find one they like. No knowledge required.It works less well for relatively expensive items like printers with relatively hidden pitfalls that require a some level of domain knowledge and research to comprehend before purchase. Most people can&#x27;t buy a different printer every week until they find the one they like, and outside of the HN crowd many (most?) people don&#x27;t have the domain knowledge to research a tech product properly.Obviously third-party review sources (Wirecutter, Consumer Reports, whatever) can mitigate this somewhat but they are subject to their own biases. The second example: thanks to harmonised EU rules you can put palm oil in your chocolate without loudly declaring it and still call it chocolate on the packaging. (You just have to mention the palm oil in the fine-print list of ingredients.)To me an ideal solution for printers or other cloud-dependent tech devices would be along these lines. I don&#x27;t think HP&#x27;s behavior should be outlawed, but there needs to be standardized messaging&#x2F;warnings telling the consumer that:1. the box contains a device that is nonfunctional unless consumers pay an ongoing subscription fee2. what that fee is3. a warning and the manufacturer can essentially brick the device at any time by intentionally discontinuing support or going out of business reply brightlancer > This only really works if the product is cheap and most people can afford to try lots of competitors, or if the consumer is sufficiently knowledgeable.That is absurd. By that argument, individuals consumers can&#x27;t be trusted to make any but the simplest decisions, and all the rest must be made by some All Knowing government agency.In practice, consumers talk to one another; if someone bought a lemon, they&#x27;re usually quick to warn everyone else away. And because all of this is iterative, companies that make good products&#x2F; services will get increasingly more customer share, while other companies will lose.Governments are very good at making pronouncements but they are slow and often no more expert than the consumer. Consumers can correct their mistakes much faster than bureaucracies can. reply KerrAvon You’re literally arguing with someone advocating for consumers to be provided with enough information to be able to make decisions for themselves. They’re not saying they want the government to ban these practices, just to make them non-deceptive. Which is a role the government has performed successfully in the past: see the Pure Food and Drug Act. reply lostlogin > Governments are very good at making pronouncements but they are slow and often no more expert than the consumer. Consumers can correct their mistakes much faster than bureaucracies can.Here in New Zealand we have some legislation called the consumer guarantees act. It’s gold, and has all sorts of gems. My favourite is that things I buy should last an amount of time commensurate with the price I paid.For example, my iPhone was replaced at 3 years for a faulty home button and my Stihl saw had its motor replaced at 3 years. It’s amazing. I see the sort of warranties available in other countries and wince. reply Two4 If this is true then why, for the love of God, can I not walk into my local and buy a halfway decent printer? reply deaddodo > The second example: thanks to harmonised EU rules you can put palm oil in your chocolate without loudly declaring it and still call it chocolate on the packaging.

So German supermarkets mostly only carry &#x27;proper&#x27; chocolate. So we private companies regulating the German chocolate market, to give consumers what they want.Except, Hershey has been using vegetable oils in Chocolate in the US, due to lower costs and lax regulation, for decades. It hasn&#x27;t stopped them at all and is the primary reason the cheap commercial chocolates in the US \"taste like vomit\", to foreigners. reply implements The vomit taste comes from butyric acid, I believe - which seems to be a breakdown product of milk:The process is a company and trade secret, but experts speculate that the milk is partially lipolyzed. This produces butyric acid, a compound found in substances such as Parmesan cheese which stabilizes the milk from further fermentation. This flavor gives the product a \"tangy\" taste that the US public has come to associate with the taste of chocolate … reply deaddodo My understanding was that butyric acid was a byproduct of the overall process. I am not an expert at all though, so thanks for the correction.I think that just further reinforces the point though, that the market doesn&#x27;t correct for a (generally regarded) subpar product, on its own. It requires external influence; whether it be regulatory, cultural, health-based, etc. reply sublinear Americans prioritized the price over the accuracy of the product, and at this point the \"vomit\" flavor is what Americans prefer. Same deal with other foods full of oil like American cheese. Same thing with other artificial ingredients like gums (cream cheese, ice cream, etc.).These foods are deeply ingrained with the culture now. It&#x27;s much more complex than just having an opinion about how things are made and assuming that opinion is correct.Just because a vocal minority complains about the quality of a product doesn&#x27;t mean the majority agrees or stops buying it. People vote with their wallets. reply deaddodo This is just moving goalposts based on your weird biases. Even on an almost 1:1 comparison, you&#x27;re handwaving away because \"Americans just like shitty food\".OP claimed that the market would balance things out when given subpar foods. When Hershey first made these subpar chocolates the market didn&#x27;t correct it, despite OP&#x27;s claims. Just like how the market didn&#x27;t correct meat glue use in Europe, until it was regulated out. reply eru > OP claimed that the market would balance things out when given subpar foods.No, I never claimed that. The claim that I wanted to make is the one that sublinear made: the market provides what the people care enough about that they are willing to pay for.Eg Germany has good pork and decent chocolate in mainstream supermarkets. But the boil-in-bag rice those places sell would make your average Asian through up a little.Consumer regulation does the least harm, when it is the least necessary: when the mainstream consumer already agrees with it, and when it&#x27;s reasonably easy for knowledgeable people with different tastes to side-step.Eg the German &#x27;Reinheitsgebot&#x27; purity law has some strict rules about what you can put in your beer and still call it &#x27;Bier&#x27;. But it doesn&#x27;t actually restrict the knowledgeable consumer: your supplier can concoct whatever they feel like, they might just have to get creative with the name.If Americans like &#x27;shitty food&#x27;, that&#x27;s up to them. Who are we to judge them? reply deaddodo 51 Your point might apply if Lindt, Ghirardelli and Guitard weren&#x27;t the most popular chocolates after Hershey&#x27;s; all considered pretty high quality. That&#x27;s like saying \"Germans like shitty meat because you can buy cheap, low-quality sausages at the corner store\" (which I can attest to myself, anecdotally).The point being, a lack of regulations allowed for low quality chocolates that are available and some people purchase. There&#x27;s no reason to believe the same wouldn&#x27;t happen in other countries; Germans, French, Japanese, etc aren&#x27;t somehow more enlightened about food. reply happymellon It&#x27;s not the Hershey&#x27;s chocolate bar that this impacts, and makes it taste of vomit, as already mentioned it&#x27;s the soured milk that causes that. The extra vegetable oils impact the white chocolate more obviously.Have you tried American white chocolate, like the white Kisses? Candles have more flavour. reply hathchip I think you need to explain why in the United States chocolate is shitty and meat is toxic, as well as why Germany doesn&#x27;t have regions with poisonous drinking water, nor health clinics where you can simply declare yourself in need of large amounts of highly addictive opiate painkillers in order to receive a prescription. reply eru American mainstream consumers have weird preferences, I would guess?It&#x27;s perfectly possible to buy decent chocolate in the US. Eg Lindt and Ritter Sport seem to be widely available. (They are far from the best chocolate, they are just decent-enough brands that I remembered at the top of my head, and could verify with a quick web search are available in the US.)How toxic is that meat actually? What are your sources? How do you know it&#x27;s more of a problem in the US than in Germany? (Americans like to complain about their products. But we get American beef here in Singapore, and it&#x27;s generally ok. Typically not as good as the Japanese or even Australian stuff, but good enough.)> [...] nor health clinics where you can simply declare yourself in need of large amounts of highly addictive opiate painkillers in order to receive a prescription.The stories I heard are rather the opposite: the political and regulatory backlash against the alleged &#x27;opioid epidemic&#x27; has been so bad, that it&#x27;s hard for people who legitimately need painkillers to get a prescription.I suspect the US is a big country, so both accusations can be true at the same time. Even if the problem is tiny in relative terms, because of the size of the country, in absolute terms you will find plenty of cases of both failure modes. reply hathchip 37 You seem very in denial about a lot of this. Obviously &#x27;weird preferences&#x27; do not really explain these issues (I note you completely ignored the case of heavy metals in drinking water, hard to explain as a &#x27;consumer preference&#x27; for cheaper but unusable water.) So you&#x27;ve chosen to pretend that well documented things do not exist or are trivial.. Libertarian Germans often have to tie themselves in knots to pretend that all the elements of their high-trust society would exist without paternalistic government, when it&#x27;s enough to compare their society to most others in the world to establish the opposite!What country does Ritter Sport come from? Is it considered luxury chocolate in that country?The huge differences between husbandry and meatpacking standards in the United States and Western Europe are extremely well known. Most US meat products are not allowed to be imported to the EU because of this. I&#x27;m surprised you need a &#x27;source&#x27; for this widely known fact pattern (which in fact, you yourself mentioned in your comment above - pork in the US can not be eaten rare). What US meat is exported is generally a completely different standard than what&#x27;s sold domestically.The ready availability and aggressive marketing of opiate painkillers in the US continued for around twenty years, many of it based in &#x27;pain clinics&#x27; whose only service was writing scripts for pills. Such clinics do not exist in Western Europe. The govt cracked down on these at a point where addiction was endemic in some regions. The problem was demonstrably not &#x27;tiny in relative terms&#x27;. reply nitwit005 If it was normal, there wouldn&#x27;t be special Costco models. All the other retailers would have made the same demands.I&#x27;d love if the market fixed all these product quality issues, but it doesn&#x27;t. reply JohnBooty next [–]I&#x27;d love if the market fixed all these product quality issues, but it doesn&#x27;t.Yeah. Free markets only work when consumers are educated and sufficiently informed enough to make good decisions.The problem is that a consumer relies on thousands of products a year and it is a practical impossibility to be educated in all domains of knowledge. You can&#x27;t have deep knowledge of transport, healthcare, technology, food, and a thousand other things. reply hgomersall It&#x27;s even crappier than that. There are loads of products that don&#x27;t see the commercial light of day. Vested interests work very hard to suppress competitors before it even gets to the point where consumers have a meaningful choice. In other areas, gatekeepers (e.g. supermarkets) make decisions on behalf of the consumers, often actively suppressing information that might damage other product lines. reply epgui It&#x27;s so refreshing to just hear someone say exactly that. (Shouldn&#x27;t this be obvious to everyone?) reply eru The market only fixes issues that customers care enough about to vote with their wallets.Quality ain&#x27;t free. There&#x27;s often a trade-off between quality and price. Pretending otherwise is foolish. reply linker3000 Trouble is that in many cases the food industry has rebased what was once the normal product as &#x27;premium&#x27; and charges a higher price for it. A good example is bacon.No food manufacturer us going to sell the &#x27;normal&#x27; product as just that and label the cheaper one as somehow inferior.On a side note, it irks me that a certain brand of mayonnaise (made by a global chemicals company), which calls itself &#x27;real mayonnaise&#x27; lists its top two ingredients as vegetable (not olive) oil and water. Not exactly a classic start to how the original was made. reply 8note The customer isn&#x27;t the regulator here though, Costco is, and Costco can only do so with market power.People aren&#x27;t picking Costco because Costco has the best printers, they&#x27;re buying their printers at costco because they&#x27;re already at Costco buying groceries and clothing.It&#x27;s the same thing with apple -- monopolizing power gives corporations regulatory power.> normal existing rules about truth in advertising would make sure the sticker is trustworthyTake out one regulation, while leaving another overlapping regulation, and the regulation still works?

Etc.> Take out one regulation, while leaving another overlapping regulation, and the regulation still works? This is switching the conversation to which regulations are the most effective, rather than saying that regulations are irrelevant.Maybe.

Reputational value that the actual tech company itself has lost reply aix1 Agree 100%.

I am not saying the American market would provide Americans with pork that&#x27;s safe to eat raw.That&#x27;s because Americans don&#x27;t typically eat their pork raw, so they don&#x27;t care enough for the market to supply this product. reply namibj 17 Even then, raw pork requires 100% carcass inspections or sashimi-like freezing to reliably prevent the parasite infections. reply derbOac I guess that still doesn&#x27;t explain why consumer preferences need to be conveyed through a strongman like Costco?Is Costco really doing anything other than selling the more expensive version which you could buy anyway?If not it suggests Costco is acting as some kind of hired protection, which definitely doesn&#x27;t sound like an optimal supply choice scenario in an ideal market. reply SmellTheGlove They don’t need to, it just happens to be in the best interest of Costco, so Costco inserts itself.People buy larger ticket items at Costco because they trust it to work, with a return policy that makes it a safe bet. So Costco needs to sell products that don’t get returned in order to make this strategy work. reply eru What is an &#x27;ideal market&#x27;?Costco is a retailer, and as such is providing a service by amongst other things aggregating consumer preferences. reply dumbfounder They are creating a trusted environment where you can buy things that don’t suck. That has value. If it was the mafia they would require you to shop there. reply mbreese Costco is also saving themselves money by making sure that people don&#x27;t return HP printers because they don&#x27;t work. When you have a known liberal return policy that is a feature of the membership, you have an incentive is to make sure that customers don&#x27;t want to return those products.So, I see it less as a trusted environment and more as a seller motivated to make sure returns don&#x27;t hit their margins. A consumer-positive&#x2F;trusted environment is still be a good thing for consumers, regardless of if the creation of that environment was motivated by the bottom line. replysoulofmischief > By default, consumers are their own best regulatorAll of these free market tenets fall apart in a propaganda state. reply eesmith You wrote: \"By default, consumers are their own best regulator.

Consider https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Alum :> In the Victorian era, alum was used along with other substances like plaster of Paris to adulterate certain food products, particularly bread. It was used to make lower-grade flour appear whiter, allowing the producers to spend less on whiter flour. Because it retains water, it would make the bread heavier, meaning that merchants could charge more for it in their shops. The amount of alum present in each loaf of bread could reach levels that would be toxic to humans and cause chronic diarrhea, which could lead to death in young children.[26]Or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.geriwalton.com&#x2F;food-and-drink-adulteration-in-17...> ... by the early 1800s, the practice of adulteration had become so common, nineteenth century people developed a taste for fraudulent substances in their food and drink and often did not realize anything was wrong with what they were ingesting until it was too late.quoting https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;History_of_bread :> [Bread adulteration] gradually came to an end with government action, such as the 1860 and 1899 Food Adulteration Acts in Britain.[29] America had a more difficult time ending these processes of adulteration, however, as various states had varying policies regarding bread making.The free market could not resolve the problem. reply fireflash38 The bread that tastes good to most is the one that has shitloads of sugar added.

So no regulation keeps this kind of product off the market in Germany.)> Shit, even with your example of chocolate in the US capitalism got us shitty ass Hershey \"chocolate\". Why would that happen ya think?The market provides what customers are willing to pay for. I don&#x27;t know why mainstream Americans have weird taste in chocolate.Germans get the kind of chocolate they are willing to pay for. And Americans get the kind of chocolate they are willing to pay for.As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s perfectly legal to sell Hershey&#x27;s in Germany.

Eg in mainstream German supermarkets you can&#x27;t find the quality of rice that would be acceptable in eg Singapore.

Mainstream Germans just don&#x27;t care enough. reply erulabs You mean by far and away the cheapest possible chocolate and bread money can buy? The chocolate and bread the majority of us grew up with because it was cheaper than dirt and it was all we could afford?Why do you think healthier options have been flooding shelves for 20 years now? We’re getting wealthier, and our standards are going up. Don’t make the mistake of mandating your standards onto others ‘for their own good’.

Nobody can choose to use cable&#x2F;dsl and run their own wifi AP?No DSL or cable because the building was never wired for POTS or cable.

I should probably be a better person and block it.*probably because I am not a complete idiot and the open network is throttled down to just about unusable. enough perhaps for a webpage and a message but pictures are unpleasant and video is right out. reply ben0x539 Do you know that the neighbor didn&#x27;t intentionally make their TV do that? reply somat Hard to say, the link is slow enough that video is unpleasant. But sure, it could have been someone fiddling around in the config when they first got the tv(onboarding process?) but does not have any streaming services so does not care that the link is garbage. But I think the tv was just happy to find a open network and started using it for telemetry. replyLeoPanthera Currently, I&#x27;m not convinced there is a difference. There used to be, in that some Sony TVs would require an out-of-the-box firmware update in order to enable all features, but the Costco models didn&#x27;t.But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true with the current generation. reply spywaregorilla I feel like people get hung up on silly things. What does \"enable all features\" mean? Does it mean using the smart tv features? I feel like that&#x27;s pretty reasonable.I say as someone who just bought a sony tv, declined all features, and just use an hdmi input from an actual computer. Very pleasant experience. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever seen a TV that doesn&#x27;t actually allow you to do this. reply saratogacx I had a Vizio that only let you change inputs and volume, everything else only worked through a phone app that worked over the internet. This included things like picture&#x2F;sound settings and input labels.I hated that t.v. And was glad it died prematurely. reply LeoPanthera It wasn&#x27;t smart TV features, no. From memory, it was things like variable refresh rate support, for games consoles. reply Rebelgecko Some companies just do that so they don&#x27;t have to price match competitors reply Marsymars I don’t think there’s any difference currently. I have a one-generation old Sony TV that I bought from Costco in Canada, and it’s the same model as is sold in Canada outside of Costco. reply walrus01 Just don&#x27;t ever give your tv the wifi password. I have a thousand times more confidence at microsoft will keep the xbox operating system up to date and reasonably secure (yes, it has ads on the homescreen) than I do that any smart tv vendor will still support their crap OS in 5, 7, 10 years from now.Use an xbox or a PS5 to drive the TV and run the apps on that. reply jwells89 I use an Apple TV 4K, but yeah, same idea. I was mainly just wondering if Costco models had significant differences in terms of non-smart features. reply aceazzameen My TV and the few IoT devices I own are all on their own wifi network under their own subnet. I don&#x27;t care what happens on that network. Maybe routers should come with similar automatic features to sequester unsecure IoT devices from everyday users&#x27; networks. reply JoshTriplett The issue isn&#x27;t (primarily) your TV abusing the local network. The issue is your TV sending all your viewing habits back to the manufacturer to sell them, including by doing video recognition on videos being played through HDMI inputs. reply userbinator I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to cross-flash firmware to unlock other models. I highly doubt HP is spending the money to create an entire new different set of models just for Costco. reply ShadowBanThis01 It&#x27;s most likely not so consumer-friendly.This kind of bullshit has gone on for years, notably in the mattress industry. Mattress companies are famous for simply slapping different model numbers on the same mattresses sold to each retailer, to undermine price guarantees.No doubt HP, Sony, and who knows who else pulls the same shit with merchandise sold to Costco. reply __jonas But the sticker has an icon in the lower left corner that suggests it should be pulled off?Here is a reply from the Mastodon thread that seems more plausible:> @steeph @netspooky They&#x27;re not hiding it, they&#x27;re getting you to set up the printer over wifi, and only use the USB port after that. It seems if you use the USB port straight away it&#x27;ll only print up to 20 pages then stop. They do this to get you to opt into hp+ and lock the printer in to use official toner. That&#x27;s why the printer is so cheap reply userbinator The phrase \"opt into\" implies there&#x27;s a choice, but the rest of that paragraph implies there isn&#x27;t. reply wolrah The choice is when you buy it. The models with \"e\" at the end are less expensive, sometimes significantly so, than their hardware-identical non-e counterparts, but they are locked in to the HP+ service in firmware.As far as I can tell there is no option to \"buy out\" an e model to remove the subscription requirement. Given HP&#x27;s history I suspect once this annoys the wrong person it&#x27;ll turn out to be pretty trivial to break, but for now if you feel the need to purchase a new HP product you should definitely avoid the ones with an e in the model number.AFAIK Brother hasn&#x27;t tried anything like this (yet?) and they&#x27;re cheap so if they fit your needs I recommend them. reply dryanau Brother rejected my 3rd party toner on the MFC-L3750CDW after an automatic firmware update. Fuck them, I said at the time.Then I bought a far cheaper second-hand Brother printer, turned off firmware updates, and have continued using 3rd party toner. So only kind-of fuck them, I guess, because their printers do the job pretty well.But I am glad I switched to mono, because the colour MFC would have cost AUD$550+ on genuine toner (3 colour + 1 black).

So I got another HL-L2375DW (mono full duplex laser) last year to replace my first which I gave to my ex after separation&#x2F;divorce - a perfect little unit, not a trace of HP-level BS anywhere to be found. It goes to sleep with minimal power use, and wakes up when needed, even weeks or months between each use - can print straight from my Samsung phone with no extra driver install needed, as well as from PC naturally. I&#x27;ve just set it up on the Wifi, but it also has a network port + USB. Perfect.It was only around 200 AUD; mind you the included toner wasn&#x27;t the biggest but I only need it for occasional use so it&#x27;s still going strong. I&#x27;ll probably get their big drum when it eventually runs out (that&#x27;s what I did with my 1st, ex printed a lot more than I) and whilst I could go 3rd party I&#x27;ll just buy theirs anyway to support them in a small way.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brother.com.au&#x2F;en&#x2F;products&#x2F;all-printers&#x2F;printers... reply cam_l I got to the point where I actually buy brother ink for my old brother printers, because it is not that expensive and I really don&#x27;t want them to go out of business. reply Nifty3929 Right!

But I have only printed 3,768 pages in that time. So 314 pages per year.It is the best type of printer for my use case which is infrequent printing. Ink type printers aren&#x27;t the best options if you might have 90+ days between printing jobs. I also really like having the scanning and photo copying features that mine has.

Speaking from experience doing support for a lot of them, brother* printers are notorious for not realizing the toner (even with originals) was changed. There are ways to reset the counter though(Holding two buttons while powering on). It&#x27;s usually mentioned in the manual.* It&#x27;s the only brand I know with that problem. reply codemiscreant After a recent firmware update my Brother inkjet refuses to print b&w (yes it has a full black cartridge and this was never a problem previously) because one of the color inks is empty. Brother the Good is a thing of the past. reply nektro the issue is using inkjet reply codemiscreant Sure, but previously this printer explicitly supported black only modes with no regard for the other inks. Brother decided it was easy money acting like the other makers, and this is likely to percolate to their other products. reply ksherlock There&#x27;s a little window on the side of the toner. Cover it with some black tape. reply m463 i have a brother toner cartridge and got low toner messages. I have not even printed 250 pages.I was thinking maybe I moved the printer and it is not level? reply xeromal That&#x27;s actually great information because it has been driving me crazy. I put in a brand new cartridge and it still complains. I assumed it was non-OEM BS. reply graton You could try to shake the toner cartridge a bit from side to side. Try to make the toner even. It might help, it might not. reply joecool1029 No point in doing this unless the prints themselves are fading out. Doing it with a full aftermarket cartridge is just asking for a mess. reply joecool1029 > I was thinking maybe I moved the printer and it is not level?Unlike the inkjet where it shines a little LED through the cartridge (covering with black electrical tape makes it think it&#x27;s always full), laser toner I think has an id chip on the cartridge and the printer just maintains an internal counter as to guess when it&#x27;ll run out. Reset that, and make sure the option is turned off that stops it continuing to print once low (networked models have a webpage you can go to to turn these from stop to just warn). reply foobarian Do you have a recommendation for color photo printers? For when grandma is visiting and so on? reply FireBeyond Canon. A whole range from &#x27;enthusiast&#x27; to &#x27;professional&#x27; (I love my Image Pro 1000, but I make a sideline hustle from photography - it&#x27;s entirely overkill for most - but there are more budget friendly models). reply graton Print them at your local pharmacy or somewhere else that will do color photo prints. Not worth the hassle, in my opinion, to have a color printer (ink or laser). reply squarefoot Although Epson doesn&#x27;t quite have a stellar reputation wrt user friendliness, my WP4515 has worked great for like 7-8 years so far. It&#x27;s also perfectly supported by Linux. Not sure if the above can be still relevant as that model has been superseded by newer ones. reply themindfield Is anyone familiar with a solid open source printer hardware project?Given all of the issues with printers over the years (driver compatibility, ink cartridge drm, things like the above post), I’m curious if there is a reason open source printer hardware is not more common.My assumption would be the complexity of the print mechanism &#x2F; tolerances &#x2F; balancing. reply leejo > My assumption would be the complexity of the print mechanism &#x2F; tolerances &#x2F; balancing.I once sat on a chairlift with a lawyer who had represented one of the big printer companies and he explained that printers are the perfect storm of: hardware, software, firmware, chemistry, physics, fluid dynamics, paper science, and (yes) lawyers.The larger companies have put billions into R&D, hence them continuing to pull the crap we see every other month on HN. reply thih9 I don’t care about that R&D.I seriously doubt that R&D was about long term cost efficient reliability in a user friendly context - because we’re mostly seeing the opposite.I print two b&w pages per month, for now I’m another happy user of a brother laser printer. reply userbinator There are plenty of open-source 3D printers but doesn&#x27;t seem to be any 2D ones.That said, I think open-source firmware for existing 2D printers would be a better idea, perhaps with a controller board to retrofit into existing mechanisms since I suspect they&#x27;ve heavily used crypto to lock out alternative firmware. Driving the two axes is relatively simple, but RE&#x27;ing printhead signals and driving those are probably going to be the most difficult part. reply exmadscientist In general the hardware on a 2D printer is simply more difficult than most or all of the OSHW stuff.Paper handling is hell (there&#x27;s a great magazine article from a few years back on the Xerox division who handles this... they&#x27;re wizards, the lot of them). Hardware, software, and environment dependent.Everything needs to be RIPped but that&#x27;s the sort of thing which software is really good at and which is well suited to open source.For an inkjet driving the nozzles is the nasty bit. First figure out which ones to fire when, then you have to actually do it. I&#x27;m told by those in the know that this really just can&#x27;t be done well enough in software, you need the timing control of FPGA&#x2F;ASIC solutions. So, very doable, but hard.Laser printers have difficult drum and transfer belt issues but solutions are mostly copyable from existing products. Driving the laser diode itself is pretty easy (admittedly I&#x27;ve worked with laser guys, but still). The hard bit is pointing the laser in the right direction, with either spinny prisms or galvos. Or you could forgo the laser in favor of an LED array but I don&#x27;t think anyone (Oki?) ever got great results out of that. Overall a B&W laser is probably the easiest thing to start with.That all said, everyone knows China&#x27;s reputation in the hardware space: clone, clone, clone. And yet, how many Chinese printers do you come across? There&#x27;s probably a reason for that. It sure isn&#x27;t lack of skill.It&#x27;s probably just that printers are awful. reply userbinator For an inkjet driving the nozzles is the nasty bit. First figure out which ones to fire when, then you have to actually do it. I&#x27;m told by those in the know that this really just can&#x27;t be done well enough in software, you need the timing control of FPGA&#x2F;ASIC solutions. So, very doable, but hard.To get a rough idea of the frequencies involved, consider a 1440x1440 DPI printer, with a 12\" wide axis and 1\" swath. Assume the printhead can move across the full 12\" around 5 times per second (this is really fast), for a standard 8.5x11 portrait print this turns out to be around 1 page every 2.2 seconds or 27 pages per minute; at this speed the printhead is moving at 60 inches per second, so for 1440 DPI each nozzle needs to be pulsed at 1440x60=86400kHz or an 11us period, which is not that fast in terms of digital electronics. However, if you&#x27;re firing 1440 nozzles in parallel, then the total throughput of the data that needs to go into the printhead goes up to 124.416MHz, or closer to 500MHz for all 4 colours, but this is easily parallelisable.That said, those numbers are probably on the high end and represent a fast printer; I&#x27;m not even sure any consumer inkjet can do full-colour 1440 DPI at 27PPM. reply exmadscientist True enough, but it turns out you can&#x27;t fire a nozzle with a 50% duty cycle TTL signal... it&#x27;s more complicated than that. More analog. More annoying.Most of my knowledge here comes from very peripheral involvement with a project to repurpose an inkjet printhead to do Something Else™ (sorry, NDA here). The printhead high priests just scoffed at any kind of software control over the firing process, and that was that. reply mindslight Or just use an FPGA. They&#x27;re not really that hard. Just different from the open hardware community&#x27;s usual go-tos and the tooling can be kind of crappy.I&#x27;ve often wondered about an open printer design. My current printer uses inkjet cartridges which contain the print heads (HP 45&#x2F;78). That would seem to be most of the difficulty, already made available in a commoditized off the shelf package.I&#x27;ve heard paper picking can be kind of a black art, but I&#x27;d think a community could iterate fast enough to get it at least passable, or just suck it up with single sheet feeding in the beginning. And it&#x27;s not like commercial printers are foolproof.Then there&#x27;s motion control, which is already the bread and butter of the 3D printing scene. Perhaps not initially good enough to align 600dpi over multiple inches repeatably for photo quality, but I&#x27;d think it would be fine for business forms and whatnot that people end up having to print. reply kuschku Most modern color laser printers actually use LED arrays. If your laser printer has the same speed (pages&#x2F;second) for b&#x2F;w and for color, it&#x27;s very likely using an LED array.The printer I got from brother is definitely using one LED array per color. reply NortySpock I assume the print-head and paper-feeding are the hardest parts, but I would absolutely be interested in exploring how to liberate 2D printing into an open-source ecosystem just as 3D printing has an ecosystem... reply snvzz I am always sure to mention this whenever there&#x27;s talk about printers.We _need_ an open source printer. Ideally a monochrome laser with an automatic paper feeder.For most, it would be the only printer in consideration when in the market for a printer. This is true even if the specs were just at the level of early 90s printers.Even if buying something else, the mere existence of this printer would keep printer brands honest. They get to be scummy because they know we have no alternative. reply Sophira The fact that there are (formerly) \"secret agreement[s] with governments to ensure that the output of those printers is forensically traceable\" in the form of the Machine Identification Code[0] suggests that it could potentially be difficult for an open-source 2D printer to gain traction.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Machine_Identification_Code#Hi... reply snvzz >suggests that it could potentially be difficult for an open-source 2D printer to gain traction.More difficult, as opposed to easier?Avoiding this (insane) tracking anti-feature is an argument for open source, not against. reply askvictor Printing is hard. Printing fast is harder. The main reason printers still suck, 40-odd years later, is because it&#x27;s really hard, at least in the consumer market, where you don&#x27;t expect regular service, and there&#x27;s a race to the bottom in terms of price. reply smegger001 I mean you would think printers would be THE opensource hardware project as printer hate has been a ongoing issue for as long as people have been attaching them to computers. I mean a shitty closed source printer driver is what acted as the impetus for Richard Stallman to start GNU and peicemeal trying to replace the Unix. it would seem like printing would be the prime target for opensource. reply mdaniel this question comes up on a lot of the \"printer rage\" threadsand my recollection of the majority of the substantial discussions seem to imply that there are patents which are a major obstacle to any such effort, above and beyond the general \"hardware development is its own specialization\" problemNow, what I don&#x27;t know (and don&#x27;t recall seeing) is whether that&#x27;s true of every jurisdiction or if it&#x27;s just a US-centric problem and the EU could have their revenge by having an open printer that US consumers couldn&#x27;t buy :-&#x2F; reply 0cf8612b2e1e I thought patents were 20 years. At the time, in the early 2000s, I thought the HP Laserjet 4000 was a tank. Is there any reason someone would be prevented from replicating a circa 2003 model printer? reply Ekaros I would also venture to say cost. Printers use pretty specific parts and making enough generic versions with all tooling would likely mean unit price is closes to the more expensive side. And then you might as well get one from that price range.They are complex machines with complex parts. And to have those priced sensibly needs volume. Like how many injection moulds would you need? And then you would have one factory equipped. reply noAnswer My personal take is: Why bother?! It is a dying marked. Most private people don&#x27;t need a printer. Just go to a convenient store, for that one print every other year. And for the high volume business side there are still good enough commercial options. reply p1mrx A monochrome laser printer is useful for USPS shipping, because they pick up at the mailbox. I also print icons for confusing switches around the house (light &#x2F; fan &#x2F; garbage disposal) and attach them with clear tape. I recently made a \"This Hyundai vehicle is equipped with a push-button ignition\" window label to deter TikTok thieves.Inkjets are junk, because the ink dries up within a year. I&#x27;m still on my original laser toner from 2007. reply 7373737373 Is there a list of corporation shaming websites&#x2F;projects&#x2F;organisations somewhere? Edit: I suppose https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Consumer_organization is a good startIn Germany we have \"Mogelpackung des Jahres\" (\"Cheat packaging of the year\") by the consumer center&#x2F;protection organisation for example that points out companies that abuse shrinkflationhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vzhh.de&#x2F;themen&#x2F;mogelpackungen&#x2F;mogelpackung-des-j...Shame is a big driver of achieving cultural&#x2F;behavioral alignment, the same has to be done with corporations if they misbehave.While legal entities do not care, their employees and customers can be capable of that. Make every such infraction public so the companies&#x27; reputation, brand and profits correspond to the morality of its actions. Systemic failures like these need systemic fixes.Maybe it would be a good idea to force companies to publicize product return rates, so managerial brainfarts like these get rewarded accordingly. reply hobotime HP sucks, but that sticker has instructions on where to start to peal it away.They&#x27;re obviously trying to get the whole family to wirelessly print with all their devices via WiFi to use up ink. And not just connected to dad&#x27;s boring household accounting desktop. reply sliken Yes, and get the printer on the network where it can download new DRM behaviors to screw the users out of more ink. So far they retroactively added banning 3rd party ink, disabling ink once it gets too old, and of course not letting you print black if one of the other colors is out. reply quickthrower2 Next step: SaaS subscription or 60 second pause before printing reply sliken Shhh, don&#x27;t give them ideas.What gets me is large parts of HP was cut (calculators, test instruments, laser printers, etc), not because they weren&#x27;t profitable, but instead because they weren&#x27;t as profitable as selling ink. reply quickthrower2 Someone needs to tell them about diversifying investments lol! They are one disruption away from being a Kodak replyuserbinator I still wish printers continued to have parallel ports and something relatively standard and simple like ASCII+ESC&#x2F;P2 compatibility. Instead we got a morass of complexity with proprietary protocols over USB and extremely user-hostile printer firmware. reply biugbkifcjk I bought one of these because it was like $30 and needed it to print off some stuff with color. I had immediately taken the sticker off even realizing until after the fact that they try and limit it to WiFi only. It worked immediately plugging it in to USB on my Linux laptop, so yea.. I guess its only there for people that don&#x27;t know better? reply mbreese > plugging it in to USB on my Linux laptopI think this is the key part... I haven&#x27;t installed a printer driver from the manufacturer in years. Using CUPS through my Mac or Linux machines \"just works\". The crazy bloatware drivers are almost always associated with Windows, so if you&#x27;re using Linux or a Mac, there isn&#x27;t much of a risk here, is there? Linux even more so... reply quickthrower2 Didn’t a closed and unfixable printer driver kick off the free software revolution? reply fodkodrasz You&#x27;d need no hardware redesign, just not install the connectors during manufacturing. You might need to adjust the automated QA actually. There are lots of parts not installed in electronics if you disassemble something and examine it. The reasons can be multiple, cost saving, using the same PCB for different similar products, etc. reply worewood If corporations are people, HP deserves the death penalty reply charonn0 Is this just a tweet or something?

No jams, everything works, no crapware. Done 7000 sheets on it. The only thing you have to do is ignore the low toner warning as it&#x27;ll do a few hundred pages after that kicks off.This is a vast contrast to the cheap inkjet I got from them before which was drop kicked all the way to the trash after it died replacing the first cartridge.I had a Brother laser before them and the thing used to jam all the time and ate drums. reply zapkyeskrill Think of the children! There are hordes of bad men out there printing illegal material, sharing it hand to hand, and doing unimaginable things with it. It must be stopped! reply lapetitejort Their mistake was to make the sticker distinguishable from the background plastic. Inquisitive people will always remove the sticker to reveal the tempting secrets behind. reply missblit I just remove stickers because I hate all manner of visual distractions. If I could find a way to remove etched in &#x2F; painted on logos from from computer hardware I&#x27;d do that too.Got a (pretty good) apron from William Sonoma but it had the logo sewed on with a huge patch, had to painstakingly unstitch it to get a pretty apron without any branding emblazoned across the front. reply wildzzz It&#x27;s been awhile but I&#x27;ve always taken the logos off the front of the optical drives in my desktop builds. Takes like three wipes with some acetone and now you have a very clean look. Very few companies are willing to spend money on robust branding for whitebox goods so it&#x27;s often very easy to remove logos from stuff like conference swag.I bought a pencil case for work off Amazon and it had a bright red patch with the company name on it, just some sort of absolute nonsense combination of consonants and vowels. One minute with an xacto blade cut the stitches and I was left with an acceptable quality pencil case. reply JohnFen I thought that I was the only weirdo that did this sort of thing, but I&#x27;m reassured to find a kindred spirit. reply dylan604 My personal pet peeve is the branding car dealerships place on the cars they sell. I asked one sales person if I was going to get a monthly check from them for the advertising services I was providing for them. He thought I was joking. While I&#x27;ve never used a seam ripper to remove a logo from an article of clothing (kuddos to them), I have removed the license plate covers and decals from my car in front of the sales person that assumed I was joking before accepting the car. reply jacquesm Hehe, same here. I asked for a discount if they wanted to put their branded license plate holders on the car. No discount? Ok, I&#x27;ll bring my own (they&#x27;re like $5 each so no problem there). It&#x27;s kind of weird that a dealer gets to use your vehicle to advertise, it&#x27;s not like they built the car or something, they&#x27;re just a middle man. reply dismalpedigree I forced them to agree to not apply the sticker to the car I ordered for delivery to the dealer. I got in in writing from the sales rep. When I went to pick up the car and it had their stupid sticker on it. They had to remove it and redo the clear coat at their expense. reply c0nsumer Last time I purchased a car, I told the salesperson that if there&#x27;s any dealer logos or whatnot on it, I will not accept delivery. There was a license plate frame, it was very quickly removed. reply _ah Some car dealers have installed private car washes. Come in for a free wash, any time, as long as you own the car and are displaying the dealer plate. So at least in that case they&#x27;re \"paying\" for the advertising. reply quickthrower2 Lol good way to get someone who buys cars from dealers to come back. reply astura I won&#x27;t accept delivery of the car without the logos removed. reply jacquesm My stitch cutter is my favorite tool. I got mine from a surgeon in the hospital, before that I used one that is used for sewing, but the big one is a lot quicker. reply Marsymars I should really get one of those… I’ve been using the little scissors in my swiss army knife for years. reply catchnear4321 the little arrow on the bottom left also looks strikingly like a “peel here” indicator.pretty easy to peel, too, given how much larger the sticker is from the little port extrusion thing.for that matter, it isn’t even centered.assuming it would even remain stuck given how little it would be sticking to.almost like someone placed a sticker over a usb port.would someone do that? reply krackers Even with the sticker, there&#x27;s also a USB logo visible. It seems like this is not HP trying to trick the user into using wifi by hiding usb, but just letting them know that this thing supports wifi. reply catchnear4321 exactly.that isn’t to say their app isn’t nefarious or supported by alphabet agencies. it could be. or not.but this sticker isn’t there to hide anything. reply Marsymars My cable modem has a sticker that looks very much like the surrounding plastic.

The 910 3-pack on Best Buy is $36 for me, and claims a 315 page yield. Instant ink, on the other hand, offers 100 pages for $6&#x2F;month, making it about $20 to achieve the same yield of pages.And with the rise of digital records, most people could probably live on the $1&#x2F;month plan where you get 10 pages and can rollover up to 30 pages with every extra 10 pages costing $1 when you need it. It&#x27;d take 3 years of not printing a total of 315 pages to lose money on Instant Ink compared to the price of the new cartridge (I&#x27;m on the grandfathered $1 15 pages&#x2F;month plan). reply isykt If you have the patience &#x2F; time &#x2F; energy to track this, god bless.

Dan Garisto Twitter Facebook Email A superconducting magnet is cooled by liquid nitrogen, producing a strong magnetic field that causes the magnet to levitate.Credit: Patrick Gaillardin/LookAt Sciences/SPL A Korean team’s claim to have discovered a superconductor that works at room temperature and ambient pressure has become a viral sensation — and prompted a slew of replication efforts by scientists and amateurs alike. But initial efforts to experimentally and theoretically reproduce the buzzworthy result have come up short, and researchers remain deeply sceptical. The research team, led by Sukbae Lee and Ji-Hoon Kim at the start-up firm Quantum Energy Research Centre in Seoul said in preprints published on 25 July1,2 that a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen, dubbed LK-99, is a superconductor at ambient pressure and temperatures above 127 °C (400 Kelvin). The team claims that samples show two key signs of superconductivity: zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect, in which the material expels magnetic fields, leading samples to levitate above a magnet. Previous efforts have achieved superconductivity only in certain materials under incredibly low temperatures or extremely high pressures. No material has ever been confirmed to be a superconductor under ambient conditions. LK-99’s purported superconductivity drew immediate scrutiny from scientists. “My first impression was ‘no.’” says Inna Vishik, a condensed matter experimentalist at the University of California, Davis. “These ‘Unidentified Superconducting Objects’, as they’re sometimes called, reliably show up on the arXiv. There’s a new one every year or so.” Advances in superconductivity are often touted for their potential practical impact on technologies such as computer chips and maglev trains, but Vishik points out that such excitement might be misplaced. Historically, progress in superconductivity has had tremendous benefits for basic science, but little in the way of everyday applications. There’s no guarantee a material that is a room-temperature superconductor would be of practical use, Vishik says. The first attempts to replicate LK-99, reported in the past days, have not improved the material’s prospects. None of the studies provide direct evidence for any superconductivity in the material. (The Korean team did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.) Two separate experimental efforts by teams at the National Physical Laboratory of India in New Delhi3 and Beihang University in Beijing4, reported synthesizing LK-99, but did not observe signs of superconductivity. A third experiment by researchers at Southeast University in Nanjing5 found no Meissner effect, but measured near zero resistance in LK-99 at -163 °C (110 K) — which is far below room temperature, but high for superconductors. Theorists have also entered the fray. Several theoretical studies6,7,8,9 used a computational technique called density functional theory (DFT) to calculate LK-99’s electronic structure. The DFT calculations suggest LK-99 might have interesting electronic features that, in other materials, have been associated with behavior such as ferromagnetism and superconductivity. But none of the studies found evidence that LK-99 is a superconductor at ambient conditions. Early efforts Replicators first attempted to synthesize LK-99, following the process described by the Korean team, which involved mixing powdered components and two stages of heating up to 925 °C. (The high temperatures and use of lead have prompted concerns about amateur replication attempts, which researchers say are dangerous.) To confirm that material’s structure and identity, replicators used X-ray diffraction, an atomic imaging technique. The Beihang team concluded that their sample’s structure was “highly consistent” with that of LK-99. A co-author on the National Physical Laboratory team, physicist Veerpal Singh Awana, acknowledged small differences between their sample and that of the Korean team. “Our LK-99 is very similar to that as the reported superconducting LK-99,” he says. But Robert Palgrave, a chemist at University College London, says that both teams’ materials differ from the original. Both X-ray diffraction patterns are significantly different from the Korean team’s patterns and from each other, says Palgrave. (Members of the Beihang team did not respond to Nature’s request for comment.) The Southeastern University team’s experiment produced X-ray diffraction data that is more consistent with the Korean team’s sample, according to Palgrave. But several researchers have questioned their claim of achieving zero resistance at -163 °C. Evan Zalys-Geller, a condensed matter physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that the resistance measurement wasn’t sensitive enough to distinguish between a zero resistance superconductor or a low-resistance metal like copper. (Members of the Southeastern University team did not respond to a request for comment.) Theory troubles Uncertainty about the structure of LK-99 limits the conclusions that researchers can draw from theoretical studies, which assume a given structure for the material to make calculations. On 31 July, a theoretical analysis posted on Twitter prompted excitement among online enthusiasts. Sinéad Griffin, who studies quantum materials at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, shared her theory paper, accompanied by a gif of former US president Barack Obama performing a ‘mic drop’. The optimism was prompted by Griffin’s use of DFT to find that LK-99 has ‘flat bands’, a feature that indicates electrons in the material are strongly correlated with each other. “Flat band systems tend to show interesting physics,” Vishik says. “So when a material is predicted to have a flat band, people get kind of excited.” Griffin later rebuffed the optimism, tweeting: “My paper did *not* prove nor give evidence of superconductivity.” Other theory papers also suggested the presence of flat bands, but all of them suffer from the same assumption about the structure, says Leslie Schoop, a solid state chemist at Princeton University in New Jersey. “In a nutshell, I don’t believe any of the DFT before I know the correct crystal structure,” she says. Griffin agrees that knowing the structure is essential. But she says that the structure found by the Korean team is similar to that of other lead phosphate minerals. “So it’s not too bizarre to think it possible.” Even if future experiments confirm flat bands, the feature does not mean the material would display room-temperature superconductivity, Schoop says. The association between flat bands and superconductivity comes from other materials, such as ‘twisted’ layers of graphene — slightly offset sheets of atomically thin carbon — which displayed superconductivity at -271 °C (1.7 K) and featured flat bands. But this does not provide evidence for superconductivity above 127 °C (400 K) in the lead-based LK-99, Schoop says. Viral videos The limited success of the replication attempts has not quelled speculation online. Unverified videos of samples, supposedly levitating because of superconductivity, have circulated as viral evidence, despite the fact that many materials — including graphene, frogs and pliers — can exhibit similar magnetic behaviour. Previous room-temperature superconductivity claims, including one made in March by the controversial physicist Ranga Dias, have made headlines. But the viral attention associated with LK-99 has surpassed many of its predecessors. Frustrated by the atmosphere of hype, some scientists have taken to mimicking the levitation videos with everyday materials suspended by string and other props. “I opened Twitter up one day and noticed a bunch of sketchy videos with little floating pebbles,” says Eric Aspling, a physicist at Binghamton University in New York. In response, he uploaded a video featuring a “sample of LK-99 shaped as a fork” suspended by tape. “I thought, ‘How can anybody be convinced by this?’,” he says. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-02481-0 References Lee, S. et al.

    "commentBody": "LK-99 is an online sensation but replication efforts fall short | Hacker NewsHacker News new | comments | ask | show | jobs | submitloginLK-99 is an online sensation but replication efforts fall short (nature.com) 313 points by mfiguiere 18 hours ago| 360 comments bbatsell 1There were people complaining in earlier threads that bigger publications haven&#x27;t been reporting on LK-99 — this article is a perfect distillation of why. It is already significantly outdated, missing out on multiple interesting findings that were posted yesterday which would almost certainly have resulted in a much different piece had they been available when it was reported out and sources asked for comment. reply Verdex 1I&#x27;m absolutely ready to be disappointed by LK-99. Some sort of fraud, some sort of experimental error, something interesting that&#x27;s still not a real superconductor, a real superconductor but a quirk of the material means that it&#x27;ll never scale past being a parlor trick, whatever.However, Nature weighing in that way feels premature to me. It&#x27;s been what ... 2 weeks? If that? Somehow it just feels that something as momentous as a plausible room temperature superconductor should take a bit more time to rule out as a fake. Unless there&#x27;s some pretty blatant fraud involved where they&#x27;re literally levitating it with a string.Nature feels like the sort of publication where their job is to have the final say after all of the dust has settled. Participating in hot takes with a negative conclusion just feels like they&#x27;re hedging their bets. If it turns out to be false then they can say that they were right at the beginning. If it turns out to be true, then everyone will be so excited that they&#x27;ll forget about anything nature came out with.Meanwhile, wikipedia feels like it has pretty objective reporting on things that are actually happening more or less as they&#x27;re happening. It just doesn&#x27;t have a narrative to go along with it. reply marcosdumay > If it turns out to be true, then everyone will be so excited that they&#x27;ll forget about anything nature came out with.Will people forget about Nature making fun of the researchers that are working trying to replicate the thing?I did expect nobody to publish anything until there&#x27;s more certainty, and I did not expect any early publication to have any lasting impact anyway. But this piece is well, pretty heavy handed. I&#x27;m not sure people won&#x27;t hold a grudge. reply whycome 1The simulation is just testing the release. They haven&#x27;t decided whether or not to make it real yet. There&#x27;s a lot of bureaucracy involved. Even doing this initial test caused a lot of debate as it&#x27;s deemed too early. If it launches, it requires a lot of updates on the backend to expand. reply ghughes 1Notably:Successful room temperature ambient-pressure magnetic levitation of LK-99 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36994214Andrew McCalip demonstrates synthesis of LK99 - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36997821 reply Lewton 1Notably, neither provided any extra evidence that LK-99 is a superconductor reply rendang 1They provided evidence that reduces the likelihood of total fraud&#x2F;fabrication on the part of the original researchers, though. reply Lewton 1Agreed! But I think total fraud was already ruled out once the reports from chinese labs reproducing it came out reply yorwba And the nature.com author didn&#x27;t cite those reports. replyLewton 1I severely doubt the nature article would look much different if written today reply emtel 1There seems to be a group of people who have appointed themselves the science police. If you are excited about a tantalizing phenomenon that has yet to withstand expert scrutiny, you can expect to hear from them!I do not understand this mentality. There is no conflict between these two statements:- LK99 cannot be considered a proven superconductor until there have been multiple replications that withstand expert scrutiny.- The evidence that is freely available on twitter and elsewhere right now is worth getting excited about.Look, this isn&#x27;t like Covid, where at least there is some public interest served by a skeptical approach to treatments. At least for the next six months or so, LK99 is an almost purely scientific topic with almost no wider implications.But people love to clutch their pearls - I have read twitter commentators claiming they are concerned that amateur replicators may get lead poisoning! Lead, while dangerous, is not polonium or something - there are plenty of reasons people choose to tolerate some exposure (recreational shooting, civil aviation, fishing...), all of which I would consider less compelling that what may be the biggest scientific breakthrough in decades. I do not think people are truly concerned about lead exposure, I think they want people to \"stay in their lanes\". An attitude that I find detestable.The fact that such a (possible) enormous breakthrough is within the reach of chemistry amateurs is wonderful! Everybody who has the equipment, knowledge, and inclination to attempt a replication should do so, and if you do, I hope you will post videos online so I can cheer you on. reply ecshafer 1I am very bullish on LK99, but it is of course with the caveat that it needs replication. I am not seeing anyone not saying that. One of the big exciting things about it has been that there HAS been some replication, between simulations and science. This article is too incredulous and does get a bit of “science police” feel.In the 1800s people were often inventing and researching in their garage labs, we need more amateur science not less. reply influxmoment The science police want to keep their authority. Evidence on Twitter isn&#x27;t real evidence unless it had been endorsed by the science police reply phreeza The funny thing is it&#x27;s mostly not even real scientists doing this kind of policing. reply SubiculumCode 1The only downside is disappointment after great excitement, and the animosity it can create towards the field&#x27;s viability. reply jacquesm 1That depends on how it all crashes. If it was fraud, then yes. But there are ways in which it can crash that would result in more funding to rule out spurious or transient effects that by themselves suggest interesting areas of research.But yes, the chance of a &#x27;superconductivity winter&#x27; is definitely there. What surprises me is how this whole thing has blown up. People that would not be able to tell a copper wire from an aluminum one are talking about superconductors. That really gets me, why the sudden massive interest? reply emtel 1> People that would not be able to tell a copper wire from an aluminum one are talking about superconductorsi know this was hyperbole, but I think the fact that it is almost certainly false is important.I think the reason that people are so excited is that you can learn the basic facts about superconductivity in a few hours on wikipedia. The basics are not that complicated: Superconductors have zero resistance below a critical temperature, are diamagnetic due to induced eddy currents that cancel out magnetic fields, and the high temperature ones exhibit \"flux pinning\" where magnetic field lines can get stuck at defects in the material, leading to stable levitation.Having learned all this over the past week, I certainly don&#x27;t consider myself an expert. I&#x27;m well aware I don&#x27;t know 10% of what a first year physics grad student probably knows. But it&#x27;s enough to follow along, and ask basic questions. Its _okay_ for people to do this even if they aren&#x27;t remotely qualified to make final judgments about LK99.To me it seems no more improper than someone talking excitedly about the rocket equation or orbital mechanics even though they don&#x27;t have an aerospace degree.As for why the sudden massive interest? Why wouldn&#x27;t there be massive interest? Its a huge potential breakthrough, with multiple claimed reproductions already, and, most astonishingly, it could have been discovered (though not understood) in the 19th century! Maybe even earlier! Of course the fact that something so basic was just lying around waiting to be found is generating interest! reply jacquesm 1> The basics are not that complicatedI know what you&#x27;re getting at but your list isn&#x27;t the &#x27;basics&#x27;, those are the symptoms. It&#x27;s like saying you understand the basics about cancer because tumors grow and people die. It doesn&#x27;t even begin to scratch the surface and it certainly isn&#x27;t the basics, it is just the part that laypeople (myself included) see when looking from the outside in.The &#x27;basics&#x27; not being so simple is exactly why the search for conveniently usable superconductors is an ongoing thing after a century. Copper wire was solved on the day we needed it, and even if it would not have worked we would have had a whole bunch of fall back materials available. reply emtel I didn&#x27;t say \"the basics of superconductor theory\" I said \"the basic facts about superconductors\", and I stand by my claim that those facts are enough to form an opinion about LK99 that is \"above the noise floor\", if you will. reply jacquesm Ermm, no, that was a literal quote, as you can see from your own comment halfway up the page.And those bits aren&#x27;t nearly enough to form an opinion about LK99, it may be enough to form an opinion about what the appearance of a generic, cheap room temperature super conductor might do for the world from a lay persons perpective. But it doesn&#x27;t say anything about LK99. reply Dylan16807 > that was a literal quoteThey did in fact say \"The basics are not that complicated\".Now please look at the previous sentence, which contains the full version: \"the basic facts about superconductivity\"You quoted the short version, then gave a rebuttal that doesn&#x27;t really hold up when you consider the long version. reply jacquesm Ah yes, you&#x27;re right. Thank you for pointing that out. replySubiculumCode 1I think there is a number of reasons this blew up, but I think the biggest one is the lack of good news.We all see weirder weather than we used to and man made climate change is implicated.War in Ukraine.Tensions with China.Political turmoil in the U.S. with small minorities driving the news cycle with crazy talk.We just got through COVID, and hopefully end of the inflation scare.Housing prices suck the hope out of most on a daily basis.Suddenly, a miracle material seems to appear that could change the game at so many levels, not owned by one corporation or country. And its a magnet, and everyone loves magnets....its the one things we&#x27;ve all experienced that feels like magic...and that magic was going to save us.So yeah. That&#x27;s my diagnosis. reply djangelic This is how I feel. I chose to have children with the knowledge that there is a very real possibility that they may inherit a hell scape when I’m dead. The thought of them having the possibility of a better future combined with finally having something positive to hope for fills a void that I believe many people share. reply jacquesm Interesting, there may be something to your observation. It also explains why you get these &#x27;fireman rescues cat&#x27; news articles, even when there is plenty of other news, most of it very negative. And guess what then gets talked about. reply ThrowawayTestr > That really gets me, why the sudden massive interest?Because if this is real it&#x27;s basically science fiction come to life. reply emtel 1I think we are witnessing that animosity right now, and if I understand correctly, it seems to be the result of (allegedly) fraudulent claims that people got excited about, e.g. Ranga Dias.But I have seen absolutely no evidence that anybody is acting in bad faith here, and so I see no reason to treat this the way we ought to treat fraud. replynoahlt 1> many materials — including graphene, frogs and pliers — can exhibit similar magnetic behaviour.I&#x27;m sorry, FROGS!?I looked this up and it&#x27;s very fun: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ru.nl&#x2F;hfml&#x2F;research&#x2F;levitation-explained&#x2F;diamagn... reply adw 1Yes, resulting in Andre Geim (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Andre_Geim) having the best possible scientific resume:- the 2000 Ig Nobel Prize for frog levitation:- the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on graphene. reply h2odragon \"There were no worlds left to conquer\"After that, where do you go? Write poetry? Go start a turkey farm? reply michael_nielsen 1There&#x27;s a great video of a frog (and several other items) floating in a strong magnetic field, from 1997: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KlJsVqc0ywM&ab_channel=APArc...Lots of objects are diamagnetic, including human beings, and can potentially be made to float in a strong magnetic field. reply ummonk 1This seems like a rather bad faith article. While there are certainly people overhyping LK-99 (and prediction markets seem to have a higher chance of success than one would expect), the general sentiment about the material I find online is that it&#x27;s probably the cold fusion of our time. The hype is because of the potential groundbreaking results, and the fact that the material is unusual even if, as is most likely, it turns out not to be a room temperature superconductor.As for the videos, are the people posting these joke videos trying to imply that the videos we&#x27;re seeing of partial levitation (including one put out by an actual Chinese lab) are fake? One can point out that the videos are likely merely evidence of really good diamagnetism without pretending they&#x27;re hoaxes. reply areoform 1> LK-99’s purported superconductivity drew immediate scrutiny from scientists. “My first impression was ‘no.’” says Inna Vishik, a condensed matter experimentalist at the University of California, Davis. “These ‘Unidentified Superconducting Objects’, as they’re sometimes called, reliably show up on the arXiv. There’s a new one every year or so.” Advances in superconductivity are often touted for their potential practical impact on technologies such as computer chips and maglev trains, but Vishik points out that such excitement might be misplaced. Historically, progress in superconductivity has had tremendous benefits for basic science, but little in the way of everyday applications. There’s no guarantee a material that is a room-temperature superconductor would be of practical use, Vishik says.As someone who loves Nature, I would like to commit a dash of heresy. A manufacturable, room temperature superconductor with a low current density wouldn&#x27;t lead to maglevs, but it would revolutionize the world. It would be one of the starkest turning points in human history.Most of the heat generated by a CPU is generated shuttling electrons back and forth. A superconductor instantly changes the calculus and, depending on whom you ask, makes processors 500x more efficient. And that&#x27;s just the start.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Superconducting_computingThe before&#x2F;after is so stark that it&#x27;s really hard to game out all of the consequences, but it&#x27;s quite obvious that it instantly changes the cost of running these massive AI models as well as the cost of doing highly detailed FEM simulations.Even if some of the properties are replicated, the strangeness of this material puts us on track to that world. It&#x27;s incredible what it could be. I&#x27;m extremely excited! reply __MatrixMan__ > A superconductor instantly changes the calculus and, depending on whom you ask, makes processors 500x more efficient. And that&#x27;s just the start.I&#x27;m excited too, but \"instantly\" is not how I&#x27;d describe retooling semiconductor fabrication to include a new material. Besides, nobody has claimed that you can dope silicon with it.But since we&#x27;re dreaming, I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll make doing plasma physics cheaper (via simpler superconducting magnets) which will then make nuclear fusion power plants feasible. reply mercutio2 1Most of the heat generated in a CPU is voltage turning on and off, not current flowing continuously.Superconductors do not have zero inductance. reply kaba0 Aren’t CPUs prone to quite a lot of current flow even in their off state? If I’m not mistaken that’s the biggest energy draw in case of large servers, but I am no expert on hardware nor physics. reply shkkmo 1> it&#x27;s quite obvious that it instantly changes the cost of running these massive AI models as well as the cost of doing highly detailed FEM simulations.This seems pretty overstated. Developing the tooling to build chips takes years, there is good reason to think that even if this material does revolutionize chip efficiencies, it will be years at least before we start producing those chips and probably years more before that production scales to fully supplant the existing production infrastructure. reply agnosticmantis 1> … despite the fact that many materials — including graphene, frogs and pliers — can exhibit similar magnetic behaviour.This is a dishonest argument. Frogs and pliers don’t levitate on a typical magnet in ambient conditions, so you can’t say the behavior is ‘similar’ just because ‘everything levitates in a strong enough magnetic field’. If your measuring stick can’t distinguish these two significantly different behaviors, it’s a useless measuring stick.Also, more generally, the logic of science is statistics, not Boolean logic. We all know that[(p —> q) and q]doesn’t logically imply p, but still observing q makes p more likely when thinking probabilistically.Overall I found the article to be very dismissive of weak evidence and also shortsighted when considering the potential applications that we can’t think of right now (even if those are not the typical hoped-for applications like efficient power transmission). reply YeGoblynQueenne 1The logic of science is logic. Statistics is used to provide confidence intervals. reply spxtr Do you disagree with ET Jaynes then? reply YeGoblynQueenne You&#x27;ll have to be more specific: what are you asking me whether I disagree with? reply TehCorwiz I&#x27;m pretty sure the parent comment just dunked on you by demonstrating a deep well-read understanding of the underpinnings of both logic and statistics.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes\"Jaynes strongly promoted the interpretation of probability theory as an extension of logic. \" reply YeGoblynQueenne >> I&#x27;m pretty sure the parent comment just dunked on youOh, sorry, I didn&#x27;t realise this was a dick-waving competition. reply jncfhnb Confidence intervals are not an appropriate tool for something like this. This isn’t an effect size of dubious magnitude. It’s a simple claim that something either exists or it does not. reply moultano 1Why does the tone of this sound just like the January 2020 articles saying \"weird nerds on twitter freaked out about viruses in china when they should be worried about the flu?\" reply none_to_remain 1The same \"no evidence\" line was used about airborne COVID-19 transmission the whole time that evidence mounted it was airborne. reply distortionfield 1Yeah, this article has all the smacking of major news players with egg on their face. Like that front page of a magazine with Jeff Bezos on it mocking him for starting AWS. reply woah 1\"VCs are washing their hands\" reply hcks You don’t understand. Real science happens on Twitter. Real scientists are the startup founders who make grandiloquent threads about Arxiv pre-publications. Academia doesn’t work at all. Actuallly, academia’s scientists are just jaded. We’re so much smarter than them. You need to root for LK99 to be real so we can live in the post-scarcity techno magic utopia. If you spread FUD the rock wont levitate. Extraordinary claims only require trivial amount of suggestive evidence. Did you hear an anon cat girl already made a Gundam robot in her kitchen out of the stuff? Maybe if you squint hard enough and try 999 times it’ll work the 1000th. Epistemic standards don’t matter. What matters is to be excited and enthusiastic. That’s what science is really about. We’re all in this together folks. What an adventure. reply victorantos 13 Oh, I see you&#x27;re embracing a rather unconventional perspective on science and academia. While it&#x27;s true that social media platforms like Twitter have provided new avenues for scientific discussions and collaboration, it&#x27;s essential to consider the potential downsides of context switching and chasing after every shiny new experiment.Research and replication are crucial components of the scientific process. Context switching too frequently can indeed lead to wasted time, as researchers may not have the opportunity to delve deeply into a particular topic and build upon existing knowledge. Replication is essential for validating findings and ensuring the reliability of scientific claims.While some interesting discussions may occur on Twitter, it&#x27;s important not to dismiss academia entirely. Academic institutions provide an environment conducive to rigorous research, peer review, and collaboration, which are fundamental aspects of advancing scientific knowledge. reply DoingIsLearning Irrespective of your view on the Nature article and the current online activity, it is useful to remember that much like Epistemic standards, HN also has standards.At the bottom of this page you will find a Guidelines page with an \"In comments\" section:\" Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Converse curiously; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Edit out swipes.Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.\"You were both not entertaining and added nothing to the discussion.As much as I agree with you, people are excited for the potential of an extraordinary result, and in my view this article&#x27;s tone is completely out of place for a publication with the historic weight and impact of Nature. reply tromp 1> that a compound of copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen, dubbed LK-99, is a superconductor at ambient pressure and temperatures above 127 °C (400 Kelvin).No; it&#x27;s claimed to superconduct at temperatures up to 127 °C. They didn&#x27;t perform tests above 127 °C. reply mbauman 1> They didn&#x27;t perform tests above that temperature.Right, exactly, they&#x27;re claiming that Tc is above 127°C. The claim is that it&#x27;s a superconductor at (some) temperatures even higher than what was tested. It&#x27;s also still a superconductor at temperatures below. reply croes I was puzzled by that sentence. I wouldn&#x27;t call 127°C room temperature. reply philwelch All of the known, confirmed superconductors only work at extreme cryogenic temperatures. reply kaeresten_dit I guess it&#x27;s not entirely surprising to see this from Nature, but it&#x27;s been incredible to see how many people across the web try to tear any shred of possibility of LK99 being a real breakthrough because of a lack of replication, but from my understanding the lab it came put of, QEL, commercial research lab, so why would they publish the exact process to be able to create the material especially if they don&#x27;t even fully understand it themselvesRegardless it is a promising development with the potential to flip several industries on their heads in terms of what is possible with current understandings but also what is possible from the mind of someone who grows up with the internet like those born post 2k with the internet reply meindnoch 1Nature seems pretty salty about this whole thing circumventing prestigious journals like theirs :D reply fullspectrumdev Nature supposedly rejected the paper, according to some accounts, which makes that doubly funny. reply rrrrrrrrrrrryan This is the most fun hot take.I still think it won&#x27;t be replicated, but on the off chance we&#x27;ve got the real deal on our hands, science publication will have changed forever and this article will have aged very poorly. reply b800h 1This is it. This episode is the beginning of science moving away from journals altogether. reply knbrlo 1When publications put out things like this it reminds me of why I can&#x27;t trust them. They&#x27;re writing this article for clicks and attention and to feed that side of society that constantly pulls us down about what&#x27;s not possible while the publication makes money from taking the other side of a issue. It&#x27;s plain corruption. reply deepspace 1FTA: \"Evan Zalys-Geller, a condensed matter physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, says that the resistance measurement wasn’t sensitive enough to distinguish between a zero resistance superconductor or a low-resistance metal like copper.\"I have little knowledge of the field, but as an EE, I would have thought that making sure that you are actually able to measure the effect you are trying to prove would be step zero in an experimental setup, no? reply dekhn 1People overestimate their ability to run high quality scientific experiments. I think a perfect example was the claim of faster than light neutrinos (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faster-than-light_neutrino_ano...). it was experimental error. CERN sent a team of smart EE&#x2F;physics folks to debug it quickly. This is consistent with my estimate that 90% of all physics labs aren&#x27;t capable of building, running, and interpreting state-of-the-art scientific measurement and discovery. reply distortionfield 1From what in understood, the sharp drop in resistivity was consistent enough to mark as the change to superconduction reply psychphysic 1Mainstream science: we need to get the public excited about science.Also mainstream science: no stop talking about us!!What&#x27;s the bfd? This isn&#x27;t IV bleach for COVID... So what if tiktokers are suddenly talking about the quirks of BCS?Nature is just bitter imo because they passed on an article that the public was fascinated by because as the authors put it \"trauma\".They are reacting just like all the publishers who passed on JK Rowling because no one wants to read a fantasy book a girl wrote.This is like YouTube telling people not to watch Cobra Kai on Netflix because they passed on it. reply rex_lupi 1Nature is now just whining cuz one arxiv publication got everyone excited. That&#x27;s what it feels like after reading this poor quality article published by nature reply anonylizard Don&#x27;t forget it was Nature that published Ranga Dias&#x27; fraudulent superconductor papers. LK-99&#x27;s confirmed properties already infinitely more valuable even if it isn&#x27;t a superconductor. reply Eji1700 1It&#x27;s because people aren&#x27;t excited about the science. They&#x27;re excited about the speculation, the gossip, and the potential result. That is literally antithetical to the entire process of proper science, and the exact kind of behavior&#x2F;mentality that most scientists hate due to how it warps things like funding.Science is the process. It&#x27;s taking your time, proving your work, and most importantly, replicating your results. reply fragmede 1Is the gossip about LG&#x27;s involvement and the leaked-ness of the paper and the death bed dying breath parts really taking center stage here? I&#x27;ve come across that stuff but the focus of the excitement really seems to be on \"will it replicate\". reply fullspectrumdev > That is literally antithetical to the entire process of proper science, and the exact kind of behavior&#x2F;mentality that most scientists hate due to how it warps things like funding.Have you considered that the way we “do science” is actually a broken process made of absolute bollocks? reply devnullbrain 1>the exact kind of behavior&#x2F;mentality that most scientists hate due to how it warps things like fundingI&#x27;d be more sympathetic to this had scientists not done such a terrible job of distributing the funding my taxes pay for reply fullspectrumdev Tbf, it’s not scientists who make the funding choices.

They&#x27;re excited about the speculation, the gossip, and the potential resultI think you could argue that the initial spark of intuition-- the thing that makes you go \"huh. Let me look into this more\" before gathering evidence and peer review, is one of the most important steps of \"the science\" reply mcpackieh 1You don&#x27;t get to have public interest in science without public interest in science drama and gossip. Humans being what they are, it&#x27;s unreasonable for you to expect otherwise. There is not a single topic for which the public has an interest in the thing but no interest in the gossip and drama surrounding that thing. reply akasakahakada 1This article is like what a high school student would write for their essay: quote some dudes&#x27; speech without actually explaining anything and call it a day. Those speeches are my proofs because they say so. Room temperature superconductor is useless because someboby said that on twitter! Seriously every argument in this article is flawed. reply rahkiin 1Rome was not build in a day. Let’s not expect scientists to do so after a draft publication. reply relativ575 1It is true, yet I can&#x27;t reconcile the fact the overall excitement and optimism this generates, vs. the lukewarm and skepticism towards news about advance in other hard problems such as fusion, battery, self-driving, space exploration, cancer treatment, Alzheimer treatment.I get that disappointment in the past make people jaded. Weren&#x27;t there false hope in superconductor as well? Or are people here too young to have experienced that? reply cthalupa 1There&#x27;s a lot of people in here arguing like there&#x27;s some significant faction of people that truly believe we&#x27;ve got enough proof that we have an RTAPS and are somehow negatively impacting their life because of it.I&#x27;m excited enough about this that I&#x27;ve read about 3500 HN comments on the subject over the past few days. I&#x27;ve talked about it with friends of various levels of science literacy. I&#x27;ve seen it come up in various discords, IRC channels, etc.And... I&#x27;m not seeing any real amount of people doing that. The twitter crowd is largely people just memeposting with \"FLOAT THE ROCK!\", places like HN have a bit more technical discussion about it, lots of other places it comes up in conversation and people shrug and go \"huh that might be cool hope it works out tell me in 6 months\"But even as someone with enough free time this week to read all these comments and engage in the discussion so much, it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m sitting here expecting 15 years from now we&#x27;ll all be living in a superconductor wonderland. If I had to make a bet one way or the other, I&#x27;d probably bet it won&#x27;t be. But that doesn&#x27;t mean this whole thing isn&#x27;t fun and entertaining.We&#x27;ve got some potentially world altering thing that is potentially real, and replicating it is easy enough that we have engineers and scientists all over the world doing it in public. Most of these kind of things require lots of funding, labs with advanced tools, access to exotic materials, etc. Instead, this time, we get to watch it on Twitter, Bilibili, etc.It&#x27;s possible for people to recognize that this is a potentially world altering discovery and be hyped about the process and visibility we have in it, as well as realize that the most likely outcome at this point is \"LK99 does some weird diamagnetic stuff that looks cool but probably isn&#x27;t actually an RTAPS\" reply jonny_eh 1Makes sense, on the other hand, the recipe is apparently fairly simple, so why would it be so hard to replicate? reply stusmall 1It&#x27;s posts like this that make me think of Roosevelt&#x27;s Man in the Arena speech. It&#x27;s easy for folks on the sidelines to criticize and say \"what&#x27;s so hard?\" It&#x27;s for the best who the folks rolling up their sleeves, doing the hard work don&#x27;t see&#x2F;hear it. There are tons of teams working at this from multiple angles, both trying to prove and disprove it.It&#x27;s only been a few days! The fact that cutting edge science from a pre-release version of a paper isn&#x27;t going perfectly doesn&#x27;t mean much. Give them time. Eventually we will have more solid answer. reply yiyus 1I am a material scientist. Everyday, I see failed attempts to replicate samples. Slightly different compositions, slightly different heat treatments, subtle differences in crystallographic texture or the arrangement of inclusions that unexpectedly change the properties of your material in mysterious ways.And I know nothing about superconductors, I am talking about steel, a material that we have worked with for centuries, it&#x27;s in the first chapter of every textbook and is practically everywhere.Things are hard. reply jacquesm YES! This is exactly my experience. Even if I do stuff myself it is often very hard to get to consistency, there are almost always more variables in play than the ones that I&#x27;m initially aware of. I&#x27;ve seen seasoned pros driven to despair by things that &#x27;worked in the lab&#x27; but that they could not replicate outside of it for want of a simple oversight. Sometimes the line between success and failure is hair-thin, you can be almost there and never realize it. reply mensetmanusman 1The unit cell apparently has:1 Copper atom 25 oxygen atoms 6 Phosphorous atoms 9 lead atomsThere are many ways to arrange these constituents.It’s hard to create the environment where they want to go exactly where you hope over a large volume. Sometimes this level of precision requires atomic control of layer growth and extreme temperature management. That’s why the methods list days between steps to get the atoms diffusing, and that’s for a few micrograms of material. reply jonny_eh 1I guess whoever figures out a reliable process for scaling up production gets a second nobel prize? reply RosanaAnaDana 1or just billions upon billions of dollars. reply jonny_eh I should patent a process then figure out the details later, or sue anyone who does. reply ThrowawayTestr Thankfully the patent system isn&#x27;t that broken. replytraverseda 1Because if it is superconducting they only have tiny tiny superconducting chunks in a much larger sample that isn&#x27;t. A couple of superconducting grains of sand in a rock, basically. Separate them out, try to test them on their own while ignoring all the rock parts, well that&#x27;s difficult.I suspect that what they actually have is some incredibly tiny superconducting crystals suspended on a material that is almost identical except for the placement of a few atoms. Very hard to work with.Or it&#x27;s just a regular diamagenetic material. reply rsfern 1The steps are simple, but it seems to be quite finicky and there are almost sure to be sensitive to important factors that we don’t have clarity on yet. If it turns out to be definitively shown to be real reply ssijak 1so simple that original authors fail 9 out of 10 times it seems reply golol 1It is simple as in doesn&#x27;t require expensive materials or tools or a particularly long process. It can nevertheless be tricky to execute correctly and depend on luck reply seba_dos1 1It&#x27;s too simple - it&#x27;s simplistic. It doesn&#x27;t control for some (yet unknown) things that make it fail or succeed, which makes it hard to replicate. reply _joel 1It seems to be, so far, a stocastic process in such that they don&#x27;t now what&#x27;s causing it in the 1&#x2F;10 times it works afaict. reply someotherperson 1The recipe for Shakespeare is English, paper and a pen. reply Lewton 1The recipe IS easy...

Even if LK-99 is some kind of a superconductor, there are a whole host of daunting technical issues that will need to be solved. For example: how do we get the yield up? How to turn it into a wire? If the material is not ductile, how to form the wire into a useful shape? How to reliably couple to the wire? How does the material age over time and and humidity? How to deposit and pattern it as a thin film?We have a lot of arrows in our quiver to shoot at these problems -- I would be optimistic that the promising applications of a room temperature superconductor would attract plenty of investment and talent. On the other hand, I imagine it may take years or even decades before we have answers to these hard questions. As the quote says, \"there&#x27;s no guarantee\" that we can solve them, because right now we know so little about the properties of the material at this time. Of course, that is no reason to throw in the towel right now! reply mbauman 1I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too hard to imagine that other characteristics of the material could indeed get in the way of practical applications — perhaps brittle-ness or difficulty of manufacture or challenges in making it in the appropriate forms or ... reply WitCanStain 1Could be extremely expensive or impractical to produce at scale, could be extremely brittle, etc. reply TaylorAlexander 1Did anyone notice the description for the image at the top of the article? My understanding is that this description is nonsense, but I am an amateur and would love some clarification:“A superconducting magnet is cooled by liquid nitrogen, producing a strong magnetic field that causes the magnet to levitate.”Like superconductors don’t float because they’re a “strong magnet” they float because they reject all magnetic fields beyond the London depth and this somehow leads to levitation. Right?? reply rizzaxc 1SC requires a critical temperature, so the \"cooling\" part leading to the \"producing\" part is correct reply TaylorAlexander 1Is the producing part correct? My understanding is that once cooled they reject magnetic fields, not produce them. According to wikipedia:\"The Meissner effect (or Meißner–Ochsenfeld effect) is the expulsion of a magnetic field from a superconductor during its transition to the superconducting state when it is cooled below the critical temperature. This expulsion will repel a nearby magnet.\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Meissner_effect reply NotYourLawyer 1The original team has been working on it for 24 years (that’s what the 99 in the name refers to). Everyone who expected a clean replication in a week was deluding themselves. reply m3kw9 1Replication seem pretty successful to me, 3-4 labs has made the same effect. Nature sound salty they are not really involved in anyway now that results are displayed on social media rather than through journals reply stainablesteel 1this seems click-baitybut i&#x27;m glad about that, because it means communication on other platforms are more effective at sharing results than an outdated publishing system that drains people of their livelihood reply oivey 1This Nature article claimed that two of the Chinese labs attempting replication provided XRD measurements that didn’t at all match what the Korean lab had. I’m not a pro in this field, but XRD gives you insight into the crystalline structure of materials. That suggests that whatever they made might not even be LK-99. I suppose the difference could be other contamination?Is my understanding right? If so, slightly shocking that these replication attempts are garnering so much visibility. reply consumer451 1Speaking of which, here is a new video with Varda - some US engineers who just replicated a bit. Live stream ended 5 minutes ago, not sure how long the video will stay up:LK-99 with Varda – This Week in Startups [live video]https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37002618https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=s1o88seNB-w reply lordnacho 1I don&#x27;t know what to think. Wasn&#x27;t there an article earlier today showing the video of the speck of LK-99 standing up in the tube?Also, why does the chunk in the image levitate in a stable manner? As in, why doesn&#x27;t it slide off to one side, like it would if you just tried to balance two north ends of a magnet on each other? reply serf 1>Also, why does the chunk in the image levitate in a stable manner?I don&#x27;t know what this new thing is, but isn&#x27;t &#x27;locking&#x27;&#x2F;&#x27;pinning&#x27; a known characteristic of superconductors otherwise?that&#x27;s the whole point of the &#x27;train track&#x27; demo they do with cold superconductors for college kids. reply jonny_eh 1Meissner effect: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Meissner_effect reply lordnacho 1Yes but why does expelling the magnetic field make it hover stably instead of just falling out of the side of the field it&#x27;s in? reply robinduckett 1My laymen’s interpretation is that superconductors perfectly expel the magnetic field without distorting the field and so can sit in a position that is effectively locked and held in position. I could be completely wrong however. reply bhattid 1There&#x27;s a noticeable distortion of the magnetic field near the superconductor. It&#x27;s this distortion that keeps the superconductor stable - it&#x27;s caused currents that appear on the surface which match and cancel* the surrounding field.*some of the magnetic field penetrates onto the surface of the superconductor, but internally, there&#x27;s 0 magnetic field within the superconductor. reply bhattid 1When a superconductor interacts with a magnetic field, currents generate at the surface of the superconductor that will produce their own magnetic field, which cancels the external one. The superconductor doesn&#x27;t fall out to the sides because the field gets cancelled and there&#x27;s no net force acting on the conductor.There can still be torque (i.e. rotations) for type I superconductors, and type II superconductors when they&#x27;re fully superconducting. I&#x27;m not familiar with how the specific dynamics work though - I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s related to gravity? reply zrezzed 1Afaik, your intuition is basically right! A superconductor exhibiting only the Meissner effect won&#x27;t hover (\"pin\").It&#x27;s a defect (where small amounts of the field aren&#x27;t expelled) that allows for the pinning to happen: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Type-II_superconductor#Flux_pi... reply space_fountain 1I think that for true hovering demos the trick is to cool the super conductor to below its critical point while it’s already inside the magnetic field. Then any way you move it will immediately induce a reacting current in the superconductor that will move it back into place. Exactly the same place since it’s a super conductor and has 0 resistance. I think in these demos though it is the fact that one side is heavier and dragging that’s leading it to stay in place reply bazodedo 1https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flux_pinning reply merman 1\"The first attempts to replicate LK-99, reported in the past days, have not improved the material’s prospects. \" This to me is sort of a summary of Nature&#x27;s position.Reframing- there is no reason to change from the default position of skepticism - that the material is uninteresting.If you ignore the viral hype, and only pay attention to the replication attempts: They have been rushed. They lack rigor. Still, the summation of their findings is reason to think there is something very interesting going on with this material.I do see some manic hysteria. I understand the urge to push back on that. It&#x27;s smart to advise people to maintain skepticism. But if you do not think that the replication attempts are an indication that there is something there, I think it&#x27;s because you have some sort of error in reasoning. reply Lewton 1I do not think that the argument is that the material is -uninteresting-, there&#x27;s just plenty of reasons to believe it might not be a superconductor reply dragonwriter 1LK-99, as a social phenomenon, is looking a lot like cold fusion with the added energy of social media. reply theogravity I&#x27;m really excited by the hype around it because it&#x27;s a great demo of how science works in practice in a semi \"real-time\" fashion. Whenever I share news on it, I always preface that it&#x27;s still in the replication &#x2F; validation phases by multiple labs. I don&#x27;t I&#x27;ve read of anyone so far stating that this is 100% legit.It&#x27;s just nice to see the scientific process get carried out - here&#x27;s something we discovered, and now labs are working to reproduce the result to see if it&#x27;s an actual thing or not. From my understanding, this stuff generally takes years to validate, but we&#x27;re getting \"immediate\" glimpses here and there which makes it really exciting.I get that the paper hasn&#x27;t gone through peer review yet, but there&#x27;s something interesting about the findings that are prompting labs to immediately try to replicate it. reply golol 1People are just having fun entertaining the very real possible and \"believing\". What&#x27;s wrong with that? It is more interesting to just go ahead and say that they are 100% sure LK-99 is real whent here are no stakes. Having differentiated and uncertain opinions all the time gets boring. reply Janicc 1Didn&#x27;t the indian team have a big chunky rock of LK-99? Considering that the majority of researchers can at most create a tiny grain of it where there&#x27;s still parts of it that aren&#x27;t levitating, the conclusion to me is that their findings are largely useless. reply 1970-01-01 1The gestalt of LK-99 is ironic. It is both a sensation and (hopefully) an almost magical rock, and still \"None of the studies provide direct evidence for any superconductivity in the material.\" reply moh_maya 1Its a bit surprising to see a journal like nature effectively whine about replication efforts falling short in what’s likely a very temperamental, context &#x2F; environment influenced synthesis process of a new composition. Its not going to work immediately.Even if it is a real breakthrough, material synthesis of a new material in any lab, and doing so reproducibly, is tricky enough that I am absolutely not going to infer &#x2F; conclude from, or pass any comment on any replication efforts this early into the process.

The comments are always full of hostile and vitriolic remarks by people who are personally offended if the video suggests the cup holders on a Model 3 are less than perfection. For some reason, Tesla is surrounded by a cult of personality where it&#x27;s not just a car, it&#x27;s a lifestyle.And bizarrely, something similar is happening with this funny floating rocks. Here we are, on HN, and people in this very thread are calling Nature (Nature!) an \"online sensational clickbait magazine\" because they want to believe the hype that the rock has properties that they only learned about from Wikipedia a few days prior (and only understood 5% of it, at that)Is there reason to be excited? Hell yeah. Are all the different replication attempts super fascinating? Hell yeah. Could it be the real deal? It could!But this has become some weird spectator sport, where you&#x27;re either a believer or a skeptic, and if you&#x27;re on a different side than I am then screw you, even if you are Nature. reply Osmium 1> calling Nature (Nature!) an \"online sensational clickbait magazine\"Not far from the truth, talking as someone who is in the field. Unlike Science, which is published by AAAS, a non-profit, Nature is a for-profit publication. They have an incentive not to miss out on something huge so that they can retain their status as the place to go for big results, but this also means they have an incentive towards selecting more sensational research for publication. That doesn&#x27;t mean that research published in Nature is bad--often it is excellent--and I&#x27;m sure their editorial staff sincerely try their best, but they often make quite bizarre editorial decisions (personal opinion).That said, Nature attracts far more scrutiny than other journals because of their ability to make and break careers, so many people feel resentment towards them as a result. Not all criticism of Nature is entirely fair.No comment on this particular story :) reply dmarchand90 1The important thing to understand is that only the scientific publications in Nature matter. These articles are written by world-class scientists and are taken very seriously. In contrast, the journalism section is akin to any random newspaper. It is generally written by standard journalists and is intended for a mass audience. reply hilbert42 1Even if the hype over LK-99 comes to nothing it became evident to me several days ago that this research has likely changed scientific publishing permanently—and I&#x27;d almost bet on the fact if the research is confirmed.What made this a such a huge tech event with the world watching on was that the research was on a subject that has captured the imagination of both scientists and the lay public for many decades and that it was posted on arxiv.org website which is open and copyright-free, similarly, we witnessed peer review processes also occurring out in the open and in public for all to see—and essentially in real time! Contrast this with the traditional tech journal process, Nature, Science, IEEE Proceedings, The Lancet, etc. which takes months to publish, and is a closed process not to mention papers being the whim of editors who often reject them (and sometimes very significant ones at that).Irrespective of whatever outcome eventuates, the contrast between traditional, slow and now-very-expensive scientific publishing with that of this speedy, exciting, open and participatory model that&#x27;s copyright-free will be obvious to everyone.Moreover, this is happening at a time when the traditional for-profit scientific publishing has come under enormous criticism with Elsevier and others milking the university and scientific establishments to breaking point and the rise of Sci-Hub as a countermeasure. Whilst academics have been aware of the problem for quite some time the general public has not. This research and how it played out on arxiv.org in just two weeks won&#x27;t be forgotten easily.If I were a director of Elsevier and after witnessing what&#x27;s happened in less than two weeks I&#x27;d be damn worried. reply jacquesm 1This puts Nature&#x27;s position here as on display in TFA (they don&#x27;t have to publish everything that is sent in) in a different light. There might be an element of sour grapes here, and if the research is validated then it will have a huge impact on them. reply dekhn 1This isn&#x27;t \"Nature&#x27;s position\". This is a freelance science writer&#x27;s position, and they paid him for the article. Nature wouldn&#x27;t even weigh in with a real editorial opinion at this point. reply jacquesm 1It is their name on the masthead. If they don&#x27;t agree with it they shouldn&#x27;t publish it. Doing this &#x27;at arms length&#x27; allows them to have this under their banner while at the same time being able to say &#x27;that wasn&#x27;t us&#x27;. reply dekhn This is standard practice in journalism which is widely used.If you weren&#x27;t so involved in the field, would you even care? reply jacquesm Yes, I care. I&#x27;ve been a subscriber since the 80&#x27;s, Nature, SA and the Lancet. I don&#x27;t think any of them should pull a &#x27;Ted-X&#x27;. reply dekhn I went through and reread the whole news article.There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this article. I really don&#x27;t see what you have to complain about. It&#x27;s broadly factual, and roughly consistent with the mainstream opinion at this point: there is no smoking gun evidence of anything, and the noise being generated by social amateurs is making it hard to find the real signal from the small number of groups competent enough to make useful statements about this \"discovery\". reply jacquesm Yes, and it serves no purpose other than to get Nature in the position where they can hedge their bets based on rejecting the article earlier and publishing this now just in case it eventually does work out. It&#x27;s content free from Nature&#x27;s audience perspective, nobody reading it will think &#x27;hey wow, this is news to me&#x27;, if they&#x27;ve been at all interested. So it must serve some other purpose because Nature doesn&#x27;t just publish anything. I was wondering earlier why they would publish it and I think it isn&#x27;t too farfetched to see this as a deliberate strategy to protect their interests. It&#x27;s going to be interesting what happens on both sides of the fork: what they will do if after say 3 months there still isn&#x27;t any very clear replication and when there is. For both of those they have positioned themselves well.What irks me about it is that it&#x27;s been all of a week and yet Nature is already deprecating it because the replication efforts fall short. It would seem to me to be a little bit early for that, what did they expect? And sure, we can argue over whether it was nature or the writer that is the root cause here but someone with editorial control at Nature must have felt it was good enough to include, even though it is just premature meta commentary, not science news. reply mattkrause Nature doesn’t need to hedge because their reputation won’t really affected by publishing—-or not publishing—-something on LK-99.Paul Laterbur, who won a Nobel Prize for MRI after Nature rejected his paper on it has quipped that \"You could write the entire history of science in the last 50 years in terms of papers rejected by Science or Nature.\"The “top journals miss good stuff all the time; they publish bad stuff pretty often too. Sorting them out is just really hard. reply dekhn Nature doesn&#x27;t need to hedge its position.The article doesn&#x27;t deprecate LK-99. The article is about the hype surrounding the announcement and its replication results, mainly, but not exclusively by, amateurs in other fields (who seem to have shown that they can make samples that have unconventional properties, but not necessarily superconducting).It&#x27;s worth reading about a previous social media science debacle, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faster-than-light_neutrino_ano... where the observations of neutrinos being faster than light was eventually debugged to some simple hardware errors and naive analysis.\"After the initial report of apparent superluminal velocities of neutrinos, most physicists in the field were quietly skeptical of the results, but prepared to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Experimental experts were aware of the complexity and difficulty of the measurement, so an extra unrecognized measurement error was still a real possibility, despite the care taken by the OPERA team\" reply jacquesm No, but they also don&#x27;t need to try to catch some of the hype while pretending to be immune to that hype. Clearly they feel the need to put LK-99 in at least one article title even if there is no news. That&#x27;s not their normal standard for articles, at least not as far as I&#x27;m aware.I&#x27;m aware of quite a few other scientific debacles, some involving outright fraud, data fabrication and sometimes true believers that even convinced themselves. What is interesting about the Ranga Diaz episode is that it was Nature that published it (and it took two years to retract it):https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;s41586-020-2801-zSo their stance right now is understandable but also a bit self serving. reply arka2147483647 > So their stance right now is understandable but also a bit self serving.If there is this hot topic about LK-99, is it not their job to report it to their readers? Not everybody follows social media or has come across this personally. From this point of view, the article seems fair enough roundup of whats been happening. reply Natsu > It&#x27;s worth reading about a previous social media science debacle, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Faster-than-light_neutrino_ano... where the observations of neutrinos being faster than light was eventually debugged to some simple hardware errors and naive analysis.\"Debacle?\" Some scientists saw something funny, pointed out that it violated known laws of physics, and asked for help explaining the results. They got that help relatively quickly and it was found that, indeed, the neutrinos were not moving faster than light.If I were looking for a debacle, I&#x27;d look for something where there was outright fraud.Here we have lots of people levitating small black rocks. It&#x27;s probable that the samples created are impure, but something interesting might well be going on and so it&#x27;s getting attention. Making things levitate like that is pretty cool, though, even if yes, you can do it with pencil lead (and a different magnet setup, not just a single magnet).So people are trying to understand it. It&#x27;s messy, and the results are unclear, but... hey, that&#x27;s how things go. Sure, I&#x27;ll wait to call it confirmed until we have a number of labs with good quality samples and expert testing, but I&#x27;ll also give them time to actually try a few things since there are good reasons to think the synthesis is less easy than is reported.But I&#x27;m not going to hate on people who just wanna see the rocks float, either. And we have quite a few people now with floaty rocks, which is more than enough to keep the average person entertained while the science settles. reply dekhn Sorry, debacle wasn&#x27;t the right word. Situation? Event?In this case it wasn&#x27;t as simple as asking for help- the team that caused this situation really just wasn&#x27;t up to the task, and that should have been detected far earlier than their press release announcing faster than light neutrinos.From https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2011&#x2F;09&#x2F;24&#x2F;science&#x2F;24speed.html \"\"\"Nima Arkani-Hamed, a particle theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, said in an e-mail, “There was no need for a press release or indeed even for a scientific paper, till much more work was done. They claim that they wanted the community to scrutinize their result — well, they could have accomplished that by going around and giving talks about it.”\"\"\" reply Natsu Sure, that&#x27;s better. I dunno, feels like bikeshedding to worry about the best way of getting help. It&#x27;s sad that it turned out to be relatively boring (equipment not set up right) instead of any actual scientific discovery, but I&#x27;d personally rather see more people having fun and learning to love the process of discovery even when it doesn&#x27;t pan out. And most things don&#x27;t pan out, I get that.This may well not pan out either, but lots of people with little floaty rocks are going to capture people&#x27;s imagination in a way that a bunch of graphs just don&#x27;t. replybigbillheck > I don&#x27;t think any of them should pull a &#x27;Ted-X&#x27;.That ship&#x27;s long since sailed, see all those &#x27;Nature Whatver&#x27; journals. reply kergonath That is completely different. The mini-Natures are still peer reviewed journals with a strict selection process. These journals are usually reasonably high impact, and I don’t think there is evidence pointing towards them having more or less fraud than other journals on that tier. It’s not an amateur slapping a Nature logo on a preprint, which is basically what TEDx is. replyprogrus Nature certainly would not platform my position on this one. Why would they choose this other person?Why can I tell you what it says without even reading the headline? reply nonethewiser Why did they publish it? reply pabs3 > posted on arxiv.org website which is ... copyright-freeContent on arvix is copyrighted by the authors, who then choose one of the available licenses to allow redistribution under (mostly CC ones).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.arxiv.org&#x2F;help&#x2F;license&#x2F;index.html reply whimsicalism Interesting. Personally as a huge advocate of open science, the LK99 stuff has revealed to me flaws in rapid communication of science.The lay public becomes far too overinvolved. reply abnry What are the flaws? Why is the lay public not allowed to be involved? That sounds like elitist gatekeeping. The truth will come out regardless. Why can&#x27;t everyone share in the excitement? reply shadowofneptune Yeah. For everyone watching with excitement, keep in mind that the silicon semiconductor was for years worse in practice than germanium ones, even if it was theoretically better and cheaper. It took advancements in material sourcing, kilns, etc. etc.Give this material 20 years, and we will see how it fared. reply almostnormal Most topics are sufficiently boring (or presented in a boring way) that it won&#x27;t cause any issues.The problem arises, when journalists publish some bad interpretation or oversimplification. That&#x27;s where the review is needed. reply techdragon I think this might be a bit exceptional as far as public engagement goes. So I wouldn’t necessarily judge public engagement based on this case.“Rocks float” vs “rocks not float” is a very easy success criteria for the average person to judge by, lowering the bar for the average person to feel like they can add something to the conversation… so when we add in the potential revolutionary aspects of a room temperature superconductor we have a recipe for significant engagement… it’s even engaging the gawker reflex and people are picking up on it be LK99 is a weird trending topic and people will check to see if it’s an airplane that crashed or something …In essence it was, by sheer coincidence, bound to go viral… and only because of a number of properties that others won’t have… reply MPSimmons 1>It is generally written by standard journalistsIt may be, I don&#x27;t know. This particular journalist has an undergraduate degree in Physics from Columbia - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dangaristo.com&#x2F;about&#x2F;That&#x27;s not exactly subject-matter expertise, but it&#x27;s also not a standard journalist. reply kergonath That’s all ready much more credible than a lot of people I have seen on social media, for whom a CS degree and reading Wikipedia is enough to weigh in. reply ecshafer 1While an undergraduate degree in physics puts them above the average person, it’s probably only slightly. The majority of undergraduate physics degrees do not touch on solid state physics or material sciences to this degree. It would be at best a single elective course. And even then in physics and the sciences the area of focus gets so specific I would be hesitant to trust even a graduate degree holder unless they went into that field. reply whimsicalism Agreed. I have an undergrad in physics from a top uni, took solid state courses, and worked in a lab specifically studying superconductivity and I dont really feel qualified to comment on this, so a generic undergrad physics degree certainly means jack. reply throwawaymaths 1Expertise aside I would argue that an undergraduate degree from a prestigious institution that pivoted to journalism is worse in this era. They have been tokenized and given lots of unearned reputation from their credentials, which biases them to provide the rosiest narrative (which is what the science industrial complex wants), without the years of grinding work or cynicism from management of rocky rapids of fraud and overrepresenting work that at least a grad student had to deal with.That said, I actually believe lk-99 (let&#x27;s be clear this is a belief, if strongly held) based on my personal experiences with scientific shenanigans. reply whimsicalism It is unpopular on HN to say but I think credentials reflect work usually and so it is not unearned reputation. reply throwawaymaths I will amend my adjective. \"Only very slightly earned reputation\". Getting an undergraduate degree and getting a PhD are nothing at all like each other. Yes, coming out of undergrad you might be book smart, but most phds learn at least some amount of street smarts. reply aydyn 1That should be the absolute bare minimum expertise for a journalist to report on a technical matter. reply wolverine876 1> intended for a mass audienceNature markets it to a mass audience? A mass audience reads Nature? reply nonethewiser Ah yes. So put Nature’s name on it for credibility but insist it doesnt reflect on Nature’s reputation. reply lyapunova 1I hate to say it, but I agree. Nature has outlived its \"legit\" branding by leaning too hard into the \"product\" realm. Most scientists don&#x27;t want their fundamental work to be sold as a product unless it is a precursor to commercialization of their work. At that point, it becomes advertising rather than science.When I see Nature pubs, I tend to enjoy the aesthetics of the articles, but discount them a bit to account for the mainstream-ness. reply LordDragonfang 1Yeah, I was going to say. I&#x27;ve seen so many (usually legitimate) criticisms aimed at Nature dot com in the past year alone that I saw the domain immediately disregarded the possibility that this should affect my opinions one way or the other. reply alpineidyll3 1... I once had someone in publishing try to offer me nature acceptance in exchange for ... things. The outsized role of these journals in the scientific community when reviews could be done in the open is pretty messed up. reply dclowd9901 1> but they often make quite bizarre editorial decisions (personal opinion).Off-topic, but if this opinion you wrote wasn’t yours, then who else’s opinion were we to assume it would have been? reply wolverine876 1>> calling Nature (Nature!) an \"online sensational clickbait magazine\"> Not far from the truthIt&#x27;s very far from the truth; nothing is perfect, but Nature isn&#x27;t some SEO clickbait. This subthread shows that the reactionary takedowns of everything now even are taking down Nature, of course. They&#x27;ve already discredited much of science, and have a lot of blood on their hands (climate change and vaccines stand out). reply s1artibartfast 1LK-99 sensationalism and especially online sensationalism is an excellent example of everything that&#x27;s bad about rapid communication and the attention economy. A huge number of people suddenly feel a need to have a hot take opinion on cutting edge superconductor research, apparently including nature authors. There&#x27;s a false sense of urgency around trying to understand a possible discovery that even if true, wouldn&#x27;t impact anyone&#x27;s life for many years, and will probably never be relevant to an actual decision they have to make.Things will pan out or they won&#x27;t. What&#x27;s the rush to form an opinion and hop on a hype bandwagon. I&#x27;m probably just a curmudgeon, but the whole thing seems to be more about social signaling than anything else.Maybe I find it so distasteful because I think the hype and jumping to conclusions is antithetical to real science and understanding. reply polishdude20 1So in regular one on one in person conversation, you can show your \"presence\" by uttering a simple \"mmhmm\" or \"yeah\" or \"I understand\" when someone is telling you something above your expertise. Humans like to be heard even if it&#x27;s just an utterance. There&#x27;s nothing like this online though. Imagine if we allowed posts on hackernews where you just say \"cool\" or \"mmhmm\". It adds no value to the conversation. So rather than being quiet and being silent or adding no perceived value to the convo, we come up with misguided opinions because \"at least someone needs to hear me\" is a thought that goes through our minds.I mean heck, I could have not written this post. reply abracadaniel 1This is a more articulate description of something I’ve been thinking of for a while. Tweets, and maybe just internet comments in general, are like a stream of consciousness momentary thought response. Rarely is it a fully formed opinion, but instead it’s an instantaneous opinion that might have left as quickly as it came. Someone insults my cup holders, and I kind of like my car, the cup holders are fine, but for an instant I feel slighted. Then I see they have so many upvotes, and their wrong opinion is being spread. Now it’s my duty to inform the world of the quality of these cup holders, and defend my honor. They can’t just be wrong, they have to be completely wrong, so out comes the exaggerated response. And then, as quickly as it came on, it’s forgotten, and I don’t even notice the next time I use the cup holders that they are kinda shit. reply Retric 1That’s common, but it’s also an artifact of how few topics people are experts in.The chances of two people on HN happening to both be experts in superconductors or even condensed matter physics &#x2F; automotive design &#x2F; … is higher than normal. But there’s a rapid drop off in expertise so most people commenting don’t really understand the specifics.So, rather than people arguing about the tradeoffs of cup holder placement and material choices etc it just devolves into “Ug like tribe! Things good! Back off!” reply jacquesm 1With Tesla it seems to revolve around who has Tesla stock, who drives one, who doesn&#x27;t and who doesn&#x27;t have Tesla stock and then finally there is your personal attitude towards Elon Musk. That gives you an eight way fight with every faction behaving utterly predictable. I suggest we enumerate the factions and add them to our bios that way we can at least discount that factor. replytrog This is why I love love love reaction icons. First used these a lot in Slack but now I want them on everything. People can feel like they&#x27;ve acknowledged something (and even provided their sentiment to it if they want) without having to feel like they need to provide an opinion. reply wpietri 100% agreed. Reaction emojis are a huge innovation in online participation, and they serve a lot of the same functions as non-speech behaviors do in group conversation.I&#x27;m in one large Slack where people have contributed an extensive library of custom reaction emojis and it&#x27;s great. The place has a strong culture and a lot of great in jokes all expressed in relatively few pixels of screen real estate and relatively few seconds of comprehension. It also diverts a lot of energy from what would otherwise be low-value comments. reply s1artibartfast 1I think this is a really good analogy for exploring my emotions on the topic.There are people who make utterances because they want to show they are paying attention, and there are people who make them because they cant stand not being heard. To me, the latter is more distatsefull than the former.I think it is gross that in the attention economy, the drive for existential validation is reduced to posting \"cool\" to be seen, and clicking an upvote feels like being part of a conversation. In some sense they are, but it just a very streched and hollow manifestation of human interaction and participation.My likely arrogant and possibly hyprocirtical conceit that I think what I post into the void is more interesting and substantial than \"cool\". Still, that doesnt change my feeling on the subject. reply mepian 1I thought that&#x27;s what the upvotes are for. reply jacquesm 1Upvotes are for what you consider interesting or added value. reply fardo 1That seems to be their theoretical use, much like the downvote is theoretically supposed to be their inverse.In practice though, it seems that the users of most online communities seem to treat them as an \"agree or disagree\" button, with dissenting opinions typically being either forced out of a thread or languishing due to the upvote-downvote tug of war generally suppressing a comment&#x27;s rankings. reply moolcool 1> Things will pan out or they won&#x27;t. What&#x27;s the rush to form an opinion and hop on a hype bandwagonBecause it&#x27;s fun and exciting watching smart people from around the world collaborate&#x2F;compete around an interesting and world-changing idea. It&#x27;s cool and good that many people are invested and interested in science and technology. reply lamontcg 1The really smart people so far aren&#x27;t barely saying anything about it.The people who have spent all their lives researching superconductors have yet to weigh in on this at all. reply jacquesm 1> The really smart people so far aren&#x27;t barely saying anything about it.Publicly. But they are saying stuff and it isn&#x27;t all negative but very, very carefully hedged and qualified. reply throwawaymaths I think it&#x27;s a mistake to think that the only people with useful opinions are experts in the field. While still leaving much to be desired, Science education has gotten much better in the last 50-60 years and i find I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised how discerning the public is about bad science recently.The thing about this experiment is that it really is accessible. It&#x27;s something most people could imagine themselves doing and the observable is fairly clear we with like a few minor caveats with simple things to try that even refute those! People are resonating with that. Let them for gods sake.Plus the elegant simplicity should give the result and the amateur replications more credence and yet we have these weird kneejerk reactions against them by scientists who act seemingly threatened, I wonder if that is just insecurity about their own corpus. Any scientist who won&#x27;t admit to having some stinker data that they pushed through is probably lying or has like, one publication. And many have a career that is all stinkers. reply s1artibartfast Maybe I didn&#x27;t articulate things very well. I&#x27;m for fun and excitement, and think following and learning about science does both of those.What I think is weird is the need to feel that you as an individual are part of the action or moment, and insert yourself into it. It&#x27;s kind of like the person who watches the football game on TV and thinks that their personal ritual and enthusiasm will change the outcome.It&#x27;s weird that people feel an urgent need need to converge on an opinion about superconductivity experiments as if there opinion will shape the future outcome and make it so reply ordu Recently Nature and Ars published articles about LK-99, and in both cases it seems to me that a) they couldn&#x27;t allow themselves to keep silence about a hot topic; b) they successfully didn&#x27;t answer a question is it a real room temperature superconductor or what. They did exactly what I expected them to do, they described the current state of affairs with all its uncertainty.And based on this I do not think that they felt the urgency to choose an opinion. At least they didn&#x27;t choose between \"yes\" and \"no\".As for twitter and reddit I personally didn&#x27;t bother to look what happens there. I see here on HN people who reduces the issue to a question is it a real thing, ignoring issues like the rules of science dictating what must be done before science can reach a conclusion. I believe it is much worse on reddit, where people generally have less insight into how science works as a social institution.> Maybe I find it so distasteful because I think the hype and jumping to conclusions is antithetical to real science and understanding.People have a lot of fun generating and watching videos of different levitating objects. They have a lot of fun arguing about these videos. It has nothing to do with science, though they can believe otherwise. I&#x27;m ok with that. It is better then when they choose an other topic to agrue. Something from social or political issues is much worser. reply mpsprd 1Something exciting is happening, of course people want be informed as it evolves.A similar example are election nights. People already voted, the result is in the box, we could simply wait and announce the result.But seeing the numbers rise like an ongoing fight is going on makes for a more entertaining evening! reply s1artibartfast 1I think politics would be a lot better if people treated it less as a source of emotional engagement or as a spectator sport.Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m for fun, excitement, and curiosity.What turns me off is that once the shallow well of real information depleted, how quickly people switch to speculation, Hype, and attention seeking reply jacquesm 1You essentially want people to stop being people. We are for want of a better term meme machines and we pass on information that we find interesting, gives us hope or makes us feel better and we avoid the opposite because it eventually makes us feel worse. reply j_maffe 1Yes but we can try to be selective about what we treat as a meme. People have that ability, although it is diminishing with the speed of communication these day. reply jacquesm 1That is a very interesting observation. I&#x27;ve always likened it to the diminishing cost of communication but your insight may well be the better one. reply s1artibartfast 1j_maffe took the words out of my mouth.I would also say that in addition to diminishing cost and discretion, there are changing incentives&#x2F;rewards structures with online communication. reply jacquesm 1Maybe. I think the point is valid but in the traditional media there is plenty of ways in which the incentives and rewards lead to pathological behavior, especially with TV but also with some forms of print. reply s1artibartfast I totally agree that there are always incentives at play! I&#x27;m not even trying to make the claim that they&#x27;re worse, although I do believe that.One of the new incentives more at play with modern media is using a sense of social visibility, community, and belonging as a reward. Well sometimes true, I think that for the most part it is false or at least very shallow.Someone shouting at or praising a book, newspaper, or TV rarely felt like they were part of something bigger and making a difference.New Media enables these feelings in a way that I think is exaggerated, and leads to a different type of pathological Behavior.To take an example, I think that some people, on some level, feel that posting some mundane comment about superconductivity makes them feel more part of the science, history, and Society. It is a subtle satisfaction of a need to validate ones on existence. I know this all sounds very Freudian, and it probably is. But my central objection is that this gratification is just a new form of junk food for the mind, leaving people malnourished and ultimately dissatisfied.It&#x27;s basically a psychological trap, like someone satisfying their need to learn with a tweet instead of reading a book. Not everything needs to be a book, but some people trick themselves into thinking they&#x27;re a scholar after reading a tweet. reply jacquesm That&#x27;s true. It is something I&#x27;m observing with kids around me: they don&#x27;t learn from books, they hate to read, but they consume video like there is no tomorrow, wherever and whenever they can. Inane stuff, but also really bad stuff as well as good stuff. Getting them to be selective is hard, but it is far less hard than to try to get them to read.I really struggle with this, I would love to get my kids to read more (they are the ones I can influence the easiest) but it&#x27;s very much an uphill battle. Their peer group is just like them, and &#x27;reading is for old people&#x27; is pretty much how that whole generation sees it. They may well be right and I&#x27;m probably tilting at windmills but I&#x27;ll keep trying. I wouldn&#x27;t know how to get through life or run a business without my literacy and ability to write, it&#x27;s what allows me to absorb knowledge far faster than I could do from any other means of communication. Video, in comparison, sucks. It is so low in information density that unless the subject is something where video actually enhances the information it is a distraction and bloat. reply s1artibartfast Yeah I think that&#x27;s another way of viewing what I&#x27;m saying. Different levels of information density I&#x27;m fine with, but what concerns me is that the median itself is rarely conducive to nuance and detail. Even some of the top tier educational videos gloss over things that make the conclusions conditional or even completely incorrect. It has the appearance of authoritative knowledge, but if you take it at face value you&#x27;d have a completely inaccurate understanding of the subject matter. I&#x27;m a scientist myself and watched what I thought was a fascinating and detailed 30 minute video about power transmission last night. I had a question so I clicked through to written description of the phenomenon which explained it in one paragraph and completely invalidated the video.I worry about my kids in the world if people lose the expectation of detail replyjustanotherjoe I think there is justifiable view here that people these days are getting more and more addicted to making prediction. We predict everything but we forget most of it will be just a coin toss cause for every 1 factor we consider, 100 more are unconsidered. reply wolverine876 1It&#x27;s sad that the current assumption is that we have no power to change ourselves or our world. We&#x27;re not machines, we are human beings, agents; we control what we do. reply jacquesm 1Collectively we have a lot of power, individually much less. reply wolverine876 I agree, but that&#x27;s always been true and yet we are communicating on HN and not wandering the savannah trying not to starve. reply whimsicalism I think more and more people are using politics as some sort of substitute for sports and&#x2F;or religion, especially post-pandemic when a lot more people were exposed to political ideas when spending time online. reply nonethewiser There definitely is an attention economy… I would go further and say people are addicted to consuming news.But this> A huge number of people suddenly feel a need to have a hot take opinion on cutting edge superconductor research, apparently including nature authors.I don’t understand. People are going to share their thoughts. Most wont be experts. So what? Is someone supposed to stop this? Are no one but experts supposed to care? Or try and make sense of it? reply justanotherjoe You&#x27;re right. Of course, getting excited on the media is fine. But people are acting as if their words can help protect something from someone, which is disconnected from reality. Things unfold either way, regardless of whether people care about it or not. The real future is not sympathetic to predictions. reply atoav This. My small brother tried to explain to me, an electrical engineer, why this will change the world.I then had to give him a rundown of things that would need to happen before there ever could be a widespread adoption of the material in common household wiring. First it needs to replicate, then a lot of research has to happen on the properties, then manufacturing processes have to be explored and created, suitable insulator materials have to be found, the price point of the sold wire has to be low enough, ...Hope for a better future is a good thing, but WHY does it always have to come in the form of technological silver bullets these days? Because then we don&#x27;t have to change our way of living?Don&#x27;t get me wrong, a room temperature, ambient pressure superconductor would be revolutionary and (provided it can be manufactured and used without a ton of hassle) it would transform the world. But it would still probably take two decades and there are so many other fronts on which we as a humanity have failed. reply inglor_cz \"But it would still probably take two decades\"Two decades is a lot of time. Transistors or airplanes got to a useful form much faster, in a less wealthy world with many fewer engineers. reply j_maffe 1I don&#x27;t know why but this comment sort of unveiled to me how much useless hype I had for this topic. Of course you&#x27;re right, it&#x27;s just so easy to indeed get this sense of urgency, even though it&#x27;s not really a good use of time (even for entertainment). reply majani 1This is just people understandably getting excited about a huge discovery.

Arguing that replication efforts fall short, after less than a week of attempts, feels pretty weird. Why even weigh in on things right now if you&#x27;re Nature? How many of their best papers have been replicated so quickly (it is approaching zero) or conclusively. It shouldn&#x27;t be a surprise that the fastest pre-release papers that are attempting to replicate it, are mostly from labs looking for publicity or from people who are just excited. Research teams that need more time for a rigorous replication effort are still working and likely will be for awhile. This is a silly thing for Nature to talk about and it makes them look like they&#x27;re going the clickbait route to take advantage of the hype around floating rocks. reply zamalek 1The issue is that this article shouting \"failure\" is just as prematurely as the loyalists crying \"success.\" Anger drives clicks and Nature knows that it&#x27;s angering the loyalists, especially with outright falsehoods in the article:> graphene, frogs and pliers — can exhibit similar magnetic behaviour.>> Frustrated by the atmosphere of hype, some scientists have taken to mimicking the levitation videos with everyday materials suspended by string and other propsWhy aren&#x27;t the scientists levitating frogs above rare earth magnets to make fun of the videos? Because you need superconductor magnet, not a rare earth magnet, to do that. This is a blatant internal inconsistency, and shows that this article is garbage.Don&#x27;t trust the loyalists, don&#x27;t trust the sensationalists, trust science. reply klohto 1I wanna smoke what the gatekeepers are smoking. “No, you don’t understand science! It can come only from fancy journals. You cannot test the properties yourself!”. Meanwhile Varda goes brrr. reply a_wild_dandan 1It’s also ironic that a publication so concerned with patience in science is so quick to dismiss experiments “falling short.” Like…it’s been a week. Chill. This is the most public scientific enthusiasm that I’ve seen in years. Let people have fun. Experience wonder and magic and mystery and awe and failure. That’s what science is about. reply drtgh 1The original team submitted a paper about LK99 to Nature in 2020, and it was rejected. The editorial may not be interested that other labs research the material, decreasing the number of verification trials. reply jbreckmckye 1There&#x27;s been a few \"over-eager\" findings these last few years. Skepticism is warranted; if LK-99 is a superconductor it will still be one after six months&#x27; peer review. reply cthalupa 1Sure. No one reasonable is seeing this and deciding they need to go investing their life savings in whatever adjacent stocks they think will take off. Skepticism is fine.The Nature article is still weird in tone, though, since there&#x27;s been plenty of interesting results that have been replicated. LK99 is a weird material, at the very least. That it&#x27;s weird in a way that somewhat implies it could be an RTAPS makes it plenty interesting.I&#x27;ve seen a lot of discussion around LK99 in a bunch of different contexts, and the portion of people that are treating it like anything more than entertaining curiosity at this point is extremely low - so this article really reads as the authors being upset that other people are having fun in their domain. That&#x27;s what comes across as gatekeeping.Or the concerns around \"amateur\" reproduction - who is trying to reproduce this without any understanding of how to operate the equipment or some understandings around basic chemistry and physics? These private reproductions are being done by engineers, chemists, physicists, etc. - I haven&#x27;t seen anything to indicate that people with no business doing these experiments are rushing out there to try it.It&#x27;s just a very strange to be written in the tone it is and make these points. It seems very divorced from the reality of the situation, which is basically a whole lot of people on twitter memeing \"MAKE ROCK FLOAT\"&#x2F;\"WE BACK\"&#x2F;\"ITS SO OVER\", people on more technical&#x2F;science oriented forums having the sorts of discussions we see on HN, and most the population sitting around waiting to see if anything useful comes of this. reply whimsicalism Having worked in a solid state lab that focused on synthesis and imaging characterization of various substrates including superconductors, being an engineer does not make you not an amateur. reply cthalupa Please read my comment again. I am not saying engineers (of the sort attempting replication) are more than amateurs when it comes to superconductors, I am saying they are not amateurs around relatively mundane equipment.> who is trying to reproduce this without any understanding of how to operate the equipment or some understandings around basic chemistry and physics?The engineers replicating it are at places that already had this equipment. They weren&#x27;t using it to try and make floating rocks, but they didn&#x27;t have the furnaces, etc., sitting around for the hell of it, and they&#x27;re going to be aware of basic precautions like \"Don&#x27;t eat your lead and don&#x27;t breathe it in in vaporized form when pulling it out of a 1000C furnace.\"I do not understand the idea that people already using this equipment day to day for other purposes are somehow at significant risk while attempting to synthesize LK-99 reply moolcool 1> if LK-99 is a superconductor it will still be one after six months&#x27; peer reviewYou might as well never get excited about anything if that&#x27;s your perspective. Watching the process happen in real time is fun and exciting. reply Eji1700 1I do not mean this in a hostile way, but I fucking hate this take.There are plenty of people who get EXTREMELY excited when shit turns out to be true. There&#x27;s this sterotype of boring serious people who never have fun and don&#x27;t enjoy what everyone else is enjoying and it&#x27;s just wrong.There are people in the industry who are going to go fucking nuts if this is true, but they&#x27;re not dancing in the streets because this is the equivalent of \"is katy perry pregnant? Our pictures maybe sorta show a bump!\".To be clear, if that kind of gossip is your life, that&#x27;s fine, but even then you&#x27;re probably about to read a shitload of ill informed speculation based on suspicious evidence, with undeniable proof 3-6 months away. You&#x27;ve seen this thing literally hundreds of times before, and see nothing to be excited about because it&#x27;s just noise. If there&#x27;s a baby in 6 months, great, if not, \"yeah maybe\" is about the extent of the information.Science is done slow because you need to prove things. Even with this material being \"easy\" to replicate by the standards of the field, it still doesn&#x27;t happen overnight (and to my amateur understanding in part because of a lack of detail).So while I can&#x27;t speak for the person you&#x27;re replying to, I can damn sure say I find nothing about this exciting (more embarrassing that so many people have turned this into a cult following, much like the cold fusion claims on steroids), and will be one of the first people to be extremely excited when we have confirmation.This is not \"watching the process\" happen. It is \"speculating on the process at every single step no matter how suspicious because the process isn&#x27;t fast enough for you\" reply cthalupa 1There&#x27;s plenty of real scientists doing real science with this. It&#x27;s pretty dismissive to talk about university labs full of PhDs posting preprints and videos and all of that and liken them to TMZ style reporting.People bring up the cold fusion stuff repeatedly, and that&#x27;s also bizarre - Muon stuff aside, cold fusion wasn&#x27;t thought to be possible under our understanding of physics when that craze happened. That&#x27;s a lot of what was so weird about it. On the other hand, there&#x27;s absolutely nothing in our understanding of physics that makes a RTAPS impossible.I would agree with the idea that not being excited about this at this point in time doesn&#x27;t make you a curmudgeon. But saying \"I do not mean this in a hostile way\" doesn&#x27;t mean much when you proceed to be hostile and disparaging towards people. The tone of your comment doesn&#x27;t change at all if you replace \"I do not mean this in a hostile way, but\" with \"You morons\" reply moolcool 1It&#x27;s this kind of excitement of possibility that drives people to work on ideas like this in the first place. Thousands of people tuned into Andrew McCalip&#x27;s twitch stream of an oven, just because of the possibility that something world-changing might come out. I&#x27;m sure lots of those viewers, many of them young people who are in the prime years of forming interests and career choices, have never even heard of superconductors before last week, and now are soaking up all the information they can on the topic. That&#x27;s awesome.Was the hype leading up to the moon landing also a waste of time, just because it was just \"gossip\" until boots hit the surface?

    "originBody": "Ben Balter Posts About Contact Technology leadership, collaboration, and open source Remote work requires communicating more, less frequently TL;DR: Remote work requires communicating more, less frequently, because asynchronous communication involves less frequent, but richer communication, meaning there is less time talking about the work and more time doing it, allowing the system to optimize for throughput and flow. Remote work is not simply a matter of replicating the office environment online. One of the key shifts that remote workers need to make is to communicate more, less frequently. Instead of relying on constant, synchronous, and often interrupt-driven interactions, remote workers embrace asynchronous, and often higher-fidelity, forms of communication, such as long-form writing or thoughtful videos. I’ve written before about the benefits of working asynchronously, but less obvious, it also changes the way we think and work. Async work allows for more reflection, research, and synthesis. Those working async can and should take the time to think, learn, and synthesize before sharing their ideas, opinions, or solutions, distilling them down to the most critical. This improves the quality and clarity of the communication, and most importantly, the overall throughput of the communications channel. Think of it like gzip compression, but for human-to-human communication. Yes, there’s slightly more processing overhead at the start, but it allows greater communications throughput using fewer “packets” (communicate more using less).1 How can you communicate more, less frequently? Here’s a few tips I often keep in mind: Choose the right medium for the message - Remote workers should use the most appropriate and effective form of communication for the purpose, audience, and context. For example, use writing for documenting, explaining, or persuading; use video for demonstrating, teaching, or storytelling; use chat for coordinating, clarifying, or socializing. Write clearly, concisely, and comprehensively - Remote workers should write with the reader in mind, using simple language, short sentences, and clear structure. They should also provide enough detail, context, and evidence to support their points, answer potential questions, and avoid ambiguity. Record videos with empathy, enthusiasm, and engagement - Remote workers should record videos with a human touch, using eye contact, facial expressions, and voice modulation. They should also keep their videos short, focused, and interactive, using visuals, examples, and questions. Communicate proactively, regularly, and asynchronously - Remote workers should communicate their goals, plans, and updates without waiting for prompts, requests, or deadlines. They should also communicate their availability, boundaries, and preferences without assuming or imposing. They should communicate asynchronously as much as possible, using synchronous communication only for urgent, complex, or sensitive matters. Remote work requires communicating more, less frequently, because asynchronous communication involves less frequent, but richer communication, meaning there is less time talking about the work and more time doing it, allowing the system to optimize for throughput and flow. Not to mention, thoughtful, written communication, helps ideas to scale more effectively (there’s a reason the printing press spurred the Renascence). It shifts communication from a one-to-one relationship, to a one-to-many. Next time you’re about to “send a quick DM” or “schedule a quick chat”, consider what steps you could take to optimize for the long tail of information retrieval and discovery. Just like building a web app, “writes” are expensive, but “reads” should be “cheap”, so avoid introducing mental N +1s into the system whenever possible. ↩ Originally published August 4, 2023 | View revision history If you enjoyed this post, you might also enjoy: Twelve tips for growing communities around your open source project 15 rules for communicating at GitHub Why open source Why everything should have a URL Five best practices in open source: external engagement Four characteristics of modern collaboration tools Eight tips for working remotely 19 reasons why technologists don't want to work at your government agency Leaders show their work The seven things a corporate Chief of Staff does Ten ways to make a product great Ben Balter is the Director of Engineering Operations and Culture at GitHub, the world’s largest software development platform.

Communication is way, way more important, and being an effective communicator doubly so. There&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s desk to go stop by, so noting things down and making sure we understand each-other is vital to accomplishing anything. reply rcarmo 1There&#x27;s a bit of a challenge today with chat, though. I work 4 timezones away from most of my team and we all prefer to swap e-mails, but chat seems to have stripped away some folks&#x27; ability to methodically go through topics, explain options and summarise next steps, leading to the usual \"let&#x27;s set up a call [to actually discuss everything in the e-mail thread]\".Reading through old mailing-lists (and even older e-mails from the same company, but from seven years ago) shows a markedly different communication style - you could pretty much take the last two e-mails in a thread and paste them into a memo that would neatly encompass all of the scope.Not so today--there&#x27;s a constant chattering of people who just can&#x27;t prioritise or discuss more than a couple of topics in tow. reply DharmaPolice 1Email is the victim of its own success. Because it had&#x2F;has such dominance in the business world everyone had to live in their inbox, marketers appreciated that and lots of people grew to hate that. There have always been bad practices surrounding emails but I think it reached a point a long time ago where email itself was considered bad. Thus \"email free Fridays\" and internal comms plans which say email should be a last resort. People felt empowered to refuse to read many emails, especially if they were over 3-4 paragraphs.I too have colleagues who reflexively ask for a meeting in response to any email longer than a few lines, even though the issue is clearly communicated and obviously requires someone to read it and build a proper response. The ease with which we can all \"jump on a call\" has contributed to this. Yes, of course we&#x27;ve all seen email chains which go back and forth without progress but that&#x27;s not a reason to assume every message will end up there. reply fuzztester 1>The ease with which we can all \"jump on a call\" has contributed to this.I hate that term and concept \"jump on a call\". I often find that people don&#x27;t prepare enough before the call, which defeats the purpose of the call. reply abalashov 1> I too have colleagues who reflexively ask for a meeting in response to any email longer than a few lines, even though the issue is clearly communicated and obviously requires someone to read it and build a proper response.Oh, yes. So much this. Except, I think it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s managers and bosses who have this tendency, not so much colleagues. reply lol768 1> I too have colleagues who reflexively ask for a meeting in response to any email longer than a few lines, even though the issue is clearly communicated and obviously requires someone to read it and build a proper response.I have spent many of these calls effectively just reading what I wrote in the email in the first place. Complete waste of my time. reply rcarmo 1We could jump on calls well over seven years ago (I actually worked in ISDN video calling in the 1990s, and spent a decade or so working in a multinational telco, with plenty of conference calling involved).The loss of focus definitely accelerated with the rise of chat. reply makeitdouble I had the opposite experience because of a single point I think: a Confluence&#x2F;Notion centric team.Chat&#x2F;email is solely for semi-live discussions (\"is this a bug ? how do you do X ? where&#x27;s the doc ?\") and decision making (\"can we release this feature this friday ?\")Anything else that requires bullet points, graphs and&#x2F;or more than 5 min of thinking goes into a Notion page where the team comments and argues the topic. Sometimes the Notion page will even start with Slack snippets for context, as the topic just happened to require a more constructed discussion. The magic of it is that people switch mode and write complete, coherent arguments if they&#x27;re on a page, vs small the chatty style they have on Slack. reply jacobgorm I too long for the days of mailing lists and neatly structured email threads where you could reply to each point in order using >> markers for context and so on.In my view, it was GMail with its top-posting proportional-font-only interface that killed email and mailing lists. reply quectophoton 1> leading to the usual \"let&#x27;s set up a call [to actually discuss everything in the e-mail thread]\"You forgot the part where the call is scheduled for next week even though today is Wednesday. And any attempt to discuss further in text is met with \"let&#x27;s leave that for the call\". reply cookie_monsta 1If you want to do this really well, title the meeting something generic like \"catch up\", don&#x27;t attach an agenda or any kind of description and invite a bunch of people who weren&#x27;t in the original discussion. reply fuzztester 1Solid point. reply andrei_says_ Both email and chat are ephemeral and make things really difficult to find. Who said what when about what in what thread?People use the same thread to speak about unrelated to the thread topics which makes those communications impossible to find.I’ve introduced and use basecamp with my team. It’s genius is in collecting things into projects, and in intentionally resisting complexity. Frictionless flowing focused communication - with everything in its right place, providing just enough information in activity feeds etc.It’s for high trust teams who are trying to find all needed info to get their work done, and delivers.Truly signal over noise.I am a total fanboy after trying a bunch of systems trying to be too clever, track time, create Gantt charts etc. reply isykt 1Additionally, they refuse to answer the question that’s put to them. I am very careful with my words. I say exactly what I mean in as few words as necessary, but I find myself copying and pasting the same sentences into the chat box because the person or people reading seem to want to answer a completely different question. reply silverlake 1Yes, this is the worst. I assume some people glance at the question and answer their misunderstanding. reply fuzztester 1Smaller attention spans, information overload, and consequent lack of attention to detail, are some of the reasons, IMO.And the first two of those are largely due to the uncontrolled effects of the Internet, i.e. the web and social media, on people, of course.Edit: wording reply prpl 1I don’t think there is a good solution here. I realized that I must have a 90th-95th percentile memory when compared to my coworkers, but it frankly doesn’t matter if I write things in chat or a long form document, it’s often lost to much of my team.I have come to realize the best path forward is likely pair programming&#x2F;working meetings (remotely) because writing things down and repeatedly referencing them doesn’t stick reply wonderwonder I have a decent memory but my attention span has been decimated. I find myself tuning out on calls and looking at anything else. Then I come back to reality and realize I have missed something important. Recently I have started closing my eyes while on zoom (camera off). It has really helped me focus and pay attention. this breaks down of course when someone is sharing their screen. I find that a solution to this is to turn my camera on as it forces me to pay attention or people will see me with my head turned to the side. Incidentally it also forces me to shower and shave most days, something that has really fallen off since going remote and covid. I almost never leave the house so my presentation suffered. Only time I cleaned up is if I was going to the gym. So I was somehow in the best shape of my life while also looking like a homeless person when forced on camera.Both have helped, still not perfect but its better. reply cosmodisk 1I had this issue when I had a larger team to manage. I&#x27;m also one of those who remembers an email that was sent 3 years ago by some random guy listing all these useful things. However,it doesn&#x27;t work for most people. The communication needs some guidance too 1) anything quick and simple- chat 2) something more complex - email 3) something complex and likely to stay relevant long in the future - knowledge base, documentation, etc 4) major announcement- medium matters less but they need to be stored somewhere for people to refer to later.Communication requires enforcement too: I had people in my team that kept saying that they weren&#x27;t told about x,y,and z. If those are repeated behaviours( they usually are), they need to be managed accordingly so people would start take it seriously. reply yonaguska 1It&#x27;s not a memory issue- it&#x27;s an attention issue. I&#x27;m on the other spectrum from you- I have clinically diagnosed terrible memory. I write and read a lot to compensate. If you are writing something down- things are getting lost to your team because they are not taking the time to read and process what you wrote.I&#x27;m also finding that the best path forward is to pair frequently- because a lot of people just don&#x27;t read. Also, it&#x27;s important to note that with writing things down for people, referencing is just as important as the content. If something is written in a slack conversation- they are unlikely to go searching back months for it- when they could just ask you again! When something is documented in a structured and easily memorable manner however... reply Hermitian909 1Even well done, this kind of communication doesn&#x27;t substitute for more free-form 1:1s that in-person allows. The latter are key to building trust.I&#x27;m finding this to be one of the key drawbacks of remote work - some decisions require cross team trust and I&#x27;ve yet to see anything besides more frequent ad-hoc conversations that builds it. The problem is that the most trust building conversations tend to be \"off-topic\" conversations that just don&#x27;t happen organically in a remote environment. I as an individual can try and make these happen but I can&#x27;t force the org to do so.If anyone feels like they have a solution I&#x27;d love to hear it (we&#x27;re already doing quarterly off-sites, it&#x27;s not enough) reply spandrew 1Not discounting this, but i Free-form 1:1&#x27;s always have an aura of being more \"improvisational\" and in the moment. Good 1:1&#x27;s are supposed to be semi-structured (ie not &#x27;free form&#x27;). A shared journal, a retro exercise, etc. I have not had the experience that these build trust. Good team work, and delivering high quality work towards a common goal do that. You popping by for a 3 minute conversation in ear shot of 5 other people trying to do their work doesn&#x27;t.It may FEEL like it because those people chatting get energy from it. But it doesn&#x27;t. If you need energy from people like this it&#x27;s 100% a good idea. Go nuts. Personally I think people over index on this because they have no idea how to structure async team comms.– Videos – Longform content – Team agreements to respond to things async without x-hours – Team collaboration spaces – Good sprint ceremonies like refinement – Team QA-type exercisesAd hoc conversations also contribute immensely to what I call \"comms debt\". The jolt of energy you get from water cooler talk last 3 minutes, and excluded anyone not in direct proximity. If the best idea was in the head of somebody 3 rooms away you have no way of knowing it. Add dozens of these micro-interactions throughout the day and it&#x27;s a recipe for comms breakdown and kliqish behaviour.I see this a lot in User Research. Let&#x27;s \"get out of the building\" and talk to people. A good idea in practice, but without actual goals or hypothesis product leaders mistake the first 5 opinions they collected as fact — often cherry picking sound bytes that fit right in with their own biases (and I&#x27;ve seen this A LOT in older leaders). This is mistaken as research. But they love it because it has that face to face energy. The feeling makes it right, regardless of the evidence.Trust in a team is based on good communication — and an agreement on what you expect from it. If someone posts a video to Slack do people respond? Do you have ceremonies to build togetherness and understanding? All of these things are somewhat easier when you just have to deal with Zoom logistics.Anyone who has to clean up and index the deluge of Design Sprint whiteboard stickies knows what I&#x27;m talking about. Put that shit in Miro, thanks. reply Hermitian909 I think I&#x27;ve been unclear on the problem. Trust inside a single team is not something I&#x27;ve found to be a major problem, but between teams. Let&#x27;s be more concrete:I need to build trust between between 6 EMs spread over three different directors and 2 vps + some very senior engineers. I need to do this so that we can solve one of the larger problems the business is facing. Most of these people have no good reason to talk to each other (or me) regularly. Without trust, one or more of these people will likely torpedo the proposal in order to avoid tying themselves to other teams and people they don&#x27;t know.Pre-covid the solution to this problem was (mostly) chatting over lunch. You&#x27;d get the right people talking, seed the idea, and build up to a proposal that everyone could agree to drive forward. IME this whole style of consensus building is dead in a remote world because async communication is too low bandwidth for trust building.This makes it really hard to take good organizational bets, you have to wait till you have a mountain of data and customer feedback before you can sell big projects. The quality of the company&#x27;s output really noticeably declines from this. reply bluefirebrand > Pre-covid the solution to this problem was (mostly) chatting over lunch.Except that Pre-Covid, those [6 EMs spread over three different directors and 2 vps + some very senior engineers] were already probably not at the same office.They were spread across three states, two countries, and one was a consultant from India.This was my experience with any company bigger than about 40 people, anyways. reply ethanwillis 1Maybe part of the problem is a lot of orgs are watching(and logging) your remote conversations with an all seeing eye. But they&#x27;re not necessarily bugging your in person office? reply okaram 1Not sure if this would work for you, but I tend to have ad-hoc, 1on1 video calls with people.If you are not doing deep work, it&#x27;s no biggie.I also would schedule 1on1 meetings to &#x27;catch-up&#x27; (not too many of them, but ...)Don&#x27;t get me wrong, meeting some of these people in person is great, but I have several great relationships at work where we&#x27;ve never met in person reply mpeg I think the most frustrating part of remote work are people who expect synchronous communication. Conversations that go like “good morning, how are you?” and then wait until you reply to say “so I was wondering about x”It’s annoying, wastes a lot of time and people keep doing it because they’re still stuck in office mode when they should be following IRC rules (don’t ask to ask) reply uxcolumbo Yes exactly. I worked with folks located in India and I had to tell them it’s OK to get straight to the point without having to wait for me to say hello back etc. I had to explain it’s not rude if they leave out the hellos and how are yous. Probably a cultural thing. reply mcguire 1Few people mention the difficulties of the other paradigm, though. I&#x27;ve had lot of hallway conversations where, if I don&#x27;t write down some notes, it&#x27;s gone. Plus, if you don&#x27;t have any control over it, having someone stop by your desk is a significant interruption.Ever been in a situation where you asked someone for something you need done, they said yes verbally, it didn&#x27;t get done, and now everyone is looking at you for the reason why it isn&#x27;t done? reply brailsafe 1Ya I&#x27;d probably consider switching careers before returning to the tyranny of my manager just being able to pop up behind me. Fuck that. reply unshavedyak 1How do you communicate the \"right things\" tho? That&#x27;s the part i find difficult. I feel like most consumers just want cliff-notes. Which are difficult to write for a wide variety of audiences. reply mydriasis 1This is tough, yes. I&#x27;m a programmer -- so for me, knowing what&#x27;s _vital_ to a task is what I&#x27;m always searching for. Nailing down requirements is challenging...! reply Swizec 1Funnily, studies have shown that people spend more time on chat and less time in face-to-face communication when working from an openspace office than when they work from home.Hopping on a quick 5min zoom is frictionless at home. Walking aaaaalll the way over to someone’s desk and disrupting the entire office with your conversation, or god forbid finding a free conference room, is way harder. So you smear the meeting on slack across a 1 hour back-and-forth pingpong instead of doing a quick 5min sync.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;worklife&#x2F;article&#x2F;20180718-open-offices-m...Private offices solve this problem of course. Wfh is the easiest way to get that. reply rcarmo 1I&#x27;ve never been more productive than when I have an office with a door -- home or otherwise. That also makes it much easier to have quick chats without disturbing the rest of the floor. reply pasc1878 1Communication is important and does require more communication - but more frequently I don\"t think so. You don&#x27;t pop into somon elses space and interrupt them unless you have a reason and don&#x27;t do that often. IRC or other chats happened a lot more often as the receiver can just ignore it. reply sussexby 1Currently in crisis because I simply can&#x27;t handle communication in remote work. For something I do for the majority of my working day, I feel devoid of human interaction to such an extent that it&#x27;s massively affecting my mental health.I regularly find myself clock-watching until the next time I can talk to someone because everyone is always busy - there are no water coolers or coffee breaks to stitch in between.Even if you create the virtual coffee break and have a chat with people, often we&#x27;re pushed to abandon it - presumably because it&#x27;s flipped from an opportunistic (oh, we&#x27;re all of the phone, let&#x27;s go grab a coffee) to a scheduled event which a) gets dropped and b) doesn&#x27;t naturally recur. reply hypeit 1I have to admit as someone who enjoys WFH and would never work in an office again, that having co-workers like you is one of the main reasons. You should work on not relying so much on others. You may be benefiting from all that social \"charging up\", but you&#x27;re taking that from the person on the other side of the conversation.I work to make money, not to fill someone&#x27;s social void. You&#x27;ll be happier if you explore the root cause of your issue and get a little more comfortable with yourself. reply DiggyJohnson 1They&#x27;re not referring to socializing with you, per se. I see this mistake made all the time in these discussions. Many just prefer to be around other people, myself included. They&#x27;re not necessarily the caricature of the \"overly social office mate that needs to find friends outside of work\" that you are implying.I really think you&#x27;re overassuming your knowledge of the person you&#x27;re responding to. reply paulcole 1It’s not a mistake. People who are pro-WFH are so dogmatic about it (and so protective of their “right” to WFH) that they intentionally reduce anyone who prefers working in an office to somebody with no social life. reply n42 I guess it’s unsurprising that people without the social capacity to handle in office work would not have the social capacity to empathize with someone who prefers it.Or more fairly, probably the inverse; plenty of WFHers wouldn’t be so derisive, we just don’t hear from them reply biztos That’s quite the generalization, and isn’t at all the typical pro-WFH attitude I see on HN.I’m pro-WFH and have WFH-d since 2009 but I’d love to go to the office more, if the office were nice and in the right place. reply spookthesunset 1Many of them bought homes way out in the boondocks assuming this covid remote crap would never end… reply paulcole 1Yeah, and? That gives them the right to put down anyone who likes working in an office by calling them an anti-social loser?Every decision has consequences.Anybody who thought “covid remote crap would never end” is either way more optimistic or way more pessimistic than I am. reply spookthesunset 1Totally agree. I really hate how so many people paint those who want 2019 normal office interaction back are somehow deeply flawed and just need to straighten up and fly right somehow. reply DiggyJohnson I actually agree 100% with this perspective. Well said. reply sussexby 1The root cause of my “issue” is I’m human and I’ve evolved to work with people face-to-face, not through a computer.I’m not yearning for social interaction because I need a friend. I’ve got friends and they’re not at my job.I’m yearning for the variety of different communication methods I have in a physical domain with the added bonus that I can change the environment I’m in to accommodate different tasks. reply jensensbutton 1I mean, they can just as easily tell you to deal with in-person. This isn&#x27;t a particularly useful contribution imo. reply n42 It’s fine to have preferences, it’s telling if you’ve reduced anyone who differs with yours into a mental disorder. Personally, I believe that your attitude is the bigger red flag. reply paulcole 1No offense to you, but this is why my next job will not be remote. reply NotSuspicious 1Yet another case where capitalism incentivizes pathologizing natural human behavior. It is absolutely normal to want to talk to people, to chitchat, to be social for some portion of the half of your waking hours that you are getting stuff done. At least on assembly lines you can have some of that. WFH can be demonic. reply sublinear 1Send your DMs when people are on \"busy\" status anyway. They can respond later. That&#x27;s the huge advantage of remote work. Async communication is so much more efficient. If you&#x27;re watching the clock, there&#x27;s something wrong. reply hext 1Async communication is not even remotely close to socializing, and hardly feels like genuine human interaction. reply dinvlad 1Work != socializing. Quality work requires deep concentration over long stretches of time, not tapping on a shoulder at random intervals. Both IRL and virtually. reply tenacious_tuna 1I keep seeing people say this, but I always sympathize with others who lament the lack of socialization that comes with remote work. I have several engineering friends, and myself, who all have gone full remote and are starting to go a little insane from feeling lonely all the time.\"Just socialize outside of work!\" seems to be everyone&#x27;s go-to response, totally missing how much time is taken up by the 8+ hours of the workday, and how much ambient socialization has been lost with that time now spent remote.Sure, remote is more convenient for \"deep work\", but I honestly never had issues with that in-office: If I had my headphones on, people didn&#x27;t bother me. If I had questions, I&#x27;d take them off and look around to see if anyone else was \"surfaced\" to talk to, or ping someone on slack. In the meantime I could kill time chatting with my team or going for a walk around the building--when I would inevitably find someone else from another team who was taking a break, and I could either ask them or just chat.Now it&#x27;s just me, in my apartment, all day, except for maybe standup. The only reliable face-to-face human interaction I have is my partner when they come home from work--and they&#x27;re usually exhausted and ready to go to bed in an hour.Work absolutely used to be a significant portion of socialization--just like going to classes used to be, in college or secondary school. We&#x27;ve absolutely lost that. reply sublinear 1> \"Just socialize outside of work!\" seems to be everyone&#x27;s go-to response, totally missing how much time is taken up by the 8+ hours of the workday, and how much ambient socialization has been lost with that time now spent remote.You&#x27;re working remote, not necessarily working from home. The world is your office now.For particularly meeting heavy days I have experienced no shame going on a daytrip while on those calls. It&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s business how you do your job remotely anyway. Get some coding in while stopped somewhere. Yes this means I have to make up for lost time in the day with all the interruptions. No I can&#x27;t just put away the laptop at 5pm because I still have stuff to do (usually done by 8pm), but it&#x27;s worth it. If Sarah from accounting is allowed to flex time to pick up her kids from soccer practice, I&#x27;m allowed to shoot the shit with random people I meet while getting gas or trying a new restaurant. There&#x27;s your new watercooler. Go to the beach or something. If your partner is driving you around, even better. Use the laptop like its namesake suggests.Not exactly a \"digital nomad\" lifestyle, but it&#x27;s such a mood boost to mix light travel with working hours. It&#x27;s a win for everyone if productivity goes up from these little things. reply broast 1My team does collaborative sessions twice a week with the whole team, and has a game session once a month. Between all the rest of the meetings, and between the important work we get done through chat, I feel that we do get to know each other and enjoy the time we spend together online. Plus we have public and private social chats full of devs of relatively the same level or age groups where coworkers feel comfortable chatting about sensitive topics. I feel socially fulfilled by this but I can&#x27;t know if everyone else does. reply goodpoint 1> Work != socializing.That&#x27;s plain unhealthy.> Quality work requires deep concentration over long stretches of time, not tapping on a shoulder at random intervals. Both IRL and virtually.This has little to do with socializing or not. reply SketchySeaBeast 1>> Work != socializing.> That&#x27;s plain unhealthy.Why? I have friends and people I socialize with, I don&#x27;t have to socialize with my coworkers. I am friends with people I&#x27;ve met along the way, but with everyone else I keep a distance and remain professional. Why is it unhealthy to have boundaries around work relationships? reply goodpoint It&#x27;s a basic psychological need: humans are social animals. People spend 40+ hours at week at work for many decades. Unless you work only 5 hours a week, it&#x27;s a huge fraction of a lifetime. replyswozey 1My team is incredibly quiet on slack and I find it pretty frustrating. We&#x27;re under 10 people so I don&#x27;t expect constant chat but it&#x27;s not uncommon for our guild channel to have a day go by with no messages.I try to keep it alive by posting interesting articles, updates and tools and things like that and that sometimes drums up some conversation but it&#x27;s rare that my teammates do the same thing.I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m more passionate about tech, more extroverted, more obsessed with improving processes or just less busy than them. It&#x27;s been like this at multiple companies I&#x27;ve been at so it&#x27;s not unique to my current team. And I&#x27;m clearly the outlier.I just try to not take it personally and keep going. I feel like I post really cool things, especially new tools&#x2F;repos&#x2F;projects that benefit everyone to the void sometimes. reply charlie0 I sympathize. You&#x27;re the person who does this because they love it and sees room for improvement everywhere. Unfortunately, most people are not like that. I know because I&#x27;ve been in a few teams and it&#x27;s rare to find the person who is seeking constant improvement. Most get to just good enough and stop there. It&#x27;s fine. It is what it is. reply bluefishinit 1> I try to keep it alive by posting interesting articles, updates and tools and things like that and that sometimes drums up some conversation but it&#x27;s rare that my teammates do the same thing.It&#x27;s a lot of work to read articles when people post them or evaluate a tool. It&#x27;s even more work to form an interesting opinion about it and discuss it.I enjoy researching things on my own time, but I find it stressful to add to my workload at work, especially when it&#x27;s not related to the other work I&#x27;m already doing. reply nickstinemates 1> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m more passionate about tech, more extroverted, more obsessed with improving processes or just less busy than them.

I am the same way but we are the minority. reply DiggyJohnson 1I had this issue and the only way I could solve it was moving to a primarily in-office company. This was the best thing I ever did for my mental health.Not trying to start a big debate over the whole issue, but just sharing that I felt very similarly to you (\"massively affecting my mental health\") and that it was solved by doing the obvious: going back to the office.No amount of socializing outside of work or hobbies or 1:1s during the workday sufficed for me. reply charlie0 It would be interesting to see what happens when all the extroverts self select for in office work and introverts self select for wfh. reply nvarsj I did the same as DiggyJohnson. And I&#x27;m introverted. Even introverts need human connection and interaction. And in my experience, being in an office is easier for an introvert.Being 100% remote for several years was terrible for my mental health. As to why... well, a lot of it was precisely because I&#x27;m introverted.As an introvert, it&#x27;s a lot more draining to do the explicit communication required to work remote effectively. Maybe 10% of people can work effectively over written comms. As a lead, I had to schedule zoom calls and make explicit face to face time to make any of it work. In an office setting, this happens more naturally and is a lot easier.On top of that, I found at a 100% remote company it seems more common for people issues to happen. When you are only interacting over text most of the time, misunderstandings seem to happen more often.I found it very draining to fix these issues. It was much harder than if we had been in an office together, where we could just have a quick chat and fix sensitive topics. It&#x27;s also more obvious in an office setting when this stuff happens and so you can sort it faster. reply dpz 1find the social outside of work? Work has always been work for me and nothing more, not really looking for socialising.In fairness I&#x27;ve been fully remote for 10 years but I see friends during the day for coffees, lunch, exercise. And then multiple sports clubs in the evenings reply whateverman23 1> Work has always been work for me and nothing more, not really looking for socialising.But work is 40-50 hours of my week. That&#x27;s a HUGE portion of my life. Almost half my waking hours are at work. (7x16=112 waking hours a week. 35-45% of it at work).Not taking time to socialize during that period is draining as hell for me. I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is you&#x27;re way overestimating the percentage of people who can go to work and just... work. Most people need the socialization. reply makeitdouble Outside of just cutting WFH, alternatives are to work in places where there&#x27;s people: libraries, co-working spaces, co-working coffees etc.You&#x27;ll have no commitment to come everyday, have people to talk to, and still hopefully be close enough to home to get back anytime you need pure calm or a full dedicated environment.To note, for many people WFH means their family is around one door away, which makes it a widely different experience from people living alone. reply hahn-kev 1Sounds like WFH isn&#x27;t for you then. reply whateverman23 1That&#x27;s... my point. WFH isn&#x27;t for a lot of people. And there are factions who say stuff like \"Just get a hobby dude!\" as if that fixes anything. reply DiggyJohnson 1I have a great social life outside of work and still felt the same as GP during the remote work day. And I&#x27;m pretty reserved at work, not known for bothering people incessantly. reply rcarmo 1Do more 1:1s. You&#x27;ll have to chase some things piecemeal across two to three people, but you&#x27;ll soon figure out who actually owns a topic and be able to have more in-depth conversations. reply j-bos 1I have a friend who often works alone for extended periods of time in isolated locations and loves being with people. Similar to your situation, but more outdoorsy. His solution is having an open phone line, just have a call going and occasionally saying things, chatting, joking, etc, or not. Sometimes it&#x27;s real quiet for long stretches, but it&#x27;s less lonely. I&#x27;m a quiet guy, and even I enjoy being on those calls. reply spookthesunset 1Welcome to my world. You aren’t alone. Remote work absolutely ruined my career…I really hope what shakes out is some places are all in on the office and some are all in on remote. None of this dithering crap that came post 2020 reply JohnMakin 1This is why I went back to the office, but it took me a very long time to realize it.Try to exercise a lot during the day, it helps. reply freeone3000 1Take your own breaks. Hang out with friends. Take a lunch. Your officemates do not have to be your end-all of social interaction :) reply avg_dev 1i had the same problem. i solved it by becoming much more social in my non-work parts of life. reply liveoneggs What did you want to talk about? reply theduder99 1If its affecting your mental health so much, perhaps you should change jobs. reply FartyMcFarter 1This sounds great for experienced engineers, but in my experience junior workers often require bite-sized guidance in order to avoid going down rabbit holes. A 10 second conversation could easily save hours of head-banging-into-wall type work for a junior SWE (not even exaggerating).Accordingly, during the pandemic I think it was mostly the less experienced engineers suffering from low productivity and lack of confidence (which feed into each other). reply gavmor 1I had the rare privilege of pair-programming 40 hours a week for several years early in my career. This follows the extreme programming ethos of \"everything in the limit,\" where pairing is \"code review in the limit\" and \"mentorship in the limit,\" to say nothing of the oral tradition it imparts[0].Even pair-programming with my fellow juniors was both more productive and more educational than a rubber duck[1].I had the opportunity to sit down to dinner with some very junior devs at a family gathering, recently, and to hear of their isolation due to remote-work broke my heart. They simply have no idea what they&#x27;re missing.0. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4PaWFYm0kEw1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rubber_duck_debugging reply mattnewton 1As a counterpoint, I have a hard time coding with other people, it’s like part of my brain spends the whole interaction thinking about what they could be thinking and I usually can’t shut this off. It’s especially aggravated if the person isn’t very familiar to me. For leetcode style interviews that means I basically memorized hundreds of kinds of problems and pattern match to them because thinking deeply while supervised just doesn’t reliably happen for me.I know mentorship is important and spend quite a bit of time on it everywhere I work, including with pairing. But the costs to many senior people’s productivity are very real and can’t be stated lightly. Remote work has been a godsend, previously I would do my best work behind a closed office door, in the back of a company bus, or after hours at home and it’s like having unlimited access to that zone. reply breischl 1I think it can work great for some people. I did it for a few weeks at one point, and found it thoroughly unproductive. 90% of my time was spent waiting for somebody else to type something, or trying to verbally communicate something that would be better done in writing&#x2F;code.Even now I find it incredibly off-putting to have somebody looking over my shoulder when I&#x27;m trying to work, to the point that I basically just can&#x27;t. People have asked to watch me do something, and my response is that you can either watch me, or I can do it, but not both. It&#x27;s like Heisenberg Uncertainty for work output. reply gavmor 1> waiting for somebody else to type> trying to verbally communicate something that would be better done in writing&#x2F;code> somebody looking over my shoulderAt the risk of sounding flippant, none of these activities comprise pair programming. What&#x27;s better written should be, and the simplest way might be \"can I just show you?\" or, from a particularly well-atuned pair, \"would you mind showing me?\"\"Waiting for someone else to type,\" in my experience, is either a good opportunity to finish a bit of thinking that&#x27;d I&#x27;d put off moments prior, or else premeditate on our next move. Sometimes, however, the typing is, as you alluded to, an attempt to communicate something, in which case watching them type is roughly equivalent to listening to a person in conversation, and therefore an opportunity to learn, catch bugs, etc. In other words, when I am pair-programming I am never waiting qua idling.And, lastly, I completely agree that \"somebody looking over my shoulder\" is an unnerving condition to code under. As purely ergonomic concern, \"over one&#x27;s shoulder\" is not a healthy position from which to operate a computer. ;)But, seriously, it&#x27;s not pair programming if you&#x27;re not on equal footing (seating?), with equal access to mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Don&#x27;t stand for someone standing behind you!I am sorry for the unpleasant experiences you&#x27;ve had. As a practitioner, I would not have subjected you to them. I am, frankly, vicariously irritated with whomever did. reply breischl 1\"Looking over your shoulder\" was just a figure of speech, not a literal description. And I suppose I could have grabbed the keyboard, but there&#x27;s social niceties to navigate, everyone likes their keyboard & IDE set up different ways, and it&#x27;s generally a PITA.Also the way I tend to code is never linear in a way that anybody else could follow. I write something, edit it, throw it away, put it back, rename it, hack out something I _know_ is buggy so I can see how it looks, and basically \"thrash\" my way to a solution that I like. That makes it essentially impossible for anybody to follow in real time, and having them try to point out errors would be counterproductive. In the later stages someone could help polish it, but even then I think it&#x27;d mostly be a waste of time.That&#x27;s before we even get to things like dealing with interruptions, or answering other questions quickly. Ideally interruptions don&#x27;t happen, but in practice they do, and I don&#x27;t want to be wasting someone else&#x27;s time.There&#x27;s a lot I liked about XP, but I still think that (for some people) it&#x27;s just a great way to make two devs produce the output of one intern. reply urthor I&#x27;d chew my arm off to have that 40h a week pair programming experience to be honest.Sounds like my dream job. reply brailsafe 1Meh, I don&#x27;t think this is an intrinsic quality of working in the same space. Sometimes it is, if you&#x27;re very lucky, but my experience in offices was mostly wasteful interactions with people who weren&#x27;t satisfied with me checking my messages periodically instead of instantly. reply gavmor > I don&#x27;t think this is an intrinsic quality of working in the same spaceIt&#x27;s certainly not. reply manvillej 1I still think that is a culture problem. I have a team of engineers that frequently has a lot of junior engineers. I find it really REALLY important to reinforce the culture of \"software development is a team sport\" and provide concrete mechanisms to do so.Junior engineers need help as the same rate they did before. They still need to ask for help. Remote work lets it:- happen asynchronously & synchronously- creates visibility of asking for help - reduces this weird shame around it - allows us to correct bad answers - allows people to learn from others with the same questions - self manages by capacity because the people with time are the ones that can answer questions - produces an awesome collection of analytics: how many & what questions are being asked by who, Who is answering questions and about what?Remote work is a communication and cultural change that a lot of teams have done poorly. I think most teams decided when the pandemic hit: \"oh we&#x27;ll use teams or slack. That&#x27;s enough\" and never thought more about it. reply maestroia 1It&#x27;s always difficult for people to ask for help. The best thing senior engineers can do is set the example and ask for help when they get stuck on something--even if it&#x27;s something they could figure out on their own with some time. reply fsociety 100%. If your seniors aren’t asking for help or even casually chatting in channels, then why would the juniors be expected to start. Setting the example helps encourage it and make it no big deal. reply seadan83 1Your team started out as in person?What kinds of things did you think about to transition to where you are? How did that transition happen? reply coffeefirst 1Well, it was always true for EMs that you could have a junior dev quietly spinning their wheels and not asking for help. The difference is before you could sometimes see they were frustrated, and they could see other people asking for help and know that&#x27;s just part of how you work. If they can&#x27;t see it passively, you have to proactively show them.You can and should still have those 10 second conversations. We&#x27;ve got Slack huddles, screen sharing, VSCode Live Share for more complex pairing... the tools are really good now.That said, I tend to agree, a remote culture that doesn&#x27;t respect the need for teaching and mentoring is going to be bad at it. reply pavedwalden 1When I worked in an office it was much easier to casually ask for quick help. It was often pretty obvious whether a senior engineer was busy and focused or between tasks, checking email etc. and the overhead&#x2F;friction of these ten-second conversations is higher when you have to wait for a response on slack, then launch a video call, share screen... instead of just making eye contact and saying \"got a sec?\" reply donpark 1Pair junior developer with a senior, starting with an hour every other day.I had more problems with junior developers who think they&#x27;re senior developers (some experience, high-confidence) bc they don&#x27;t ask for help when they should. reply nmridul 1In my project (30+ members) we have team members located in multiple locations (6+ cities in 4 countries). And for the last 2+ years I am the only one working from my country. While our company is 500+ strong in this country, for this particular project I am the only one.So interactions with the project team is fully remote.I am sure even pre-covid many MNCs might have a similar structure with members spread across different location. Though coming to office, but project work happens remotely. Also have juniors joining the team.It might be difficult for juniors to get started. But not impossible to handle. reply Aurornis 1> Its difficult - yes. But not impossible to handle.The problem with “difficult but not impossible” is that it requires special personality types to handle it.Some people can do it, but now you have a secondary problem in that you need to find a way to filter those people in the hiring pipeline. You also have a risk of hiring people who can’t handle it and having to cut them and re-hire.This is why most “difficult but not impossible” conditions are reserved for special exceptions but aren’t useful for general policies. reply freyes 1> it requires special personality types to handle it.I agree, and I don&#x27;t see a problem with it.> [...], but aren’t useful for general policies.offices are just optimizing for the loudest and more social people, this is a consequence of managers tending to be like that, I don&#x27;t think that approach is useful for general policies neither. reply seattle_spring 1Isn&#x27;t the same thing true about working in an office? Certain personality types thrive while others suffer. reply no_wizard 1I disagree its difficult. When the culture supports mentorship, onboarding and first year experience as high priority items with solid guidelines &#x2F; process around them, its pretty easy.but wait, that means changing cultural and such, that&#x27;s not easy is the response I often get to this, to which I say preemptively:That I would agree with, because the US business cultural is surprisingly stiff to changing things that would have favorable impact to workers, but that is IMO a different and separate discussion to the fact that this is a readily solvable problem. reply ravishi 1I had the opposite experience with junior devs on my team. The ones that knew how to communicate and ask for help thrived. It was easy to negotiate some head banging on the wall time while also pairing from time to time to discuss where they&#x27;re going. I&#x27;ve seem them flourish in less than a year&#x27;s time and be able to perform just like experienced devs. reply bluefirebrand All of the junior devs Ive ever mentored, I would be as detailed as possible with my onboarding, demo the product from end to end, walk them through the codebase, and provide step by step instructions to start up their own dev environment. This usually took a couple of days, depending on the project and the dev.Then I give them a ticket and say \"if you get stuck, let me know\"For the first little while, I am super responsive with them and answer everything immediately and eagerly.After a while, I start to wait about 5-10 minutes before I respond to questions. Usually they figure out the answers before I even get back to them in these cases, and then I get to praise them for it. reply ravishi That&#x27;s a great technique I would say!I stumbled on it by chance when I failed to make it to a client meeting with one junior dev I was leading. He was counting on my presence to support him, we had already discussed it before. But I got caught up last minute and he decided to go alone. And I know it was hard for him, but everything went fine. And from then on he was a lot more confident in his day to day. reply bastardoperator 1A 10 second conversations sounds like a slack message to me, or providing the guidance before they go down the rabbit. reply jayd16 1The difference is you can tell on someone&#x27;s face whether they&#x27;re struggling or cranking away without bugging them.\"Give guidance before\" is about as good a \"just don&#x27;t make mistakes.\" reply fsociety 1I think the experience of banging your head against the wall (for a bit) can be valuable. As long as the culture of the team encourages this and offers an escape hatch after a few hours (or whatever timeframe is appropriate for the problem). reply commandlinefan 1> the experience of banging your head against the wall (for a bit) can be valuableYes. This \"get it done as fast as humanly possible whether or not you actually understand what you&#x27;re doing\" is the most detrimental attitude toward beginning software developers I can think of. \"Going down a rabbit hole\" is a dismissive way of saying \"actually figure out what the computer is doing\" which is what actually makes you valuable to the team. If you just wanted somebody who can type in what they&#x27;re told to type in, you&#x27;re wasting a lot of money hiring computer science graduates. reply nerdponx 1What&#x27;s worse, you&#x27;re actually hurting their future career by allowing (or encouraging) them to develop bad intellectual, work, and communication habits. Borderline abusive IMO because the junior doesn&#x27;t realize they&#x27;ve been misled until much later. reply bravetraveler 1Yep, this is learning. Asking for help is a key part. Without trying first, asking for help is asking for someone to do it for you.In office, remote, whichever - I&#x27;ve been ignored. It took a while to learn to ask questions.People will help, but \"the squeaky wheel gets the grease\", and all. There&#x27;s movement [or an attempt] implied with this.The locality doesn&#x27;t matter, effective communication can exist in either.It&#x27;s possible to foster a remote environment where Juniors do ask questions - I&#x27;ve worked in several. As such, I&#x27;m skeptical of this &#x27;Think of the Juniors&#x27; concern. It&#x27;s manageable.It&#x27;s also worth pointing out, Junior and Senior aren&#x27;t diametrically opposed. It&#x27;s relative and nebulous depending on context.I&#x27;m a Senior Architect, but know very little about the specifics of our network devices - for example. I&#x27;m Junior to our &#x27;Network Engineering&#x27; team, making an Ouroboros of SeniorityRecognizing where strengths are helps greatly. Productive environments have their Seniors evangelizing this awareness reply travisjungroth 1> As such, I&#x27;m skeptical of this &#x27;Think of the Juniors&#x27; concern. It&#x27;s manageable.The top comment is saying how to manage it. TFA isn’t saying no remote work, it’s saying less frequent communication. That doesn’t work in all cases. Struggling for hours without getting much done or understanding more isn’t effective for productivity or learning by definition. These cases can often be prevented with quick questions. “Send me an email, I check it every Monday and Thursday” doesn’t support that. reply bravetraveler 1My skepticism isn&#x27;t aimed at themThis can be prevented without (net) more involvement... with better use of those existing sessions, perhaps splitting them.The definitions on that aren&#x27;t clear - the comments around seem to expect the worst, absent employers abound.I expect a fairly guided mission, with reports on findings. Questions both ways, Socratic or not. reply rqtwteye 1Totally agree. But with newbies I feel it’s very important to check from time to time if they are banging their heads on the right wall. reply bfeynman 1exactly, the most frustrating type of behavior for any colleague (esp jrs) is those who just default to consistently ask for help instead of diving deep. That behavior is costly in slowing down others. People need to learn how to learn, otherwise they will just be handicapping team if they cannot function independently. At the same time, navigating large proprietary or new knowledge sources can be tedious and sometimes impossible, but I have found that starting from the ask first mentality to be a positive feedback loop for never diving deep. reply commandlinefan 1> default to consistently ask for helpDon&#x27;t necessarily blame the developer - there&#x27;s a _lot_ of pressure from the PHB that doesn&#x27;t understand the difference between HTML and Linux to \"get it done right now\" and they think (for no reason) that nagging somebody else to do it for you is the most efficient way to do that. reply kritr 1I think if you have a good mentor or guide in a space where there might be a proprietary system, it’s a lot easier to start being able to do those deep dives. I found that when people were able to explain the larger context for the question I was asking, I would be able to move along faster and deep dive, but with brief answers that didn’t really go beyond my surface level questions, I ended up having to ask a lot more questions, sometimes finding certain information was never documented. reply eyelidlessness 1On the one hand, I agree from personal experience. Banging my head on the wall is how I’ve learned quite a lot of what I know and developed many helpful instincts.But on the other hand, I think that value comes from more than the persistence alone: it depends a lot on what you hope to get out of it. And I also say this from experience. Banging my head to “make it work” has almost always been an enormous waste of time and effort, but to “learn how&#x2F;why it works [or not]” has been the exact opposite. reply biomcgary 1It is particularly helpful if the team answers using a text format that is easily searchable (e.g., Slack). Long-term written communication is better for building a team&#x27;s institutional knowledge than verbal communication. I have saved hours of work just finding URLs and documents that I had posted, let alone others. reply rocqua 1I myself have also learned a lot from this. But I also see people doing it whilst they feel more pressure and less space to ask for help. That can lead to a non helpful state of a very quick shallow search for solutions. Anything complicated gets dismissed as &#x27;will take too long&#x27;, and you end up with completely suboptimal bodged solutions that, if anything, taught the wrong thing.Learning to do things properly by banging your head against the wall is great. But only if you feel like you have the leeway to figure out how to do things properly. Without that leeway, you need the space to ask for help. reply eddd-ddde 1I bang my head into the wall all the time. You just have to know which walls have a pot of gold behind them. reply pydry 1I dont. Ive gone down many rabbit holes thanks to, for instance, subtly incorrect or outdated docs in working cultures that valued not being interrupted and it&#x27;s a recipe for anxiety and a huge waste of time. reply andsoitis 1Hopefully you updated the docs as you encountered them and figured out the most up to date context. reply CoastalCoder 1> Hopefully you updated the docs as you encountered them and figured out the most up to date context.I&#x27;ve been in an environment like this, and it really burned me out.People broke docs faster than I could fix them, and it was an accepted part of the development process.My conclusion was that fixing the docs was simply a waste of time. My resulting despair for the software and the company surely destroyed my productivity. (I&#x27;m not saying this is a valid excuse; just an explanation.) reply prepend 1> My conclusion was that fixing the docs was simply a waste of time. My resulting despair for the software and the company surely destroyed my productivity.What did you do instead? It’s certainly frustrating to have people breaking docs that you fixed. But what else is there. You just figured it out on your own and left the docs broken? reply CoastalCoder 1> What did you do instead? It’s certainly frustrating to have people breaking docs that you fixed. But what else is there.I concluded that it was a fatal and unfixable flaw in that community &#x2F; product &#x2F; company. This sapped my motivation, and I&#x27;m sure resulting burnout was a factor in eventually being laid off.One thing that sucks about being a senior dev is you&#x27;re subject to Cassandra [0] syndrome. In a tight labor market, that gets painful.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cassandra reply pydry 1I dont think I even had edit rights. I was also under pressure to do my actual job.I would have loved to have been working in an environment where I could work with the system maintainers to fix their docs collaboratively but alas it was more of an \"I&#x27;m busy go away\" type environment.I think this type of dysfunction was fairly common during lockdown WFH. reply newsclues 1It a useless exercise to have people do so for solved problems.Sure, reinventing the wheel every time is a valuable experience, but it&#x27;s not efficient to relearn how to do things every time.This is like letting toddlers struggle to learn how to tie shoes themselves, sure they will eventually figure it out, but it&#x27;s better to just teach people have to do the basics, and let people bang their heads against hard problems. reply lapcat 1> This is like letting toddlers struggle to learn how to tie shoes themselvesJunior engineers aren&#x27;t toddlers. Hopefully they&#x27;re a lot more competent. Nobody hires toddlers to do work. reply twobitshifter 1It’s just an analogy. human progress is made from “standing on the shoulders of giants” not starting from scratch. reply lapcat 1It wasn&#x27;t a good analogy. For one thing, toddlers don&#x27;t tie their shoes: the average age for learning to tie your shoes is 6 years old. And it&#x27;s not clear that kids will learn for themselves if you give them a few hours. We&#x27;re not talking about letting junior engineers struggle for weeks or months, but they can bang their heads for a few hours or maybe even a few days and figure out a lot of things for themselves. That&#x27;s a useful skill to acquire.Here&#x27;s my analogy: if you want to learn how to ride a bike, you&#x27;ve got to take off the training wheels, and sometimes that means falling over. reply jewayne 1I don&#x27;t think you get it. Letting a junior engineer bang their heads for a few days on something you could show them in ten minutes is just a waste of time and money. In my experience there are PLENTY of real problems for them to solve, things I DON&#x27;T know the answer for. reply lapcat 1You can&#x27;t just consider one question and one answer in isolation. The questions and answers add up. It&#x27;s a waste of the senior engineer&#x27;s time to spend ten minutes each answering every question of junior engineers who are constantly asking questions, seemingly incapable of helping themselves. The senior engineer becomes a glorified babysitter, and the junior engineers then never learn to solve problems for themselves, which will waste everyone&#x27;s time in the future.Not every problem is going to take junior engineers days to solve for themselves. I was stating an upper bound of how much rope to give them, not an average.Besides, what happens when the senior engineer leaves the company? Sometimes \"institutional knowledge\" walks out of the institution. replyfendy3002 1> A 10 second conversation could easily save hours of head-banging-into-wall type work for a junior SWEAgree, though sometimes the hours of head banging will benefit greatly to the skills of said junior.That aside, everyone should be encouraged to ask to company&#x27;s developer forum (slack channel). That way, if the senior that&#x27;s responsible to train the junior is busy, other less busy senior can help. reply mrits 1Reminds me of when I blew up on my partner when I told her I&#x27;m not going to tell her how to switch from Playstation to Roku on the TV for the 1000th time. She spent 2 minutes trying to figure out and actually now understands how it works. reply dinvlad 1I think it&#x27;s actually better for junior engineers to go alone for long stretches of time. That is such a huge driving force for their own success, when they have to learn by doing a lot of things on their own, without external help, and without someone constantly micro-managing them. reply abalashov 1I don&#x27;t know. Really depends.Some of them are very independently-motivated and self-contained, but inexperience means they are still prone to rabbit holes. Others really will sit on their hands until explicitly told what to do, which doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re bad or lazy, just that they require tight feedback loops.In both cases, it seems like quicker feedback cycles do more good than harm. reply no_wizard 1It doesn&#x27;t have to be this way though. This sounds to me like a huge gap in communication and on-boarding process, which indirectly is a cultural problem, its not a remote work problem.You can solve this, and many organizations have. It does mean re-thinking expectations around onboarding and the role of mentorship in the company though reply BeFlatXIII 1> but in my experience junior workers often require bite-sized guidance in order to avoid going down rabbit holes. A 10-second conversation could easily save hours of head-banging-into-wall type workThis is why I more or less never go and \"do my own research\" before asking questions for hobby projects. I&#x27;ve gotten stuck in too many research rabbit holes and (hopefully) have learned my lesson. Ask first, then get mired in irrelevant details if the response to my bizarrely unique question is crickets. reply eschneider 1Part of the job of a mentor&#x2F;senior engineer is spending time helping get juniors up-to-speed on projects and getting them comfortable asking questions. And if they&#x27;re not asking questions, checking in on them to see how they&#x27;re doing. (Pro-tip: don&#x27;t just ask them how they&#x27;re doing, have them explain what they&#x27;re doing and why. Problems show up a lot faster that way. :)Building an environment where junior engineers learn how to find things out on their own and when they need to ask questions is a company culture thing and has very little to do with remote vs in-office. reply osigurdson 1I’m convinced the strength of the “rabbit hole detector” is what truly differentiates software engineers. While I do think experience has something to do with it, I have also observed very senior people with terrible RHDs. reply Tade0 1Dealing with frustration is part of this job.Also this is trivially solved through checking on the person twice a day and doing call reviews, thus making it at most a few hours.Actually, this is a regular part of successful remote team building.Meanwhile making the junior approach unannounced is counterproductive. I for one would rather have my interruptions at least scheduled if they can&#x27;t be avoided. reply m_0x 1Agreed. As a 10 YoE engineer working from home is a blessing. Interruptions are minimal and I can take a 15-20 minutes nap if I want. Before the pandemic my office provided a nap room so napping during business hours is NOT frowned upon.People still ping me frequently for a \"quick chat\" which is rarely quick, tho. reply willio58 1This is very true. For interns and junior devs if the team is remote the seniors need to set aside time to help them out daily. I&#x27;ve started doing this as a senior dev on my team, basically setting time for office hours, and it&#x27;s been great so far. reply jayd16 1Office hours is an ironic choice of words. reply fossuser 1Agreed, tools like gathertown can make a big difference in improving this problem for remote teams, but it requires buy in from the top and the right culture (everyone has to hang out in there during working hours). reply throwbadubadu 1That&#x27;s true, but I don&#x27;t see how this relates to pandemic or being remote?Also not reaching out when getting totally stuck is a bad thing, but again unrelated? reply sokoloff 1There is a higher hurdle to setting up a zoom call than there was to waking up to a colleague who was at their desk and didn’t look obviously busy. Solve that, and you probably solve a lot of low-grade communication challenges that are made worse by being remote as compared to in-same-office. reply throwbadubadu 1A 10 second convo is a two liner question I can shoot of via chat any time, not even needing to look for (and still fail or mistake) unbusy persons (and with a small team chat even broadcast to multiple people to also solve finding the unbusy person)? There are always many perspectives.. I have also seen introverts cope much better that way than approaching IRL. Heck you can even combine, \"let me know when you are not busy to quickly explain me X\" providing already the question async way, and then have the call or real desk meeting afterwards?> There is a higher hurdle to setting up a zoom call than there was to waking up to a colleague who was at their deskAlso just not getting that, hitting the call button (or a real phone call) was always quicker and easier than walking two floors down to another room just to find the person not at its desk. Where is the hurdle?Really, just not getting it ;) What&#x27;s to be solved? I see it may be a problem or hurdle for some, but for others the bigger hurdle is the opposite way. Don&#x27;t extrapolate, generalize and state it like fact, because that is imo not true for everybody and may be the other way round. reply okaram 1Slacking &#x27;hey, can we do a quick huddle?&#x27; takes about the same time as walking to someone&#x27;s desk (less if the desk is far away;) reply FartyMcFarter 1> I don&#x27;t see how this relates to pandemic or being remote?There was more friction to asking quick questions, compared to being in office. This may not be the case any longer at all companies, as it&#x27;s possible that some of them solved this with new communication practices. reply grozmovoi 1Absolutely agree. I think remote engineering work is a skill that is hard to acquire when you&#x27;re very junior. reply ramesh31 1>A 10 second conversation could easily save hours of head-banging-into-wall type work for a junior SWE (not even exaggerating).Weeks, even. It took me a while to come to terms with the fact that this is the majority of my value to an org now. Not so much in my IC abilities, but in the ability to save endless amounts of time for lesser experienced folks. reply ResearchCode 1Those \"rabbit holes\" are where you learn. Saving hours is more important if you bill hourly, less if you are salaried. reply itsmemattchung 1Generally agree that rabbit holes (or as my wife calls mine: black holes) can be conducive to learning. But I suspect that there&#x27;s diminishing returns. At some point, you may end up spinning your wheels and reaching out for help does not distract from learning the valuable lesson. reply ResearchCode 1If you&#x27;re doing a PhD, that point is a weekly chat with your supervisor. I don&#x27;t see why a few hour \"rabbit hole\" would be a problem in software engineering. If we&#x27;re even discussing hours unless billing hourly, that&#x27;s a red flag for micromanagement. reply throwawayfear 1Indeed. There may be a toxic or stupid management culture at that company if they&#x27;re worried about someone going down a rabbit hole to learn. In my experience this is usually in teams that are run by people who don&#x27;t have technical ability. reply FartyMcFarter 1Going down rabbit holes and getting something out of it is fine, but that doesn&#x27;t always happen.Sometimes people are just frustrated and spinning their wheels, or doing work that turns out to be pointless because they failed to understand something which would have been clarified by a short conversation. reply throwawayfear 1That can be measured by frequency of code commits. You can tell which juniors are making the most of a rabbit hole and becoming better versus which ones are mindlessly surfing because they don&#x27;t want to think. The first group will have things to share or talk about if they go some time without committing code and their mentor or manager starts getting worried.If someone hasn&#x27;t pushed something in a week or two, that&#x27;s a good time for their mentor to initiate a conversation and see where they&#x27;re at and when they think they will push something.Anything else is micromanagement by a company that has hired someone without giving them any amount of runway to actually work and learn the space they&#x27;re in. You can also tell on company hardware and on company accounts if the junior&#x27;s browsing history represents getting better or just resting on their haunches because they want someone else to do the thinking. Let&#x27;s not pretend the micromanagement cultures where \"fear of rabbit holes\" exists are not already doing this. reply jzm2k 1>You can also tell on company hardware and on company accounts if the junior&#x27;s browsing history represents getting better or just resting on their haunches because they want someone else to do the thinking.Are you saying the mentor should actually go and check the browsing history of one their engineers to verify whether they&#x27;ve actually done \"correct work\" or what are you trying to say exactly? This sounds to me like micromanagement of the highest order. replypatrick451 I dunno, I was only a few months into my first job when covid hit. Going down all those rabbit holes alone was a massive learning experience. I&#x27;d much rather do all that head-wall banging and figure it out myself. I&#x27;d have felt smothered if somebody was checking in on my every couple of hours. But this does seem to be a fascinating difference with academia and industry. E.g, in gradschool I got 30 min a week with my advisor, and by some standards that is actually a lot. reply okaram 1Have the 10 second conversation over video reply pnutjam 1A culture of good, clear documentation is critical. reply dakiol 1That&#x27;s why one should hire juniors based on how well they communicate and less based on their skills to invert a binary tree or design a URL shortener service. reply ResearchCode 1There&#x27;s an abundance of people that can talk but do less. Real tech talent are rare, not that you find them by algorithms quizzes. reply x86x87 18 hours ago[flagged]| next [51 more] Oh..

Remote check-ins with juniors every 30-60 minutes? That&#x27;s crazy. But that&#x27;s basically the only way to replicate the in person experience.The best mentoring results for me as the mentee and for me as a mentor have been when we&#x27;re sitting next to each other. The mentor can visually tell when the mentee is stuck, and mentee can tell when the mentor isn&#x27;t focusing on anything important and is more willing to ask for help.No matter how many times you tell junior engineers to ping you at the first sign of trouble, they&#x27;re not going to do it. They&#x27;re going to toil for way longer than needed, unless you&#x27;re sitting right next to each other. reply belval 1I like to do virtual desk with Slack, where I will have a channel where I&#x27;m always in a huddle and they can drop by when they have questions, just like they would in-office.I have to say as a counter point though that I&#x27;ve had a lot more trouble with coworkers coming to my physical desk for questions that they could have Googled than with Junior getting stuck for extended period of time remotely. It&#x27;s all a matter of culture and relationships. reply pnutjam 1100% this. Keep an open channel for IM and setup regular shadowing. I&#x27;ve been on both ends, learning and teaching. It&#x27;s way preferable to have your own computer, shared screen vs trying to look at another screen and taking notes. Remote is better for collaboration and training. Proper documentation is a big part of it, and open channels for IM, like slack. reply whateverman23 1> Remote is better for collaboration and training.Oh come on... I get arguing that there are ways to make remote training good enough. Maybe even similar. Maybe even a net-positive when you look at the entire picture (including the productivity and happiness of your senior staff). But saying remote is better for training specifically? No way. That makes no logical sense. reply pnutjam 1Please elaborate how it&#x27;s better in person? Remote: I can see and hear the person. I can see their screen. I can copy past back and forth (as can they) through the screen sharing app. I can invite others into the training pretty much instantly. I can send links and commands typed properly in the chat. User can record session for later.In person: Usually have to face the person or the screen, can&#x27;t see both. I have to write down commands and pass them, or type them myself. There is a delay finding others if we need to talk to them. More chance to transpose commands incorrectly by the user. Harder to record the session without losing parts. reply whateverman23 1Everything you can do remotely, you can do in person as well. I don&#x27;t know why you think you can&#x27;t screen share or send links and commands in a chat if you&#x27;re in person.So at minimum, in person would be the same. So I can&#x27;t possibly see how in person could be worse. reply pnutjam 1So you&#x27;re just ranting, no data and looks like no experience. OKIn person is worse. I&#x27;ve done both. It&#x27;s noisier, you&#x27;re crammed into a cube taking notes, etc. If you&#x27;re going to use remote tools, what&#x27;s the benefit of in person? reply whateverman23 1> looks like no experienceGot it, I see you&#x27;re in the \"make up stuff about the other person\" phase of the discussion.

Way to support your statements. replyasyx 1It&#x27;s really not an issue to have a junior bang their head against the wall for a few hours and then telling them that they should have gotten help sooner.They won&#x27;t do that every single time.

Learning when to ask for help. If someone is doing this for you, you&#x27;ll never going to learn. reply criddell 1Why the &#x2F;s? I happen to agree with that statement.Part of being a senior engineer is to use the mentorship skills you developed along the way and make judgements about how much struggle is right. Every new person should have a more senior partner with whom they can ask the dumb questions and not be made to feel dumb. reply commandlinefan 1> learning how to go about your workThere are whole college degree programs designed to teach this, in fact. reply lukeschlather 1Effective use of group chat works well. The most effective remote teams, there are little conversations happening in the team Slack, often more than once per hour that can go for 5-10 minutes. Some people are bad at communicating over text but some people are also bad at communicating in person and in-person just biases for the latter, it&#x27;s not inherently better. It can be helpful to hop on video but there&#x27;s a ton of ways to communicate, often more effectively and less disruptively. reply ta1243 1> But... how? Remote check-ins with juniors every 30-60 minutes? That&#x27;s crazy.

Slack is the same thing, just send a message. reply lambersley 1Agile environments are much better at this. Its inherent frequent touchpoints and \"fail fast\" mindset can help to ensure the juniors are getting as much information and direction as required. reply mejutoco 1Pair programming sessions. reply throwawayfear 1The juniors will have to read documentation and spend long hours writing and reading code and understanding what has already been built. Just like all of us who did that and had to do it in order to move up. The idea of spending time \"mentoring juniors\" has always ended up being an euphemism. It&#x27;s just a way for non-technical people, at the end of the day, to consume as much time as possible from other people so they can pretend to be doing work.It&#x27;s clear which juniors are motivated and will make the most of the mentorship and which ones are not. Some are just there for the check and you cannot compromise your senior and higher talent on people who don&#x27;t want to learn and grow and just want the prestige and check of a high-tech job. It&#x27;s the same situation with someone who is drowning not listening to orders and taking down their rescuer with them too.If a junior needs someone to sit next to them because they toil for way longer than needed on clear simple requirements and goals, this may not be the field for them. I never needed anyone right next to me that couldn&#x27;t have been a direct message or a brief remote call to clarify something specific, clear, and to the point. You&#x27;re describing a reality where the people who don&#x27;t do are just trying to take as much time for themselves as possible to hide the fact that they don&#x27;t want to think. reply malfist 1Who suggested checking in with juniors every 30-60 minutes? GP certainly didn&#x27;t. You&#x27;re arguing against a strawman. reply whateverman23 1Sorry I edited to include my point there. If you don&#x27;t have 30-60 minute check-ins with juniors, they&#x27;re not going to have the same rapid feedback that they&#x27;d get from in person mentoring.And very importantly, I&#x27;m saying 30-60 minute remote check-ins are an absolutely insane idea that should never be implemented.I don&#x27;t know any kind of remote system that provides for anything even close to the power of in-person mentoring. reply x86x87 17 hours ago[flagged]| Lol. Are those juniors in the room with us right now?How about letting them figure it out and provide opportunities to chat and ask questions from time to time. Everyone wants superdevelopers but everyone expects that you&#x27;re going to put a complete noob in a room with a senior developer, they&#x27;re gonna rub hand and in 2-4 days you&#x27;re going to have another senior developer. That&#x27;s not how it works. reply repeekad 1I was one of those juniors, the rapid shift to remote work ruined me. I had just moved to a new city where I knew no one to start a life doing the work I loved, and all at once I got told leaving my house was dangerous and to stay home alone all day staring at a screen to keep people safe, for 2+ years…It’s great you value work life balance, but junior engineers suffered a lot (to different degrees), and you being on edge that remote work might be taken away from you is nothing compared to what I went through and haven’t recovered from.We’re allowed to love our work and the people we do it with, that’s my ideal, just a because you hate it doesn’t mean everyone should reply saurik 1Look: except for a few months in high school, I have never worked for a stereotypical company where I would go into an office and do work with other people; I have always worked by myself or remote. I relish working alone and have never had an issue with it; I&#x27;ve even been quite fanatical about it, trying to make sure everyone knew how great this lifestyle was (one which I learned from my father, who worked for a company half a world away from him, from a home office where he was always accessible to his son: me).But... the pandemic also broke me. Bad. I wasn&#x27;t at all prepared for life trapped inside where my only interaction with human beings I knew was via video. There were like four months in early 2021 where I only had about four interactions with flesh and blood humans whose name I knew (like, not some entirely random person)... one of them was the guy who lived in a nearby park whom I normally avoid as it is so difficult to end conversations. I gained a ton of weight and at one point--end of 2020--I had given myself some kind of weird anemia (I think from lack of B12 in my stupid closed-in diet).Like: I am someone for whom his entire life normalized remote work and who thrived in such an environment and yet the pandemic was so hard I still haven&#x27;t really recovered... thinking about it makes me cry. (And like, yes: I could have better managed my lifestyle or better handled the loneliness. Whatever. That is also true for you, and I at least am not judging you for that.) It is one thing to not work in an office--you can work from anywhere! and there are a ton of people who you can get to spend time with--and it is entirely another thing to work explicitly from a small room in your home day in and day out for a year without human contact.I thereby want to posit that maybe--just maybe--the issue isn&#x27;t working remotely but being forced to stay at home and at times even fear going to the supermarket. There were periods during this thing when people were even afraid to meet up outside, and so human contact for white collar professionals outside of relationships was pretty much just verboten. The world was in a shitty place, and you shouldn&#x27;t judge working remote based on the experiences you had during a pandemic without even trying to control for the existence of a pandemic as part of your analysis. reply repeekad 1I vividly remember trying to meet up with the few people who stayed behind and didn’t move to their parent’s lake house during covid, one person in the group being concerned about even meeting up outside and everyone else not wanting them to be left behind, so we did virtual on zoom. Laughs and fun, then with a button press the screen flicks black and you’re alone again in your tiny apartment you signed when the plan was to spend almost no time there.You’re right, I do still think there is value working in person, but remote work by itself isn’t what caused this, even if it’s still what happened.Hindsight has made all this more clear, but imo loneliness is a silent killer around the world today, and covid threw jet fuel on the fire. reply x86x87 1You need social in person interaction as a human being. Nobody is disputing that. Should you rely on your work to get that interaction and can you make the claim that it helps your work? reply abalashov 1Considering that it delivers a feeling of productive communion, the camaraderie and esprit d&#x27;corps of solving problems together, and generally feeling useful, the answer might be yes. Especially if, as an adult, it&#x27;s where you spend most of your waking hours.Don&#x27;t misunderstand me, I&#x27;m not romanticising the marriage of one&#x27;s social life to one&#x27;s workplace, nor overlooking the ways this \"we are more than a company, we&#x27;re family\" rhetoric benefits employers at the expense of their employees&#x27; outside lives and broader well-rounded and fulfilment. But I think asking people to separate them in an extreme way is just as untenable. reply osigurdson 1I can sympathize, but you should not have let it ruin you. Take responsibility for your own life. reply repeekad 1When you’re alone, someone telling you it’s your own fault and just take responsibility for it can feel really dark reply shrimp_emoji 1I had the same timeline as you, but it was fine for me. Granted, I&#x27;ve never known anyone anywhere I&#x27;ve lived and barely leave home anyway. :p I&#x27;m grateful I seem optimized for the fully atomized cyberpunk existence which may only become more intense and universal in the future. reply eru 1> We went from offices to cubicles to open space and nobody stopped to think if it was a good idea.People have been complaining about this development since forever. I&#x27;m not sure who that &#x27;nobody&#x27; in your sentence is? reply grumpy_coder 1That nobody is obviously within the people making the decisions. The people complaining were a whole different set of nobodies. reply eru There&#x27;s lots of different people making different decisions for different reasons.Mark Zuckerberg might be a true believer in open plan offices (judging by his public comments). But your average Fortune 500 company might only be into it for the savings in office space expenditure to be had from cramming people tighter. And some companies, like SAP (at least when I did an internship with them ages ago), still have offices (shared amongst eg 4 people) instead of going open plan. reply x86x87 1My point is that we are invoking this alleged benefits when it serves a narrative but just ignore it when it&#x27;s convenient for the \"bottom\" line reply eru Who is &#x27;we&#x27;? Different people do different things. reply spike021 1Nothing about what they said is socializing. reply slily 1I&#x27;ve worked in cubicles and open space plans as well as remotely as a junior. It seems self-evident to me but maybe those who haven&#x27;t experienced the various environments do not realize that in person it is much easier to ask a random question to a senior. You can poke them and have a small discussion that would flood a chatroom and take much longer to develop remotely, without feeling like you may be inconveniencing them or the rest of the team since you cannot see if they are busy, or you can follow them to the coffee machine and discuss issues that are not urgent but could use their input instead of just notifying them over chat at a random time that may or may not be convenient.Working remotely I found myself constantly wasting time trying to figure things out on my own because I don&#x27;t know if people are even online&#x2F;active (spread out across the globe, another issue common with remote), if they are online I don&#x27;t know if they have something more important to deal with at the moment, it is more difficult to extract information from seniors who are poor communicators - as good as they may be as ICs, most of my seniors will assume I should know every undocumented internal mess and it makes asking for more details intimidating. And I don&#x27;t want to look like an idiot in writing! (lol, but I do feel that way sometimes)If you want juniors to learn anything in a reasonable amount of time you have to give a bit of a shit and invest more time solely towards that especially in remote environments, seems that people just expect juniors to take the lead and force their way in though which isn&#x27;t my style at all and if there isn&#x27;t a common agreement and people are all just doing their thing it can come off as presumptuous to be bugging people left and right for the first months. Yes part of the problem is company culture not properly adapting to the environment, but I also haven&#x27;t seen any change in the way we deal with communication since the Corona and of course seniors don&#x27;t care because they got their job security. reply no_wizard 1Hate to bang the same drum over and over, however this very much sounds like a culture problem, based on> if they are online I don&#x27;t know if they have something more important to deal with at the moment, it is more difficult to extract information from seniors who are poor communicators - as good as they may be as ICs, most of my seniors will assume I should know every undocumented internal mess and it makes asking for more details intimidating. And I don&#x27;t want to look like an idiot in writing! (lol, but I do feel that way sometimes)Sounds like the company lacks good culture, process and guidelines on expected patterns of communication and behavior. There should be an onboarding buddy when things are implemented well.Its not your fault, at all. Its the company. Its not inherent to remote work though reply bloopernova 1If your team penalizes you for \"asking questions and looking like an idiot\" then the team culture is poor.Nobody knows everything. Everyone makes mistakes. The team should help those people but they need to ask.Today I was looking in the wrong devtools tab for a token value. Because we&#x27;ve worked hard making our team a safe place in which to ask questions, I felt comfortable asking what I was missing. Heck it&#x27;s give and take, I know way more DevOps and Linux-y stuff, the devs know more about their job.Because we try to think as a team, we do better and have less interpersonal clashes. I still complain about things each dev does, that&#x27;s natural, but our team does pretty well together. reply theideaofcoffee 1This is such an important point I don’t think it can be overstated. Psychological safety is one of the key things to have a well-functioning culture and it’s one of those cultural things that I’ve tried desperately change in past positions. It’s hard, and in one place, almost impossible save for eliminating a few key people who hold onto that mindset and clean house a little bit.There is no growth, no team cohesion in an environment where you’re berated for asking seemingly stupid or dumb questions. But I think people become numb and indoctrinated to it because “well, I had to endure this when I was learning” is such a demoralizing and abusive stance and nobody wants to change.Things work so much better when everyone has a chance to pitch in, even if some ideas are dumb, just having the option is miles ahead of whatever bullshit people can justify from the “old way”.Part of the process to change I’ve found is just leading by example. I’ll intentionally ask stupid questions that I know raise the ire of my similarly-leveled coworkers just to make the point to the more junior people that “hey, this staff-level guy is asking this, I might be able to too”. Junior people will gradually start to get the picture and ignore the rantings and ravings and toxicity of the debbie-downwers and the sticks-in-the-mud. reply slily 1> Today I was looking in the wrong devtools tab for a token value.

Heck it&#x27;s give and take, I know way more DevOps and Linux-y stuff, the devs know more about their job.That&#x27;s easier to do when you&#x27;re more or less on \"equal footing\", but if you&#x27;re a junior, it can take months to years to develop knowledge that seniors don&#x27;t (depending on several factors). That&#x27;s the problem, it takes much longer to reach a point where you have knowledge that is equivalent to that of seniors if the culture doesn&#x27;t lend itself to frequent and high-quality communication and you have to learn about internal tools, processes, code bases and such largely solo. If you share a physical space with seniors you&#x27;ll at least have some common downtime like a coffee or water break to \"bother\" them and it can save minutes to hours of tedium each time.So either you end up being \"that guy always asking stupid questions in the chat and interrupting my work\" or you spend a lot of time spinning your wheels pointlessly for months&#x2F;years on end. The first approach leads to unhelpful and delayed responses and the latter makes you so inefficient that you favor lower quality work so that you can actually deliver something. reply x86x87 1Hard disagree with random questions. If it&#x27;s easy to ask a random question you&#x27;re just going to keep asking random questions. How about you write down that question and try to formulate the answer or a strategy for finding the answer?Here is a workflow I made all people I mentor go through: 1) what is the problem? 2) why is this a problem? 3) what are you actually seeing? 4) what have you tried to solve it? What are the results? reply jewayne 1Allowing a noob to spin their wheels for too long isn&#x27;t just wasteful, it sets the exact wrong tone. The goal is not to \"figure everything out for yourself\". It&#x27;s to GET THINGS DONE. reply slily 1\"Random questions\" doesn&#x27;t mean questions without any thought put into them. It just means anything helpful from workflow or environment related questions to code style or processes that are not documented or easy to find. vs. wasting time trying to find things that don&#x27;t exist or reinventing the wheel, which is more tempting to do when you can&#x27;t see what your coworkers are doing and don&#x27;t want to risk offending people who have no interest in passing on knowledge, like a sibling of your comment. reply extr 1Well said. I am currently working my way through an unfamiliar codebase and even as a mid-career developer, I find it intimidating and inconvenient to continually ask for help over slack for \"basic questions\". People say the answer is to go deep and gain expertise, but in my experience you need to reach a certain escape velocity with the codebase before that kind of spelunking becomes valuable learning experiences and not just a confusing and messy waste of time. You need either:* Documentation that is up to date and answers not just technical details but the \"why\" behind the architecture. Something that shows you where to focus and where the frontier is.* Defined, limited scope (at first). Scoping yourself to the entire codebase is a good way to become an expert in nothing. You need a foothold where you can gain expertise and give yourself a jumping off point to adjacent areas.The latter is easier to accomplish than convincing everyone to write pages of docs that don&#x27;t exist. reply grumpy_coder 1As the person you kept interrupting and following to the coffee pot, I much prefer this new way of working.To be clear, labelled as an &#x27;IC&#x27; I have zero interest in training you. You will job hop at the first opportunity, and never lift a finger to help me in the future. reply slily 1With that attitude yes I&#x27;m not surprised that people would be tempted to jump ship. reply malfist 1To add to your point. Just because there&#x27;s a tradeoff one way doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t make that tradeoff.Yeah, there might be some impacts to junior engineers. But if it improves the efficiency of your more expensive senior devs, isn&#x27;t it worth it?And just because your team has a problem with onboarding and mentoring junior devs in a remote environment doesn&#x27;t mean A) Everyone has the same problem, B) you can&#x27;t fix that problem yourself. Self improvement is the name of the game here anyway reply leidenfrost 1Another (unrelated) problem with Remote work is how harder is to lose weight when you stop moving throughout the day.Before the pandemic, I usually got up to make coffee, to ask for help or to make consensus with my fellow coworkers (other devs or even UX people, a few stairs away). I usually walked from work from time to time to clear up my mind. Now I barely move. I live in a small apartment. The fridge is 3 meters away from me.Back then, I could somehow manage my weight by applying some casual restrictions, like eating fewer carbs and eat mostly lean cuts of meat. Now I need to apply some zen monk level of self control if I want to not gain more weight. And losing it is terribly hard. reply katbyte 1Opposite for me, wfh means healthier lunches, more time and flexibility to be active . The short walk to transit (of not driving) doesn’t come close reply repeekad 1It’s not for everyone, but people who don’t already have an entire life outside of work struggle to start one when the majority of your day is spent alone staring at a screen. The idea that socializing at work is a bad thing I think isolated a huge number of people who used to thrive on work relations and didn’t need a huge number of close friends outside of work to be happy. reply biomcgary 1My company is 90% remote in practice even though almost everyone lives is in the greater Boston area. It has a Monday meeting over Zoom that starts with socializing, typically discussing personal events from the weekend. This kind of conversation might help people (particularly junior employees) realize that it is possible to have a life outside of work and give some ideas about how to start it (e.g., organized bike rides). reply rqtwteye 1For me it’s the opposite. I don’t have any junk food at home but when I was in the office I was constantly surrounded by pretzels, ice cream and candy bars. I also often do some work in the backyard while I am thinking about a problem. reply Aaronstotle 1I&#x27;ve actually gained weight since having to go into an office a few days a week, was much easier to exercise when working from home imo. reply anurag6892 1I struggle with this too. My usual exercise routine is to run alternate days. With WFH, I go on 1 hour evening walks on days I am not running. This makes up for the lack of walking at home. reply WirelessGigabit 1For me it&#x27;s the other way. I used to drive to work. Now I walk before and after work. reply malfist 1Maybe for you.Working from home means I make healthy lunches for me. It&#x27;s a lot easier to eat right when you have a full kitchen and pantry at your disposal. reply leidenfrost 1I made my lunch the day before and carried it on a small tupperware (how are these called?)Wasn&#x27;t as great as fresh food but at least I made sure it was healthy. reply throwawayfear 1This is just a description of your lack of discipline. Since the pandemic, I lost a significant amount of weight and increased my fitness across all other parameters as well. This is because remote work facilitated that. If you need to work in an office in order to get up to make a coffee or to ask for help or to \"make consensus\" then that&#x27;s a you problem. reply esafak 1A lot of people don&#x27;t know how to cook. Maybe the company offered access to a gym too. The \"you problem\" could be doing a lot of lifting here.I can cook but I appreciated not having to think about it, and the food was great. reply spookthesunset 1If you don’t like remote work, it’s always “your problem” somehow. Everybody has to like remote work, I guess. And if they don’t it means they are flawed somehow.It’s kinda nuts the lengths people to go put down those who simply hate working at home 40 hours a week. reply ricardo81 1It&#x27;s weird seeing all this content the past 3+ years about remote working as I&#x27;ve worked remotely for 20+ years. I&#x27;m not an authority on the matter (why would I be), just weird to see so much &#x27;authority content&#x27; on it lately.Maybe there are more granular and data-driven conclusions, I&#x27;m just someone who sees the benefit of communicating information over vast distances aka the web and appreciate that it&#x27;s something we can do nowadays.A message, SMS, phone call, a group call, a skype call or whatever can clear things up right quick.Plenty times I&#x27;ll send someone an email because I don&#x27;t want to engage with someone and the time frame of their reply can be minutes or days. That&#x27;s fine.WFH&#x2F;remote is all about trust from an employer and motivation by an employee.You&#x27;re entirely free to communicate as much as you need to whether you&#x27;re physically present or not. The work gets done or it does not.I don&#x27;t really understand the confusion about this. reply goalonetwo 1>>> It&#x27;s weird seeing all this content the past 3+ years about remote working as I&#x27;ve worked remotely for 20+ y",

    "originBody": "Simple Thoughts All Posts Tags Categories About Non-determinism in GPT-4 is caused by Sparse MoE What the title says 152334H included in tech  August 5, 2023  1701 words   8 minutes  CONTENTS Are you really sure it isn’t hardware? Empirical Results Yes, I’m sure Implications We’re so far behind GPT-3.5-Turbo may be MoE too Conclusion It’s well-known at this point that GPT-4/GPT-3.5-turbo is non-deterministic, even at temperature=0.0. This is an odd behavior if you’re used to dense decoder-only models, where temp=0 should imply greedy sampling which should imply full determinism, because the logits for the next token should be a pure function of the input sequence & the model weights. When asked about this behaviour at the developer roundtables during OpenAI’s World Tour, the responses of the members of technical staff were something along the lines of, Honestly, we’re confused as well. We think there might be some bug in our systems, or some non-determinism in optimized floating point calculations… And internally, I was thinking – okay, I know the latter point is true sometimes, and maybe OpenAI doesn’t have enough engineers to look into a problem as small as this. I felt a little bit confused when I noticed a reference to this behavior over 3 years ago – 3 years, and this couldn’t be fixed? But I didn’t have a meaningful alternative explanation for the phenomenon. After all, why would you want to keep things random? Ilya’s always going on about reliability, right? There was no way OpenAI wanted to keep determinism bugged, so an unresolvable hardware limitation was the best explanation. 3 months later, reading a paper while on board a boring flight home, I have my answer. In the recent Soft MoE paper, there was an interesting blurb in Section 2.2 that sparked a connection: Under capacity constraints, all Sparse MoE approaches route tokens in groups of a fixed size and enforce (or encourage) balance within the group. When groups contain tokens from different sequences or inputs, these tokens often compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers. As a consequence, the model is no longer deterministic at the sequence-level, but only at the batch-level, as some input sequences may affect the final prediction for other inputs It is currently public knowledge that GPT-4 is a Mixture of Experts model. Given that GPT-4 was trained before Q2 2022, and that Sparse Mixture-of-Experts have existed long before that, I think the following hypothesis is justified: The GPT-4 API is hosted with a backend that does batched inference. Although some of the randomness may be explained by other factors, the vast majority of non-determinism in the API is explainable by its Sparse MoE architecture failing to enforce per-sequence determinism. This is either completely wrong, or something that was already obvious and well-known to people developing MoE models. How can we verify this? Are you really sure it isn’t hardware? Not yet. Let’s ask GPT-4 to write a script to test our hypothesis: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 import os import json import tqdm import openai from time import sleep from pathlib import Path chat_models = [\"gpt-4\", \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"] message_history = [ {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}, {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Write a unique, surprising, extremely randomized story with highly unpredictable changes of events.\"} ] completion_models = [\"text-davinci-003\", \"text-davinci-001\", \"davinci-instruct-beta\", \"davinci\"] prompt = \"[System: You are a helpful assistant]\\n\\nUser: Write a unique, surprising, extremely randomized story with highly unpredictable changes of events.\\n\\nAI:\" results = [] import time class TimeIt: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name def __enter__(self): self.start = time.time() def __exit__(self, *args): print(f\"{self.name} took {time.time() - self.start} seconds\") C = 30 # number of completions to make per model N = 128 # max_tokens # Testing chat models for model in chat_models: sequences = set() errors = 0 # although I track errors, at no point were any errors ever emitted with TimeIt(model): for _ in range(C): try: completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create( model=model, messages=message_history, max_tokens=N, temperature=0, logit_bias={\"100257\": -100.0}, # this doesn't really do anything, because chat models don't domuch ) sequences.add(completion.choices[0].message['content']) sleep(1) # cheaply avoid rate limiting except Exception as e: print('something went wrong for', model, e) errors += 1 print(f\"\\nModel {model} created {len(sequences)} ({errors=}) unique sequences:\") print(json.dumps(list(sequences))) results.append((len(sequences), model)) # Testing completion models for model in completion_models: sequences = set() errors = 0 with TimeIt(model): for _ in range(C): try: completion = openai.Completion.create( model=model, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=N, temperature=0, logit_bias = {\"50256\": -100.0}, # prevent EOS ) sequences.add(completion.choices[0].text) sleep(1) except Exception as e: print('something went wrong for', model, e) errors += 1 print(f\"\\nModel {model} created {len(sequences)} ({errors=}) unique sequences:\") print(json.dumps(list(sequences))) results.append((len(sequences), model)) # Printing table of results print(\"\\nTable of Results:\") print(\"Num_Sequences\\tModel_Name\") for num_sequences, model_name in results: print(f\"{num_sequences}\\t{model_name}\") This final script is a little different from what you’d see if you clicked on the share link. I had to redo the script a few times along the way, because of a few problems: the OpenAI API was taking very long to respond. I had to add timestamp logging to check I wasn’t doing something wrong – I wasn’t, the API was simply really slow, with nearly 10 seconds of delay to call even 3.5 turbo. I wonder why? some completion models were truncating their responses very early. I added a logit bias against EOS to try to fix this. Related: there is no equivalent bias against thetoken; the API returns, Invalid key in 'logit_bias': 100265. Maximum value is 100257. 100265 is the accurate value for : I figured this lack-of-logit-bias problem for the chat models was a non-issue – most completions reached the max token length, and they were absurdly more non-deterministic anyway (adding the logit bias would realistically only increase the number of unique sequences) An hour of waiting and scripting later, and I got confirmation: Empirical Results Here are the results (3 attempts, N=30, max_tokens=128): Model Name Unique Completions (/30) Average (/30) Notes gpt-4 12,11,12 11.67gpt-3.5-turbo 4,4,3 3.67text-davinci-003 3,2,4 3.00text-davinci-001 2,2,2 2.00davinci-instruct-beta 1,1,1 deterministic Outputs deteriorated into repeated loop davinci 1,1,1 deterministic Outputs deteriorated into repeated loop Before I noticed the logit_bias problem, I also obtained the following results (max_tokens=256): Model Name Unique Completions (/30) Notes gpt-4 30gpt-3.5-turbo 9text-davinci-003 5text-davinci-001 2 Noticed the logit bias problem at this point Yes, I’m sure The number of unique completions from GPT-4 is ridiculously high – practically always non-deterministic with longer outputs. This almost certainly confirms that something is up with GPT-4. Additionally, all other models that do not collapse into a repetitive useless loop experience some degree of non-determinism as well. This lines up with the public claim that unreliable GPU calculations are responsible for some degree of randomness. However, I’m still partially confused by the gradual increase in randomness from text-davinci-001 up to gpt-3.5-turbo. I don’t have a neat explanation for why 003 is reliably more random than 001, or turbo more so than 003. Although I expect only the chat models to be MoE models, and not any of the 3.5 completion models, I don’t feel confident based on the current evidence available. This is only evidence that something is causing GPT-4 to be much, much more non-deterministic than other models. Maybe I’m still completely wrong about the MoE part. Maybe it’s just because of parameter count. (but then – why would Turbo be more unpredictable than davinci? Turbo’s faster; if you assumed the same architecture, Turbo ought to be smaller) Implications It’s actually pretty crazy to me, that this looks true. For a few reasons: We’re so far behind If the non-determinism is an inherent feature of batched inference with Sparse MoE, then this fact should be visibly obvious to anyone that works with models in that vein. Given that the vast majority of GPT-4 users still have no idea what is causing their API calls to be unreliable, it should be concluded that (I am completely wrong, OR) too few people know anything about MoE models to launch this explanation into the public consciousness. It implies that Google Deepmind knew, and found it trivial enough to write as a throwaway sentence in a paper. It implies that I should be a lot more bullish on them, and a lot more bearish against every other wannabe foundation model org that’s still working on dense models only. GPT-3.5-Turbo may be MoE too I heard a rumour, once, about 3.5-turbo sharing the same architecture as GPT-4; just with much much less parameters than it, or even GPT-3. And, when I heard it, I was thinking: Nah, that sounds too complicated for a small public model. Why wouldn’t they just use a dense one? Fits on one GPU, no complexity overhead, really simple to optimise… Fast forward to now, and we’re still suffering a regime where it takes 70B parameters to meet Turbo’s performance – a number which just doesn’t make sense for how much traffic OpenAI’s handling, and how much speed they get. It’s also easy to notice that Turbo is the only other model in the API that has its logprobs restricted from public view. The common explanation was that they were restricted to prevent increased accuracy in distillation, something which sounds a little bit naive today given Orca and others. OpenAI has also publicly stated that they’re working on getting the logprobs integrated into ChatCompletions, making “prevent distillation” less likely than “this is hard to engineer reliably because they’re inherently too random right now”: But, still, as I said earlier – not fully confident on this one. Maybe someone should open a prediction market? Conclusion Everyone knows that OpenAI’s GPT models are non-deterministic at temperature=0 It is typically attributed to non-deterministic CUDA optimised floating point op inaccuracies I present a different hypothesis: batched inference in sparse MoE models are the root cause of most non-determinism in the GPT-4 API. I explain why this is a neater hypothesis than the previous one. I empirically demonstrate that API calls to GPT-4 (and potentially some 3.5 models) are substantially more non-deterministic than other OpenAI models. I speculate that GPT-3.5-turbo may be MoE as well, due to speed + non-det + logprobs removal.

This is very much by design (as they&#x27;re faster than their deterministic counterparts), and I mostly just take issue with how parent phrased this as a bug caused by bad code. reply Tunabrain GPUs are deterministic machines, even for floating point.The behavior in the linked article has to do with the use of atomic adds to reduce sums in parallel. Floating point addition is not associative, so the order in which addition occurs matters. When using atomic adds this way, you get slightly different results depending on the order in which threads arrive at the atomic add call. It&#x27;s a simple race condition, although one which is usually deemed acceptable. reply n2d4 I just edited my comment while you were writing your comment to add an explanation. The point here is that some primitives in eg. cudNN are non-deterministic. Whether you classify that as a race condition or not is a different question; but it&#x27;s intended behaviour. reply xyzzy_plugh Right but that&#x27;s not an inherent GPU determinism issue. It&#x27;s a software issue.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;issues&#x2F;3103#issueco... is correct that it&#x27;s not necessary, it&#x27;s a choice.Your line of reasoning appears to be \"GPUs are inherently non-deterministic don&#x27;t be quick to judge someone&#x27;s code\" which as far as I can tell is dead wrong.Admittedly there are some cases and instructions that may result in non-determinism but they are inherently necessary. The author should thinking carefully before introducing non-determinism. There are many scenarios where it is irrelevant, but ultimately the issue we are discussing here isn&#x27;t the GPU&#x27;s fault. reply n2d4 What I&#x27;m saying is \"there are non-deterministic primitives\", not \"there are no deterministic primitives\". reply xyzzy_plugh Yes, and `gettimeofday` is a non-deterministic primitive. There is nothing special about GPUs here. If you write tests that fail sometimes because you used non-deterministic primitives like gettimeofday and someone files a bug we don&#x27;t throw up our hands and say \"this is not a bug but due to how CPUs work.\" We remove the non-deterministic bit.There&#x27;s no difference here. This isn&#x27;t a GPU problem. reply cpgxiii Except the issue is inextricably linked to GPUs. All of the work in practical DNNs exists because of the extreme parallel performance available from GPUs, and that performance is only possible with non-deterministic threading. You can&#x27;t get reasonable training and inference time on existing hardware without it. reply d0mine 1000 threads can run in parallel. It doesn&#x27;t prevent us to sum their results deterministically: results = ThreadPool(workers=1000).imap_unordered(calc, inputs) print(math.fsum(results))Due to the magic of the fsum alg, the result is deterministic whatever order we get results in. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.python.org&#x2F;3&#x2F;library&#x2F;math.html#math.fsum reply cpgxiii That&#x27;s not the operation being performed on GPUs that is the problem. The issue is that fundamentally GPUs allow for high performance operations using atomics, but this comes at the cost of nondeterministic results. You can get deterministic results but doing so comes with a significant performance costs. reply xiphias2 Using atomics is easier than warp operations (using warp shuffle for example), but warp shuffle is quite fast.I guess if determinism is so important implementations can be changed, it is just maybe not that high priority. reply WithinReason That summation is slow and would not be used in practice.You could use just one thread on your 10000 thread GPU too and it would be deterministic, sure. Completely beside the point. reply WanderPanda In my experience cuBLAS is deterministic, since matmul is the most intensive part I don‘t see other reasons for non-determinism other than sloppyness (at least when just a single GPU is involved) reply danieldk 20 Yeah. In curated transformers [1] we are seeing completely deterministic output across multiple popular transformer architectures on a single GPU (there can be variance between GPUs due to different kernels). Of course, it completely depends on what ops and implementations you are using. But most transformers do not use ops that are typically non-deterministic to be fast (like scatter-add).One non-determinism we see with a temperature of 0 is that once you have quantized weights, many predicted pieces will have the same probability, including multiple pieces with the highest probability. And then the sampler (if you are not using a greedy decoder) will sample from those pieces. So, generation is non-deterministic with a temperature of 0.In other words, a temperature of 0 is a poor man’s greedy decoding. (It is totally possible that OpenAI’s implementation switches to a greedy decoder with a temperature of 0).[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;explosion&#x2F;curated-transformersDeathArrow If the hardware is deterministic, so are the results. You can&#x27;t generate random numbers purely in software with deterministic hardware. reply WithinReason The behaviour of atomic operations is definitely not deterministic. E.g. if you have a lot of atomic adds, every time you run the code you&#x27;ll get a different result without a random number generator. reply jiggawatts Read the article you linked.It literally says that the GPU is deterministic, the NVIDIA libraries on top are deterministic, but it is Tensorflow that introduces variability (errors!) for “performance”.My argument is that it is the AI&#x2F;ML code that is introducing non-determinism, usually by sacrificing repeatability to gain performance.That&#x27;s precisely what&#x27;s happening here. Tensorflow introduced a \"harmless\"[1] data race to improve performance by not having to use a deterministic but slower algorithm.The individual floating point computations are deterministic, it&#x27;s the multi-threaded design on top that&#x27;s introducing the variability in the output.[1] Used to be harmless, but cutting corners like this will make it nigh impossible to repeatably validate the safety of future models like GPT5. That seems pretty dangerous... reply n2d4 As the article says, cuBLAS is deterministic, but other CUDA primitives (eg. some of those in cudNN) are not.Yes, the non-determinism is being introduced somewhere, but that is splitting hairs. The point is that the primitives that you work with on GPUs are non-deterministic by design.I mostly take issue with you phrasing it as a bug and using it to insult the authors. reply xyzzy_plugh How is that splitting hairs?> The point is that the primitives that you work with on GPUs are non-deterministic by design.This is just blatantly wrong. There are _some_ operations that can be non-deterministic in some scenarios but they are not necessary.GPUs are deterministic. If you ask them to add a million floats in order, you get the same result every time. If you ask them to add a million floats in some arbitrary order, then you may get different results every time. The distinction is that someone had to ask the GPU to do that. It&#x27;s a choice.> I mostly take issue with you phrasing it as a bug and using it to insult the authors.It&#x27;s a bug, whether it insults the authors or not is irrelevant. It&#x27;s most definitely a bug. reply spott Basically any parallel map-reduce operation using non-commutative reduce operators[0] is non-deterministic unless you specifically sort after&#x2F;during the gather, or block on the gather (and gather to a thread-determined memory location). Sorting and blocking takes time. If you remove the sort&#x2F;block, you will get a non-deterministic answer when operating on floats for a wide variety of reduce operations, but it will be faster. This is true of any parallel map-reduce, done anywhere (MPI, cuda kernels, openMP, spark, etc.), and is not unique to gpus&#x2F;cuda.> If you ask them to add a million floats in order, you get the same result every time.There are a bunch of ways to add a million floats in order on a gpu, but they will all get you different results.:* split the million floats into ‘n’ chunks, each chunk is summed, then you sum the ‘n’ results. * if you sum results as they are gathered (you don’t need to block) you will get a non-deterministic result, as the threads finishing (outside of a warp) is non-deterministic in order. * if you change ‘n’, your result will change. * if you sort after gathering , your result will change.TLDR: parallel race-conditions are nondeterministic. Map-reduce has an underlying race-condition that you can prevent, but it costs time&#x2F;performance. Sometimes you don’t care about the non-determinism enough to pay the performance penalty to fix it.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;research&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;... reply dlkf 31 Your comment, along with cpgxiii and n2d4’s are all really good. I have a question: suppose training and inference of an LLM were made to be deterministic at the cost of performance.Would the cost be “everything will take twice as long” or would it be more like “inference will take a week and training will take a couple lifetimes”?If it’s the latter, then it seems disingenuous to call this a “bug.” It’s like saying F1 cars could be horse drawn, and they only use internal combustion for “performance reasons.” If its the former, then maybe there is a more interesting discussion to be had about the potential benefits of determinism? (That said, I agree with n2d4 that it’s stupid to insult the authors. Talk is cheap and building is hard.) replyjohndough The PyTorch documentation has an entire section about how to make your code deterministic. In my experience, the performance difference is negligible.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pytorch.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stable&#x2F;notes&#x2F;randomness.html#avoidi...Unfortunately, determinism across devices or even driver versions is not that easy. You&#x27;d have to write your own BLAS kernels using only basic operations, which are guaranteed to follow IEEE 754 semantics.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.nvidia.com&#x2F;cuda&#x2F;floating-point&#x2F;index.htmlOne gotcha are fused multiply-adds, which the compiler may or may not introduce, so you have to wrap all your floating point operations with __fma* intrinsics to make sure the compiler does not interpret them differently. reply nextaccountic As far as I can tell this article doesn&#x27;t explain why this happens on the GPU (for example, why Tensorflow&#x27;s reduce_sum is non-deterministic). My hypothesis is that this is entirely due to concurrency: if the same code can be run in two or more different interleavings, they can produce different results. This is corroborated by the first answer here [0].If so, this exact same issue happens in CPU code as well: have two or more threads, run the program many times, observe different interleavings that expose race conditions which (depending on the algorithm) may or may not produce different results. This can happen even if you don&#x27;t use floating point, and has nothing to do with floating point non-determinism itself. For example, have a thread print \"Hello\" and another thread print \"World\"; even without tearing, you may see either Hello World or World Hello on the screen.Now, proper floating point non-determinism happens in two cases. One is that when you run the same code in two different architectures you could have different answers (because of rounding modes, or because some architecture doesn&#x27;t support subnormal numbers or signaling nans, because transcedental functions like sine are implemented with different accuracy, etc). In this case it&#x27;s deterministic when run the same in the same machine, but may run differently in another machine with a different architecture.The other case is that some \"optimizations\" actually break your code if applied carelessly (you enable those broken optimizations with -ffast-math in C for example). Among other things, this may break numerical stability of algorithms like Kahan summation. And, if you let the compiler decide which exact optimizations will be applied and in what order, you get non-determinism between different compilers. So in this case it&#x27;s deterministic when compiled with the same compiler, but may run differently with another compiler.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;50744565&#x2F;how-to-handle-n... reply ascar To nitpick in addition to the already existing comments: this has nothing to do with GPUs per se. You would see the same issue in multithreaded code on a CPU. Even on a single core CPU this can happen with a multithreaded program depending on how the OS schedules and interrupts the threads. It just happens to be an implementation choice in a GPU library&#x2F;API. reply zx14 There isn&#x27;t much of a culture around code quality in ML &#x2F; AI &#x2F; DS. reply PeterisP It&#x27;s not a code quality issue, there are ways to ensure determinism (sometimes you just need to set a flag), however, they are intentionally explicitly not used in order to gain performance. reply benreesman I don’t know about how insulting it is, I don’t like rushing things out but we’ve all had to.People are rushing like crazy to get there first with X for AI all over the place, it would be pretty shocking if there weren’t wires sticking out everywhere.I don’t think that says anything positive or negative about the hackers involved. reply jes5199 it’s basically always reasonable to insult someone’s code because we are computer programmers and we know what we have done reply DeathArrow So you can generate true random numbers using just the GPU parallelism? Consider me impressed! reply WithinReason Yes you can, and it&#x27;s been done:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11071-015-2287-7 reply xyzzy_plugh You&#x27;ve moved the goal posts. You&#x27;re conflating CUDA with GPUs. From Wikipedia:> CUDA (or Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a proprietary and closed source parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (GPUs) for general purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU). CUDA is a software layer that gives direct access to the GPU&#x27;s virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements, for the execution of compute kernels.Is the issue we&#x27;re discussing because of the GPU or is it because of choices made in software libraries?The parent is right, there is a deterministic, reproducible way to solve these problems, so if determinism is a desired or expected property, then this is a bug. It&#x27;s not an inherent problem like you make it out to be. The fact that \"workarounds\" are given in what you link prove this. reply KolenCh What you said can be violated when parallelism is involved. One such example is that we know some floating point operations such as addition and multiplication are non-commutative, hence it depends on order of execution to complete reduction for example. And then in parallel situation, some implementation will make the order or reduction non-deterministic (for performance reason) and hence the final result also non-deterministic. reply toxik Minor nit but commutative is the wrong term. Floats always obey a+b == b+a, but not associativity: (a+b)+c != a+(b+c). reply DeathArrow It&#x27;s still deterministic even if the results appear not to be. If you have memory, CPU cache, CPU registers in the same state, you will get the very same results. You need a source of entropy for the results to be non deterministic. reply namibj Actually, clock domain crossing for asynchronous clocks (as is AFAIK typical for granular dynamic frequency scaling, like running CPU cores at individual frequencies instead of all at the same, because it quite softly smoothes over to any new target frequency to prevent glitches) implicitly includes thermal noise in the raw transistors that determine which of the two involved clock edges happened earlier (a decision that eventually ends up truly random when they are at (almost) exactly the same time). And this is involved in even L3 hit latency. reply WithinReason Sure, but they will never be in the same state, which can even be used as a source of entropy: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;s11071-015-2287-7 reply dwpdwpdwpdwpdwp Mathematically, computation is deterministic. The author dismisses or ignores the many ways that the physical apparatus driving the computation can force the result of a software application to be a function of time.Calling GetTimeOfDay() could do it.Clock frequency drift between multiple processors could it. reply water9 When theory fails to consult reality. reply DeathArrow On a large scale, not having memory with good ECC is enough to have entropy. reply neatze hmm, how, I wonder if Alhazen’ s Circular Billiard Problem[1] results for n steps in simulation will be same for multiple runs.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forumgeom.fau.edu&#x2F;FG2012volume12&#x2F;FG201216.pdf reply alexnewman Small nit. You mean errors due to floating point math reply gojomo Not sure I understand the excerpt from the referenced paper.Is it saying that part of its more-efficient inferencing relies on mixing tokens from completely-separate inputs – eg, from other users? And then, depending on what other inputs chance into the same grouping, the relative assignment-to-&#x27;experts&#x27; varies, and thus the eventual completions?If so, I&#x27;d see that as not just introducing non-determinism, but also potentially making the quality of your responses dependent on how-many-concurrent-requests are fighting for the same expert-allocations.(For example, maybe the parts of the system best at translating&#x2F;interpreting Hindi give worse results during peak usage hours-of-the-day in India, when the most concurrent inputs are competing for that same competence.)Perhaps also, this is another possible explanation for perceived quality-degradation over time. When certain tests were reliably succeeding earlier, there was less congestion for the relevant &#x27;experts&#x27;. Now, with more concurrent use, those same tests aren&#x27;t as reliably winning as much of relevant &#x27;experts&#x27; effort.This may also suggest a bit of a quagmire: on whatever domains some sub-experts seem impressively good, initially, even more proportionate use will be attracted. But such new congestion means all the copycat use no longer gets the same expert allocations – and thus the initially-impressive performance degrades.(And if the effect is strong, & known-but-undisclosed-by-OpenAI, does it amount to a bait-and-switch? Attract users with unrepresentative excellence on an initially-uncongested Mixture-of-Experts system, but then offer them the lower-quality results from a more-congested system.) reply spott The results are showing essentially 12 unique responses from 30 tries… not what you would expect from mixing tokens.I think it groups the batch up differently, so if I have a batch of 10, and it groups it up into 2 groups of 5, if my prompt makes it to the second group or 1st group I get a different answer. But if I’m in the same location in the batch, then I get the same answer.The whole batch is deterministic given the same batch (sequences and ordering), but if you shuffle the batch then you lose that determinism. reply albystein this seems like a plausible outcome, and if true could spell disaster for OpenAI models relative to the competition and open source models. Currently, reliability is one of the core obstacles preventing widespread adoption of LLMs in many business critical workflows. And if these rumors, that GPT-4 is inherently un-deterministic and unreliable, are true then most enterprises are better off finetuning open source LLMs—which are just as capable—for their specific domains. they stand to gain better performance that way anyways, as domain-specific models will always outperform generalist ones reply mrtranscendence > And if these rumors, that GPT-4 is inherently un-deterministic and unreliable, are true then most enterprises are better off finetuning open source LLMs—which are just as capableWait, am I misunderstanding you? I feel like I&#x27;ve had a head injury or something, because I&#x27;ve never heard of an open source LLM that&#x27;s as capable as GPT-4 (in most scenarios). reply visarga Only on specific domains, these models don&#x27;t become generalists like GPT-4, they can become task experts for a single task. reply geysersam > domain-specific models will always outperform generalist onesThat&#x27;s only true assuming you habe enough data to train a domain-specific model &#x2F; expertise to train it and test it correctly.I&#x27;ve encountered cases where an image recognition task could be accomplished well with a very general model like CLIP, but people still fine-tuned another model on their own small data set because that&#x27;s considered better.A domain specific model might be more likely to fail on weird outliers not present in the small domain specific training data.> could spell disaster for OpenAINah I don&#x27;t think so. They are not all in on one specific model architecture. If the current architecture is found to have serious unfixable flaws then they&#x27;ll just change architecture. reply og_kalu >as domain-specific models will always outperform generalist onesThis is not even close to true for Language models. reply alpark3 _If_ 3.5 is a MoE model, doesn&#x27;t that give a lot of hope to open source movements? Once a good open source MoE model comes out, maybe even some type of variation of the decoder models available(I don&#x27;t know whether MoE models have to be trained from scratch), that implies a lot more can be done with a lot less. reply 152334H I agree, and really hope that Meta is doing something in that vein. Reducing the FLOPs:Memory ratio (as in Soft MoE) could also open the door to CPU (or at least Apple Silicon) inference becoming more relevant. reply osmarks It would be bad for single-consumer-GPU inference setups. reply Me1000 Not an expert (no pun intended), but MoE where each expert is actually just a LoRA adaptor on top of the base model gets me pretty excited. Since LoRA adaptors can be swapped in and out at runtime, it might be possible to get decent performance without a lot of extra memory pressure. reply arugulum While MoE-LoRAs are exciting in themselves, they are a very different pitch from full on MoEs. If the idea behind MoEs is that you want completely separate layers to handle different parts of the input&#x2F;computation, then it is unlikely that you can get away with low-rank tweaks to an existing linear layer. reply worldsayshi Could this work well with distributed solutions like petals?https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bigscience-workshop&#x2F;petalsI don&#x27;t understand how petals can work though. I thought LLMs were typically quite monolithic. reply osmarks 1I feel like this introduces the potential for weird and hard-to-implement side channel attacks, if the sequences in a batch can affect the routing of others. reply tehsauce 1I think you’re right. Would be very hard to exploit I imagine though. reply catchnear4321 the tools available to imagine such things are limited today.the language models in our heads have not caught up to the ones in our browsers.as the similarities and associations crystallize a bit better, it won’t look so hard.bookmark this if you think it bullshit. eight months. reply derwiki Hard like building a virtual machine in an image decoder? If there’s a way there’s a will. reply adql Same thing was said about Spectre-like bugs reply pazimzadeh Mixture of Experts reply TechBro8615 Thanks. I assumed it was Margin of Error. The article doesn&#x27;t expand the acronym until midway through the post, where it appears almost accidentally. Perhaps the intended audience is a mixture of experts, of which I&#x27;m not a part. reply mst 30 I suspect the article is written primarily to be clear to people sufficiently immersed in the relevant areas to be able to have a concrete opinion on the theory.Also I strongly suspect that at least in the case of -me-, an article that was easier for me to understand wouldn&#x27;t make the underlying theory any easier for me to judge.(on the upside, at least I -did- understand and appreciate your self deprecating pun :) reply airstrike Thank you! I knew it couldn&#x27;t mean \"Merger of Equals\"... but then again, if those experts are equals, then maybe that acronym also works ;-) reply f1shy I see in the comments it seems to be a huge miss understanding between 2 uses of “non-deterministic”: 1) from normal English: cannot be determined beforehand (results may vary) 2) from theory of computation: loosely “parallel computation” (unknown path to the solution) reply PeterisP For floating point math, there&#x27;s no distinction, as \"parralel computation with unknown path to the solution\" inherently implies \"results will vary\", as (a+b)+c != a+(b+c). reply cainxinth I asked GPT to explain this:>In the MoE approach, different \"experts\" or portions of the model are selected for different parts of the input data. The selection of which experts to use can be influenced by several factors, including the specific content of the input data, the order in which data is processed in a batch, and possibly even minor variations in the internal state of the model.>This \"expert selection\" process introduces a level of stochasticity, or randomness, into the model&#x27;s operation. For example, if you process the same input data twice in slightly different contexts (e.g., as part of different batches), you might end up consulting slightly different sets of experts, leading to slightly different outputs. reply hyperthesis MoE: Mixture of Experts reply ShamelessC There’s a comment that’s 3 hours older than yours that clarifies this. reply hyperthesis I searched for MoE in the comments and didn&#x27;t see it. ah, you must mean this one https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37006549, which doesn&#x27;t include \"MoE\", so that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t find it. Still, my comment&#x27;s upvotes show it was helpful to some - maybe they searched for \"MoE\" too, instead of \"mixture of experts\". reply throwawayadvsec \"these tokens often compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers. \" So is this also why ChatGPT is often just writing placeholders in place of functions when I ask him for some long code? reply DeathArrow Well, a colleague of mine managed to build a non deterministic GET REST API endpoint. :D reply icelancer How interesting. I was just discussing this last night with our analysts after I experimentally noticed that temp=0.0 (and all penalties&#x2F;top_p set accordingly) still showed non-determinate behavior. Wasn&#x27;t sure why this was, and now this article comes about.The explanation makes quite a bit of sense. reply afro88 > these tokens often compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers.Hold up, does this mean that under heavy load the results change? Does this explain why it sometimes feels like the output quality changes? reply refulgentis This is _excellent_ work, I&#x27;ve been adamantly against MoE for a set of reasons, this is the first compelling evidence I&#x27;ve seen that hasn&#x27;t been on Substack or a bare repeating of rumor.I had absolutely no idea GPT4 was nondeterministic and I use it about 2 hours a day. I can see why a cursory looking wasn&#x27;t cutting it, they \"feel\" the same in your memory, a lot of similar vocab usage, but are formatted entirely differently, and have sort of a synonym-phrase thing going where some of the key words are the same. reply 152334H Thanks. I&#x27;m really no expert (:P) on MoE research; I just noticed what was written in the Soft MoE paper and felt a need to check.The non-deterministic outputs are really similar, yeah, if you check the gist examples I linked https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;152334H&#x2F;047827ad3740627f4d37826c867a.... This part is at least no surprise, since the randomness should be bounded.I suspect OpenAI will figure out some way to reduce the randomness at some point, though, given their public commitment to eventually adding logprobs back to ChatCompletions. reply cubefox I don&#x27;t think this commitment had any plausibility. Token \"probabilities\" only have a straightforward probabilistic interpretation for base models. In fine-tuned models, they do no longer represent the probability of the next token given the prompt, but rather how well the next token fulfills the ... tendencies induced by SL and RL tuning. Which is presumably pretty useless information. OpenAI has no intention to provide access to the GPT-4 base model, and they in fact removed API access to the GPT-3.5 base model. reply refulgentis Topic laundering, the probabilities are the probabilities, you don&#x27;t suddenly get wrong probabilities with more training on more data reply goodside You do, because it’s not just more training it’s PPO updates instead of MLE. It’s no longer trying to estimate the token distribution of the training corpus, it’s trying to shift logprobs into tokens that maximize expected reward from the RM. The GPT-4 technical report has a figure showing that logprobs become less well calibrated as confidence scores in the RLHF vs pre-train model. reply refulgentis Fascinating, ty replyderwiki GPT4 web chat for two hours a day? I buy that. Using the API repeatedly for the same inputs, eg developing a program, and the non-determinism is hard to miss. reply sebzim4500 I would imagine that most people use nonzero temperature, so they won&#x27;t need to look for any explanation for non-determinism. reply dekhn Literally the first thing I did when I had llama.cpp working was set the temperature to 0 and repeat queries.(but that&#x27;s mainly because I&#x27;m a weird old scientist with lots of experience with nondeterminism in software). reply refulgentis I did too, Kmeans broke me a couple years ago: but, never temperature at 0 with long length, and trusted my instinct instead of actual diffs. This is was the first time I actually diffed reply phillipcarter Yeah, it&#x27;s one of the first things you notice when trying to do some kind of \"feed GPT some data and get it to produce a novel answer to a question\" task with the API. reply refulgentis No, because if you wanted a novel answer, why would you set 0 temperature? ;) reply FanaHOVA > I&#x27;ve been adamantly against MoE for a set of reasonsSuch as? reply lucubratory It was completely unsubstantiated, based on rumours from a blog, but everyone repeated it as fact. reply whimsicalism I think it is pretty compelling that almost all of the people doing research into switch transformers at Google were hired into OAI.

This is a habit I envy but don&#x27;t share.Any tips or sites for someone interested in picking up more science papers to read. reply jldugger For just getting started I recommend collections:1. Ideas That Created The Future[1]. It&#x27;s a collection of fiftyish classic CS papers, with some commentary.2. Wikipedia&#x27;s list[2].3. Test of Time awards[3]. These are papers that have been around for a while and people still think are important.4. Best paper awards[4]. Less useful than ToT as not every best paper is actually that good or important, and sometimes the award committees can&#x27;t see past names or brands for novel research.5. Survey Journals[5]. Students often get their research started with a literature review and some go the extra step to collect dozens of papers into a summary paper. I subscribe to the RSS feed for that one, and usually one or two are interesting enough to read.6. Citation mining -- As you read all these, consider their citation list as potential new reading material, or if an old paper leaves you wanting more, use Google Scholar to find a papers that cited what you just read.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Ideas-That-Created-Future-Computer&#x2F;dp...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_important_publications...[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usenix.org&#x2F;conferences&#x2F;test-of-time-awards[4]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jeffhuang.com&#x2F;best_paper_awards&#x2F;[5]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.acm.org&#x2F;journal&#x2F;csur reply puzzledobserver I&#x27;d like to disagree with this. In particular, about [1]: It is a collection of papers in many different topics. There is little technical overlap between Alan Turing&#x27;s Entscheidungsproblem paper, for instance, and Hoare&#x27;s paper on axiomatic semantics. Also, the papers are all from the 70s. They&#x27;re uniformly influential papers, and have shaped the field, but the fields and the vernacular used by working researchers is very different. At best, the papers approximate a four year undergrad curriculum in CS, and at worst, are a recipe to get distracted and overwhelmed. The link to Wikipedia [2] is somewhat better in that the papers appear to be more modern, but suffers even more from the problem of diversity.A somewhat similar problem arises with test-of-time and best paper awards. To elaborate on my complaint, imagine the exaggerated case of someone trying to understand modern science by intensely focusing on the work of researchers who won the Nobel Prize. Clearly all very important work, but understanding the 1990 Physics Nobel Prize (on electron-proton scattering) is of no use to understanding the work for which 1991 Nobel was awarded (complex systems and polymers).There are two things that (I&#x27;m assuming the OP&#x27;s field of interest is computing) a CS education provides: At the undergrad and in the early stages of grad school, breadth of topics, and their modern synthesis. You don&#x27;t spend much time reading papers (at least in an undergraduate education), but you understand the basics, and get a feel for the problems considered and the sensibilities of researchers. In an intermediate-level graduate seminar, you pick a narrow topic, and focus on papers in that topic. The first papers in the area (like Dijkstra&#x27;s papers on distributed computing), the best &#x2F; most important papers in the area, and the latest papers on topical interests (like Merkle trees and blockchains). There is thematic and technical continuity from one paper to the next, and you start to understand the the story being told. Then, late in graduate school, and in the rest of one&#x27;s professional career, one starts reviewing papers that haven&#x27;t even been published. At this point, you see the story being written: the steps and the missteps, and the memorable and not-so-memorable papers in a field. To truly understand a field, one needs to read not just the great papers, but also the middling ones.And one needs to concentrate on a topic. The thing about a forum such as HackerNews is that for every topic of interest, there&#x27;s likely a person here who&#x27;s an expert in the area, but it is easy to confuse that observation with the much stronger claim that there&#x27;s a person here who&#x27;s an expert on every topic. The last of those people died in the mid-20th century, if they ever existed. reply jldugger I feel like you&#x27;re giving advice on how to become a PhD student, and frankly, that&#x27;s not the point of the question, and if it is: any grad student who can&#x27;t read papers should ask their advisor for advice.So I take OP&#x27;s perspective to be from a practitioner (such as myself). Apart from my colleagues in R&D, we aren&#x27;t called upon to write new papers that demands expertise in ever increasing narrowness. Instead we are to solve the needs of the product, usually regardless of specific expertise. So we need to be more broadly equipped, as it&#x27;s typically better to have a screwdriver and a hammer and a screwdriver in the toolbox than a ten different screwdriver bits of varying niche application.As an example, the TD-IDF paper curated in [1] has been broadly useful as a log analysis tool to surface interesting log lines and remove the mundane common \"error\" logs. There&#x27;s been many advancements since then, using bayesian techniques or deep learning, but this one is simple enough and cheap enough to deploy. reply mst 24 Old ideas that were good but didn&#x27;t become common&#x2F;standard are something I run across a fair bit in papers and yeah, they&#x27;re often way behind the state of the art but also a lot easier for me to understand&#x2F;implement and far better than the relatively naive approach I&#x27;d&#x27;ve taken otherwise. reply jldugger From there, just keep a reading queue. If you notice a particular journal is a good source of material, consider subscribing to it. reply nerdponx > I noticed people from hacker news routinely read scientific papers.Do they? I suspect that most don&#x27;t, and those that do are either in specialized careers or are engaged in some kind of scientific research.Some interesting research gets disseminated via Twitter and chatrooms. Or maybe you follow a podcast that mentions new research. But you might also be following new publications from a handful of reputable journals, or following an Arxiv category, or looking through new conference papers. It&#x27;s very easy to get overwhelmed with new research to read, and not knowing what&#x27;s worth your time, unless you&#x27;re already very familiar with the field and well-versed in the material. reply i-use-nixos-btw I strongly agree.Once upon a time, I was in condensed matter physics. I was (and remain) interested in a very specific niche within that, and I read a small handful of the papers that were published each week. I’m not actively researching or publishing anymore so I cap this to one or two per month now, and mostly scan over them to see if anything piques my interest.I was still interested in condensed matter as a whole, at the time, and attended group seminars once a month to see what other people were currently excited about - there wasn’t any hope of me reading a cross section of all condensed matter papers because there is far more published per week than I’d be physically able to even glimpse at, and most of it is stuff I don’t understand or particularly care about.I was likewise interested in physics as a whole, and twice a year I’d attend a departmental seminar and see what people in the entire department were interested in. Most was far over my head, but it still directed me to a small handful of papers that I’d read for the hell of it. Of course, I couldn’t do this without first hearing people review the research. There’s far more published per day in physics as a whole than I could read in a year, and most of it I’d find unrelatable and uninteresting.I guess where I’m going with this is that anyone with a specific interest is already reading papers. It’s their job. Anyone with a general interest would find actively pursing paper hunting to be a waste of time with a ridiculously bad signal to noise ratio. Instead, they should use channels that align closely with their own interests, through which they can get recommendations to read papers from the aforementioned specialists who have already filtered out much of the noise themselves. At that point, they should actually read the resulting papers.There is another trick, though, and that’s to find an individual who publishes two unrelated pieces of work that you find interesting, then read their work and maybe those of their coauthors. Be careful, though, because this is a slippery slope to specialising, after which you’ll find yourself back at the point where you don’t aren’t following 99.9% of the stuff you wanted to follow in the first place. reply MacsHeadroom Long time HN&#x27;er college dropout and I read a LOT of scientific papers. Probably an average of 4 a week over the past couple of decades, sometimes reading 40 in a week.I probably averaged 20 a week back in March when open source AI was booming in the wake of Llama and on the heels of GPT-4. reply CSMastermind I typically look up and read a paper when it&#x27;s referenced in discussion or cited in something else, I&#x27;m reading&#x2F;watching, and the purported contents seem surprising to me. This normally happens 3 or 4 times a week.Honestly many papers are written in a way that&#x27;s hard to approach and difficult to understand unless you&#x27;re prepared to reread them a few times.You&#x27;re better off just getting your science news from actual science communicators and not the raw source. reply allisdust Don&#x27;t read them for the sake of reading them. Read them to solve your current problem or trying to keep up with advancements in a narrow field you love. Most papers (especially the ones in deep learning) seem to also have a mathematical fetish (to put it mildly) where needless representations are used where none are required and are self evident (for example inputs belong to Real number set). It ends up making the paper pseudo complex and unapproachable. Most papers are doing average&#x2F;summation&#x2F;series operations but instead of just saying so, use the symbols all over the place. So even if a few papers appear tough, keep reading them and digest your first paper thoroughly. You will find subsequent papers mostly are a rehash of existing work with similar fetish to make trial and error appear like mathematically sound research. Once in a while, you would find some paper which is fully theoretical and try to prove that either the inputs&#x2F;outputs&#x2F;components of models have certain well known mathematical properties and hence can be reasoned similarly. These are rare and would be difficult to parse through.PS: Best papers I have seen are from deepmind where the approaches usually described are novel, varied and path breaking. Worst ones are - well no names but those that just use training and eval sets generated by GPT4 and try to prove things empirically reply LudwigNagasena > Most papers (especially the ones in deep learning) seem to also have a mathematical fetish (to put it mildly) where needless representations are used where none are required and are self evident (for example inputs belong to Real number set). It ends up making the paper pseudo complex and unapproachable.I completely disagree with that. Spelling out math is literally something out of 12th century. It just hinders understanding, if you have basic STEM-level math literacy, which anyone who reads an ML paper is implied to have (how could you seriously study linear algebra and calculus without it?).Math may actually be the first thing you recognise in a paper, which can help you cross-reference the text to understand it. reply mst 26 For computer science, https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.acolyer.org&#x2F; is called The Morning Paper and talks about one interesting paper per post.Edit: It seems to&#x27;ve gone on indefinite hiatus but there&#x27;s a lot of backlog already there and some of it&#x27;s really quite fascinating. reply brmgb > I noticed people from hacker news routinely read scientific papers.Highly doubt that. It’s very hard to actually read scientific papers when you are not actively doing research.You can’t just read a research paper in isolation. It’s next to useless. You need to understand its context, where it stands with regard to its sources and what it brings which is actually new and valuable. It’s nearly impossible to do properly if you are not fully immersed in a research subject.I don’t even know how you would scheme introduction and sources to filter articles which are immediately obviously useless without being immersed in a field.I guess you can obviously go though lists of papers which have be deemed worthwhile by someone else or got prices. That solves the filtering issue but then nearly every time you will be better served reading a text book presenting the ideas in said papers.I fully expect the HN readership to contain a significant amount of students and actual researchers which explain why you encounter people reading papers but these people aside I would be surprised if the habit is common. reply cypress66 You don&#x27;t need to be doing research to read an ML paper. With some general knowledge in AI you should be able to understand most papers.And even then, sometimes you don&#x27;t understand or care about their procedures, and you just want to look at the pretty results (check out this song they generated using AI!). There&#x27;s even a very popular YouTube channel that focuses on this (two minute papers).Finally, you usually hear about these cool papers via Twitter &#x2F; X reply brmgb > You don&#x27;t need to be doing research to read an ML paper. With some general knowledge in AI you should be able to understand most papers.I have a degree which involved reading some ML papers and I seriously doubt that. The field is flooded with papers which looks good when you quickly read them but are actually worthless because they misrepresent the state of the art or intentionally don’t compare their methods with other papers they should know.> And even then, sometimes you don&#x27;t understand or care about their procedures, and you just want to look at the pretty resultsThat’s fair but I wouldn’t call that reading a scientific paper. reply obblekk Build the habit.When google doesn&#x27;t return a good result to a specific question, switch to scholar.google.com and start reading abstracts. Everything may seem like an opaque maze at first, but just keep reading and patterns start emerging quickly and become useful. reply TechBro8615 I don&#x27;t mind reading research papers, but they&#x27;re really annoying to read on a phone screen. I remember a few years ago, an HN comment shared a link to some tool that could convert a PDF to single column text and make it more readable on a phone screen, but I can&#x27;t find it. Anyone remember this or have the link? reply jayshua I use an android (and iOS I think) app called Xodo. The \"reader mode\" re-flows the PDF into a screen-width single column like an e-book. The latest update really buried the option in the menus, but it&#x27;s there somewhere and works pretty well. reply segfaultbuserr > but they&#x27;re really annoying to read on a phone screen.+1. I&#x27;ve already read probably 100 research papers this year in search of solutions to some technical problems, mostly while lying on bed with a tablet. I won&#x27;t read as much without it. reply mst 21 Once phones got relatively big (i.e. &#x27;phablet&#x27; ceased to exist as a concept because that size was just &#x27;phone&#x27; now) I switched to using a 7&#x2F;8\" tablet with my SIM in it as my primary portable device (Nexus 7 and now Galaxy Tab A6).Means I have to carry it in my jacket pocket or a side pocket on my combats but the bigger phones weren&#x27;t comfortable in my trousers&#x27; top pocket anyway so for me at least the trade-off is well worth it. reply UltimateEdge The software KOReader [1] has a PDF reflow setting which you can try.[1] http:&#x2F;&#x2F;koreader.rocks&#x2F; reply michaelmrose How big is your phone screen and what are you using to read it? A few inches makes a lot of difference. In landscape mode my phone is 6.5\" wide and reading a pdf with moonreader in full screen because its wide enough to read without having to reformat anything. You can also click on figures to view only that figure.If that isn&#x27;t enough you might consider a tablet or e-reader instead of trying so hard to make existing options work.You CAN convert to something like epub which is trivially reflowed and this is just fine for reading fiction but just isn&#x27;t as pleasant and nicely formatted as a pdf. reply cpeterso Check out the papers and talks from Papers We Love, a \"repository of academic computer science papers and a community who loves reading them\":https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paperswelove.org&#x2F; reply eru It depends on why you want to read papers and what you want to get out of it.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37006967 suggested some avenues for finding some classic papers. The follow-up https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=37007360 pointed out some circumstances where that&#x27;s not ideal. But in the process, implicitly assumes that you want to become familiar with current research, instead of just enjoying classic papers for some other motivation.I mostly read papers in mathematics and computer science. For other disciplines I mostly rely on pop science, like Slate Star Codex or Money Stuff and blogs. There&#x27;s also The Monad Reader (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.haskell.org&#x2F;The_Monad.Reader) if you are interested in functional programming.There&#x27;s various blogs with interesting articles. Eg Vitalik Buterin has great stuff, like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vitalik.ca&#x2F;general&#x2F;2017&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;starks_part_1.html and he links to the original papers. (I have no conclusive opinions on whether crypto-currencies are useful or good for the real world, but I do find the math behind some of them endlessly fascinating. Especially zero-knowledge proofs.)Wikipedia is also often a good starting point. Whenever you read about a random topic, Wikipedia usually has an article that comes with plenty of references. Eg https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Forth_Bridge#References links to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bath.ac.uk&#x2F;ace&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;StudentProjects&#x2F;Bridgeconf... and down the rabbit hole you go.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gwern.net&#x2F; also has great write-ups and links to original papers. reply alecst Honestly a lot are really hard to read. You start with the easy ones, learn the lingo, and then just keep going. Eventually you can enjoy reading the harder ones.You learn pretty quickly that if you want answers, it&#x27;s better to just go straight to the source, rather than have it filtered through someone else, where the message can (and often does) get twisted.What are you interested in reading about? Maybe some people can recommend you some papers to start with. reply eru There are certainly easier and harder papers. Though when you are struggling: keep in mind that there are also papers that are just badly written (and some papers that are well written). reply quickthrower2 Pick ones that are easy to read. Some are written line a magazine article. Others are math dense, reference another paper you can’t get hold of every other sentence and are a kind of marketing material anyway.Also youtube and code: Attention is all you need is not a nice paper to read for Joe programmer, but you can understand what it is doing by watching karpathy and reading his code (or someone else who has implemented it, Llama for example). But you need to do some basic torch training first (karpathy again!) reply NalNezumi There are some materials about \"how to read scientific paper\", like the pdf one from U waterloo [3] with some methodological advice. Some good advice in this old HN thread [1]But I don&#x27;t see the point of reading a scientific paper unless you&#x27;re actually curious about a specific topic. They are often hard to read, dense, have so many field-specific jargon that if you&#x27;re new, you won&#x27;t be able to read one paper and grasp everything. You would have to read references, or a book&#x2F;blog that summaries core points.So find a specific field you&#x27;re interested in, find a good book&#x2F;blog&#x2F;homepage&#x2F;tutorial&#x2F;video to get your basics going so that when you start reading papers you won&#x27;t be completely lost.Then find a highly cited survey paper to understand what progress have been made beyond what is now basic. Then you can follow your curiously along that survey, decide a branch of research to read upon. You&#x27;ll probably then realize that a few labs research&#x2F;publish a lot in a specific direction. Now you can follow those professors (Twitter, Google scholar email notification) to keep up to date. By reading a lot you&#x27;ll also start to notice papers that are \"published just to get my PhD\" and soon enough you can just read abstract + intro&#x2F;result to judge if it is valuable or not.If ML&#x2F;LLM is your curiosity probably Lillian Wengs blog [2] is a good start for tutorials &#x2F; surveys.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24986727[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lilianweng.github.io&#x2F;Edit: direct link [3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.stanford.edu&#x2F;class&#x2F;ee384m&#x2F;Handouts&#x2F;HowtoReadPape... reply rgoldste Don’t feel like you need to understand 100%. You can always give yourself an hour to read a paper and gloss over some notation. If you read 5 papers over the course of a month, you can go back to your favorite and dive into the notation. reply necubi For me it&#x27;s very helpful to print out papers and read them with a pen in hand, away from my computer. Papers tend to be dense and require a level of focus that (I at least) cannot maintain when reading on a screen. It helps as well to able to easily take notes and annotate the paper. reply AnthonBerg Anyone can read scientific papers. All you need to do is pierce the layer of jargon. It takes practice but you kind of just pick it up. Reading on a computer helps because you can get words defined by clicking on them. Reading on paper is good too, it’s easier to keep at it and it sticks better.Some sense of urgency helps. Most people will have a medical ailment or physiological issue of some sort. I promise you that there exist useful papers on it. reply j7ake Feedly with keywords for your favorite topics or researchers works decently.I imagine this routine comes from people with research backgrounds, where browsing papers is the academic way of googling around for answers. reply obblekk Build the habit.When google doesn&#x27;t return a good result to a specific question, switch to scholar.google.com and start reading abstracts.

Not sure which computing analogy would drive home the complete recklessness of this mentality but the Earth is not something you can reboot to the last working state once you harebrained patch implodes.It is true that we have been slowly geoengineering for ages (initially unwittingly, recently with eyes wide open) and it is also true that our modeling abilities increase but this is quite far from making us experts in geoengineering.For the short term future (decades) the only strategy that seems to make sense on the face of epistemic uncertainty is to refrain from aggravating the situation while studying ever more deeply the system we are now perturbing so much.Our biggest mental deficiency when handling complexity is that we cant think holistically in practical ways. Isolating individual factors and applying linear thinking has worked wonders in isolated problems but it is not cutting it here. reply atoav It is very uncomplicated in fact:Most people here on HN are rationally capable of understanding the challenges humanity faces right now.What many aren&#x27;t capable of is accepting the conclusion that we all have to change the way we live and quite possibly even the way we organize society in order to mitigate the irreperable problems our way of living has already caused.Deep down they might suspect this is necessary, but it is much more comfortable to believe in a solution that is only technological and go on as we did. That is why discussions around such technological silver bullets are always toxic: people want to believe. reply fasterik 36 >That is why discussions around such technological silver bullets are always toxic: people want to believe.On the flip side, some people reject technological solutions on principle because for them, it&#x27;s not about solving problems, it&#x27;s about atoning for the sins of humanity.What does the alternative future look like where we solve the climate crisis by changing the way we live and organize society? Personally, I would prefer to continue having electricity, heat, running water, sewage treatment, shipping, transportation, and the internet. It seems to me that if we really wanted to, we could keep these things around while putting a substantial portion of GDP into building nuclear reactors and removing carbon from the atmosphere. But that&#x27;s not a satisfying answer for people who have made the climate crisis into a religious issue. reply jacquesm 4 Bluntly: far fewer people, sustainability built into every process, no more oil, very high cost for transportation unless it is by ship, personal transport will be very costly and you won&#x27;t do it unless you really have to. Think &#x27;1850&#x27; but with transistors. reply matsemann Especially since HNers mostly are the top top top earners in the world, having unsustainable lifestyles. No one likes to accept it can&#x27;t be like this forever. reply fasterik This doesn&#x27;t seem right. Most of the world&#x27;s new carbon emissions are coming from developing countries. On the other hand, the HN crowd is much more likely to live in dense cities (which are more climate friendly), have access to public transportation, drive electric cars, and can afford to pay for carbon offsets.The only thing unsustainable about the first world lifestyle is the fact that we don&#x27;t have the political will to invest in real solutions like nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, etc. reply matsemann 46 Well, you&#x27;re saying \"new carbon emissions\", of course those are coming from developing countries. It&#x27;s not the same statement as I said. And of course they should be allowed to improve their quality of life.My point is that an average HNer lives in a country where per capita co2 per person is >10x as much as the poorer countries. And since the average HNer is a well off person with a lavish lifestyle, international travels etc., it&#x27;s probably closer to 100x the amount of a person in a developing country.Either this lifestyle should only belong to us few and developing countries should remain developing. Or we need to cut back to a sustainable level everyone can share. Which is a reality people don&#x27;t want to face.> The only thing unsustainable about the first world lifestyle is the fact that we don&#x27;t have the political will to invest in real solutions like nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, etc.It&#x27;s not about \"political will\". Would you pay more for a product if it&#x27;s external effects were priced in? Probably not. Hence unsustainable. Our level of consumption is only possible because we don&#x27;t pay the true price, someone else is. reply fasterik 25 Carbon emissions per capita is going down in developed countries. It&#x27;s going up in developing countries. Your implication was that the current problem is the level of consumption in the richest countries. But in reality that only accounts for a small portion of the expected carbon emissions over the next century.We don&#x27;t need to \"cut back\" to a sustainable level. A sustainable level is whatever amount of energy we can produce without increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. If we built more nuclear, solar, and wind power, and invested more in carbon capture and storage, we could sustain a much higher level of consumption than we currently are, while emitting less carbon. reply matsemann 9 You&#x27;re kinda proving my point. Instead of facing reality as that would mean changes to your lifestyle, you want to keep on going as if nothing is happening and just hope technology will save us. reply fasterik 4 My argument is that your point isn&#x27;t based in reality. How is changing my lifestyle going to fix the problem when most of my power consumption is fueled by renewables, while most of the carbon emissions over the next 50 years are going to come from India and China?I&#x27;m not saying keep going as if nothing is happening. I&#x27;m saying the climate crisis is a real emergency, and the solution is to build more renewable energy and remove carbon from the atmosphere. matsemann 1 Because while your \"power\" consumption is mostly renewables (again, you arguing against something slightly different than what I write), it&#x27;s a small part of your total consumption. What about all the power China uses to build the things we in the west consume? That&#x27;s on your budget.lordnacho 48 > Most of the world&#x27;s new carbon emissions are coming from developing countries.Isn&#x27;t this because we&#x27;re paying them to make stuff for us? Or is there some accounting of this where its their own consumption that causes it? reply fasterik 21 It&#x27;s because they&#x27;re industrializing, have higher population growth, and are primarily building coal power plants to keep up with it. reply omnimus 38 Also why would developing countries have to limit carbon emissions more than non developing ones? reply CalRobert It&#x27;s really frustrating that I had to work really hard, study the right things, and get lucky to be able to afford to live somewhere my direct emissions are minimal. More people should be able to afford to live car free in well insulated homes. reply CalRobert I want everyone to be able to live in a well insulated flat powered by renewable energy walking and biking distance from their daily needs, and with public transport (and rarely-needed EV share) for the rest. Combined with a low meat low dairy diet and less disposable consumer junk it seems like we could get a long ways with an arguably better quality of life. Maybe work half time too. reply concordDance \"Stop eating nice food\" is a nonstarter, as is \"give up personal all weather mobility\", have these as a policy positions and we&#x27;ll get 3 degrees rises as those would be a smaller quality of life decrease for the average American. reply Loic 45 Replying here to your below comment because of the \"stack\" limit. You wrote \"I want to go to visit my friend Bob who lives 10 miles away but the rain is pouring down.\" as a justification for ownership of a car.We just went through 2 weeks of heavy rain here in Germany. I am only biking (not even an E-Bike) and what I did is just looked at the rain radar with a simple app, add a bit of buffer time, packed rain clothes in my bike bag and just go. I was only once a bit wet because I was too lazy to pull out my jacket as I came back home one evening.You will always find a good excuse to keep the apparent comfort of a car, but once you start to really bike on a regular basis, in my case, I found the bike way nicer, you bring movement in your life. It helps my health and my mood, which is a nice side effect. reply concordDance 40 I&#x27;m a biker, I commute to work via bike and mostly shop via bike.The car is still incredibly useful for rainy days, visiting friends or when I really don&#x27;t feel like tackling that hill to shop.Maybe you enjoy half an hour cycling in rain that&#x27;s going to last 6 hours, but I don&#x27;t. reply amrocha Meat != nice foodCars != all weather mobilityAnd if you really want a car get ready to pay 4x current prices because that&#x27;s what they actually cost without subsidies and free externalities reply concordDance While some meat eating being required for nice food is subjective, I&#x27;m struggling to see what the suggested alternative to cars for all weather personal mobility is. I want to go to visit my friend Bob who lives 10 miles away but the rain is pouring down. What do I do in a carless world?Btw: CO2 emission taxes, road taxes and congestion charges are a great idea. reply omnimus 40 This is what OP means by changing the way we live.Sorry but getting rained on a bit is least of our troubles. Imagine there are places like Netherlands where it rains all the time and people (including very old ones) bike around the city… reply teamonkey 49 The real problem is that your friend lives 10 miles away and you don’t have adequate public transportation, not that life without cars is impossible. reply concordDance 46 Public transportation still requires you to go to the bus stop in the rain.I&#x27;m also unsure what the proposed solution to Bob being 10 miles away is. Should I only make friends with people who work at the same place? reply californical 14 The solution is that Bob isn’t 10 miles away because the town is more dense. And carrying an umbrella to the tram or train stop 3 blocks away is easyatoav Are you sure the impact of \"everybody on earth lives in a well insulated flat\" on the earth climate and biodiversity is net positive? reply adaml_623 Who&#x27;s building that well insulated flat and where is the insulation coming from?I sometimes worry that the pyramid of infrastructure and labour required to create that flat is not scalable reply hkt 18 The thing that is galling is that we already have the technology to live sustainably if people do change their lifestyles. reply NoMoreNicksLeft Why would I accept that there&#x27;s this doomsday barreling towards us at high speed, and the only way to avoid it is economic devastation and serfdom for my grandchildren?That sounds an awful lot like a long con.Most rational people have arrived at the very reasonable conclusion that the more extreme the danger is, the more justified we are in attempting cutting edge countermeasures. So when the response we get back is \"oh no, you can&#x27;t do that, anything but that!\"... the more it sounds like it was a grift all along.This requires no conspiracy, by the way. Large groups of people can subconsciously coordinate in these ways without even realizing they&#x27;re doing it. Just takes a bit of groupthink and a small dab of neuroticism. reply ImHereToVote 50 Personally I can&#x27;t wait for the democracy is white supremacy memes coming at us in a couple of months&#x2F;years. reply concordDance > What many aren&#x27;t capable of is accepting the conclusion that we all have to change the way we live and quite possibly even the way we organize society in order to mitigate the irreperable problems our way of living has already causedThat&#x27;s because this has never actually been shown. So many people think it has, but almost none have ever seen an actual attempt at a QALY calculation for no climate change mitigation. If you&#x27;ve actually seen one I&#x27;d love you to link it!Mostly it&#x27;s lots of handwaving, but attempting to quantify things is actually important so we can know what measures are worthwhile (e.g. if climate change was an existential risk this century then threatening with nukes any country emitting CO2 would be reasonable). reply sz3 There is no alternative.We have \"aggravated the situation\" (as you put it) beyond recovery. Doing nothing will now surely lead to an unacceptable outcome. We are going to have to fix it, or resign ourselves to a huge shrinking of the habitable region of the planet, with the hunger&#x2F;famine&#x2F;war that will accompany that.Obviously we can always make things worse. But when doing nothing is unacceptable, we have to start taking risks. reply Turskarama You have absolutely no idea if the \"solutions\" we try won&#x27;t lead to even worse outcomes.Up until the point climate change is becoming an existential threat, which it isn&#x27;t yet, we shouldn&#x27;t go doing anything too drastic. There is plenty of evidence that we can still avert the worst of it without resorting to geoengineering. reply fastball 25 Why exactly do you place faith in evidence that says \"we can still avert the worst of it\" and are not willing to do the same for evidence that says \"we can do even better with geo-engineering\"? Presumably the scale of the problem is the same either way, so well-reasoned evidence should be able to persuade you of either. reply realusername 44 > There is plenty of evidence that we can still avert the worst of it without resorting to geoengineering.We already have once in a lifetime climate event every month and the carbon locked-in of the past decade still hasn&#x27;t kicked-in. I&#x27;d argue the complete opposite, there&#x27;s a lack of evidence of other options. reply LatteLazy >There is plenty of evidence that we can still avert the worst of it without resorting to geoengineering.And zero evidence we will... reply PradeetPatel This kind of defeatist attitude doesn&#x27;t help with the situation at all. We can all do our part in reducing our daily carbon emissions, raise awareness, and educate policymakers and business stakeholders on the importance of mitigating climate change! reply concordDance Consider me a policy maker.I want to know what the costs[1] of ignoring are likely to be so I can be sure it&#x27;s worth the pain to ban non-electric cars in 10 years, ram through nuclear power plants while gutting safety regs so we can get them built in less than a decade and try and threaten India and China into reducing CO2 emissions. What do you tell me?[1] In $, convert other units like lives into dollars as need be and be sure to value lives from different cultures at 0.1x as thats the expressed preferences of the population based on chatitable giving figures. reply LatteLazy You can call it defeatist, but at this point it&#x27;s factually true. We&#x27;ve made a negative amount of progress on this matter. And that&#x27;s taken 40 years. We have very little time left. We have already locked in almost 2 degrees of warming.These are all regrettable facts. But that are facts.40 years of raising awareness and individual action has failed. reply dougmwne You sound like someone about to perform a triple bypass with a butter knife. reply fasterik >You sound like someone about to perform a triple bypass with a butter knife.This style of comment is lazy and simply trying to shut down conversation without actually making an argument. If you have an objection to the comment you&#x27;re responding to, then say why you think they&#x27;re wrong, what your alternative point of view is, and why your point of view is the correct one. reply psychphysic Or an emergency trach while us sensible folk watch the patient die and hand wring? reply johnnyworker That metaphor implies an understanding and overview that we simply do not have. Think of it as changing bytes in an executable file which will be run in 50 years, based on what \"seems reasonable\" to you staring at a wall of hex without even a de-compiler existing, much less you being able to use one. The only reason to even dream of it is not having to suffer the consequences, period. And that&#x27;s not just because you might not be here in 50 years, it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re just one person in one very, very narrow walk of life, as opposed to being billions of people.The carbon emissions of the richest 1% of humanity are more than double than that of the poorest half of humanity. Oil and coal companies profit, while putting out disinformation, as they have been for decades. But why step on the toes of the powerful when you can just use inject sulfur into the atmosphere? reply raverbashing You can watch the patient choke from the obstruction as well, but it won&#x27;t be pretty neither reply sz3 Well, hopefully we have some time to practice first. Because we&#x27;re the only person in the room and the patient is bleeding out. reply Roark66 So don&#x27;t do a bloody tripple bypass with a butter knife. Just stop the bleeding. Jeez, this conversation is the best illustration of everything that&#x27;s wrong with geoengineering ideas.Indeed we have practiced quite a bit. Read on the catastrophe that was geoengineering attempts resulting in what is now happening with the Sea of Azov. reply fastball 28 I don&#x27;t think hilariously strained analogies are helpful in this discussion.The incredibly multi-variate nature of this problem effectively prevents any comparison that is at the scale of an individual. reply fredrikholm > Just stop the bleeding.Is that enough? AFAIK all paths forward to avoid the worst outcomes includes becoming net negative ASAP.That&#x27;s stopping the addition of 37,000,000,000 tonnes of CO2 anually.For context, a modern CCS captures some thousands of tonne, which is a comparatively tiny, tiny number.Unless magic happens in the next decade, it appears that geoengineering is something we can&#x27;t avoid, sans the suffering and death of billions.I&#x27;d love to be wrong here. reply concordDance > Just stop the bleedingConvincing every country in the world that they don&#x27;t need fossil fuels isn&#x27;t possible.Blocking some sunlight from reaching the Earth is. reply aziaziazi Why being an absolutist? We don’t need to convince every country. Just the top ones that drive the most consumption&#x2F;pollution. reply fastball 35 Because the top ones won&#x27;t be convinced if you don&#x27;t convince the others. Tragedy of the commons and all that. reply realusername 46 > So don&#x27;t do a bloody tripple bypass with a butter knife.

On what body do you want to practice ? reply sz3 I feel like we&#x27;re stretching the analogy pretty thin here. reply aziaziazi We’re actually curating it to get closer to the situation.

It will take millions of years for the human carbon emissions to be cycled back into the lithosphere.In this sense, continued emissions only accelerate and compound the current process unfolding. Global warming as it exists today cannot be stopped passively.That was the previous poster&#x27;s point. We can infer that their unstated objective is the end of global warming in the near future (i.e. in the next few centuries), the achievement of which necessarily requires active intervention.I might infer that your unstated objective is not the end of global warming, but the end of ongoing human interference per se. That&#x27;s an entirely different objective, albeit no less legitimate.If I&#x27;m correct (and I&#x27;m confident in my assessment wrt to the previous poster), then you two are talking past each other. reply szundi No problem with this, apart from convincing like 5-6 billion people to cut their standards of living to half. Also less people is needed, few children. Sounds like impossible now without concentrated media effort and all ruling parties probably would lose for decades. reply TheOtherHobbes 5-6 billion people are going to have their living standards and reproductive opportunities destroyed anyway.If not worse.But you&#x27;re really just remaking the point that as a species we&#x27;re incapable of intelligent collective management of our resources. reply selestify You are right. But good luck convincing those billions to voluntarily reduce their living standards. I fear change will have to come involuntarily. reply concordDance Coordination problems are really really really hard. You shouldn&#x27;t be dismissive about them. reply concordDance Got to convince Nigeria that they shouldn&#x27;t expect any further quality of life increase. Good luck. reply MrBuddyCasino This is a good example of the lack of epistemic humility OP was taking about. reply sz3 We don&#x27;t have the time to sit back and let epistemic knowledge wash over us. We know more or less what needs to happen (less sunlight in, more heat out). All attempts to resolve the situation require taking some risk, and it&#x27;ll be impossible to quantify all those risks until we try them.At the risk of stating the obvious: we need to measure every weird idea we try, and do our best to isolate the variables. Easier said than done. But we broke it, it&#x27;s our problem now.Talking about humility: an excess of humility leads to fatalism. Some is good, but not too much if you want anything to happen. We&#x27;re talking about fixing the ecosystem of a planet, of course it&#x27;s ambitious. reply Tuna-Fish 15 > the Earth is not something you can reboot to the last working state once you harebrained patch implodes.There are methods of geoengineering that you can stop doing at any point, at which point they stop having an effect.The one proposed in this twitter thread, marine cloud brightening by spraying seawater in the air, is one of those. reply bartimus Reducing atmospheric CO2 is geo-engineering just as well. Tackling climate change is going to involve climate engineering. Some solutions will work. Others will not.> to refrain from aggravating the situationEasier said than done. What makes you think this is going to be achievable?Why are you assuming the HN community isn&#x27;t acknowledging the complexity and not taking a holistic approach? reply teamonkey 36 Pumping CO2 into the atmosphere is geoengineering. Reducing CO2 emissions is less geoengineering. reply fastball 22 It is more like geo-fly-tipping. Engineering implies we are being thoughtful about it (which is more true in the reduction case than the dumping case). reply sfvisser I highly doubt many proponents of geoengineering think in terms of rebooting or isolating individual factors.The appeal of geoengineering is you can nudge specific systems slowly into another direction. You can start small and observe expected effects and unwanted side-effects.Reduction of sulfer emissions by ships is an interesting starting point to learn something. reply wnkrshm Starting small doesn&#x27;t work if you have a nonlinear system. In nonlinear systems, the magnitude of a perturbance isn&#x27;t linearly related to the absorbed effect.So in the worst case: small input, giant irreversible effect. reply Kuinox It is accidental geo-engineering. reply concordDance > For the short term future (decades) the only strategy that seems to make sense on the face of epistemic uncertainty is to refrain from aggravating the situation while studying ever more deeply the system we are now perturbing so much.Sometimes perfect is the enemy of good. If climate change really was going to kill a billion people then taking the risk with some geoengineering would be better than just letting it happen. reply tmpX7dMeXU It’s almost like this website is full of people that let Silicon Valley money trick them into believing they are Gods amongst men and that knowing how to write software grants them some sort of transferable expertise. reply BasedAnon >Not sure which computing analogy would drive home the complete recklessness of this mentality but the Earth is not something you can reboot to the last working state once you harebrained patch implodes.here&#x27;s one: stop writing random bits to the BIOS hoping it will fix things reply concordDance That&#x27;s an awful analogy. The science behind, say, sunshades is much stronger than the science behind climate change itself!Eg. The odds of blocking out the sun not cooling the earth are much lower than the earth&#x27;s temperature magically stabilising at current levels despite more co2 emissions. reply brucethemoose2 > Not sure which computing analogy would drive home the complete recklessness of this mentalityGeoengineering is an act of desperation. Its like your laptop is on fire, so you throw some water on it. reply kybernetikos > Its like your laptop is on fire, so you throw some water on it.Is it a lithium fire? I think this might be a very good analogy. reply rgmerk Geoengineering is bad. The problem is that the alternatives may be even worse. reply peyton Yeah but I think natural experiments like low-sulfur marine fuel adoption can point to areas where we can find reversible interim solutions. reply Roark66 More people should upvote your post. If there is a rank of how easily humanity can destroy itself and make the earth uninhabitable for itself geoengineering is probably second only to thermonuclear war.Also I object to the use of the term geo-engineering. Engineering supposes we know exactly what the outcomes will be following centuries&#x2F;decades of experience with similar systems. Including many failed experiments. Thinking we can geo-engineer a predictable change when there is no way to experiment, fail and learn safely because we only have one shot at this is massively stupid. Anyone that claims \"but we&#x27;ve been geoengineering for decades with our greenhouse gas emissions etc\" is simply wrong. No, we haven&#x27;t been \"geoengineering\". Engineering implies conscious intent. Humanity didn&#x27;t start burning coal to increase co2 content in the atmosphere. Confusing these two things are akin to finding a victim of a vehicle accident and doing a roadside open heart surgery by a random bystander. \"Hey, the guy is already sliced open, we&#x27;ve already started the surgery so we may as well continue right?\" No, wrong. That is insane.The biggest lie today is that we comprehensively know how climate works. We don&#x27;t. We don&#x27;t even measure the earth&#x27;s temperature properly. We extrapolate huge amounts of data. If we _really_ wanted to learn how climate works it would require not just arrays of sensors covering the entire planet&#x27;s surface, but also ocean depths and the the entire thickness of the atmosphere. No, satellites are not a replacement. Anyone that knows the limitations of satellite sensing knows we can measure a lot, but reliably measuring temperature, humidity, and wind direction across the entire thickness of the atmosphere is not something we can do. We can roughly approximate some measurements across the entire thickness, in theory in good conditions we can narrow it down to certain attitudes and on this basis we make conclusions on the entire state of the system pulling the missing data from our \"models\". If we discovere the models are wrong? We just tweak them to match the historic data. We might know the measures in this particular place and time, but we use our \"models\" to \"approximate\" everything we are unable to measure.This is one of the major reasons why we cannot reliably predict weather for next 3 days, and why our attempts at making climate predictions are laughable. We know a certain number of principles so we can make some conclusions like more co2&#x2F;h2o&#x2F;ch4 = more temperature, but even in this we have to accept there are processes (positive and negative feedback) we have zero idea of.Furthermore, our planet has shown us huge climatic variability in the geological record. Within that variability the most dangerous to human life are periods of excessive glaciation (ice ages). We&#x27;re \"just\" in the warming period after the last one. Is humanity taking part in accelerating the warming? Yes, is it a licence for stupidity like attempting to \"stabilise\" something that is inherently unstable and periodic(climate) risking we overdo it and find ourselves in a \"mini ice age\"? No.Has it ever stopped us before? No. Anyone interested in results of previous \"geoengineering\" efforts should read up on the soviet attempts at it and what catastrophe it wrought on the region including the Sea of Azov. People in the entire Black Sea region can consider themselves extremely lucky they haven&#x27;t implemented more than few percent of their plans. It is generally accepted today had more of Soviet attempts at geoengineering been implemented it would&#x27;ve had same horrible consequences we see near the Sea of Azov far and wide. reply mpweiher We have extensive records on what happens after volcano eruptions. So we know what happens. Because it has happened many times before.And yes, if the alternative is an extinction-level event, for example a runaway greenhouse effect turning the earth into Venus, then stomping on the brakes with anything whatsoever is a perfectly valid proposal. And doing something comparable to a volcano doesn&#x27;t come close to \"anything whatsoever\", because, as I said, we have records of how this plays out, and it happens all the time anyway.And if you are saying that this isn&#x27;t an acceptable way to proceed, which is a perfectly valid position, then very obviously the alternative cannot be an extinction-level event such as a runaway greenhouse effect that will turn Earth into Venus.What you cannot have is have it both ways. Which is where a lot of people currently seem to be positioned. As in \"we are literally destroying the planet AND geo-engineering is unacceptable\". Nope. Pick one.Furthermore, injecting SO2 into the atmosphere is easy enough that it is well in reach of pretty much every state actor whose population is going to be most severely affected by climate change, in particular \"wet-bulb events\". So the question of whether we want this to happen or not really isn&#x27;t relevant. It almost certainly will happen. reply TheOtherHobbes We&#x27;re actually pretty good at predicting the weather for the next three days.The point about climate variability is a stock denialist talking point.In reality climate predictions have been extremely accurate. There is absolute no mystery or ambiguity here. We&#x27;ve been improving our CO2 models for over a century now, and in recent decades the modelling has been extremely good - although if anything it&#x27;s been too optimistic.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.harvard.edu&#x2F;gazette&#x2F;story&#x2F;2023&#x2F;01&#x2F;harvard-led-a...The problem isn&#x27;t the science, it&#x27;s the politics. We have a planetary culture that puts profit and political ambition - naive uninformed personal indulgence and status seeking, mixed with sanctioned reality denial - over collective intelligence and awareness.While we have individual intelligence - in varying degrees - we still have herd-animal politics and economics. Our management systems have barely changed for millennia, the same issues and tendencies to self-harm keep recurring, and they&#x27;re completely unsuitable for dealing with the kinds of problems we&#x27;re facing.Darwin is remorseless. If a species is maladapted to its environment, extinction - cultural and eventually physical - beckons.That&#x27;s where we are now. reply sfvisser 31 > We&#x27;ve been improving our CO2 models for over a century now, and in recent decades the modelling has been extremely good - although if anything it&#x27;s been too optimistic.If the models are too optimistic, that still means they are wrong, right? Genuinely confused about this.“The situation today is more dire than our previous models predict and the same models predict an even worse future so we need to take them extra seriously” doesn’t strike me as very reasonable. Not in a super non-linear system with tons of complicated feedback loops.Any pointers to in-depth explanations of how these models work and how they are benchmarked? Definitely want to learn more. reply concordDance CO2 caused climate change isn&#x27;t an extinction risk for humanity. reply concordDance > If there is a rank of how easily humanity can destroy itself and make the earth uninhabitable for itself geoengineering is probably second only to thermonuclear war.But emitting some sulfer oxides is not.Geoengineering is a very broad term, yes there are things that are in the category of \"geoengineering\" that could make humans extinct, but none are proposed as a solution to global warming. reply thriftwy Aren&#x27;t you confusing it with sea of Aral &#x2F; Caspian sea?Black sea indeed had a catastrophe but that one predated humans. reply selimthegrim Yes, came here to say this as well. reply jabbany > Not sure which computing analogyProbably akin to \"testing in production\". But, as is in computing, it&#x27;s still done all the time despite the dangers. reply happytiger Linear thinking is how we take action. Leaning back observation is how we analyze.It’s cool to analyze but it can paralyze us into observation and this situation benefits from the former because the consequences of being wrong is so profoundly dire.Generally agree with you, but why not be conservative when it comes to issues like global warming and species extinction and avoid catastrophe if it turns out to be as bad as it could be?That takes linear thinking and action now. We should also analyze, but it’s logical to take action too. reply HPsquared I suppose it comes down to a judgement of how reliable the models are. In this case the models of what happens after applying the \"patch\". reply nologic01 12 The degree of confidence in our abstractions of reality is usually a visible process: You are able to explain things you can measure with increasing accuracy, you can predict and verify the unfolding of what-if scenarios etc.One thing that we should not refrain from is applying 10x, 100x, 1000x the brainpower to understand objectively (as in: not captured by short-term interests) what sustainable biospheres look like and how things can go wrong.The capacity and orientation of the scientific apparatus (universities, research centers etc) is a WIP that has been shaped by momentous historical events (WWII in particular) and societal choices. I think the sustainability transition is of far greater importance but it has not yet had a visible impact.

Engineers onboard argue the only solution is to invent a laser that will blast a tunnel through the asteroid so that the spacecraft can continue safely its out-of-control trajectory.Its an insane strategy. Predicated, among others, on the impossibility of getting back into the control room and charting a non-collision course (which among others will ensure we can better handle any future sustainability challenges). I would challenge that assumption (but with a caveat).The obstacles you mention are real and in a sense currently as complex to model and work through. Its the difference of socially engineering the complex system that is human society versus biophysically engineering the complex system that is the Earth&#x27;s biosphere.Social change is intrinsically easier and far more comprehensive insurance: There is a lot of precedent of purposeful social change and the enormous historical diversity of socioeconomic structures points out to very flexible systems. The obstacles you mention did not even exist a few decades ago. There is nothing deterministic about the current state of the world. Its all in our freaking brains, a lot of it just inane over-consumption because for a while the answer was... why not.The caveat is that a minimum amount of social change needs to be truly global. This is something unprecedented. We are living through a historically unique moment where the random walk of political and socioeconomic evolution folds onto itself: its canvas is now a finite manifold. Cherished behaviors, power games etc may no longer be part of the solution space.Remains to be seen how our complex system will adapt. reply nostrebored The more radical geoengineering ideas, like deflecting sunlight from space, are truly potential extinction level events that should be regulated out of existence. This should not be some VC funded endeavor. reply krisoft 10 > This should not be some VC funded endeavor.How would it be VC funded? Where would the return on investment hypothetically come from? If you could produce localised effects while being able to turn them on or off then maybe you could charge for it as a service, but is that at all realistic? reply defrost I&#x27;m no great fan of geoengineering, however ...The idea to inflate space foam reflective bubbles to reduce incoming sunlight is one of the saner geoengineering proposals:* It can start small and grow to measure incremental effect,* It&#x27;s orthogonal to any unintended effects as it happens in isolation and isn&#x27;t deeply coupled to things unknown in the same sense as aerosols and atmospheric chemistry is.* It&#x27;s reversable as bubbles can be popped and no longer exist to reflect and have an effect.> This should not be some VC funded endeavor.Yeah, on this we can agree- a high degree of global nation state consensus is what&#x27;s called for with most climate action .. like the 1970s UN agreements that got effectively sunk by unending Koch et al oil bro&#x27;s negative media campaigning and lobbying.&#x27;Lone&#x27; capitalists do seem to have undue sway in matters that impact billions. reply concordDance You&#x27;re really underestimating how much sun blocking would be needed to kill off humans. reply zith Climate models take this into account [0], contrary to what some people here seem to imply.

Pretty scary these things can happen, but he was warning basically we are further along with global heating than we thought and this pollution was just masking some of the effect in the Northern Hemsiphere of CO2 we’d already released. We were always going to have to stop sulfur emissions, might have just been better perhaps to have a bit more gradual phase out to soften the shock… reply matsemann 40 The way Green is presenting this doesn&#x27;t sit quite right with me. From day one of the sea temperature anomalies it&#x27;s been said it&#x27;s mainly because of these emissions no longer happening.

Nevertheless if it really were an emergency… in real emergencies, triage happens, and downsides are taken for granted.Thankful that there’s no real emergency yet, but I suspect governments will drag their feet long enough that there will eventually be one, and then emergency relief will be deployed anyway, but it will cost way way more than 5bn. reply steve_adams_86 I don’t know. My province in Canada is experiencing anomalous weather events year after year, and while things still look “okay” we seem to be encroaching on visible threshold events quite rapidly.Sure, these events could mysteriously stop. Or stay very much the same, acting like a new normal that isn’t so destructive as to be an emergency. But the trend line is there. Fires increasing, biodiversity decreasing, floods occurring more dramatically and frequently, 100 year events predicted to be 10 year events not in decades but right now.If that’s not an emergency, what is? If you’re thinking something like “when the province is stricken with drought for 10 years and everyone’s starving”, I hate to tell you but that’s well past the emergency date.

Systems had time to adapt, including new animals evolving. For example trees species habitable zones migrate north or south in response to a changing climate, but to do that the northern most edge of the habitable zone for that species at the time a tree starts is life needs to stay within the southernmost edge until that trees dies, otherwise they can&#x27;t move fast enough. So the whole zone can&#x27;t move further than the width of it within, what 500 years? At a wild guess. Depending in the average lifetime of the tree species. Other systems involve evolution to adapt which takes a lot longer.

I&#x27;m sure you understand why we had to stop that. CO2 accumulates in the atmosphere and stays there for thousands of years.. This sulfur that causes dimming stays for a year or two. reply paulmd because sulfur causes acid rain and respiratory problems and infrastructure damage etc. you&#x27;re putting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere, just like carbonating water produces carbonic acid that eats your teeth.It&#x27;s not fundamentally different from burning coal, and coal obviously had to be stopped too, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s really a question that we need to avoid harmful pollutants even if they have a fringe benefit. reply clolege It&#x27;s an unstable equilibrium.The more necessary evils we depend on, the more things that can fail and further perturb the system.Stopping now helps nudge us back towards the stable equilibrium we had. reply shinryuu Also contributes to ocean acidification which isn&#x27;t great. reply developer93 Specifically because it kills sea life which reduces the amount of carbon the sea can hold. And for a lot more reasons. reply XorNot It also causes acid rain, which while it will never be literally \"acid\" falling from the sky, a general decrease in the pH of water entering arable lands, estuaries and other areas is not going to be great for any of them (also the generalized increase in maintenance cost for concrete, and particularly limestone, structures). reply dghughes Water is hydroxic acid &#x2F;jk reply amateurCoder5 Lol.

I think it also interacts with other green house gases over a longer period increasing warming despite cooling up front. reply MattGaiser Sulphur emissions cause acid rain. reply iamflimflam1 I’ve unfortunately come to the conclusion that we are buggered.Watching politics in the U.K. and the rest of the world I’m seeing politicians realise that they can tap into the populist idea that anything green is “the elites trying to control and tax you”.All they care about us short term election prospects. reply concordDance A lot of \"green\" policies are holier than thou people trying to impose their lifestyle preferences in ways that don&#x27;t actually help.

While it is related to global warming, and there might be other causes to sea surface warming as well, that is not what was discussed. reply HardlyCurious In terms of total global heat content sure. In terms of surface ocean temp, I&#x27;m not so sure you have a point. It&#x27;s a pretty indirect path for greenhouse gasses to heat the ocean, and they can&#x27;t push the water above the temp of their air.Less shade however can cause solar heating well above air temperatures. reply ericjmorey I don&#x27;t know that you&#x27;ve considered the effects of more vs less ice covering the ocean. reply teawrecks Your rewording is inaccurate. There is no masking, it was actually reflecting energy away from earth, reducing warming. This is important because, turns out, we unintentionally ran an ethically dubious climate engineering experiment, the results of which can now be used to inform future possible climate engineering efforts. reply rplst8 The fact that the loss of particulate matter in the atmosphere increases warming has been known for at least two decades.This is not surprising to me. It started years ago when scrubbers began to be installed on coal power plants and continued with low sulphur diesel requirements that started 15 years ago. reply developer93 Depends on the size of the particle, no? Some sizes can have the opposite effect afaik. reply brutusborn Not a bad thread but misses a critical point.If the Sulfur emissions policies were known for >5 years and discussed for >10 years why aren’t they part of mainstream climate models?The best answer I could find was essentially that models use a proxy for aerosols and so including the new policy might cause “double counting” of this forcing. This ‘conservatism’ caused this effect to be left out of the models.So the story is basically that current mainstream models underestimated warming due to them ignoring this effect. But if they are missing this forcing, what other “insignificant” forcings are missing? Are they positive or negative? Are there other observations that don’t match the models?This has really shaken my faith in the climate science community. I’m starting to think ClimateGate wasn’t the nothingburger the media made it out to be. reply paulmd The models have underpredicted the temperature rise throughout my entire living memory. Even the \"pessimistic\" scenarios of high-temperature-rise have been blasted right through on a yearly basis. The model is drastically, dramatically understating the natural feedback loops involved and the amount of temperature rise that&#x27;s going to happen.Feedback loops like methane release are likely also hugely understated, as another practical example.A large amount of this is due to political manipulation and pressure. Researchers are afraid of the way the issue has been politicized, and generally don&#x27;t want to go out on a limb for fear of personal reputational damage or consequences to the field of study as a whole. Even just 15 years ago, in the 2000s, conservative-dominated media was begging for someone to step over the line so they could cancel them Dixie Chicks style and pronounce the entire field of study as discredited.People spend way too much time on \"but what if the models are overstating the problem\" and they don&#x27;t, actually they aren&#x27;t even centered on the actual rate of increase, we pre-manipulated the model by building in all these stabilizing assumptions and even the pessimistic scenarios are actually quite optimistic. And then people apply additional optimistic \"cheater factors\" on top of that, and we still can&#x27;t get to a situation in which the climate is not drastically deteriorated in a hundred years.As I said, we have blasted through the most pessimistic assumptions on a yearly basis, the models are very clearly not aggressive enough about the temperature rises that are going to happen this century. reply brutusborn I don’t disagree that there could be lots of other forcings&#x2F;tipping points etc, but I hear lots of conjecture and don’t see the effect as much in actual predictions &#x2F; models. I do disagree that if they are not included in our models, then we must be systemically underestimating warming.Why do you assume the missing effects will make the situation worse?If the model is missing positive forcings, what makes you so sure that they have included all the negative forcings? reply paulmd > Why do you assume the missing effects will make the situation worse?> If the model is missing positive forcings, what makes you so sure that they have included all the negative forcings?I don&#x27;t think they have included all the negative forcings, but I think that&#x27;s irrelevant because the observed evidence is that the unincluded positive forcings are significantly larger than the unincluded negative forcings.All that matters is the net balance, and the fact that the climate is systematically exceeding the most wildly pessimistic predictions our model provides, shows that the model is not neutrally-calibrated with the present assumptions. There is a significant positive net balance (including any negative forcing) that our model is understating.At any given time that could be a lot or a little, but, right now it seems to be \"a lot\". And the fact that it&#x27;s been that way for 30 years, says that this isn&#x27;t a short-term thing. And in fact the rate of departure from the model is accelerating too - the second derivative and third derivates seem to be strongly positive. We are not just getting farther away from the model, we are getting farther away faster and accelerating as we do it.Could that all change tomorrow when some other effect kicks in and plunges us into a nuclear winter or whatever? No, probably not, but that&#x27;s the kind of hope that conservative media has been selling people for 40 years.When scientists give a neutral \"well, anything could happen but...\" response, all the public hears is \"you&#x27;re saying there&#x27;s a chance\". Nope, we&#x27;re blasting through all the guardrails of the model on a yearly basis, we&#x27;re pretty fucked.And yes, there&#x27;s also the possibility that we&#x27;ve unintentionally been geoengineering something for a while and when we stop ships from putting out sulfur (because it causes acid rain) that we suddenly jump even higher.Getting to the \"disease, famine, endless wildfires (way too many to keep under control), storms with the power to level cities and blot out the sun\" portion of the Toby Ruins It For Everyone video. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Uc1vrO6iL0UAnd yes, it is absolutely too late to stop and the best we can do is try to limit the impacts... which will continue to worsen until we do (and then for about another 20 years after we cease net emissions). Which is why the conservative media will jump right from \"it&#x27;s not real&#x2F;it&#x27;s not human caused&#x2F;it&#x27;s not bad enough to do anything about it\" right to \"wow it&#x27;s too late, let&#x27;s do nothing\". Which is the same thing they&#x27;ve wanted us to do all along, ofc... reply RandomLensman If it is too late to stop might as well aggressively geoengineer and see if it pans out, no? We sort of know we can cool the planet if we wanted to. reply adrianN Cooling the planet doesn&#x27;t make the oceans less acidic. reply brutusborn What’s the evidence for “observed evidence is that the unincluded positive forcings are significantly larger than the unincluded negative forcings”? reply paulmd The fact that we&#x27;re continually exceeding the most pessimistic projections the models can produce on a yearly basis, even after repeatedly recalibrating it to build in even more pessimistic assumptions, and that we&#x27;re tending to depart more strongly from even the pessimistic models.This implies that the models are broadly understating these feedback loops, that they are net-balance in the positive-feedback direction, and that they are becoming more active in the current climate behavior regime. reply brutusborn That isn’t evidence of the previous statement.If we continually exceed model predictions, it could be from underestimating known positive forcings, overestimating known negative forcings, or some combination of unknown positive&#x2F;negative forcings.Essentially I think continuous failed predictions are a red flag for any model, especially one as critical to us as the global climate models. reply RandomLensman Strictly speaking that is not sufficient as it only holds for the current part of the climate evolution and not the future one. It could be that currently positive forcing is underestimated while in the future negative forcing is. replyusaar333 > The models have underpredicted the temperature rise throughout my entire living memory.This doesn&#x27;t seem historically true. They seem more or less on point with some overshooting and some undershooting: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbonbrief.org&#x2F;analysis-how-well-have-climate-m... reply brutusborn It’s a good summary but I don’t think the data actually support their conclusion that “While some models projected less warming than we’ve experienced and some projected more, all showed surface temperature increases between 1970 and 2016 that were not too far off from what actually occurred.” +&#x2F;- 15 % over the last 3 IPCC reports is a lot of missing energy. The models are getting better but I don’t think matching 50 year trends that are essentially linear proves that they are accurate for long term forecasting.I’d be interested to see a new comparison for this years heatwave. I don’t think models would fare as well. reply js8 > This has really shaken my faith in the climate science communityAre you kidding me?Activist climate scientists (like James Hansen) have warned for decades that IPCC reports are likely too conservative, because they represent broad consensus of climatologists.Yet climate deniers continued to decry IPCC (also for decades) as too radical, political organization.And now that the conservativism of IPCC is finally coming to public consciousness, you decide to side with the deniers, as if they were right all along? reply scaramanga Yes, this is like my relatives who voted Tory because immigrants are taking their benefits away. Only to enter old-age with the Tories taking their healthcare and their benefits away. These are tragic and self-defeating people. It doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t stupid or dangerous to the rest of us. Or that they aren&#x27;t responsible for the consequences of their own actions. But that they do stuff which is illogical, self-harming, or counter-productive shouldn&#x27;t be surprising. reply lacrimacida I wouldn’t solely hold them to blame but also point to who manipulated them in the first place. While they are blamable through ignorance they are not the real culprits It’s known the masses are manipulable to do and think in certain ways, and almost always to their disadvantage reply avgcorrection I can&#x27;t take a normal person seriously who, with apparent (imagined) perfect awareness, talks about the masses as a blob of stupid individuals who can&#x27;t think a critical thought.The real reason the masses often act irrationally—counter to the manipulation that your brain has received—is that they have no power or coordination to act as a group themselves. It has got little to do with ignorance. reply brutusborn If you think criticising a model for not matching observations is illogical, then I don’t think you have a very good understanding of logic. reply brutusborn There’s no reason the IPCC can’t report on more conservative models whilst keeping all relevant effects in accurate models. Usually their conservatism is in choosing more realistic assumptions. In this case they ignored a realistic effect.I’m not siding with anyone. I’m criticising a particular groups models which they have admitted to not contain critical effects and thus don’t match recent observations. I don’t deny climate change, I deny that the IPCC models are good. reply scaramanga Yes, that&#x27;s precisely the sort of thing that would elicit flak. If they openly say \"here is an under-egged model for the climate deniers, but here is the real, alarming model\" which one do you think their climate-denying flack machines are going to take aim at?\"No, you think fox news would really do that? cherry pick data?!\" :) reply brutusborn So just to clarify, you agree that “the models are inaccurate” is true, but that is is because of pressure from climate deniers and is systematically conservative.So because of political pressure, the modellers didn’t include a well known effect and missed predicting the highest temperatures on record. A model confirming event which could have convinced millions that climate is worth worrying about.But instead the IPCC listened to fox and neutered their models? I think that is a lot less likely than “their models aren’t very accurate, they simplified a part of the model which turned out to be very important.” reply RandomLensman Where is the conservatism coming to the public consciousness? I don&#x27;t think that is the case as such. reply raggi > If the Sulfur emissions policies were known for >5 years and discussed for >10 years why aren’t they part of mainstream climate models?Why do you believe that they are not? reply brutusborn https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;leonsimons8&#x2F;status&#x2F;1666729264270520322?s... reply raggi https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cesm.ucar.edu&#x2F;community-projects&#x2F;lens2 reply brutusborn It doesn’t sound like their sulphate correction was due to policy changes.Do you know how this model went with this years predictions? reply raggi I do not, this is not my area of expertise. Cross integrations are ongoing, for example the model presented in https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acp.copernicus.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;11&#x2F;11707&#x2F;2011&#x2F;acp-11-117...

This is a difference of assumptions. reply brutusborn I’m saying I used to think climategate was all conspiracy theory nonsense. Now I think there was likely an attempt to hide unhelpful data. reply hotdogscout Climategate was definitely real even if it obviously does not disprove or relate to human-driven climate change.Scientists are sometimes politically motivated and will resort to lying to push their point. This romanticization of scientists and scientific institutions as inherently above lying and fraud is mythological. I see it happening on engineering research that has zero political relevance, imagine research that does. reply brutusborn The way I see it is the media conflated “ClimateGate deniers think global warming is false” with “ClimateGate deniers think global warming models aren’t scientific.”Any politicised science should be treated with extreme. skepticism reply roneythomas6 I think you are miss remembering what climategate was. Climategate deniers where saying \"There is no relationship whatsoever between human activities and climate change\" and they released some out of context emails to support their claims. How does finding out sulphur reduction was masking actual warming effect make climate science any wrong. reply brutusborn I read many of the emails recently so I don’t think I am misremembering.The missing sulphur effect suggests mainstream climate models are incomplete, which makes one skeptical of their results. In the same way deleted data and other shadiness during ClimateGate made people skeptical of the science then. reply jonathankoren What? How are you equating a misinformation plot that at its core was promoting the lie that the climate wasn’t actually warming, but rather cooling with a web celeb alleging that models underestimated the amount amount of warming?How are these even in the same galaxy, let alone the same thing? reply brutusborn I’m not sure what you’re referring to. ClimateGate was about the quality of evidence for early global warming studies. It claimed that scientists were hiding bad data and evidence that their models had problems.This seems very similar: models missing data and forcing but not being criticised when they miss a once in a century confirmation event. reply jonathankoren No. The “scandal” was they were hiding evidence of cooling. If you don’t remember, read the article. Look at who promoted it.Literally no one promoting that bullshit believed that models were underreporting the effects and causes climate change. reply brutusborn The hiding of cooling was implied in the problems in the data&#x2F;models. It’s a moot point really, the scientists did some dodgy stuff, whether they were exaggerating warming or hiding cooling doesn’t make much difference to their integrity. reply roneythomas6 How could cooling be implied from climategate leaks, when climategate deniers where saying \"There is no relationship whatsoever between human activities and climate change.\"? reply brutusborn If the leaks show that some models and data were ignored that show cooling then you can imply that they were hiding cooling.You can also imply that their warming models and data reconstructions were not very accurate. Either way many climate scientists have a history of shadiness, just look at all the Dr Mann lawsuits pending. replyvictorbstan Sounds like some excuse from shipping companies to avoid cleaning up their act. reply uxamanda For anyone interested in a near-future sci-fi look at how sulfur as a form of geoengineering might play out, check out out Termination Shock by Neal Stephenson[0]. The title[1] refers to what happens when you suddenly stop an effort like that...[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Termination_Shock_(novel)[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solar_geoengineering#Maintenan... reply siwatanejo I&#x27;m still kinda surprised that no novel from Neal have become films or TV shows yet. reply zwily There’s been talk of a Seveneves movie or mini series for years…. reply epivosism The final 1&#x2F;3 of the book would be an amazing role-playing scenario. When you think about it, it&#x27;s almost designed that way. The underground area, the floaters, the various \"classes\" of people we meet, their interesting combinations... reply Vecr I think the final 1&#x2F;3rd of that book is actually a horrible situation to actually be in. \"Someone else&#x27;s dream\" for sure. reply epivosism Have you played Dungeons and Dragons? It&#x27;s not supposed to be fun as a place to really live, living in a land harassed by monsters, demons, no security, etc. It&#x27;s an interesting scenario to explore creativity and conflict in difficult situations. reply Vecr Sure, but imagine if a D&D setting was an actual world that somehow survived long enough to start implementing countermeasures (remember the last 1&#x2F;3rd of this book is set thousands of years in the future, so reasonably analogous). If the Player Characters decide they don&#x27;t want to bother with a problem, it would have to be solved with other methods, like massive use of defoliants (think agent orange) and pesticides, bunker buster bombs (think MOP, if deliverable with enough precision), and as a last resort, dropping massive thermobaric weapons to destroy entire cities, possibly repeatedly, and then setting up miles wide demilitarized zones in a circle around the incident zone with kill-on-sight orders and automated turrets and tracking systems, if feasible with the tech available. Obviously a few Player Characters can&#x27;t handle everything, so it would be reasonable common as an ordinary person to find out the next city over no longer exists and they have just been drafted to man the \"human side\" of the newly created DMZ. reply epivosism You&#x27;re right, I had assumed some kind of general peace for the resettlement of the surface of the planet. Given that, there would be some lawlessness, but at least no orbital strikes&#x2F;nukes.I was more thinking about various types of agents from the people living in space, all infiltrating each other, traitors to their own types, double agents, weird combinations etc. Plus mysterious people nobody can place - who turn out to be agents from the submarine&#x2F;hot air balloon groups. And vice versa.The land is now mostly open and clear, right? So there will be new populations, settlements being started down on the surface. A resource race, with possibly high-tech stuff lying around, relics from the lost civilization!Player characters could start off as an alleged group of \"explorers for sites for new cities\" put together by a newly established base - but actually one is trying to divert them away from the hidden holy site of the mineshaft people, where he came from, the other is a spy from a lost faction of the brain people who are outlawed in space now, another is trying to fulfill a 5000 year family promise he received from his father, that when he could, to go to a certain place and say a certain prayer, etc.There is just huge diversity of backgrounds and tech, and a large, unexplored environment potentially full of strange treasures! replyadzm Snow Crash has passed hands a few times as well. reply epivosism Read counts: Snow Crash (3) The Diamond Age (1) Anathem (2) Cryptonomicon (3&#x2F;4) Baroque cycle (2&#x2F;3) Seveneves (2) Reamde (2) The rise and fall of D.O.D.O (9&#x2F;10) Fall or Dodge in hell (1&#x2F;2) Termination shock (1&#x2F;3) reply jojoo Are the fractions ongoing efforts or did you drop it?re-reads for me:Diamond Age (4) (I&#x27;m an educator), Cryptonomicon (2), Baroc cycle (2)However i plan to re-read Anathem in paralell with my second re-read of Russels A History of Western Philosophy.

Remember there was a huge concern for acid rain in the 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s and cutting atmospheric SO2 pretty much eliminated it.Not discounting that coal is terrible for lots of reasons but there&#x27;s a ton of variability on types of coal. One of the core reasons the coal industry pulled out of Appalachia is there were lower-sulfur deposits out in Wyoming... Some gov data: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=37752EDIT: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;data-and-statistics&#x2F;charts&#x2F;emissions-of-... Transportation is a small % of emissions compared to energy generation. There&#x27;s been a regional shift though as North America moved to sulfur controls earlier for energy generation (1990) than Europe, and Asia has begun to climb as these regions went into decline. reply BenFranklin100 Either the world accepts that nuclear energy along with wind and solar is part of the solution to climate change, or we will be forced into geoengineering solutions. We may have already reached that point. reply adrianN There are lots of nuclear reactors being built world wide currently. The problem is that it takes forever to build nuclear reactors and we would need twenty times as much nuclear as we have right now just to replace coal. An additional twenty times as much as we have now to replace oil. And an additional fifteen times as much as we have right now to replace gas. Nuclear is not particularly cheap either. reply askvictor Where do you get those numbers from? In terms of total energy use, perhaps. But oil accounts for about 3% for electricity generation, compared to coal&#x27;s 36% [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iea.org&#x2F;reports&#x2F;world-energy-balances-overview&#x2F;w...]. Most oil is used for transport, so dropping that would increase electricity demand, though a lot of that doesn&#x27;t need to be dispatchable, and there might be efficiencies gained moving to electric. Similarly with gas and heating (gas is used for electricity generation a lot more than oil though).Also, the same site shows nuclear as about 10% of the electricity generation mix worldwide; unless there&#x27;s about 5x as much coal being used for steel-making and other non-electricity purposes, then the numbers would be around 5x instead of 20x. reply coffeebeqn Renewables still have a grid level storage issue. Having enough nuclear as a backbone would be the best we can do right now until battery tech catches up reply adrianN \"Right now\" is incompatible with nuclear. It takes at least a decade to build a nuclear power plant. By that time we can have a lot of hydrogen storage and electrolysis. reply Krssst That&#x27;s why you build non-dispatchable renewables at the same time. NREs can help quickly reduce emissions when there&#x27;s wind&#x2F;sun, and when nuclear reactors are online you can finally bury the coal plants that were running during windless nights. reply gcoakes Are those real numbers? Also, do you mean additive or multiplicative (i.e.: 20 + 20 + 15 vs. 20 * 20 * 15). reply adrianN We have about 2500TWh&#x2F;a of nuclear worldwide. 42000TWh&#x2F;a coal, 48000TWh&#x2F;a oil, and 38000TWh&#x2F;a gas. Give or take a few thousand TWh. replyrgmerk New nuclear energy, at least in the places where most of the HN readership is concentrated, has very little to contribute as an incremental solution to climate change.Now that Vogtle 3 & 4 are complete or almost so, there is essentially no new nuclear power plants under construction in the United States.Europe? The long-delayed Flamanville 3 and Hinkley Point C1 and C2.Canada? Nothing.Australia? Nothing.There won&#x27;t be any additional new nuclear plants built in any of those regions before 2040 (which is only 17 years away)We will have to almost completely decarbonize our electricity grids by 2035-2040 if the world is going to get net zero by 2050 (which is probably not enough to avoid the need for geoengineering anyway). reply kouru225 As with all things I feel like a little from column A, a little from column B reply bell-cot Quip: But when the patient&#x27;s temp is high enough, everyone in the ER knows that you gotta go straight to the ice-water bath.How many square miles of solar reflector could each Starship launch carry to a stable-ish region near the Earth-Sun L1 point? reply adrianN Reflectors act as solar sails and hence need a fuel supply to stay put. reply bell-cot They need active guidance systems. Being solar sails - with a competent design, they can be trimmed (small portions of the sails moved with electric motors to adjust the forces from the sun) for station-keeping. reply lostlogin Based on the tweet (is that what we call them?), wouldn’t super crappy oil burning power stations be a temporary solution?What a time to be alive. reply ido Why not both? reply jonathankoren We’re past the point that nuclear can help.We broke the planet.But hey. “Needs more study.” and academics are living large, unlike the poor billionaires. reply BenFranklin100 This is defeatist and also not true. We adopt nuclear, invest in carbon capture technologies, and employ geoengineering strategies as needed until fusion comes online. This is a solvable technical problem with significant political hurdles. reply teamonkey 15 > adopt nuclearNot possible in the timescales required.> carbon capture technologiesDon’t exist.> geoengineering strategiesUnproven and potentially catastrophic. reply jaggederest Nuclear is dead, it&#x27;s better to install 10x as much solar and batteries right now. \"Carbon capture\" is also highly dubious. Direct air capture is the only realistic version and it&#x27;ll take a significant portion of world GDP (8% to 20%) on an ongoing basis, which we are not spending. I&#x27;ll keep you posted when that changes. Fusion is not coming online in our lifetimes.We&#x27;re not headed for +8C, but we&#x27;re never going to see +1C or below again in our lifetimes. Maybe in the 2300s they&#x27;ll have it under control. reply czbond Thank you for being optimistic and realistic concurrently. We need more people to have such approaches to the topic. reply jonathankoren Optimism != realistic.Optimism is what got us in this mess. reply adrianN There is no reason to believe that fusion power will be cheap. reply forgetfreeman You skipped the step where we reduce global population by roughly 2&#x2F;3, or are we seriously going to pretend we aren&#x27;t well past the sustainable global carry for our species?Edit: apparently we are pretending just that. reply coffeebeqn I mean that seems to be naturally happening anyway? All major economies are under replacement rate and China for example is on a large downward population trajectory. reply mdekkers Global overpopulation is absolutely a part of the equation, and everyone is deeply uncomfortable talking about it because there are no palatable solutions to that specific problem.Humans, as a species, exhibit all the damaging properties of a cancerous growth, and our habitat can no longer support us. As George Carlin said: the planet will be fine, it’s the humans that are fucked! reply sdenton4 The solution is well understood: universal education and readily available birth control. It&#x27;s already working in the more developed economies. reply forgetfreeman That this is a solution remains to be seen. Does this result in net negative population growth? The evidence seems to suggest it does. Will it result in a sharp enough decline in total population numbers fast enough to mean anything? That seems unlikely. reply mdekkers Absolutely. Now all we need is politicians and their constituents around the globe to get on board with this.Again with the George Carlin quotes though (watch the clip “it’s a big club”) most governments are not _that_ interested in a deeply educated general population, _or_ birth control. Where are we going to get all of our obedient little workers from?So not holding my breath :) reply epivosism This seems a bit out of date. I think you need to mention how you feel about below replacement TFR in most of the world to make this position understandable. reply mdekkers Good point. As per wiki:> As of 2020, the total fertility rate for the world is 2.3. The global TFR has declined rapidly since the 1960s, and some forecasters like Sanjeev Sanyal argue that the effective global fertility rate will fall below global replacement rate, estimated to be 2.3, in the 2020s. This would stabilize world population sometime during the period 2050–2070. The United Nations predicts that global fertility will continue to decline for the remainder of this century and reach a below-replacement level of 1.8 by 2100, and that world population will peak during the period 2084-2088.Whilst there is obviously nuance here, even assuming that world population peaks well before 2088, that means we still have a lot of growth to support until that time, and then we have many generations to go before we see a decline to a point where this planet can reasonably be expected to sustain us. Do you believe, given the pace of change we are seeing in this environments’ systems, viewed in the context of the actual tangible change we are implementing to mitigate the negative impacts to us as a species, that there is enough time for that?EDIT: for some perspective, see also the current headcount: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;world-population&#x2F; and expected future headcount: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worldometers.info&#x2F;world-population&#x2F;world-populat... reply ido We’re already heading towards a peak mid-century and then a slow decline of global populations based on existing trends. reply mdekkers Correct. As per my edit in my other response in this thread, we would still be at 10+ billion in 2100. It isn’t like “oh, hey, don’t worry, it’s going down guys!” We should absolutely worry. reply jonathankoren Dude. Nuclear takes decades to build, and that’s IF you can even build it. There’s zero appetite for it in the US or even formerly nuclear happy Europe. We’re literally decommissioning more reactors than we build.Carbon capture doesn’t work. Even if you did manage to capture it from a coal plant, that’s not enough. You have to suck it from the air, and a scalable technology doesn’t exist, and even if it did, we’d need massive amounts of power to do it, because you’re literally up against the second law of thermodynamics.And even if you did have all that stuff today, you’d have to deploy it faster than exponential growth!I’m aorry, but you can’t just yell, “SCIENCE!” and expect it work. It ain’t magic, and the clock has expired. If we listened 50 years ago, and started then, yeah, maybe we’d be in a fighting chance. It’s sure as hell like we didn’t know that check was coming due. Now acting like we can just reverse a century and a half of exponential growth in a weekend is naïve at best, and “thoughts and prayers” level of “fuck you” at worst. reply fullspectrumdev Better to do something (build nuclear) than do nothing (cry on twitter). reply Dalewyn Humanity has not \"broken\" the planet; to argue such is the epitome of conceit.

The average daily global sea surface temperature beat a 2016 record this week, according to the EU's climate change service Copernicus. It reached 20.96C (69.73F) - far above the average for this time of year. Oceans are a vital climate regulator. They soak up heat, produce half Earth's oxygen and drive weather patterns. Warmer waters have less ability to absorb carbon dioxide, meaning more of that planet-warming gas will stay in the atmosphere. And it can also accelerate the melting of glaciers that flow into the ocean, leading to more sea level rise. Hotter oceans and heatwaves disturb marine species like fish and whales as they move in search of cooler waters, upsetting the food chain. Experts warn that fish stocks could be affected. Some predatory animals including sharks can become aggressive as they get confused in hotter temperatures. \"The water feels like a bath when you jump in,\" says Dr Kathryn Lesneski, who is monitoring a marine heatwave in the Gulf of Mexico for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"There is widespread coral bleaching at shallow reefs in Florida and many corals have already died.\" \"We are putting oceans under more stress than we have done at any point in history,\" says Dr Matt Frost, from the Plymouth Marine Lab in the UK, referring to the fact pollution and overfishing also change the oceans. Scientists are worried about the timing of this broken record. Dr Samantha Burgess, from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, says March should be when the oceans globally are warmest, not August. \"The fact that we've seen the record now makes me nervous about how much warmer the ocean may get between now and next March,\" she says. \"It is sobering to see this change happening so quickly,\" says Prof Mike Burrows, who is monitoring impacts on Scottish sea shores with the Scottish Association for Marine Science. Earth in uncharted waters as climate records tumble A really simple guide to climate change Scientists are investigating why the oceans are so hot right now but say that climate change is making the seas warmer as they absorb most of the heating from greenhouse gas emissions. \"The more we burn fossil fuels, the more excess heat will be taken out by the oceans, which means the longer it will take to stabilize them and get them back to where they were,\" explains Dr Burgess. The new average temperature record beats one set in 2016 when the naturally occurring climate fluctuation El Niño was in full swing and at its most powerful. El Niño happens when warm water rises to the surface off the west coast of South America, pushing up global temperatures. Another El Niño has now started but scientists say it is still weak - meaning ocean temperatures are expected to rise further above average in the coming months. The broken temperature record follows a series of marine heatwaves this year including in the UK, the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico. \"The marine heatwaves that we're seeing are happening in unusual locations where we haven't expected them,\" says Prof Burgess. In June, temperatures in UK waters were 3C to 5C higher than average, according to the Met Office and the European Space Agency. In Florida, sea surface temperatures hit 38.44C (101F) last week - comparable to a hot tub. Normally temperatures should be between 23C and 31C, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Marine heatwaves doubled in frequency between 1982 and 2016, and have become more intense and longer since the 1980s, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). While air temperatures have seen some dramatic increases in recent years, the oceans take longer to heat up, even though they have absorbed 90% of the Earth's warming from greenhouse gas emissions. But there are signs now that ocean temperatures may be catching up. One theory is a lot of the heat has been stored in ocean depths, which is now coming to the surface, possibly linked to El Niño, says Dr Karina von Schuckmann at Mercator Ocean International. While scientists have known that the sea surface would continue to warm up because of greenhouse gas emissions, they are still investigating exactly why temperatures have surged so far above previous years.

On the other hand, it also left a lot of rich people in the middle of the road. but today, the press, big companies and the rich (multi-billionaires) accuse that, in fact, we are all to blame for our unbridled consumption (which they helped to build, by the way).Even though I&#x27;m not stupid and I&#x27;m a big believer in science and the changes are real (after all, we&#x27;re seeing this in our everyday lives) it&#x27;s hard not to believe that there are SOME manipulation going on again. reply gmerc We created an autonomous system of entities running on meat CPUs with a singular non human aligned goal of profit maximization at all costs and the system has exceeded the capability of human governance which is stalled at a country &#x2F; block level.It by now controls almost every single human’s everyday schedule - the entire race has been put in service of it and it extracts all resources and externalizes all the costs and by now benefits a tiny fraction of the planet primarily - but even that fraction appears to be powerless to stop it (Lol Big tech billionaires tearingly having to take responsibility and make hard cuts at times of record profits. It’s the system, even the majority Shareholder Zuck cannot escape it. )Despite clear evidence that its continued trajectory amounts to suicide for the human race, we appear unable to stop it.And we have illusions about aligned AI. Lol. reply adamwong246 1Everyone always wonders when the Ultron scenario will come to pass but I maintain that _the AI has already taken over_. This AI doesn&#x27;t run on a computer- it runs on a machine made of laws, business interactions and human brains. This AI does not have personality, and it isn&#x27;t that smart, but this algorithm is very much in charge over every human being on earth, every minute of our lives from birth to death. It seems to have no higher aspirations than grinding the bounty of our Planet into bitcoin. We made this machine that turns everything into capital and it won&#x27;t stop until... what exactly? When some captain of industry has _finally_ achieved their goal of _owning it all_? Because if you follow the trend, that is where the line is headed- A ever-shrinking class of Skeksis ruling over a ruined planet, with just as many slaves, or as few, as they want. reply bentcorner 1I&#x27;ve thought the same thing. Our society is a superorganism with growth and consumption as its only goal.\"No raindrop believes it is to blame for the flood.\" reply ChatGTP 1It&#x27;s time we all had discussions about evolving past this phase. I think it can be done.I don&#x27;t love everything Noval Harrari has to say, but I love his idea that money is a story we believe in, if we didn&#x27;t, it would have no value, and it&#x27;s a story we need rewrite if we want to survive.Greed is not good, being a billionaire is unwise. Money is the root of much evil..or something like this. reply avgcorrection 1This is it. If we just all gather around some pet HN public intellectual, chant something about a real thing in fact just being a narrative, then that real thing will disperse as the mind-goblins that were giving it life let go. reply ChatGTP 1Wasn’t what I had in mind. What do you have in mind ? reply mistermann 1I too think it can be done, but good luck finding a platform that allows uncensored discussion of the full spectrum of the situation and countermeasures. reply selestify 1Surely, with decentralization and the dark web, such a platform can be created. But would there be enough people who join? reply mistermann First question that comes to my mind: how many (exceptional) people are needed to accomplish the goal? reply LesZedCB 1i prefer whuffie reply bamboozled 1What is amusing and sad to me is that we have now created so many insanely big problems through greed, and unbridled technological progress in the name of profits that we actually now need AI (which will for sure have introduce it&#x27;s own problems) to get us out of the shit situation we&#x27;ve created.I hear this parroted all the time, \"AI will save the world\", well maybe, but what about thinking about what has fucked this world and tackling that instead?I know AI progress is being made but I really think it&#x27;s also a fantasy to think a talking computer is going to come to our rescue.I 100% agree with you and have recently come to the conclusion that we already are the paperclip maximizers. We have turned the entire fucking ecosystem into money. reply toomuchtodo 1If \"AI saves the world\", we should consider handing over the keys. We&#x27;ve been weighed, measured, and found wanting. Let someone competent drive for a bit. reply foobiekr 1Nothing built primarily from human-generated internet content is going to be competent in the way you mean. reply toomuchtodo 1It&#x27;s fair to, in some combination, underestimate the learning curve of AI and overestimate the competency of humans. Lots of systems in place today that behaviorally nudge humans through economic and other signal, for example. And they are just dumb lines of code. How smart is a traffic light? Exciting times ahead to understand what the concept of reasoning is.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waitbutwhy.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;artificial-intelligence-revol...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;149909199.v2.pressablecdn.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;201... reply gmerc 1We do love inventing gods to escape our responsibility reply ethbr0 1Don&#x27;t fully disagree, but feel a counterpoint needs to be said.> created so many insanely big problems through greed, and unbridled technological progress in the name of profitsCapitalism is an allocation algorithm that scales.We haven&#x27;t just created insanely big problems, we&#x27;ve delivered insane boosts to productivity.Capitalism&#x27;s outputs in that name of progress (the things that greed and unbridled technological progress have enabled) are now necessary to deliver the current living standard we have for the number of people we&#x27;re supporting on this planet.- Fertilizer-boosted and genetically-modified factory agriculture- Mass manufacturing with global supply chains- Global energy markets with worldwide distribution- International capital flowsIf we&#x27;re talking about toppling the current system, then we have to admit that means losing its positives as well as its negatives.Reengineering isn&#x27;t complete when only looking at the negatives we&#x27;d avoid and the positives we&#x27;d gain.It needs to also include the positives we&#x27;d lose and the negatives we&#x27;d incur by shifting to an alternate system.The alternatives to capitalism aren&#x27;t just &#x27;avoiding capitalism&#x27;s problems&#x27; -- they&#x27;ve historically also been &#x27;rampant inefficiency to the extent that it decreases standard of living.&#x27;One reason I&#x27;m bullish on carbon taxes et. al. Adjust the incentives, and then let the best allocation model we&#x27;ve found run to optimization under the altered constraints. reply atmavatar 1\"Yes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders.\" reply imtringued 1>If we&#x27;re talking about toppling the current system, then we have to admit that means losing its positives as well as its negatives.Except you could have a free (as in freedom) market instead of a free (as in free of costs) market. The former doesn&#x27;t even look that different to \"capitalism\" except die hard capitalists would accuse you of artificial redistribution or some other nonsense.>The alternatives to capitalism aren&#x27;t just &#x27;avoiding capitalism&#x27;s problems&#x27; -- they&#x27;ve historically also been &#x27;rampant inefficiency to the extent that it decreases standard of living.&#x27;Historically, the best alternative to capitalism has worked pretty well. In fact it worked so well, the capitalists shut it down because they were concerned that unlike the communists, someone actually came up with a competitive and superior system. In fact, the capitalist system at the time generated such a rampant inefficiency and unemployment that a man named Adolf Hitler has risen to power who had to channel that unused output in a war to maintain full employment, because capitalism is a demand starved system and therefore warmongering is a popular remedy.Meanwhile some dinky little town in Austria \"printed\" 10000 shilling (about 3 shilling per resident) worth of \"labor confirmation vouchers\" and solved their problems without war.The trick? The money forces participants to maintain an equilibrium economy that follows Says Law. Suddenly all the research neoclassical economists made about equilibrium economies becomes applicable. Meanwhile in Capitalism? Capitalism is a disequilibrium economy so why would you expect any of the outcomes that neoclassical economists predict? It&#x27;s like expecting a car to fly. reply ChatGTP 1I under most of what you’re saying there but if capitalism can’t provide the solution for the climate crisis it needs to go as it’s reached it’s usefulness. There is no point in maintaining a system which will destroy itself like cancer.In my opinion, it’s had its chance but it’s too slow to deal with this. This is urgent.I’d say this much. It got us to a decent place, now maybe we need to have something else replace it. Personally I think it actually is time to move into a post scarcity type world, eliminate poverty and favour open source style collaboration, sharing and communication in every possible. At least until we get the climate under control.This is giving Africa and India the renewables they need, for example. reply selestify 1I agree with much of what you say. But how are we supposed to get there from here? It seems hard, if not impossible, to convince entrenched interests to give up the game. It seems even harder to get “the people” united enough to overthrow entrenched interests, given what we’ve seen of the increasing dysfunctionality of public political discourse. replypalata 1> it&#x27;s hard not to believe that there are SOME manipulation going on againNot at all, it&#x27;s actually really rational. We all optimized for money for as long as we could. Because if you have more money, you can have more things and more power.Then we slowly realized that by doing that, we are killing ourselves. And we don&#x27;t have much time left to save what can be saved.Now the situation is actually so bad that many people just can&#x27;t face the truth and prefer to doubt it. Until they see the consequences, which will quickly go towards global instability (think billions of climate refugees), poverty and famine.Of course it&#x27;s not fun. But it is pretty clear and backed by science. reply avgcorrection 1> Not at all, it&#x27;s actually really rational. We all optimized for money for as long as we could. Because if you have more money, you can have more things and more power.I think you missed the point. If everyone is on the same page and have the same motivation then there is no manipulation. reply sangnoir 1> If everyone is on the same page and have the same motivation then there is no manipulation.Or the manipulation was very successful. The 401k system manipulates the working class into supporting capital class causes: through injecting liquidity, supporting policies that boost share prices, and being unsophisticated investors who never pull out of downmarkets (i.e. bag holders) reply hintymad > I was told (manipulated?) that having things, better cars, better equipment, luxury, wealth, was the right thing to do.When I grew up, I had one pen, one mechanical pencil, one bottle of ink, and etc , at any time. They were enough, and I never felt inconvenience. Having moved to the US, I was shocked to see how many one-time things. Parents buy dozens of pencils for every kid every few months. Hundreds of god-knows-what in stores like Party City. Kids get them via goodie bags in birthday parties and then throw them away quickly. It seems, well, just too much and unnecessarily wasteful.And isn&#x27;t \"luxury\" meant to send a message to beholders? I failed to see the need to pay for such message at all. If you&#x27;re rich, you&#x27;re rich. You don&#x27;t need anyone else to know unless others knowing that gives you an advantage. On the other hand, I have to admit that premiere goods drastically improve the quality of life. A quiet car is much more pleasant to drive than a noisy one. An equipment that simply does not break down gives me peace of mind. A powerful air conditioner is a godsend in an extreme weather (most of the time a fan is good enough, though). The top-line MBP is certainly more enjoyable than the cheap model Boeing gave to its engineers. Frankly, I sometimes don&#x27;t know where the line is. reply DoreenMichele 1I wouldn&#x27;t call it manipulation per se. I would frame it as \"The Overton Window has moved and we have new socially acceptable talking points.\"Talking points are never The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing But The Truth. More nuanced discussion is not readily well-accepted and embraced in large groups -- like, say, the internet. reply pirate787 1The government is by far the largest enabler of consumption. Overall, it taxes savings and investment more aggressively than consumption. And in addition to massive government borrowing and spending, the government also directly underwrites much of the privately held debt (mortgages and student loans) reply danbruc 1We forgot why companies - or for that matter the entire economy - exist, not to make profits and enrich the shareholders but to provide people with goods and services they need and want in an efficient way. Profits are not the goal, they are just like markets, prices, competition and many other things implementation details that are used to control the economy, the allocation and distribution of resources. The question is of course whether there is a different implementation that is better than current system. And on the other hand the people must also care about the consequences of their consumption, the best economy will ruin the planet if people demand stupid things from it. reply dougmwne I think you are conflating different authorities and special interests into one monolith. Corporations want you to consume. Pro-business libertarians want you to consume. Environmentalists want you to draw down consumption. Authoritarians of every stripe want to tell you how to live your life and control your behavior to match their worldview.The science says that our economic system is at total odds with our biosphere and that our exponential consumption growth will come to an end. At that point, we will be forced into a new economic system. It’s an inevitability. People’s opinions and ideology can only defy reality for so long. reply avgcorrection Corporations want you to “consume“ because that&#x27;s in their self-interest. Meanwhile nation states also want you to do that, and need you to do that because the economic system itself relies on it.In other words you have all the actual authorities on the side of consumption and the non-authorities like environmentalists on the side of non- or anti-consumption. reply kavalg 1And it looks like the \"solution\" from their point of view is that you consume less, but pay the same amount of money or even more, so that the economy keeps \"growing\". reply coldtea 1>Environmentalists want you to draw down consumption.That was back in the day. Now they too want you to consume, just \"green\" products. reply palata 1Those who want you to consume green products are not environmentalists. They just hide behind it to sell their shit. reply kavalg 1And what if corporations and government&#x2F;authoritarians are (loosely) the same entity and pro-business libertarians are on a paycheck&#x2F;indoctrinated :) reply snarf21 1I feel it is pretty straight forward. We are just the greediest species on the planet. Greed begets power and power begets more greed.But part of the problem is that by and our large our quality of life is ever increasing. No one wants to go back to subsistance farming and bartering. That will only happen when there is literally no other choice to live. Water is going to be the most valuable resource in the coming decades in a way we can&#x27;t yet contemplate.George Carlin — &#x27;Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.&#x27; reply bcrosby95 1The best things in life are free. But we&#x27;re all too busy working to pay for crap to enjoy them. reply lotsofpulp 1I don’t know what best means, but essential items are certainly not free. Once you include healthcare as an essential item, which has no upper limit, you can see the incentive to secure more resources. Can also throw in legal resources too in the event you get railroaded by the system.The desire to compete for mates is also an element, and that one is built in by nature. reply ChatGTP 1When I was a kid, the seasons were that nice free thing, now I dread them all together. Summer is just too much, and I&#x27;m scared of the winter because I love snow, and if it stops, I won&#x27;t cope well with that change, it will just be too sad.I refuse to use the A&#x2F;C and I&#x27;m just sitting here sweating profusely just typing.I can&#x27;t see humans surviving another 20 years unless we start making some very, very radical changes. reply ricardobayes 1I just watched a programme on TV that is pretty popular right now in some countries where they drop a couple of naked people into the middle of nowhere and they need to survive for 21 days. It&#x27;s pretty eye-opening to be honest, to see how detached we became from nature. reply ethbr0 1I was so disappointed when the first season of Survivor years ago was not this.\"You&#x27;re giving them food? And they aren&#x27;t allowed to hunt?

Profit from war via defense contractors, and then profit again on the rebuild.I don’t think the environment is any different. They’ve profited by exploiting the environment and now they’re going to profit to “fix” it reply vouaobrasil It&#x27;s not manipulation. The economic system is as simple as the game of life when it comes to the coarse understanding of why it has screwed us:* Prisoner&#x27;s dilemma: New inventions give people a differential advantage over others, so everyone has to use them * We think new inventions give us an advantage because of our maladaptive instinct to gain knowledge and avoid deathHence, we have one mechanism (the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma) operating on our instinct to gain wealth and power and that drives us via capitalism towards the brink of death.What we need to do is have a society-wide mentality that endless growth is bad and that our throwaway society is bad but with the momentum humanity has today, we are screwed. Of course, we&#x27;ll be okay (I&#x27;m talking about people over 30), but our children will be extremely miserable. That is the karma that has accumulated every time you buy something in single-use plastic, every time you use Google and support their tech monolith, every time you drive your car, and every time you live in extreme luxury with modern technology.We cannot avoid this karma now from all this destruction we have done. reply bestouff It is manipulation. Different countries have different values systems and people in there don&#x27;t need huge cars and huge houses to feel like they are better persons. reply 7373737373 Where do you draw the line between manipulation and culture? Or do you think some cultures are self-manipulating? reply coldtea 1If it happens through an educational system tailored and expanded to produce obidient factory and then office workers,with trillions in advertising spending (around 600 billion just in the US) to get people buying,plus all kinds of experts in customer manipulation, dark patterns, number chunching, and so on, working to get people to buy more stuff,plus an orchestrated early 20th century campaign to create the modern consumer and be done with thriftiness, debt-aversion and self-sufficiency as common prior ideals,plus planned obselence,plus a political system designed to support two party monopoly, allow campaign contributions and lobbying from corporations with big pockets, and discourage active citizen participation aside from voting once every several years (hell, iirc in the US people don&#x27;t even get a mandatory free day from work to vote)...then it&#x27;s manipulation... reply monktastic1 1Right, but it&#x27;s a self-perpetuating process. It&#x27;s not happening just top-down, but cyclically. The people \"at the top\" are also caught in the same system. Jeff Bezos isn&#x27;t just trying to sell you stuff; he really believes that having more stuff is better. That&#x27;s what the parent meant by \"self-manipulating.\" reply coldtea 1If he believes it and it benefits him, giving him money and power, then he&#x27;s not \"manipulated\". reply Zpalmtree 1it&#x27;s manipulation if it disagrees with my very strict opinion of how society should be reply avgcorrection this is why the world is ending...[1] because people like you have swallowed the propaganda line that it&#x27;s about “mentality” and not the economic system itself.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;article&#x2F;20220504-why-the-wrong-pe...[1] No, not really. Powerful people are the ones to blame. reply vouaobrasil I do think one of the major components is the economic system, I never said it wasn&#x27;t. I believe a reform of the economic system will still be better than nothing, never said it wouldn&#x27;t. I would like nothing more for the mechanisms to be eliminated that have made the powerful people, because they are certainly drivers in this disaster. I still believe in doing everything possible to mitigate it and changing everything we can...but let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, our general mentality that makes us think short-term has also given us those powerful people...it&#x27;s not like \"little people\" aren&#x27;t to blame either.The sooner everyone acknowledges their responsibility, the better. Of course, I still think we will suffer due to what we have done but I believe in doing everyhing we can to change it. Of course, you were snarky because I was snarky at your other comment first. Tit for tat. reply avgcorrection Blaming “powerful people” is just a shorthand for the system itself.One can do what anyone who is serious about things like politics does: research power. Who has it, how is it wielded. Who influences the discourses? Or who dictates it? Who plans societies? Who decides that America shall be dominated by four-line highways? That it shall have terrible mass transportation? That the megalopolis from Philadelphia to Boston shall have a terrible and slow railway? That its urban&#x2F;suburban planning shall be such that people will have to commute to work by way of cars?Why are consumer products produced and imported from across the Pacific Ocean (in the case of the US)?One could research who planned the consumer capitalist economy. Who invented modern marketing. Why the economy needs “consumers”.... one could research whether the “little people” actually have power. The Princeton study that concluded that 90% of the population have no influence on policy (no correlation between policy preference and actual policy) would say no.Alternatively one could stuff all that. Say that it&#x27;s about an all-encompassing \"mentality\". That we&#x27;re all equally to blame. That it&#x27;s about Game Theory.I think your mentality is exactly what the system needs to perpetuate itself. You should feel good about that.--Really I should know better than to vent my frustration by simply saying that I think about the world ending every day... How selfish of me. reply kredd 1Other side of the problem is, we just haven’t been able to come up with a better economic system. Sure it might be sucky for us, but millions of people were lifted from extreme poverty over the last 10 years. Those people would probably support the system since the benefit they see is larger than what we see.Maybe it’s younger millennial talk, but most of my peers have given up on everyone else except their direct contacts. reply coldtea 1>Other side of the problem is, we just haven’t been able to come up with a better economic systemWe just haven&#x27;t applied one. And we&#x27;ve dismantled (or witness the dismantling) of dozens of better attributes the current one used to have (from unions to Glass–Steagall).There&#x27;s nothing special that needs some novel invention. reply avgcorrection 1Oh okay I see. reply Aunche 1No. There is absolutely no evidence that switching economic systems will magically solve global warming. Out of all economic systems capable of industrialization, capitalist mix economies are the only ones that expressed any interest in caring about the environment at all. Communist China was willing to destroy forests to make charcoal to make little bits of low-quality steel and decimate its bird population because they were eating a little bit of grain. The Soviet Union nearly drained the entire Aral Sea to grow cotton. The fact that Communism didn&#x27;t pollute more was only because they were very bad at industrializing.And before you motte and bailey your way into saying you&#x27;re not promoting communism, any proposed economic system is going to have the same problem. Even if you distribute Jeff Bezos wealth in a way that he has to give up his megayacht, then you&#x27;re going to give 10,000 people a means to buy F-150 Raptors. reply avgcorrection 1> No. There is absolutely no evidence that switching economic systems will magically solve global warming.The thing about being the most successful at something is that you both get all the praise for the results and all the criticism for the “externalities“. Welcome to the real world.I mean you could inject any other real-world-existing thing instead of the economic system, like industrialization. It doesn&#x27;t change what I said by one iota. reply avgcorrection 1What are you on about? Both of the Communist superpowers are&#x2F;were state capitalists.I don&#x27;t know what the fuck LessWrong lingo “motte and bailey” really means but it&#x27;s not like I have stated my pro-ideology. For all you know I could be an anarcho-primitivist. reply Aunche 1> What are you on about? Both of the Communist superpowers are&#x2F;were state capitalists.\"Capitalist\" has a definition that does not mean \"something I don&#x27;t like.\" Capitalism specifically refers to where trade is controlled by private owners for profit.

At the very least, you should be able to survive with minimal support for a year before you make the conclusion that this is the way you want all of humanity to live forever. reply avgcorrection 1> \"Capitalist\" has a definition that does not mean \"something I don&#x27;t like.\"“Something I don&#x27;t like”? Don&#x27;t be a child. Capitalism is a mode of production. According to Marxism it could be state-lead, which the Soviet Union pursued because they wanted to move through capitalism into socialism (and then communism).Of course one can disagree with Marxism.Go grind your axe somewhere else. The topic is climate change.> But you aren&#x27;t, are you?

The Soviet Union never considered themselves state capitalists.They did not describe themselves as ideological state capitalists, they did recognize the existence of state capitalism, and advocate it, in the hands of a “revolutionary-democratic” state as a step from the pre-revolutionary status-quo toward socialism.Lenin wrote fairly extensively on the topic.E.g., for one example, in The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It (1917)https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;archive&#x2F;lenin&#x2F;works&#x2F;1917&#x2F;ichtci&#x2F;11....EDIT:> That was a label that certain leftist critics used.Leftist—largely Marxist—critics of the USSR, and vanguardist-authoritarian systems more generally, point out that there is both a theoretical reason to see a vanguardist regime as not “revolutionary-democratic” and an empirical case to be made based in experience in the USSR and other countries employing similar approaches that vanguardist state capitalism gets stuck in elite-serving extractive capitalism and does not transition to socialism.But the label “state capitalism” does not originate with that critique. reply avgcorrection 1> If you&#x27;re using a nonstandard Marxist definition of capitalism, then you should point that out because that is not the definition that people typically use.You bring up two Marxist governments and then get upset when I talk about capitalism as defined by Marxists.Like I said: you can disagree with Marxism (or its perspective on what capitalism) but to call it akin to \"something I don&#x27;t like\" is childish.> Says the person who brought up their personal economic grievances to this discussion in the first place.

When the environment is optimal there is a big boom in their numbers. When the environment changes there is a huge die-off.Humans have the benefit of advanced technology to smooth out these environmental bumps. But, nothing can grow to infinity so there will be those die-offs at some point.Hypothetically, if we could plan out the next million years of humans on Earth, would it be better to hold a population level that could adapt to anything, or to go for the unlimited growth boom&#x2F;bust cycles of nature? reply marssaxman 1> The goal is to support the needs of the population. If people have kids and kids aren&#x27;t dying because of modern medicine, the population explodesIt actually doesn&#x27;t, though; when modern medicine lowers childhood mortality, people voluntarily choose to have fewer children. This is part of the \"demographic transition\" which has been happening around the world over the last 200 years. There&#x27;s no need to stop people from having kids; you just stop the kids from dying, then parental investment skyrockets, and next thing you know your population&#x27;s fertility level is below replacement. reply moduspol I generally agree with your view, but to play devil&#x27;s advocate:The birth rates have been below replacement rates in developed countries for quite some time now. If the 50 million humans were happy people living in abundance and luxury, it may not inherently follow that the population will increase.That said, I&#x27;m not sure how one would choose the 50 million or restrict people from having children in a way that isn&#x27;t dystopic. reply cool_dude85 No doubt you get to be one of the lucky 50 million, right? Keeping in mind that, if you are indeed a \"coder\" of some sort as your name implies, you likely are one of the relatively few people currently causing global warming, while greatly benefiting from past emissions (i.e., you live in an industrialized, developed nation, or otherwise to \"first world\" standards)? reply ianburrell 1What would be worse, being one of the Chosen and knowing all your friends and family are going to die, or being unChosen and knowing you and all your friends and family are going to die? reply ianburrell 1For climate change, the problem is not the number of people on Earth. The US produces 14% of emissions with 3.8% of people. Four times the CO2 the 1.2 billion people in Africa. The 1% globally (80 million people) produce as much CO2 as the poorer half of the population.Also, we don&#x27;t know if it is possible to run civilization with 50 million people.

That is not to say that the economists are any better, because they are often sociologically and environmentally illiterate.It seems that to be politically active you have to turn off part of your brain and accept whatever ideological bullshit your chosen tribe pushes fervently as their doctrine.I do not think you can actually achieve much politically at this point in time, without angering and alienating a lot of the electorate. The environmentalists say, \"fuck them, we will force them with laws\" and the economists will say, \"fuck the poor, we will create a pay to play system so that the rich can continue with their lifestyle and the poor will be priced out of it\".I think democracy only works because it averages over all these very different groups to get a solution that satisfies nobody but is somehow pointing in the right direction. reply palata 1> without angering and alienating a lot of the electorateThis just means that this part of the electorate hasn&#x27;t yet grasped how bad climate change is. The question is not \"how do we find more moderate solutions\", but really \"how do we get those people to see that we are going towards wars, poverty and famine globally\".All that in a context where fossil energies are going down and we don&#x27;t have solutions to replace them. So the world will become much more complicated because of climate change, and on top of that a lot more complicated because we will have less and less energy to face it.Whoever is not alarmist, at this point, hasn&#x27;t really grasped how bad the situation is (or they believe that their country will be able to survive alone, with big walls and a big army, I don&#x27;t know). reply asmor 1A lot of the outrage is cultivated by right wing paid-for by billionaires media outlets that post extremely neoliberal to downright neofeudal takes, alongside the ragebait anti-woke stuff.

We are driving into uncharted territory. reply genezeta 1I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re reading it correctly. This is what I see:There&#x27;s an underlying yearly cycle that goes something like:- gets hotter around March- gets colder around May-June- gets hotter around August- gets colder around NovemberThis is, let&#x27;s say, a sort of cyclic baseline that repeats every year. But over it there are variations. Some years are generally colder, or generally hotter. Some the differences are bigger or smaller, etc. Then, obviously, it&#x27;s not a perfect curve and there&#x27;s \"noise\" on it. It&#x27;s also interesting to note that the \"March peak\" is generally hotter than the \"August peak\", and that the \"November valley\" is generally colder than the \"June valley\". All this, broadly speaking.Now, until last year, the highest temperature had happened in 2016, in the \"March peak\". This \"makes sense\". I mean, it makes sense that the hottest it got was on one of the hot peaks. What&#x27;s more, it happened in the hotter one of both hot peaks.But if we look at this year, what we see is two things. One is that, as the title points out, there&#x27;s been a new highest, higher than March 2016. This is pointed out because it makes an easy and simple headline.The second thing you can see is what you pointed out, that in 2023 we haven&#x27;t had much of a valley in May-June and instead it has been hotter since March producing that the August peak be not only much higher than other years but even higher than the highest March peak. (And, I may add, it may still get hotter in this peak) reply ethbr0 1This is the \"daily average sea surface temperature between 60°N and 60°S\".And southern latitudes have more exposed ocean than northern ones.See 60° to 60° on \"Land Mass at Each Latitude\" https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ecoclimax.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;08&#x2F;land-mass-at-each-longitud...Which would make sense that southern summer (ending ~March) would be the typical yearly peak. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;March_equinox reply genezeta 1Yes, you&#x27;re absolutely right. There&#x27;s more sea surface in the southern hemisphere, so it makes sense that generally the peak would be determined by southern summer. reply ethbr0 1I&#x27;m rethinking this after puzzling over it for a minute.Since it&#x27;s the average... total sea area shouldn&#x27;t matter.Land heats up faster than sea, but likely doesn&#x27;t transfer much of that heat into the ocean, so the sea:land ratio might be immaterial.Probably more indicative is what deep to shallow circulation currents exist in the northern vs southern oceans.From memory, the northern has many more \"vertical\" circulations, that might lead to cooling surface temperatures. reply genezeta 1Clearly we can&#x27;t know for sure unless we have more information about the data itself.But my reasoning is this: If we assume a uniform number of \"samples per area\" then the north&#x2F;south distinction does matter. Larger total sea area in the south would mean more samples taken in the south. And therefore more influence of \"southern samples\" on the total average.Again, we don&#x27;t know unless we have more info, but it seems like a reasonable assumption to make. reply7373737373 Has this temperature average been measured by exactly the same stations over all those years?

Might cause some food shortages though reply gottorf The very existence of something affects its environment. Even the caveman burned sticks for warmth; would you say he is the \"cause\" of \"the problem\" of increased carbon emissions? Because unarguably he did release carbon into the atmosphere. So you&#x27;d have to be very specific about the \"cause\" and the \"problem\".The electricity that feeds my computer allowing me to type this comment comes from the local power plant, which is fossil-fuel based (coal and natural gas). Shall I be put to death? Or am I far enough removed, and instead perhaps the CEO of the utility company? Or considering that they answer to the shareholders, maybe anybody who owns shares? Considering that it&#x27;s a publicly-traded company that serves roughly 4% of the landmass of the continental US, that&#x27;s quite a lot of people.In the end, nobody burns polluting coal and gas for fun. They do it because it&#x27;s the economical choice; if we could all have abundant clean energy from fusion power at the wave of a wand, we would do it. The fact remains that \"problems\" cannot be \"solved\" as much as they need to be weighed against the tradeoffs; there is no free lunch, and the scarce time and resources that can be spent \"solving\" something can be equally spent somewhere else. I&#x27;m afraid that the desire of some people to classify the problem of the changing climate as a categorical imperative that must be \"solved\" at any cost does not change the underlying reality, which is that \"at any cost\" is an impossible thing in real life. reply jjav 1> nobody burns polluting coal and gas for fun.Look up rolling coal.

Models are wrong, but the ones climatologist use are clearly getting something right! reply hotpotamus Oh, I suppose it can and has been done well enough that we can now see the shape of our doom. The denialist argument for a long time seemed to be that impeccably accurate models are impossible and thus no model should be used for any predictive purposes, and therefore we didn&#x27;t need to take any action. The game may still be technically going on, but I&#x27;m fairly sure their side has already locked in their \"win\" and the outcome is now certain. reply blondie9x That’s called a tipping point. I think it’s now been broken through. The hardest part of all this is not nearly enough is being done to stop atmospheric greenhouse gases growth. If you looks at growth rates in CH4 and CO2. It’s pretty steady since recording began. It isn’t until it flat lines and we get back to 350 ppm CO2 that we can even begin to get back to the habitable planet we are suited for. reply revscat Even were we to destroy all oil refineries and coal mines today via an organized bombing campaign it would not be enough. reply blondie9x 1Why not? That would effectively bring emissions growth to 0. More carbon would start to be fixed then released into the atmosphere again due to growth in afforestation efforts. Within the next 5-10 years we would start to see negative greenhouse gas emissions growth. It&#x27;s all about balancing the math so we fix more then is released. Stopping fossil fuel emissions shifts the curve towards fixation and greenhouse gas reductions.As long as we continue to grow carbon fixation efforts without burning more fossil fuels we should head towards a negative growth trend and 350 ppm again. reply revscat 1Because the die has already been cast. Nothing humanity can do given extant technologies can reverse what was became inevitable a decade ago. replyherdcall I don&#x27;t get this figure: how can the average temperature be higher than that of all the years? If this is a model prediction, it&#x27;s extremely misleading. And if each gray line represents a year, we can&#x27;t tell if there is a steady increase year&#x2F;year, all we see are clusters for different years. Also, it seems having wide fluctuations is not uncommon: I see a +2.6 degree increase in 2015. Climate changes can be serious, but it&#x27;s hard to get straight facts anymore, it seems. reply nostrademons 1The line shown is a spatial average: its value is the average over all (measured) points of the ocean, at a given point in time. It&#x27;s not a model prediction, these are actual recorded temperatures.The graphic is illustrating how the current year compares to the cluster of previous years. It would be more informative if it were interactive and you could hover over or label other years, but that requires Javascript abilities that this news outlet doesn&#x27;t have. I think I&#x27;ve seen other presentations of this data and there is a clear later-is-hotter trend, but it&#x27;s subject to the normal El Nino &#x2F; La Nina oscillation plus random fluctuations.The bar graph is measuring a different quantity: it&#x27;s ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific (vs. all over the world), and specifically illustrates the El Nino cycle. The reason this is important is because overall ocean temperatures tend to be cooler in La Nina years anyway. One point of this research is that the naturally cooler temperatures from La Nina may have masked ocean warming that would&#x27;ve happened over 2020-2023, and now that we&#x27;re switching to El Nino conditions, the temperature increase will come back with a vengeance. reply ricardobayes 1My personal experience and research coincides with the graph presented in the article. Where I&#x27;m at, sea temps have risen greatly and this also has a weird side-effect: elevated humidity, through evaporation. Currently we have humidity levels similar to Bangkok, in a place which was otherwise a place with low to medium humidity place. I hope this will swing back to normal soon. reply cdelsolar 1it won&#x27;t reply coldtea 1>how can the average temperature be higher than that of all the years?All the lines are averages. Each line represents a year.The red line is the current year, which is why it stops at August.>And if each gray line represents a year, we can&#x27;t tell if there is a steady increase year&#x2F;year, all we see are clusters for different years.We can however see that 2023, starting from April, is consistently higher than any and all previous years. reply jsnell 1The X axis is the day of the year. The y axis is the average temperature across the entire surface area of the the sea (between -60 to 60 degrees) on that day. Each line is a different year.It sounds like you&#x27;re interpreting \"average\" as being an aggregate over time, but it is actually an aggregate over space at a given point in time.The graph you&#x27;re getting the 2015 number from is not comparable. It is only about the temperatures in the limited area in the Pacific where the El Nino effect happens. reply kredd 1Average of daily surface temperature across oceans, so every point in the plot is basically a day and its respective temperature. The problem is on average the graph lines are moving up on Y axis, potentially causing problems in a longer run. reply 7373737373 1If you mean the lower figure, the temperature is compared to the average, it shows the difference to the average over time reply ankit219 It feels weird that a reputed publication like BBC chose to focus on climate change when focusing on ocean temperatures but completely ignored the effect of S02 regulation[1] of 2020. This[2] is from three months ago when the ocean temperatures were warmer than normal. From what I gather, that trend has continued and accelerated.[1]: SO2 content in fuels was mandated to be no more than 0.5% instead of existing 3.5% in 2020(#IMO2020) citing pollution. SO2 absorbs heat in the atmosphere. This combined with end of a rare triple dip La Nina[3] (responsible for colder temps in last three years) were responsible for a sudden spike in April.[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2023-04-earth-hot-sudden-ocean-spike.h...[3]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;phys.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2023-04-hot-ocean-temperatures-hottest... reply Workaccount2 1I suspect it is imminent (5-10 years) that we will start manually spraying the atmosphere with some sort of reflective aerosol.For all the ho-ha about green energy and an electrified society, nothing will stop the hemorrhaging faster than spraying the atmosphere. It&#x27;s not even close. reply cdelsolar 1how will that help with the CO2 concentration in our oceans and atmosphere? reply Workaccount2 1It won&#x27;t. It also doesn&#x27;t provide any form of permanent fix.It&#x27;s purely a stop gap that can be used to hold down global temperatures while we figure out how to get CO2 out of the air. reply foobiekr 1it won&#x27;t. it&#x27;s just a band aid. reply avgcorrection 2Today I went to work, worked in the garden, made dinner, cleaned the dishes and waited for the world to end. reply jfengel The world doesn&#x27;t end for a while. But the things that will end it are causing problems now.If this climate change were natural, I&#x27;d be sad at how much it will cost to save what can be saved, and how much will be lost. But I myself won&#x27;t live to see the worst of it.What makes me angry today is that the same climate denialists are applying equally motivated reasoning to make a lot of people&#x27;s lives worse right now. Climate denialism is a conspiracy theory, and they see conspiracies everywhere. American national discourse is non-existent because every issue is immediately shut down with \"if you want it, it must be part of your attempt at world domination.\" The reasoning is appalling, but they&#x27;ve been trained on climate change (among others) to accept just outright stupidity.And I&#x27;m at a complete loss for what to do. Everything I believe in stems from being able to make a solid case and have it be accepted by at least a majority. If that fails the alternatives are awful. reply palata 1> But I myself won&#x27;t live to see the worst of it.It may all collapse earlier than you think. We seem to observe year after year that it is changing faster than what our models conservatively predicted.We&#x27;re not talking about a hundred years, we&#x27;re talking about decades. If we don&#x27;t change society in a major way in the next 2 decades, we&#x27;re pretty much done.Most people alive today will live to see how bad it gets (and many of them won&#x27;t survive it if we keep on doing nothing). reply avgcorrection 1On the individual level there are always options. reply vixen99 1Many people agree with you. Here&#x27;s a question though. If you observe what they do as against what they say, it&#x27;s clear that governments in major economies do not share your and their concern and indeed it&#x27;s difficult to see what can be done if they did. Example: just recently we&#x27;ve seen the British Prime Minister sign off a new raft of offshore oil and gas licenses. This is probably not unrelated to the dramatic decrease in average living standards in the UK thanks to energy policies. UK Climate protesters seem to have had a negative impact on the public especially since Britain&#x27;s contribution to global warming is estimated to be around 1% - for a population of around 67 million.Reduce industrial activity? Look at the Mauna Loa CO2 levels from 2020 to 2023 which do not appear to deviate from their regular increase of around 2.3 or so ppm. So even a &#x27;devastating&#x27; industrial economic shutdown had no perceptible effect on the relentless increase.Certainly one contributor to recent warming is the 10% increase in water vapour in the atmosphere brought about by the January 2023 under-sea earthquake off Japan. It&#x27;s estimated to have projected trillions of gallons of water into the sky thus causing a substantial heating effect.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aier.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;the-devastating-economic-impact....https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2023-02-16&#x2F;tongan-volcano-impact...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;03&#x2F;1115378385&#x2F;tonga-volcano-stra... reply saiya-jin Things will have to get worse, so folks will see direct impact on their lives, not just some reports in news.

Discussion doesn&#x27;t seem to be possible, facts on one side and bad emotions on the other are missing each other pretty badly. reply mrpopo Things have already gone worse for many groups of people.Economically: fishermen, businesses near low-altitude ski stations, mediterranean farmers (Spain, Italy, Greece, Maghreb). Quality of life-wise: Iran, Northern African countries now have to live with 45-50C temperatures every summer. Disasters-wise: increased intensity of floods in South-East Asia, China, Taiwan, South Korea during rainy season, ...The list goes on. The thing is, QOL improvements based on economic growth often counter-balance these in the short term. But growth is slowing down and warming is speeding up. reply pvaldes 1Many of those are the same people that keeps shooting themselves in the foot for decades while finding new ways to boycott nature and ignore any ecological advice, fishing quota or ecological measure that does not came with instant monetary reward. reply jeffbee > Northern African countries now have to live with 45-50C temperatures every summer20 dead bodies were brought into the morgue in Phoenix AZ every day last week. They have a backlog of over 300 unexplained deaths from July alone. You don&#x27;t have to go as far as Africa to find unlivable conditions. reply gottorf To bring a counterbalancing perspective, in Europe at least, there are an order (or two, depending on the country) of magnitude more deaths from cold than from heat[0]. I&#x27;d imagine the US, being a primarily northern latitude country, has a similar story.As for the Phoenix numbers, I assume you&#x27;re referencing this situation[1]; as of a week ago, Maricopa County had 24 confirmed heat-associated death year-to-date, with another 249 deaths under investigation. Maricopa County has four and a half million people, over 60% of Arizona&#x27;s population; even if all 249 deaths under investigation end up being heat-related, that&#x27;s still way fewer than deaths from diabetes, suicide, or drug overdoses[2] (reasonably assuming that the causes of death in Maricopa County are proportional to that of the state of Arizona as a whole).That is to say; \"unlivable\" is a stretch.[0]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lanplh&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS2542-5...[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;arizona-maricopa-county-phoenix-me...[2]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;pressroom&#x2F;states&#x2F;arizona&#x2F;arizona.ht... reply jeffbee As of this week it&#x27;s 39 confirmed and 312 under investigation. The \"under investigation\" ones always turn out heat-caused or -related, because that&#x27;s how summer goes in Phoenix. The number of confirmed heat-caused deaths in Phoenix doubled in the three years to 2022 and quadrupled in the 10 years to 2022. A cause of death doesn&#x27;t have to double very many times before it becomes a leading cause. The crude deaths among 4.5 million people would be expected to be about 37000 people per year, so over 400 heat-caused deaths is already substantial. If it increases by only 20% it will be a top-10 cause of death. reply dsego > direct impact on their livesEven then, they will just say it&#x27;s always been like this, that&#x27;s what young people born in 2000s are saying now. reply avgcorrection Please. Rational people like researchers for the petroleum industry have known about this for many decades and yet (because of their employment) worked against the truth. Meanwhile rational people who believe it and are telling the truth have no radical solutions, only bike-to-work platitudes.I don&#x27;t care about conspiracy theory losers. They&#x27;re not powerful enough to put the blame on. At least not the majority of it. reply mistermann As a conspiracy theorist myself: one thing you could do is try to raise the quality of your own thinking to meet the level of your self-perception of it. reply iinnPP Maybe your argument isn&#x27;t good enough? I can certainly tell something (this can be anything and I won&#x27;t clarify) is wrong and that it is overwhelmingly likely related to the climate. I also have as low of a carbon footprint as I can (it is near zero and my main focuses have been reduce followed by reuse and finally recycle(but only stuff I know gets recycled).With that said. I don&#x27;t trust the article nor do I enjoy reading it. It makes odd claims, and comes from a place running articles that I have a real problem with. Things that reach into my childhood and that would probably (very high) mean my death had I been born a bit later. You can disagree, but I am oft correct to a point where my hope that you are correct is sincere.One thing of note is the term conspiracy theory. There is nothing wrong with observing a situation and coming to the conclusion that something isn&#x27;t right. It is natural and more important than I think people are willing to admit. The conspiracy portion of the term is quite simple to achieve given almost everything involves at least one other person. A news network doing an interview with a person being a great example. Or there is this article where a writer&#x2F;editor&#x2F;business are in a conspiracy. The other requirement being a theory. Theories got us where we are today, often with others involved.If you truly want to use your words to fight climate change, go talk to those with an alternative theory and present your facts to win them over. All you are doing now (and this is fine, I am not critisizing you here) is complaining to already converted people.Lastly, and this will be the first time I have made this public, I think we should shift the goal posts as a society. No more stopping climate change. Let&#x27;s change it to controlling the climate. The climate will change without us here and targeting THAT also targets climate change. The key difference is what it means to the person. One goal makes you a bad person because you like to enjoy a long drive. The other goal makes you a good person because you are fighting the world for the sake of your fellow humans.It goes without saying that we need to reach both goals anyway at some point. Best start early. reply Cthulhu_ 2I mean that&#x27;s pretty much all an individual can do. Drop in the warm ocean.

More than half the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was emitted in the last thirty years, and a small fraction of the global population accounts for most of the consumption those emissions made possible.Many people whose consumption is very great complain of time stress, diseases of affluence, a sense of purposelessness, etc. Going back to the per capita material and energy throughputs of the 1960s by raising consumption for many and decreasing it for a few could easily make both groups significantly better off. reply mistermann That may depend on the efficiency level humanity is currently running at, my guess is we are running somewhere in the neighborhood of 50%.Don&#x27;t be scared, homies! reply avgcorrection Those kinds of comments from me are mostly therapeutic.

But even if we didn&#x27;t, we have countless other observations that strongly suggest the planet is heating up in multiple ways. We also have a fairly good hypothesis as well that nicely explains all of these observations (CO2 released by human industrialization is capturing more solar heat, causing the planet to warm). Yes, when we try to get too granular with our predictions the models aren&#x27;t as great, but overall we have a nice hypothesis that seems to explain a wide range of observed phenomena over a large range of time scales for different data sets.When you take into account all of this information, while it is important to always remain open to skepticism, it seems remarkably unlikely that what we&#x27;re observing is in fact common in recent human history and therefore not particularly worth of note.0. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.epa.gov&#x2F;climate-indicators&#x2F;climate-change-indica... reply nickdothutton 1> But I am sincerely curious, do you earnestly believe that, ignoring the other methods of estimating these values we have, that if we had satellite measurements going back 100s of years they would reveal that this level of heating is in fact quite common?No. Where would you get that idea?

If you had just stated something along the lines of \"Note this data only begins in the 1980s\", which the graph also clearly states, I would have considered it a fair observation. I would still agree with the general conclusion, primarily because there are so many other data points this year, that we are \"generally fucked\". And my \"generally fucked\" I don&#x27;t mean that Earth will become uninhabitable, but certainly many regions will be.

HN leans pretty conservative. reply matthewdgreen A very small but incredibly vocal contingent of HN leans towards climate \"skepticism\", and I also think some of the denialist accounts are organized brigaders who swoop into these stories from other sites. The goal is to make it look like these weird denialist opinions are mainstream, so HN readers vulnerable to influence will feel social pressure to accept them.You also see lots of organized flagging and downvoting of climate stories. reply meheleventyone 1Similar with all the incel&#x2F;red pill-esque comments on anything about sex and gender like this comments section: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=36990215Outside of conversations about tech there are definitely a strong subset of special people with very strong views on single issues. reply crawsome 1This is exactly what I&#x27;m thinking. The brigaders are jumping on hot topics. reply seanw444 1That is not my experience at all when defending the 2nd Amendment on here. reply crawsome I think the banned Redditors from the alt-right subs have started to work their way in here.It kinda used to be like old reddit in here. Empirical analysis, people who read the article first. These people jump into these hot-topic threads just to piss all over it with every possible dumb thing to say. Climate denial, \"Just let it get worse\" kinds of comments. Knee-jerk making up stuff, and coping to make it OK.I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s astroturfed bots. It&#x27;s not like HN does much to filter out fake and real accounts. reply randomdata 1In what way is it bizarre? The science is settled, so the only thing left to talk about is denial of the science.Consider the flat earth topic as a parallel. If there was no flat earth idea floating around, would we ever talk about the spherical nature of the earth? The answer is no. Why would we? What would there be to talk about? The topic of the shape of the earth comes up only because the flat earth challenges what has been settled, creating something to talk about. reply mjhay 1Like half of the tech industry is made up of \"rational\" libertarian types who Dunning-Kruger themselves into everything they can. reply jansan 2You probably mean \"denying the facts\", because being sceptical about the news should be normal for independent thinkers. reply jacquesm 1&#x27;independent thinkers&#x27; for me has become synonymous with anti-science, climate denial and antivaxx groups. reply phkahler Surface temperatures. Could this be because of the Canadian wild fires? reply orwin No, it&#x27;s from earlier.That&#x27;s problematic for zooplankton.Also, a big issue is the west Antarctica glacier. If sea ice sheets stay this swallow until next summer, that might accelerate it&#x27;s demise. Artica is done and we can&#x27;t do anything about it, but most of the ice is sea ice and the Groenland glacier aren&#x27;t that big (compared to Antarctica), and the sea level rises caused by Artica melting won&#x27;t be really high (1 to 3 meter max). If the west Antarctica glacier melt (or slide), it will be 4 to 5 times that. reply bamboozled 1What is artica, I think you mean \"The Arctic\"? reply bartimus 1Ocean SURFACE temperature reply ralusek 1It seems as though we currently have the technology to make a major dent in the release of carbon into the atmosphere. Due to the negative third party externality of something affecting the entire planet, this is a rare case where there should be unanimous agreement wrt allowing our governments some authority to take action.1.) All coal, oil, and gas power plants are phased out with nuclear power taking their place. In rare exceptions where it makes sense, solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric may be considered.2.) Continued massive subsidies for purchasing electric vehicles. Large funding for public transit, and in the US, a serious reworking of the way that bidding on contracts, etc, occurs, such that construction of this nature can actually be accomplished3.) All forests cut for agriculture must be replaced with at least 1:1 carbon sink4.) All large shipping vessels are changed to nuclear reply ChatGTP Is there going to be any leadership here from say, the USA? The UN? The EU? China? Anyone?Like, we&#x27;re obviously in the middle of some type of rapidly escalating climate emergency &#x2F; crisis and honestly, there is just silence from any of the agencies and or institutions who may have any chance to avert a potential catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. The news we&#x27;re starting to receive on a daily basis is the kind of thing you&#x27;d hope to see The POTUS making an address to the world over and actually discussing next steps.That graph looks bad enough it&#x27;s time to declare the war on the climate crisis and end fossil fuel usage immediately. If this means re-organizing society to build nuclear plants at scale in record time, so be it.Let&#x27;s be honest, we let free markets try sort it out, and they have been fairly successful through renewables but not successful enough, we need to try something more radical now. Not panic, but we need to move. reply phkahler >> is there going to be any leadership here from say, the USA? The UN? The EU? China? Anyone?China has been been aiming to reduce human impact on the planet for decades by reducing the number of humans. They are finally getting somewhere with it. reply nehal3m That sparked a thought: Considering how global all supply chains are nowadays, would the disruption sparked by the first big impacts of climate change be better for the climate, or worse?Let&#x27;s say most of the markets for luxury goods crash because of poverty due to mass migration and food and water shortages. That would be a net benefit to overall CO2 emissions, right? reply NickC25 Maybe they are paying lip service to such, but in practice, no, they haven&#x27;t, and they aren&#x27;t. At least internally.Why?Because their economy is slowing down and they have a massive population imbalance. They ended the one-child policy and want families to have 2 or 3 kids in hopes that they can help revive their economy. They can&#x27;t continue to grow at the pace they have been since the turn of the century, but if The Party wants to maintain its power (which it does at all costs), it needs to continue to hit growth targets. Can&#x27;t do that with a shrinking population.Their Belt-And-Road doesn&#x27;t really help either because it brings new money to developing countries which in turn brings new lifestyle demands from countries with now increased standards of living due to an influx of capital from increased trade with China. reply asah True emergency will only be declared after a sufficiently catastrophic",
