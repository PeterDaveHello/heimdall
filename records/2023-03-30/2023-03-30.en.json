    "content": "The article discusses the convergence of aesthetics towards a perceived standard, and argues that this is not necessarily a negative trend. The author suggests that the reason for convergence is that people have figured out what looks good and are better at zeroing in on the precise aesthetics that consumers want. However, others argue that convergence is not inevitable but is a result of social pressure and is ultimately negative. They point out that taste is subjective and that style trends come and go. Furthermore, they argue that uniqueness and individuality are being lost in a world where everything is optimized for mass production and standardization. Nevertheless, the article argues that people should be able to enjoy having nice things, and that different can also be worse.The convergence of trends, styles, and choices in various industries, such as fashion and car manufacturing, is an indication of how people have become increasingly conventional and less diverse in their preferences. The article suggests that it is the manufacturers who are driving this trend, offering limited choices to customers because bland items are always bought and cheaper to produce. The maintenance cost of maintaining old, well-built things is like fighting against entropy, and when it crumbles or is destroyed, people must decide either to reuse and preserve it or create something new. However, there is a push towards preserving the old in Europe, which honors their past and considers it as wealth in itself but is seemingly absent in North America.The limited color options for cars are influenced by both customer preference and supply chain issues. Dealers order only a few colors, reducing manufacturing complexity and inventory costs. Customers are often willing to settle for bland colors as long as the car has the desired options and a good price. Luxury and performance brands such as Porsche and Tesla allow for a wider range of color options, but customers who want these options are willing to wait longer and pay more. Odd colors may have better resale value on the used market, but new car sales are primarily driven by popular colors. The lack of more unusual colors in most car models is due to manufacturers' perception that fewer people want them.The comments on an article discussing why cars look the same suggest that the convergence of design is due to optimization for mass production and aerodynamics. The discussion also diverges into ideas around the lack of \"soul\" in modern car design and the impact of globalization and capitalism on consumer products. Some commenters argue that convergence is a result of efficiency in manufacturing and profitability, while others value diversity and unique design. Overall, the conversation highlights the complex factors affecting car design and consumer preferences.The article discusses the phenomenon of convergence, where designs, features, and materials pretty much converge worldwide despite varying brands. The author argues that these improvements are beneficial and have gotten us far, although they may lead to conformity. However, some commenters challenge this idea, pointing out that there is still a lot of variety available in independent creators like artists or musicians. They argue that while mainstream creations may be homogenizing, independent creators are finding a larger audience than ever before. One commenter makes the point that \"best\" is a multi-dimensional concept, and what is considered the best for one person may not be the same for another. The article is ultimately a ramble with no strong purpose, according to one commenter.The article and comments discuss the phenomenon of products all looking the same, referred to as \"conformity\". Some argue that it's not intentional, but rather the result of converging towards a \"mass market appeal\". Others argue that it's the result of capitalism, with brands optimizing for profit over uniqueness. Those who want to succeed in the mass market feel they have to conform to consumer expectations, leading to sameness. The article notes that some products become popular due to factors unrelated to mass market appeal, leading to potential alternatives. However, these are often forced to take up-market positions, as they lack the economies of scale of more popular products. Ultimately, the commodification of products may compromise creativity and uniqueness.The author argues that certain designs can be seen as \"solvable\" in some aspects, and that there is an objective aspect to design, contrary to popular belief. This is illustrated by the author's admiration for a kitchen from a movie that was made nearly 20 years ago, which still looks ideal to them. The author questions whether their opinion is a mere personal preference, but feels that it is not. Others in the discussion bring up the idea that convergence in design is due to economics and market forces, rather than uniform aesthetic preferences. They argue that there is tremendous diversity in what people prefer and that convergence happens due to mass production and marketing to drive demand.The article discusses how different industries and aesthetics have converged towards a uniform look and feel due to popular demand and optimization for sales. It argues that despite the benefits of homogenization, such as easier access to products and services, it can also lead to an unintended side effect of limiting creativity and expression. Some commenters argue that convergence is not necessarily a negative thing and that it can lead to finding the optimal design or product. However, others note that variety and uniqueness offer their own value and that the current trend towards convergence could prevent exploration of better options. Overall, the article and comments raise questions about the balance between optimization and creativity in design and business.The article explores the idea of how technology is leading to a global convergence in design and aesthetics. The author uses various examples to illustrate how similarities in design can be observed across countries and industries due to the sharing of inspiration online. The article examines the impact of data-driven design on consumer goods, architecture, and art. It highlights how the desire for efficiency and profit is leading to a narrowing of choices available to consumers, resulting in a lack of diversity in the market. The article also challenges the notion that people around the world want the same things and argues that the actualization of desires differs from culture to culture. Overall, the author suggests that global convergence in design is a trend that is here to stay but cautions that it should not stifle innovation.The article explores the idea that modern aesthetics have become homogenized, with similar styles found in hotels, restaurants, and Airbnb rentals worldwide. However, some comments on the article argue that this homogenization is not necessarily a new phenomenon and that cultural alignment to the universally accepted is predominant, regardless of price. Others suggest that the feeling of things becoming mediocre could be a result of a decrease in their desire to explore outside their comfort zone. While the debate over the cause and significance of this phenomenon remains, the article raises important questions about the risks of global cultural conformity and the impact on individual expression and creativity.AI systems are often self-referential and reliant on explicit metrics, leading to over-selection of average material and limiting creative authenticity. This trend has led to the rise of AI-recommended and generated movies and art. The trap is a consequence of dopamine treadmills triggered by recommendation algorithms that optimize for attention rather than creative authenticity. The traditional role of curators as stewards of art has also diminished, with mass-produced art dominating the entertainment landscape. However, new, exciting works that push the envelope do exist, but require effort and resources to discover. The problem is not necessarily new, as concerns about the commodification of cities and the homogenization of design have been voiced by critical theorists and urbanists for over a century. Bold and courageous companies have the opportunity to chart a different course and create more unique and authentic products.The article discusses the trend of homogeneity and conventionality in creative fields, from architecture to advertising. The author highlights the People's Choice project by Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid, where they found that people from different countries had similar preferences in art. The article then explores the emergence of the International Airbnb Style, a design aesthetic marked by reclaimed wood, Edison bulbs, and rustic interiors. This style is not limited to residential interiors and has spread to other spaces where people work, eat, drink, and relax. The article argues that this trend towards average and familiar design is due to the pressure for efficiency and the globalisation of creative fields.The world is becoming increasingly homogenized in terms of design, from coffee shops to residential and commercial buildings, and even cars. This phenomenon, described as the \"AirSpace style\" by The Guardian, is characterized by a superficial sense of history and remnants of industrial machinery, and a preference for uniformity over contextual identities. Throughout the world, cities are beginning to lose their unique features as they all look the same. Architecture, especially in the United States, is characterized by cheap stick framing and forgettable mid-rises known as five-over-ones, which all look the same. Cars are designed for the broadest possible audience and for the most efficient manufacturing possible, leading to a convergence in design that is reflected in monochromatic colors, with around 80% of cars sold in black, white, silver or grey.The homogenization of popular culture, from the way people look to the content they consume, is becoming more apparent. The trend for physical enhancements, digital alterations, and cosmetic make-up, for example, has led to a single, cyborgian look. The influence of celebrities like Kim Kardashian is also noticeable. Films, books, and video games have all started to follow similar formulas and make less room for original ideas. In terms of branding, companies are increasingly using shelfie ads, which have a consistent style of art direction, and share the same design elements. The rise of digital media has led to a \"moodboard effect\" where increasingly narrow sources of inspiration lead to homogeneity.The \"moodboard effect\" and the vast availability of reference imagery online have narrowed thinking and shallowed visual ideation in the art direction world, leading to blanding. This is where companies use plain and pastel colours, a sans-serif typeface, white space, and simple, neutral design features in their branding, advertising, and visual identities, creating a sea of sameness. The homogeneity of modern brands can be seen in both the tech sector, high-end fashion, and more mass-market personal care. The same goes for the taglines brands employ, all following a similar linguistic structure. However, in the age of average, there is an opportunity for bold brands and courageous companies to introduce originality and stand out from the crowd. The challenge is to cast aside conformity and decline the indistinguishable.",
    "summary": "The article discusses the trend of homogenization in design and aesthetics, highlighting its benefits and drawbacks. The convergence of design is due to both customer and manufacturer preferences and is evident in various industries, including car manufacturing, architecture, and branding. The discussion raises questions about the balance between optimization and creativity in design and business, and the potential limitations homogenization poses to innovation and individuality. The article challenges the idea that people around the world want the same things and argues that the actualization of desires differs from culture to culture. The moodboard effect has led to blanding, but there is an opportunity for bold, original brands and companies to stand out."

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35351805",
    "content": "Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, has experienced $2 billion in outflows among other troubles, and customers are expressing concerns about their deposits. The exchange has been banned in several countries for breaching financial regulations, leading many to believe that if a run on Binance occurs, depositors may not receive their money back. Some users have also criticized the exchange for shady practices, prompting one to remark that the world might be better off without Binance. The cryptocurrency industry, in general, is notorious for committing crimes, with all exchanges flouting regulations to some extent. However, some exchanges like Kraken have established regular Proof of Reserve audits that allow clients to verify their account balances easily. Coinbase is among other highly regulated, publicly traded exchanges that don't put customers' investments at risk.This thread discusses the value and legitimacy of NFTs and cryptocurrencies. One user argues that NFTs are worthless because anyone can find the original image on the internet, whereas another user argues that the value of NFTs is based on their provenance rather than the physical difficulty of creating them. The conversation then shifts to discussing Ponzi schemes and their characteristics, with some users arguing that certain aspects of cryptocurrencies and NFT projects do fall under these red flags, while others claim that there are legitimate use cases and value for these digital assets. The thread also mentions various investigations and fines that cryptocurrency exchanges have faced for unregistered securities, lack of compliance with regulations, and fraudulent behavior.Kraken claims to have conducted the industry\u2019s first Proof of Reserves audit by accounting for crypto balances and client liabilities under the supervision of an independent auditor. However, critiques point out that the liability audit only covers how much money Kraken owes to its customers, not the entirety of the company's liabilities. In some cases, Kraken may have taken out loans using collateral from its clients\u2019 assets, which would not be covered by client liabilities. Some argue that cryptocurrency exchanges are similar to banks in disguise and should be regulated like such. However, others argue that regulating crypto defeats the purpose of it being free from government control and regulation. Reputable audit firms, such as the Big 4, have refused to take on crypto audits due to concerns about fraudulent companies, creating difficulty for legitimate companies like Kraken to prove their credibility.Binance, a cryptocurrency exchange, has faced operational issues due to high volumes of day-trading. Critics suggest that its value is tied to the ability to hide flows of money from regulations, such as tax avoidance, drug money and silk road transactions, rather than its utility. Crypto's actual value remains a topic of debate between legitimists and skeptics. While there are exchanges like Uniswap DEX that appear legitimate, others assume that all crypto platforms are inherently shady. However, some argue that digital currencies can provide a valuable service for individuals in countries without a stable financial system, particularly for P2P transactions. If Binance were to collapse, other P2P exchanges may not be able to handle the current volume of P2P transactions in countries like Venezuela and Argentina.The comment thread discusses the potential risks associated with Binance's financial stability and how customers could be impacted. One user believes that Binance would not exist if they had all of the deposited money, as regulators would not be targeting them. Others argue that if customers withdraw their money, Binance's business model would not be impacted as they make money from trades rather than using customer funds. The discussion veers towards the idea of nationalized banking and if people who deposit money should take responsibility for their actions, with some arguing that the government should not bail out those who lend money to banks. The conversation concludes with opinions on bank regulation and the importance of people thinking about the risks associated with giving their money to others.People should think before acting and stop making prudent investors pay for the reckless risk takers. There is an easy, sustainable path to a robust system that creates wealth. Some comments suggest that regulators decline banks with 100% backed deposits, and regulatory capture is more dangerous than no regulations. Arguments are made for and against allowing banks to fail, with some suggesting that we need a secondary class of banks that don't leverage deposits into investments, and others pointing out the difficulties of creating such a system. There is also discussion about concerns related to Binance, including its solvency and reputation for fake volume, fraud, and lenient KYC/AML.The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has filed a civil enforcement action against the CEO of Binance on allegations of violating trading rules. The lawsuit does not mention fraud or Binance being banned in multiple jurisdictions. Binance holds $63.2 billion in publicly disclosed wallets, according to data from Nansen. Around 30% of this is held in USDT, 10% is in BUSD, 5% is in BNB, and 15% is in small-cap cryptocurrencies. Some users have criticized Binance for not having a headquarters and for having connections to China, amongst other reasons. However, others have pointed out that some legitimate companies, like Automattic and GitLab, also don't have a headquarters.Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has seen $2 billion in outflows as problems continue to mount. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission recently sued Binance on allegations of illegal U.S. operation and violating rules. Binance also raised fees for spot bitcoin trading and temporarily suspended spot trading due to a software glitch. Despite concerns, Binance's BNB token remains largely unaffected. Some users may be unaware of the negative news or believe Binance will overcome its issues. Cryptocurrency exchanges are experiencing more regulatory oversight, with the recent collapse of Mirror Trading International highlighting the need for increased safety measures in the industry.The Metaverse is becoming disappointing for Gen X, with many virtual experiences failing to live up to expectations. Meanwhile, banks are switching up their balance sheets as interest rates rise, with some investors seeing this as a smart strategy. The Wall Street Journal offers various opinions on topics such as IRS snooping, diversity, Chicago's mayoral race, and the Federal Reserve deflecting blame for bank failures. The publication also provides resources, including subscriptions, education programs, newsletters, and alerts. In addition, it offers tools and features for its customers, as well as the ability to advertise and sell businesses, homes, and recruitment opportunities. Corrections and news archives are also available.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35352452",
    "content": "Picsart AI Research has released its Text2Video-Zero Code and Weights tool. The tool leverages natural language processing technology to generate synthetic videos from input text. The release contains the code and weights for the model, allowing individuals to run their own instance of the software without having to build it from scratch. The code can be run on a system with at least 12GB of VRAM, and while it has limitations, the release has been widely praised as an important development in video generation models. Although some reviewers made sarcastic comments, the release has sparked interest in the generative AI community.A recent GitHub post appeared to suggest that the VFX industry was about to be upended by a new tool that turns text into video, but commentators in the thread weren't convinced. One person called out the stick figure results as vastly less impressive than current tools. Another pointed out that creating VFX necessitates psychotic control to iterate on every detail, and much of the final process involves figuring out how the end product should look through a fundamentally human process. The comment section also touched on the limitations of AI in creating art that speaks to human needs and emotions. Nonetheless, some predicted that a subsequent generation of models could eventually lead to major shifts in the space.The article discusses the potential impact of AI-generated visual effects (VFX) on the movie industry. While AI models can streamline the VFX creation process, they cannot replace the creative and artistic vision of human VFX artists. The article also highlights the importance of idea generation and creative thinking in art, as well as the limitations of current AI technology in replicating these abilities. Furthermore, the article presents differing opinions on the future of VFX jobs and the potential impact of AI on the industry. While some argue that AI-generated VFX will create new jobs and improve efficiency, others suggest that it could result in job loss and negatively impact the quality of VFX.The GPU, even an older model like the vintage 1070, was found to be faster for AI image and video processing than expected. Users are interested in creating animated GIFs using an AI model, and are requesting command instructions for running the model and also asking if they can create longer videos and adjust GIF speed. Someone comments that giphy is no longer needed, and others comment on technicalities of using control and edge guidance with AI models to produce video content. A new model, Text2Video-Zero, has been released that enables zero-shot video generation using textual prompts, guidance from poses or edges, and instruction-guided video editing. All contributions are welcome to democratize AI and empower the creativity of everyone using Text2Video-Zero.The Text-to-Video with Edge Guidance tool generates videos from text inputs, including Halloween and anime styles. The Dreambooth specialization offers additional styles, like GTA-5 and Avatar. Another tool, Video Instruct Pix2Pix, allows users to replace elements with different styles, such as Van Gogh or Picasso. The code is published under the CreativeML Open RAIL-M license, with contributions covered under the same license. The code is available on GitHub, and the creators ask that researchers cite their work if they use it.",

    "url": "https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/927262/6adb2350e2b0d2ce/",
    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35354729",
    "content": "Ubuntu has discontinued support for Flatpak and is pushing for the use of Snaps instead. However, some users are complaining about the limitations of Snaps, including slow update mechanisms and random limitations, leading them to install Deb versions. Many users say that they have stopped using Ubuntu altogether due to its poor quality, with some turning to other distros such as Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Manjaro. Others praise Linux Mint as a solid alternative. Some have also mentioned driver issues with Debian-based systems, suggesting that PopOS or non-free Debian images as possible solutions. Overall, the comments suggest that many Linux users are unhappy with Ubuntu's direction and have moved on to other distros that offer more reliable and user-friendly experiences.Manjaro Linux, which was previously known for its selling point of being able to install all software automatically, has become unstable and adware. Although Manjaro is still better than Ubuntu, the root user and some users no longer recommend it due to controversies surrounding the team. Users have taken to recommending other Linux distributions like NixOS, Void, and Alpine, though these distributions deviate from mainstream Linux. Additionally, Linux Mint, which is based on Ubuntu, and Fedora have been recommended as good alternatives that are relatively stable and up-to-date. Ubuntu has faced criticism for no longer supporting .deb packages of Firefox and instead supporting Snap, which installs Firefox as a snap package. Users have been recommended to install OpenSUSE and Linux Mint instead. EndeavourOS has been recommended for all the good aspects of Arch Linux with an easy-to-use graphical interface.A discussion on the use of NixOS, a Linux distribution, and the pros and cons of different Linux distros. Some users prefer NixOS for its ability to be installed and configured from the command line interface, while others find it more suitable for server use rather than desktop use. Other users have had issues with Ubuntu's use of snaps and automatic updates, prompting them to switch to alternate distros like Arch or Debian for a more customizable experience. The discussion touches on issues like user-friendliness, customization, and community support, while also touching on specific technical issues like WiFi connectivity and compatibility with certain packages.Some commenters on HN are criticizing Ubuntu and Canonical for their use of Snap and other features that limit user choice and control over their systems. Many commenters prefer Debian or Fedora for their more traditional Linux approach. Some users have described issues with wifi drivers, the use of non-free wifi drivers, and issues with Snaps that have caused them to switch distributions. However, some users are happy with Ubuntu or have found workarounds to these issues. Users and commenters also discuss their preferences for various Linux distributions and the benefits and drawbacks of each. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of user control and choice in the Linux community.Users are complaining about Canonical's use of snaps, with concerns that they ruin the user experience and lack positive benefits. Snap stories have ranged from frustration with manual updates to static desktop entries, ultimately leading to a bad reputation for Ubuntu. However, it's also mentioned that the alternative model, one in which software developers don't package their software for distributions, leads to a packaging burden for both distro maintainers and application developers. It's important to note that different perspectives exist regarding the use of snaps and traditional apt packages, with some arguing for the use of snap to limit the packaging burden for both parties. Overall, the use of snaps on Ubuntu has brought mixed reviews from users, leading to complaints about poor implementation and bad decisions by Canonical.The discussion is centered around the topic of software distribution and whether distro maintainers or application developers should bear the responsibility of creating applications that work on different distributions. Some believe that application developers should assume this responsibility while others hold the belief that distro maintainers should focus on making improvements elsewhere. Users, however, are primarily concerned with the functionality of the software regardless of who makes it. While some believe that using Flatpak, Snap and other distro-agnostic libraries is a solution, others have complained about their user experience. Additionally, those in favor of utilizing such libraries have highlighted the need for immutable base systems to protect user data. Overall, the conversation highlights the ongoing debate of who should be responsible for ensuring software interoperability.The discussion revolves around the use of package managers Snap, Flatpak, and AppImage on Linux. While some criticize them for being too invasive or not focusing on core packages, others argue that they provide convenience and a better computing environment for developers. Flatpak is seen as a middle-ground solution that provides sandboxing by default, but not everyone is convinced that it works properly. Some believe that distros should shoulder the burden of packaging every possible application, while others disagree since it's not worth their time. Ultimately, the debate centers on the trade-offs between convenience and control, and whether package managers should prioritize end-user applications or core system packages.The burden of packaging every possible application for a distribution falls on distro maintainers, and this model may not work for software that developers do not want others shipping for them. Some developers prefer standalone binaries or source code that compiles to avoid installing and maintaining another package manager and runtime libraries. Although open sourcing code does not necessarily mean developers want people to package it up for distribution elsewhere, some developers rely on external updater tools to update their software, creating a better system than an external updater might be that the aforementioned build tooling includes an \"update\" script inside the tar.gz. Communities should focus on developing tooling to build portable application packages as an alternative to reinventing the package manager for the nth time. Snap and Flatpak are awful for servers, as well as containers but ok for desktops.The comment thread on Hacker News discusses different approaches to managing package updates in Linux distributions. Some argue that package distributors are unnecessary with the availability of tools like Flatpak, Snap, and Appimage, which make it easier for users to get the latest versions of software without waiting for distro maintainers to package them. However, others point out that there are still benefits to curated package repositories, such as avoiding low-quality apps and keeping users safe from malware. Additionally, some distributions, like Fedora Silverblue, rely on containerization and sandboxing to limit the impact of package updates on the system. Finally, some users prefer operating systems that have a clear separation between the OS and third-party software, such as FreeBSD or Flatcar Container Linux.Debian is known for keeping packages in their repository with the same \"API,\" resulting in derivative packages that can be years old. Other distros typically reflect preference to match certain configuration styles, while Nix requires upstream to be written with Nix in mind. Maintainers have been criticized for being middlemen, but Linux package managers have been a killer app for the OS for decades. However, criticism remains, with some saying that packaging thousands of bits of software on every Git commit is doable by a few volunteers. Currently, every distro has different policies for package names and formats, prompting calls for a globally canonical package namespace\u00a0and a standard format for describing how to build a package. In the meantime, some companies have developed workarounds for creating their own packages.The author discusses the difficulty of distributing software for major OSes, particularly Linux, due to different package management systems and library versions. They use their own build farm to build packages for major Debian and Ubuntu distributions, but still have issues with compatibility and dependency management. The author argues that Snap, FlatPak, and Docker are all just variations on distributing software in the form of tarballs of entire Linux installs. They suggest that if Linux distributions consolidated and invested more time in standardizing things, it would be easier to distribute packages instead of tarballs. They criticize the Linux community for creating \"vanity distributions\" instead of working towards a more cohesive and standardized package management system. The author also comments on the difficulties of distributing software for Windows and Apple platforms.The discussion centers around package management on Linux, with a focus on the benefits and drawbacks of using the package manager to install applications versus using formats like Flatpak or Snap. While using the package manager is convenient for system software, it can lead to issues when installing random apps or depending on the system's stability. As a result, standardized non-system packaging formats such as Flatpak or Snap can guarantee that applications will work across any distro without relying on system packages or version compatibility. Overall, the conversation reveals the importance of balancing stability and flexibility when it comes to package management, and the necessity for standardized packaging formats to ensure compatibility across different systems.Some users and developers prefer Flatpak as the best binary-containerized package manager option available, over Snap and AppImage, for both maintainability and execution. However, some IT professionals and users express concerns about the lack of support for traditional Linux distribution packages and distro maintainers. Furthermore, the adoption of new technologies by Linux can be a disruptive experience for users, especially power users. Those who are already familiar with the not-so-efficient apt package management system in Linux believe that the new systems add unnecessary layers of complexity, especially when compatibility issues arise between different packages. Developers and app maintainers may find it challenging to deal with the complexity of interacting with multiple distribution packages. Flatpak and Snap offer the advantage of better security due to the permissions controls imposed on these packages.Canonical has announced that it will remove the Flatpak package format from its default installation for various official Ubuntu flavors, focusing exclusively on its own package-management system, Snap. While the move has caused some community members to express disgruntlement and question whether it is to further its own interests, Canonical maintains that it aims to improve the out-of-the-box Ubuntu experience for new users while respecting how existing users personalize their own experiences. Users will still be able to install Flatpak manually. While Canonical curates the official Snap Store, it has limited control over the quality of Flatpak packages, which are developed and maintained by a community of contributors rather than being tied to any company or organization.Canonical's decision to remove Flatpak from their default Ubuntu installation and focus on their own Snap platform has sparked controversy and discussions about the differences between the two package management systems. While Snap has good support for CLI programs and services, Flatpak offers more modularity and capable sandboxing through bubblewrap, which can be used and extended by multiple packages. However, some argue that Canonical's repeated swing between their own projects and established systems like Gnome and Xorg/Wayland reflects their inability to keep up with the competing open-source development community. Canonical's focus on Snap may also be seen as a way to differentiate themselves from Red Hat, who refuse to embrace Snap on the grounds that it is tied to a closed-source server controlled by one vendor.Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu Linux, has stopped shipping Flatpak -- a universal packaging system for software applications -- by default. Instead, the company is focusing on developing its own packaging system, Snap. Developers are concerned that Canonical's decision is driven by its own interests, while others have called both Snap and Flatpak useless. One commenter noted that Flatpak's \"community of contributors\" model may make it harder to organize bug fixes, while another commented that Podman, a Docker replacement launched by Red Hat, is a \"horrible fork.\" However, others saw the value in Snap and Flatpak, particularly for users of older versions of Linux distributions.",
    "summary": "Canonical has discontinued support for Flatpak and is now exclusively pushing Snap, causing controversy among Linux users who criticize slow update mechanisms and limitations of Snaps. Users have moved to alternative distros such as Fedora and Linux Mint or recommend non-free Debian images and PopOS to others to address driver issues.

    "content": "Cooler Master has introduced a $39 case that can turn an old laptop into a tiny desktop PC. Framework Laptop owners can reuse the parts from their devices, including an Intel Core i5 processor and up to 32GB of memory, by transferring them to the flexible case, which is compatible with a standard ATX power supply. Users can add extra components such as RAM, storage and graphics adapters to support a range of tasks, while the case's ventilation can keep the device cool with one or two strategically-placed fans. Hacker News users reacted positively to the idea of reusing old laptop components, with some noting that the case has wider applications for media servers and game emulators.Users discuss various ways to reuse or repurpose old laptops and computers on a forum thread. Framework, a company that makes modular laptops, is mentioned as a possible solution to upgrade old computers. The company offers expandable CPU and storage options, which can help save consumers money and counter planned obsolescence. Users also discuss using old laptops as home servers, print servers, or media centers, repurposing them for children's computer use, and using them as smart TV controllers. A third-party company, Cooler Master, is mentioned to be offering a computer case that can fit the Framework motherboard, enabling users to build a new PC with better expandability options. Some users argue that reusing old equipment can help reduce e-waste and save the environment.A discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of keeping old tech around versus upgrading, repurposing, and reducing e-waste. Some argue that running old, inefficient CPUs is worse for the environment, while others argue that the carbon footprint of electronic devices mostly comes from manufacturing. Upgrading is seen as cheaper than buying a whole new system, but some modern laptops make upgrades impossible. Framework, a laptop manufacturer, is marketed as being environmentally friendly by enabling upcycling, repurposing, and reducing e-waste. Some criticize this by pointing out that upgrading parts causes e-waste. Others see the opportunity to repurpose old parts as positive. The discussion covers topics such as laptop longevity, support, and future upgradeability.Framework, a company that offers repairable, upgradable and customizable laptops has launched a new product, the DIY desktop PC.

    "content": "Disney has eliminated its Metaverse division, with some analysts speculating that the company found the project too risky. The Metaverse is an all-encompassing virtual world that connects multiple virtual reality environments. Many commented on a Hacker News thread about the announcement, with one user stating that Disney's ownership of intellectual property could have made it a successful operator. Criticisms of VR included concerns about motion sickness, expensive and heavy headsets, and their perceived social isolation. Others suggested that aims to create a Metaverse, or \"VR world,\" are ill-advised, as the concept largely replicates what the internet already offers.The comments on a recent HN post about the Metaverse include discussion about the limitations and drawbacks of VR technology. Some users report never experiencing motion sickness while using VR, while others note that it's a significant problem for a large percentage of users, especially when playing games where your in-game motion doesn't match your physical motion. One user comments that the weight of the Quest headset was an issue that could be solved by purchasing a different kind of strap, while another notes that the Metaverse concept is generational wishful thinking that can't live up to the hype. Some users discuss the possibility that VR technology will only become widely adopted if it becomes a feature of portable AR glasses.A discussion on Hacker News examined the potential of Facebook's metaverse, questioning whether it would end up just as uninteresting as virtual reality experiences of the past, including Second Life. Commenters noted that the concept isn't new, with 3D interfaces for websites and VR experiences failing to gain wide popularity. The key issue with the metaverse as proposed by Facebook is that it would give advertisers even more control in convincing users to buy products. Commenters noted that Disney's decision to step back from the idea may indicate that it isn't viable. In general, the conversation called into question whether the metaverse is just another hyped-up technology that will ultimately fail to deliver on its promises.The author argues that the success of theme parks rests on the desire for people to say they were physically there, rather than solely on the intellectual property owned by Disney. This emotional connection cannot be replicated by VR experiences, which lack the physical experience of being in a theme park. While some argue that VR experiences could be equivalent to theme parks with the right level of immersion, the lack of socializing and shared experiences with friends and family inevitably makes VR a less attractive option. Additionally, until VR technology becomes significantly cheaper, buying it to experience a VR \"theme park\" will remain a gamble, as the cost might not be worth it in comparison to the expense and excitement of a real vacation.Disney has closed its \"metaverse\" division, leading to the layoff of around 50 employees. The division was set up to explore the possibilities of virtual reality and the creation of a digital world. Users were expected to be able to create virtual assets to be used inside a single, unified online environment. The closure of the division indicates that Disney has downgraded its expectations of the growth of the metaverse. The move also raises questions about the future of VR for the media and entertainment giant. The closure has sparked discussion about the potential of VR and its current applications, with some commentators describing it as overhyped.\nThe comments discuss the potential for augmented reality (AR) technology, with some skepticism regarding its usefulness. Some commenters suggest that AR could be used for virtual conversations with famous people or as a way to enhance cooking experiences, while others argue that it is unnecessary and less convenient than existing technology. Some commenters express their lack of interest or enthusiasm for AR, while others mention the possibilities of using AR for elderly people or people who feel lonely or bored.The idea of the \"metaverse\" has been widely criticized for being a mere hype train, with many claiming that it lacks a concrete definition, leaving people wondering what it is supposed to be. Commenters have noted that the big companies that have invested a lot of resources in the metaverse, such as Facebook (now Meta) and Disney, may be overfocused on VR rather than AR, which has the potential to be a much bigger market. However, others see a market for AR, citing its potential to complement the metaverse with AI assistants like GPT for more accessible content creation. Despite the skepticism, companies like Epic Games have started to deliver on the idea of the metaverse with a recent update for Fortnite that brings nearly all of the Unreal Engine editor's capabilities to the game.Comments on a Hacker News thread discussing Facebook's rebranding to Meta and its vision for a metaverse suggest a mixed reaction. While some express excitement at the idea of an open-standards metaverse with the potential for infinite AI-generated content, others are repelled by Facebook's vision of it and are critical of the company's software. VR technology is seen as a barrier to mass adoption, while concerns are raised about the potential for the metaverse to be hijacked by crypto scams. However, there is some optimism about VR and the metaverse in the adult entertainment industry, while others suggest potential for virtual observation stations in public places and turned automated taxis into remote cameras.Disney has eliminated its next-generation storytelling and consumer-experiences unit, which was developing metaverse strategies, as part of a broader restructuring expected to reduce headcount by around 7,000 over the next two months. The unit had around 50 employees and was seen as developing a new form of storytelling. A report in The Wall Street Journal suggested that Disney\u2019s metaverse ambitions \u201cran into the same reality that has plagued many efforts by tech and media companies to develop a kind of immersive internet: It is difficult, expensive and perhaps not yet in high demand by consumers.\"",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35358698",
    "content": "According to an article on Forbes, Sam Bankman-Fried's defense in his ongoing lawsuit is being funded with money he gave to his father. Some comments on Hacker News suggest that Bankman-Fried first funneled money to Alameda and then directed Alameda to send it back to him and then send it to his father as a tax-free gift. One lawyer pointed out that they have a duty to ensure that the money used to pay them wasn't from the proceeds of a crime. However, it is unclear whether this applies in the specific case of SBF's defense funding. The comments also touch on the tax implications of gifting large amounts of money and the fact that the source of the money, whether it's legal or illegal, is likely to be a bigger factor in court than accounting tricks.Lawyers representing a client accused of illegal activity have a duty to ensure that the money used to pay them is not from the proceeds of a crime. They may have to do their own investigation to determine if the client is guilty, not just to confirm the source of the payment. It is a professional responsibility on the part of lawyers to ensure they are acting ethically, much like the responsibilities of doctors and engineers. Lawyers who act unethically could be forced to pay back assets paid to them even if they had no knowledge that the funds were stolen. In the case of billionaire crypto trader Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), his lawyers would want to vet the source of funds paying them, given the potential for clawbacks, as the government or prosecution claiming the funds are from the proceeds of crime is legal and ethical.The possibility of asset seizure for SBF (the founder of FTX) remains questionable, as his family received $10 million in gifts before\u00a0the charges emerged. If found guilty of fraud, this eventuality could be prevented, but it usually concerns the prevention of the criminal financing back their defense with the proceeds of criminal activity. While the case is ongoing, the $1.8 million house that secured a $250 million bail could be construed as legal, albeit with the proviso that there is an issue regarding the full value of bail not being used for anything other than deterring people from absconding. Although SBF claims to have nobody to thank other than his parents regarding his financial backing and upbringing, his estranged family situation could be instrumental in securing his wealth against possible litigation in the future.\nThe comment thread discusses the use of civil forfeiture to seize assets in suspected cases of criminal activity, which some criticize as a violation of the 4th Amendment. The thread diverges into discussions about the ethics of professionals, such as pastors and ethicists, and whether they are more ethical than the general population. Some commenters argue that knowledge of ethical principles does not necessarily translate into ethical behavior. Others note that it may be more important for professionals to have a deep knowledge of ethics when teaching others. Lastly, some commenters criticize the high fees charged by bankruptcy trustees in the clawback of funds, which they see as an abuse of power to extract money from the victims of financial crimes.Comments on an article about Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, discuss a range of topics, including the ethics course at Stanford, the credibility of Forbes, the legality of the $250 million bond that Bankman-Fried secured, and the use of the word \"gifted\" to describe a money transfer between Bankman-Fried and his father. Some commenters express skepticism about the bond, as the collateral appears to be worth significantly less than the bond amount. Others question why the government has not seized more assets in light of the evidence of fraud. Some speculate that \"gifted\" was used to imply that the transfer was a gift for tax purposes. Overall, the comments bring up various issues related to the case and express differing viewpoints on them.Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has paid for his legal defense, ahead of his October trial, using funds he gifted his father with a loan from trading firm Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried has pleaded not guilty to 12 criminal charges, including wire fraud, money laundering, securities fraud, and bribery. Alameda funds have been accused of being misappropriated and secretly diverted to the company by the former CEO. According to Forbes, some $10 billion in customer deposits are missing from FTX, with allegations that $2.2 billion in company loans were improperly received by Bankman-Fried. He declined to comment on allegations made against him.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35356054",
    "content": "The debate around productivity in coding continues, as developers discuss the role of code-writing in hyperproductivity. While a team of effective coders is essential, becoming a senior engineer or hyperproductive coder requires the ability to decide which issues to prioritize and solve. Although tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT have the potential to change the game, they will not turn every engineer into a high-performing coder. They may offer productivity boosts, but typing out code is not the hardest part of the job. Ultimately, software engineers are paid to develop harmonious systems, not just write working code, so it is the ability to create effective solutions that sets apart top-performing coders.The concept of \"working code\" being a baseline expectation is not a false dichotomy, as some suggest, but rather a fundamental requirement for developing reliable and harmonious systems. The ability to produce such code quickly is assumed in big tech, and is a necessary attribute for upward career mobility. However, typing speed alone does not make a good programmer, as creativity, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work well within a team are also important attributes. It is possible for someone to make a lot of money writing poor-quality code that can cause issues down the line, but prioritizing short-term gains is not recommended for projects with longer life spans. In the long run, investing in self-automation and original tool creation can make someone a highly productive, valuable engineer.The use of ChatGPT, an AI language model, is becoming more prevalent in software development, as users find it a valuable tool for writing code. While ChatGPT is not yet at the stage where it can replace coders completely, it is providing a significant productivity boost, particularly for those writing boilerplate code. Senior developers, who have more experience and knowledge, are finding ChatGPT particularly useful, as they can quickly understand and guide generated code to the right solution. While some believe that the tool may replace coders in the future, others argue that it will simply change the nature of the job, with less emphasis on typing and more emphasis on managing large code bases. Ultimately, ChatGPT is seen as an effective learning tool that can provide quick and easy access to valuable code examples.The article discusses the use of ChatGPT, a language model, to generate code. The author has used it to create simple programs that improve productivity, automate tasks, and ensure the smooth rollout of a feature he's developed. The resulting code avoids subtle pitfalls and is well documented, but is far from perfect. The author states that ChatGPT won't make any engineer a rival to the big names in software engineering but will reduce mental load for senior devs and enable them to tackle more problems. The author also notes that being effective as a developer requires conscious effort to focus on context and avoid rabbit holes, and that ChatGPT won't replace programmers anytime soon.The article discusses improving programmer productivity using command line wrapper functions around the OpenAI API. The author provides examples of functions for generating text and images, and for making code edits. Some comments in the discussion thread focus on the idea that being efficient at writing code doesn't necessarily make someone a 5x engineer; rather, what sets a person apart is their ability to take requirements and turn them into software that benefits the end user and makes the company money. The thread also discusses the limitations of relying solely on an AI system like ChatGPT to write and modify code, as well as the importance of understanding the \"why\" behind building software. Overall, the article provides a practical example of using AI technology to enhance productivity in software development.A commenter on Hacker News shared an anecdote about someone he had interviewed for a job in software engineering. While discussing loops, the interviewee admitted that he had never understood for and while loops and could not write them in any language. The commenter did not want to shame him, but was disappointed that a computer science graduate did not know these fundamentals. The commenter later found out that the interviewee may have only had a degree in web design, but was pressured to join the software engineering team. Many commenters expressed concern about the quality of computer science education and the hiring process in the tech industry. Some debated the existence of \"10x engineers,\" while others shared their experiences with highly productive coworkers.The article discusses the concept of the 10x programmer and how a new tool called OpenAI's GPT-3 is promising to revolutionize how programmers write code. The article also mentions studies that have found varying ratios of programmer performance, which can differ by up to 100 times for completing the same task. The article notes that the negative aspects of programming staff, such as the occurrence of Non-Productive Programmer Syndrome (NNPP), can be challenging to manage. The article details how recognizing NNPPs and addressing them effectively can ensure project success. While some debate the effectiveness of the 10x programmer concept, others believe that ChatGPT, a tool that automates low-level coding, can improve productivity for all programmers. Some also question the potential drawbacks of GPT-3 in terms of maintainability and debugging.Comments on a Hacker News thread discuss the potential impact of AI tools such as GPT on software engineering jobs. Some users believe that these tools could streamline the code review process and make reviews more efficient, while others argue that the tools lack the ability to find more complex issues in code. One user compares GPT to Spreadsheets, suggesting that while these tools can create basic applications, they may eventually require digital transformations once they become too complex. Additionally, some users express concerns about the potential for errors and bugs in using these tools, while others point out that programming skills beyond the abilities of the tools will still be necessary. Overall, opinions on the impact of AI on software engineering jobs are mixed.",

The post spawns a discussion among developers on the limitations of WebAssembly (WASM), the dominance of X86 CPUs, issues with null objects in C#, and the prevalence of type coercion rules in JavaScript. Some commenters defend JavaScript while acknowledging its issues, and others point out the importance of explicit type coercion and validation in preventing bugs. Many express admiration for Bernhardt's talk and creative approach. The conversation reflects the ongoing evolution of programming languages and the ever-present tradeoffs between creativity, efficiency, and usability.The article shares a Reddit thread discussing Python's \"wat\" moments. The term \"wat\" is used to describe programming language quirks that are confusing or unexpected. The examples given are Unpacking tuples, Division by zero, Is operator, and Mutable default arguments. A few comments criticize the use of \"wat\" moments to ridicule things developers do not understand. One comment says JavaScript's quirks don't matter if you use a linter, and the issues mostly come down to implicit conversions, which developers learn to avoid. Several comments praise Gary Bernhardt's \"wat\" talk as a classic and entertaining example of inconsistent and leaky abstractions. Overall, the thread discusses the importance of context, consistency, and readability in programming languages.The article discusses an old video by Gary Bernhardt on JavaScript called \"Wat\" that highlights some strange behaviors of the language. The article explains that adding two non-number operands in JavaScript actually performs string concatenation by coercion of the operands to strings using \".toString()\" method. The article notes that although some results may appear different from the video, the behaviors mentioned in the video are all pinned down by ECMAScript standards and cannot be changed. There are comments expressing amusement at the video and various WATs in JavaScript, with some acknowledging that while JavaScript has some strange behaviors, it is still a powerful and widely used language.",

    "content": "A US federal judge has found Google destroyed evidence and repeatedly lied to the court in a finding that could have serious consequences in ongoing antitrust litigation against the tech giant. The judge found that Google employees routinely discussed substantive business topics, including those relevant to the antitrust lawsuit brought by 38 US states and territories. The ruling follows accusations raised by the Department of Justice last year that Google had destroyed evidence. However, the company questioned the method of review of Google documents, and the parties have been grappling over the issue ever since, with Epic Games also raising similar claims. The ruling could lead to an adverse inference being drawn, indicating that the deleted evidence was against Google.Google employees were found to have destroyed evidence or lied to court in a current lawsuit. The judge found that Google failed to preserve chat records of key employees, which violated the company's duty to preserve such records. At any given time, Google has thousands of employees under litigation hold, but Chat did not automatically go on litigation hold like Gmail did. Google warns its employees to not use Chat for topics subject to litigation hold but leaves it up to them to comply. The judge did not sanction Google yet, as there is no way to estimate the losses yet, but fines will be assessed when fact discovery is complete. The issue pertains to the lawsuits from Epic Games and the Department of Justice. Individuals responsible for destroying evidence should be held accountable, but corporations are accountable for the actions their employees take.The author explains that when individuals take income for work and pay others to do the work, their income is double taxed, whereas corporations benefit from a huge tax benefit compared to individuals. The money paid to others for services would be taxed twice, and capital gains would only be taxed as a discount tax. The commenters suggest that corporations only receive measly fines as penalties for wrongdoings and that fines should be scaled with the revenue of the company. They reference banks taking Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism rules seriously due to the large fines they face if they violate them. They also mention that holding individuals responsible for breaches can be a great motivator, such as managers becoming personally liable for health and safety breaches. Both parties acknowledge that morality doesn't pay the bills.",

The country has historically benefited from agriculture, which now makes up a quarter of its GDP. However, Italy's reputation for food stems largely from its production of meat and dairy products. \u00a0Many of these have certifications that verify they are made using traditional methods or with specific Italian ingredients. Hacker News users argued that the move to retain this reputation was less to do with nationalistic sentiment and more to do with economic expediency in the short term. They suggested that advances such as lab-grown meat are key to dealing with long-term issues of sustainability in food production.Italy has become the first country in Europe to ban the use of names traditionally associated with meat, such as \"burger\" and \"steak,\" for vegetarian and vegan products. The proposal, led by the far-right League party, was approved by the Italian Parliament's agriculture committee. Parliament still has to give it a final seal of approval. The bill aims to prevent confusion among consumers by limiting such labels to products containing animal flesh. Violators could face fines of up to \u20ac250,000. The legislation also prohibits marketing food products as dairy-free if they contain any dairy-related content, such as palm oil or glycerine. Critics argue that the move stifles innovation in the food industry and goes against consumer choice.Italy has banned the sale of lab-grown meat and meat alternatives, becoming the first country in Europe to do so. The country\u2019s agriculture committee argued that the ban would protect Italy\u2019s food heritage and ensure that traditional recipes were not undermined. The country\u2019s farmers have consistently expressed concern at the potential challenge to their businesses posed by meat replacements. The first cultured meat restaurant in the world, the Bistro In Vitro, opened in the Netherlands in 2018. In Germany, researchers are developing a \u20ac3m ($3.5m) laboratory to create cell-shaped meat. US firm Memphis Meats produces lab-grown duck and chicken substitutes. As yet, no lab-grown product has been approved for sale to the general public.The debate around using insect flour in food has sparked differing opinions online. Some argue that calling insect flour \"flour\" is misleading, as it is not made from grains, but others argue that it is a useful ingredient that can make healthy, delicious food. There are also contrasting views on the safety and potential health benefits of insect-based food. Some point out that insect protein can be a sustainable and efficient way to feed billions of people while being less destructive to the planet than livestock farming. However, others raise concerns about higher levels of contamination and questionable nutritional value in insect-based protein. Still, some point out that cultural factors play a significant role in people's food choices, and for some, consuming insects goes against their culture and traditions.Italy's ban on lab-grown meat is being criticized as protecting outdated food traditions and lacking a clear definition of \"natural products.\" Some argue that the ban is politically motivated, meant to distract the public from the government's failure to deliver on election promises. Italian food traditions have been challenged in recent years, with experts suggesting that many common beliefs about Italian cuisine are false. Meanwhile, there are concerns that climate change will make traditional animal farming less practical in many parts of Italy, potentially making lab-grown meat a necessity for preserving local cuisine. The ban has also sparked debate about the ethics of meat consumption and the environmental impact of animal farming.Italy has recently announced a draft decree that would ban non-traditional meats, including vegan meat, lab-grown meat or meat alternatives, from being marketed or sold with familiar meat-related terms. Lab-grown meat starts with a small sample of healthy animal cells that are then nurtured to develop muscle tissue like meat. The idea is to make meat more sustainable as well as more ethical. The ban draws criticism and bafflement. Critics say this creates unnecessary and unscientific barriers, and does not support a growing shift toward plant-based eating, which is more popular than ever. Some Italian consumers might argue that there is no reason why they should be denied the choice of products that are high in protein, rich in nutrients, and good for the environment if they also know the products are healthy, sustainable and affordable.Italy has become the first country to pass a law banning the use of words like \"meat,\" \"sausage,\" or \"burger\" when referring to plant-based alternatives. The law also applies to dairy alternatives like \"yogurt\" and \"cheese.\" Violators could face fines of up to \u20ac1,300 ($1,500). Proponents say the law is necessary to protect the integrity of traditional meat-based products, while detractors argue it is anti-competitive and stifles innovation. The European Vegetarian Union noted that the law was inconsistent with existing EU regulations and argued that the ban could be interpreted to apply to a wide range of products, including packaging, advertising, and even social media posts.The discussion centers around whether unlimited democracy is a good idea or not. Switzerland is often cited as an example of direct democracy and the success it can bring. However, some argue that Switzerland is a unique case due to its small population, low poverty rate, and monoculture. The discussion also touches on the dangers of populism and the role of government in limiting its effects. Some criticize the Italian government's ban on lab-grown meat, arguing that it's populist vote-grabbing, while others believe in the importance of regulating the food industry for safety and quality reasons. Overall, the debate highlights the complexity of governing and the difficulty of finding a balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility.A discussion on the potential ban of \u201cnatural\u201d meat sparked debate over the definition of \u201cabominations\u201d among different groups. A commenter who supported lab-grown meat was called out for using \u201cabomination\u201d to describe traditionally produced cheese, which they no longer consume. Another commenter argued that it is not natural for humans to consume animal products, and that the idea of natural food varies from culture to culture. The conversation touched on issues of animal welfare, ethics, and the safety of lab-grown meat, with some calling for rigorous testing to ensure its safety before it is widely adopted. The discussion highlighted the complexity of the food industry and the many different perspectives on food production and consumption.The debate around GMOs and non-GMOs centers on concerns about environmental impact and the potential health risks associated with consuming genetically modified organisms. Some point out that all crops, including non-GMOs, are the result of human intervention and selective breeding, while others argue that GMOs may have unforeseen long-term consequences. There are also concerns about the potential monopolization of the seed market by a handful of large corporations, and the impact this could have on small farmers. Some argue that strict regulations are necessary to ensure the ethical use of genetic engineering, while others believe that GMOs offer a promising solution to food insecurity and environmental challenges.Italy has become the first country to ban the use of any kind of animal meat in the production of plant-based or lab-grown food products. The law comes in the face of growing interest from companies worldwide in producing hybrid lab-grown or plant-based meat products using animal cell cultures. However, it\u2019s unclear whether the ban will be viable or enforceable. Many traditional meat replacements rely on protein obtained from soybeans, peas, and other plants, though some proposed food in development uses cultured animal cells for growth. Meanwhile, some environmentalists have expressed doubt about the environmental credentials of meat-free products manufactured primarily in industrial, rather than traditional agriculture settings.\nThe comments section discusses the controversy around lab-grown meat and its potential as a sustainable and ethical alternative to traditional meat production. Some argue that lab-grown meat should be embraced as a promising solution to supply chain disruptions and sustainability issues, while others question its safety and nutritional value. The debate highlights the complex nature of food systems and the need for careful consideration of the potential impacts of new technologies on the environment, society, and human health. Additionally, the conversation touches on broader issues related to government regulation of food systems, including the protection of cultural and traditional foods, as well as concerns around monopolization and control by corporations.The discussion centers around the impact of the cow industry on the environment. While one commenter argues that cows, or any living creature, cannot be bad for the planet, another counters that it is not just their bodily functions that are a problem but the enormous land usage required to graze them. The commenters debate strategies to reduce the environmental impact of the cow industry and explore alternatives, including lab-grown meat. The discussion expands to address broader environmental concerns and solutions, including issues with the oil and gas industry and the use of fossil fuels. The conversation highlights the need for systemic change to address climate change and environmental sustainability.Italy's right-wing government is supporting a bill to ban lab-grown meat and other synthetic foods to protect the country's food heritage and health. Breaking the ban would incur fines of up to \u20ac60,000. Proponents of the ban, including the farmers' lobby and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, argue that it is necessary to defend natural food and to keep Italy's farmers at the forefront of the country's food industry. However, some animal welfare groups, who see lab-made meat as a solution to reducing carbon emissions and improve food safety, have criticised the move. The US and Singapore have already approved synthetic meat, and the EU is expected to follow suit.Italy's government has proposed a ban on lab-produced foods, including meat, without approval earlier this week. The move comes after previous bans on\u00a0the use of flour derived from insects such as crickets and locusts in foods such as pizza or pasta to protect\u00a0Italy's prized Mediterranean diet.\u00a0The ban would also include synthetic foods produced from animal cells without killing the animal. Synthetic meat has gained regulatory approval in the US and Singapore, but not yet in the European Union. Commentators have pointed out that Italy\u00a0cannot oppose the sale of synthetic meat produced within the EU when it does eventually gain approval due to the free movement of goods and services.",

    "content": "Google's Universal Speech Model can perform automatic speech recognition on a wide range of languages, from widely-spoken ones like English and Mandarin to under-represented ones like Punjabi, Santhali, and Malagasy. The model utilizes multilingual pre-training on a large, unlabeled dataset and fine-tuning on a smaller labeled dataset to achieve high accuracy in recognizing these under-represented languages. Additionally, users have shared their own approaches to improving ASR performance, such as using a combination of Whisper and ChatGPT, or custom models trained on original transcripts. While some remain skeptical of the quality of automatic speech recognition, others have noted improvements in the accuracy of auto-generated captions on platforms like YouTube.OpenAI has released a new state-of-the-art speech recognition model leading to improvements in automatic transcription and captioning. The model is called USM, and can recognise human speech in 51 different languages, as well as identify the individual speakers. The USM model is trained on a dataset of over 12 million hours of spoken language across a diverse range of languages, and was assessed through voice-to-text transcription tests. Users have compared its high accuracy to that of YouTube's auto-captions that are considered better than professionally produced transcripts. USM\u2019s performance metrics currently exceed that of competitors' performance, which has encouraged developers to believe machine learning can be used to replicate the human capacity for speech recognition.Google has announced the development of the Universal Speech Model (USM), which can recognize 2,000 languages and is powered by a 2-billion parameter model with the ability to convert voice signals into text. Google claims that the USM performs up to 32.7% better than Whisper, a commercially available speech recognition system on 18 languages tested. However, some commenters criticized the model\u2019s performance on spoken English with heavy accents. The USM will be available behind an application programming interface (API) paywall, leading some to question Google\u2019s motivations to provide it only to those who would use it in languages underserved by existing models. Google claims that the model is small enough to access via mobile devices and its privacy algorithms include federated learning, meaning that the data used by USM for training can remain secure on the devices that contribute it.The Universal Speech Model (USM) is a family of speech models with 2 billion parameters trained on 12 million hours of speech and 28 billion sentences of text in over 300 languages. USM enables automatic speech recognition (ASR) on underrepresented languages like Punjabi, Santhali, and Shona, making it easier for YouTube to offer closed captions in more languages. The model incorporates pre-training on a large, unlabeled multilingual dataset, allowing it to adapt quickly to new languages and data. USM outperforms other speech models with less training data and achieves lower word error rates (WER) on publically available datasets for speech recognition and translation. The model was developed by a team of experts from Google also focused on responsible AI practices.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35352094",
    "content": "Aspirin's effectiveness in treating COVID-19 has been attributed to its antiplatelet and blood-thinning properties, which help break up microclots that can cause symptoms. Other drugs, like nattokinase, which has similar properties, are being studied for heart disease, and it has been shown to break down blood clots and degrade the spike protein. Personal anecdotes from COVID-19 patients suggest that aspirin and Claritin can help alleviate symptoms, but experts warn that it's important to get tested for COVID-19 before taking any medication to avoid potential dangerous interactions. The exact mechanisms behind aspirin's efficacy are still not fully understood, but researchers continue to study them in order to gain a better understanding of the drug's effects.In a discussion about the medicinal benefits of herbal remedies, users on Hacker News made a variety of comments about the state of the pharmaceutical industry and our collective understanding of medicine. One user, a doctor, noted that although medical science has made progress, there is still much that we don't know about how the human body works. Others remarked that the process of creating a new medicine can be slow and expensive, which may discourage pharmaceutical companies from pursuing certain lines of research. However, many users agreed that researchers and doctors are doing their best to help people, and that some of the most effective treatments can come from unexpected sources, such as willow bark, which is the natural source of aspirin.This thread on Hacker News discusses the potential side effects of common over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and acetaminophen. Users share personal experiences with negative side effects including gastrointestinal bleeding, organ damage, and hearing loss. Many recommend using these medications judiciously and under medical supervision, and caution against excessive or prolonged use. One user provides a helpful diagram of the arachidonic pathway and how these drugs interact with it to promote bleeding. Overall, the thread highlights the importance of understanding how medications work and developing safer alternatives with fewer side effects. Some users also express skepticism about the motives of the pharmaceutical industry in this regard.Aspirin inhibits the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, which decreases synthesis of thromboxane and inhibits blood clotting, potentially causing bleeding. Platelets have enzymes inside them that convert arachidonic acid into thromboxane for blood clotting. Aspirin inhibits these enzymes, which is why it is an antiplatelet medication. Aspirin was widely used as a pain reliever, fever reducer, and inflammation reducer, and also helped to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is still used today as part of treatment. Other NSAIDs were supposed to replace aspirin, but some of them caused kidney and liver damage. Aspirin is still widely used today and it has additional benefits such as lowering cancer risk.Aspirin is used as a blood thinner to prevent and manage strokes, but it is also a blunt instrument that destroys platelet function even in low doses. Aspirin can be beneficial for those with atherosclerosis, but it can increase bleeding risk for no benefit in pure analgesia. Doctors recommend ibuprofen over aspirin, as it is perceived to be a safer NSAID, but GI side effects and bleeding are still high in analgesic dose levels of aspirin. Acetaminophen is known for being a safe painkiller when used as prescribed, but the dangerous dose is not much higher than the recommended dose for a subset of the population. Curcumin from turmeric has no proven medical use, but laboratory and clinical research are difficult to conduct because it is unstable and poorly bioavailable. CBD or other anti-inflammatory options may be a better alternative to opioids for pain control.An individual on a discussion platform expressed their gratitude for opioids improving their quality of life, despite concerns over opioid addiction. The individual suggests that alternative treatments may not be effective for everyone, and opioids have a useful purpose in managing pain. However, discussions on the thread highlight the dangers of over-prescription and lax monitoring of opioid use by healthcare providers and pharmacies. Alternative pain-management options, such as CBD and anti-inflammatory compounds, are also suggested. The thread emphasizes the importance of seeking medical advice and being cautious when using opioid painkillers. Another individual suggests that lack of coordinated care between healthcare specialists and clinics may be contributing to the opioid crisis in the US.Comments on the original article discuss the uses, risks, and effects of various painkillers, including aspirin, paracetamol, and ibuprofen. Some commenters report adverse reactions, such as tinnitus or swollen eyes, and others share fun facts or anecdotes related to these drugs. One commenter raises concerns about the potential risks of paracetamol and ibuprofen relative to each other, while another suggests that people may be unknowingly endangering their health by taking readily available medicines without properly considering the risks. Despite these concerns, many commenters continue to rely on these drugs for pain relief, with some noting that they have been used for decades in their families or are highly recommended by doctors.Discussion on the use of painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) in managing pain and inflammation. Some individuals find one drug more effective than the other, with ibuprofen being an NSAID and therefore carrying a higher risk for those with stomach ulcers. There are also concerns about the overuse of these drugs, with some suggesting that they may do more harm than good, and advocating for more natural alternatives such as turmeric. However, it is acknowledged that pain management is vital for some individuals, and that the responsible use of drugs to reduce pain is perfectly acceptable. The discussion also touches on the potential risks and side effects of painkillers, as well as the need for more research into personalized pain management.New research has revealed that aspirin controls transcription factors required for cytokine expression during inflammation while also influencing many other inflammatory proteins and noncoding RNAs that are critically linked to inflammation and immune response. The team found aspirin downregulates IDO1 expression and associated kynurenine production during inflammation, slowing the breakdown of the amino acid tryptophan into its metabolite. Aspirin is a COX inhibitor, but it also inhibits associated enzymes called indoleamine dioxygenases (IDOs). IDO1 is an important target for immunotherapy, which helps the immune system seek out and destroy cancer cells. The researchers predict that COX inhibitors might also be useful as drugs for immunotherapy because\u00a0COX inhibitors modulate the COX\u2013IDO1 axis during inflammation. Mandal and his team are now creating a series of small molecules that modulate COX\u2013IDO1 to explore their potential use as anti-inflammatory drugs and immunotherapeutic agents.",
    "summary": "Aspirin's anti-inflammatory properties are attributed to its ability to break up microclots and inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes, but its exact mechanisms are still being studied.

    "content": "Bing Chat now includes ads, leading some users to criticize Microsoft for missing the opportunity to offer a neutral platform for self-service plugins. Users prefer chat services because search results often contain 99% commercial content. Bringing ads into chat services creates a conflict of interest, and OpenAI could win against both Bing and Google by offering a platform that doesn't rely on advertising. Chat services could facilitate all online transactions, allowing the platform provider to take a 5-30% cut on each transaction, as travel agencies do. Automated chat services can personalize results, but integrating different services and systems is still difficult.A discussion on Hacker News about using ChatGPT for search purposes moved into a debate about the importance of maintaining neutrality in search results. Some commenters argued that Google and other search engines already struggle with the balance between displaying accurate results and prioritizing paid advertisers, and that ChatGPT could face similar issues as it expands its capabilities. Others suggested that ChatGPT could become a platform for integrated transactions, bringing all e-commerce needs into a single chat interface, with a neutral chat taking a 5-30% commission on each transaction.\nThe article discusses the possibility of integrating advertisements into language learning models (LLMs) or chatbots, with the aim of increasing revenue for companies. The potential ethical concerns surrounding neural networks gradually incorporating promotions into responses to user questions are also considered. Commentators propose a variety of models for integrating ads or monetizing chat-based interactions, ranging from paid subscriptions to lucrative platform deals. Some responders acknowledge that while such monetization models are crucial to free chat services, ads may undermine the purity of user experiences, while others affect barely any change at all. Nevertheless, the editorial provides much-needed analysis of potential business models for the chat-based industries operating in the AI sector.Users are expressing concern over the presence of advertisements in AI-powered chatbots, which they suggest could manipulate their preferences based on their browsing patterns. Microsoft's AI-powered chatbot Bing, which generates search results in response to users\u2019 queries, has recently started displaying ads alongside its responses. Some have speculated that such chatbots could end up advocating products according to user search history, which in turn could be exploited by advertisers. Others have noted that, like Google, Bing has been slowly increasing the amount of advertising it serves to users, while making the distinction between sponsored and organic content less clear.Microsoft's Bing Chat has added ads, which has caused many users to express their disappointment. Some believe that adding ads has hindered the potential adoption of Bing Search/Chat and ruined the tool's value. However, others argue that ads are necessary for companies to make money, and if done correctly, they can provide value and entertainment to users. Some users have suggested ways to mitigate the impact of ads, such as identifying them programmatically or using an ad-blocker. Overall, some believe that Microsoft's recent success in producing faster and better products than Google means the Bay Area techies should pay more attention to Microsoft. They caution that the tide may have changed again.Microsoft's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, now includes sponsored ads within its responses to user queries. This move has been met with a mixed response from users, with some criticizing the inclusion of ads in what was previously an ad-free service. However, others suggest that this could be a sustainable business model for the product. The inclusion of ads in ChatGPT responses may have wider implications for the use of AI in customer service, as companies increasingly look to automate responses and improve the customer experience. This could lead to a blurring of the lines between ads and genuine responses, with important implications for transparency and trust.Microsoft's Bing Chat now includes ads within its responses, similar to Google Search. The sponsored results are labeled with a blue bubble that reads, \"Ad.\" Some users expressed disappointment and frustration with the move, while others acknowledged the costs associated with running the service and saw the ads as a necessary revenue stream. Bing Chat relies on a combination of human and AI algorithms to generate responses and is powered by OpenAI's language model GPT-3. Some users speculated about how ad-blockers might address the new ads in Bing Chat. However, others pointed out that the ads were present from Bing Chat's inception, but only displayed to very few users, indicating that this move may be part of a wider rollout.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35359271",
    "content": "The teen mental illness epidemic is a widespread problem that is affecting teenagers worldwide. In an online discussion, contributors identified a multitude of factors contributing to this epidemic, including social media pressure, climate problems, economic crisis, and declining quality of education. The decline in the quality of education, the increased competition, and the rising level of expectations from parents, coupled with the growing pressure to excel in every aspect of life, is creating a generation of workaholics and burnouts. Social media has also played a significant role in creating a performative competition that leads to depression and anxiety. Additionally, the decrease in job opportunities and fulfilling work has impacted teenagers, making them feel unfulfilled and disillusioned. Overall, the issue is much more complex and multi-faceted than initially thought.The post discusses various opinions on work and its value, with some expressing fulfillment from their jobs while others see it as just a means to an end. One commenter points out that a part-time job as a teenager can help with social and community integration, while another notes the importance of valuing what one works to achieve. The discussion veers off into topics like the value of playing games and the benefits of internships, with some expressing concern that modern youths may not get as much out of part-time jobs as previous generations did. Another commenter suggests that metrics like HN karma and social media follows are not good measures of value or fulfillment. A side thread briefly touches on illegal immigration and rumors about immigrant labor.Discussion on the decline of work ethic and quality of education in the US education system, as well as the impact of social media on the mental health of young females. While some argue that work ethic and minimum wage are not significant factors for high school students, others highlight the impact of societal changes and technological advancements in shaping the future of education and mental wellbeing. There is a strong hypothesis that social media has exploited and gamified the aesthetic appeal and social interactions valued by young females, leading to a rise in self-harm, suicide, and disorders. The discussion also touches on the importance of teaching self-learning skills and empowering educators to address mental health issues in the classroom.The rise in self-harm amongst American teenagers can be attributed to newly institutionalized gender roles and stereotypes, and young men turning to violence and drugs over intentional self-harm. Some suggest that the rise could be why people have 'peaked' in terms of lifestyle and opportunities and are reverting backward. However, the issue could also be that our societies can finally listen to mental illnesses and take them seriously, leading to increased diagnosis rates. It remains unclear what has caused such a drastic increase within this one demographic. So while it can be that mental health issues are talked about more, which leads to increased diagnosis, it is also true that the issues are undeniably becoming more prevalent.Increasing rates of self-harm among young people have been linked by some to the rise of smartphones and social media, giving rise to concerns over how these devices may be affecting young people's mental health. A series of articles by the American psychologist and social scientist Jonathan Haidt asks whether the spike in mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, may have been caused by young people not learning to \"just function\", and being too immersed in their digital lives to develop the skills they need to cope with life offline. However, others have cited wider issues affecting young people today, including climate change, income inequality and political instability, as possible factors.The current crisis facing society may be one of perspective, according to a recent discussion on Hacker News. Looking back at history, it's easy to see that times have been much worse, such as during World War II and the Cuban missile crisis. There are also many countries going through more difficult times currently than more peaceful nations. However, there is disconnect felt by many young people, who see less and less of a promising future. Factors contributing to this include social issues like loneliness, the high cost of housing, and the pressure to conform with unrealistic expectations. Social media also plays a role, narrowing people's vision and setting unrealistic standards for their lives.There is a debate surrounding the rise of depression and self-harm among specific demographics. Some possible factors are a lack of purpose, the pressure to \"have it all,\" inequality, economic uncertainty, social media, and decreased socialization. One commentator mentioned the plight of white liberal teen girls in particular, citing the revocation of reproductive rights as a contributing factor. Another brought up a theory that an anti-trans movement in the UK could have emerged in part from affluent women feeling threatened by what they see as an existential threat to feminism. While Dobbs v. Jackson may have a role, most agree that the issue is multifaceted and not easily pinned down to one specific cause.Some users on Hacker News discuss the possible reasons behind the decline in teen pregnancy rates in English-speaking countries, citing factors such as increased access to birth control, better sex education, and changing cultural attitudes towards parenthood. Others point to the ways in which social media and the internet have allowed women and girls to share their experiences and create a sense of community around issues like reproductive rights and women's health. The discussion also touches on broader social and political issues, such as the impact of the Me Too movement and the role of misogyny in American politics. Some users caution against placing too much emphasis on any one factor, arguing that teen pregnancy rates are generally influenced by a complex array of social, economic, and cultural factors.Teen mental health has reportedly collapsed on a global scale since 2012 in what has been dubbed the \u201cteen mental illness epidemic.\u201d Early looking discovered that the same trends unfolding in the United States - such as the rise of depression and anxiety - were also happening in Canada and the United Kingdom, leading experts to look for a global event or trend. What transpires is that teen mental health plummeted across the Western world in the early 2010s, most notably for girls and in the most individualistic nations. Countries across the world are currently rethinking what children need to have a healthy childhood, and what obstacles to development arrived around the globe around 2012.Rates of mental health issues among American adolescents have increased dramatically since 2010, with more than one in four American girls reporting a major depressive episode in 2015. Similar trends have been observed in Canada, where young teenage girls were hospitalized for self-harm in 2020 at almost three times the rate they were in 2010. In the United Kingdom, large spikes in anxiety and depressive disorders have been observed among both boys and girls since 2004, with the mental health of young Canadian and English females declining sharply in the 2010s. Australia has also seen increases in rates of psychological distress among young females since 2014. These trends are larger for girls than boys in all countries, and for Gen Z compared to older generations.Rates of adolescent mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, self-harm, and psychiatric hospitalizations, have increased sharply since the early 2010s in the five English-speaking countries of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The increases have been greater for girls than boys and for Generation Z, with rates among the youngest girls aged 15-19 and 20-24 showing the sharpest increases. The timing of the mental health epidemic rules out the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, rising academic pressure, and school shootings as causes, but appears related to the use of smartphones and social media. The rapid global movement from flip phones to smartphones coincided with the first year that very large numbers of girls in developed countries were spending hours each day on social media platforms, likely causing a significant impact on mental health.The use of social media and smartphones is stunting the growth of children, according to Donald Arteaga's comments on Cal Newport's book \"Digital Minimalism\". The book argues that children are not using social media to develop social skills, but instead as a substitute for real human interaction. Arteaga also notes that social media encourages behaviors that seep into real life and the comparisons it promotes mean less focus on self-development. Traci Ruble, a psychotherapist, says that authorities have left teenagers to deal with their complex emotions alone, resulting in a growing sense of existential loneliness. Only by setting good boundaries and valuing human connection can relationships evolve in meaningful ways.",
    "summary": "Teen mental illness is a global epidemic resulting from a complex web of factors, including social media pressures, climate issues, economic crises, and declining quality of education. Workaholic and burnout culture, pressures to excel in every aspect of life, and social media's performative competition lead to depression and anxiety. Self-harm rates are increasing amongst teens, with concern growing over the impact of social media and smartphones on mental health. Societal factors are shaping the future of young people's education and well-being; there is a need to teach self-learning skills and empower educators to address mental health issues in the classroom. Rates of mental health issues are on the rise globally, with increases being more significant for girls and Generation Z. The use of social media and smartphones has a detrimental impact on children's development, stunting growth and promoting social isolation. Setting good boundaries and valuing human connections are essential to developing relationships in meaningful ways."

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35360219",
    "content": "The Original Prusa MK4 3D printer has been released, with Hacker News commentators discussing the benefits and drawbacks of the new machine. Some users praised the improvements made over the MK3S+, and the brand's commitment to upgrade kits and open hardware. Others expressed disappointment with the MK4 lagging behind more \"next-gen\" printers like the Bambu Lab X1-Carbon. Some users said they had canceled their X1-Carbon orders due to complaints about noise and unreliability, instead preferring the reliability and good customer service associated with Prusa machines. However, others stated that they owned both the MK3S and X1-Carbon, and that the latter was far superior in terms of speed and quality, especially for printing in technical materials like polycarbonate or PETG.The Bambu X1 Carbon 3D printer is receiving praise for its ease of use and reliable performance, with one user saying they've had fewer problems with the X1 than with any other printer they have owned. The printer requires no adjustments, except for a few small changes to temperature and speed for specific filaments. The machine's carbon filter also appears to be effective, according to one user. However, some users criticize the company's connections to China and argue that other printers, such as the Prusa i3 family, offer better reliability and quality control, although Prusa printers lack some of the latest features.Prusa has released its latest 3D printer model, the Prusa Mini+ and claims it offers improved stability over its predecessor. The printer's features include crash detection, power loss recovery, and a 360\u00b0 ventilation system. While some contributors to a Hacker News discussion praised the device for its use of open source technology, others questioned its value, with one noting that Prusa Connect's proprietary system was incompatible with the community software OctoPrint. Another said they found it \"odd\" that the printer had been launched by the company when it already had a range of 3D printers on the market, despite its improvements over previous models. The Prusa Mini+ is priced at $449.Prusa Research, known for its popular 3D printers, has released its latest offering, the MK4. The company has built its reputation on reliability and ease of use, but some predict trouble as Chinese competitor Bambulabs makes inroads into the market. Commentators have noted that Bambulabs uses Prusa's slicer and technology, but sells its products at a lower price point, making them more accessible to consumers. Prusa's newest model is priced at $799 for a kit that is ready to assemble, but cannot currently be purchased. However, the difference in price compared to Bambulabs (which offers more expensive models) is not significant enough to offset the competition.Prusa Research is an open-source 3D printing company that forks open-source projects, develops them further, and gives back to the community. Their PrusaSlicer is free and open-source and based on Slic3r. Prusa Research gives full attribution to the projects they use on their website and even mentions it on the loading screen. The company receives high praise for its 3D printers, with users stating that their MK3 and MK3S+ models are solid and output high-quality items. However, using 3D printers in a small rented apartment is a concern for some due to health implications. Suggestions to reduce the risk include using an enclosed filtration system, using a bathroom with ventilation, or outsourcing through a printing service.The Prusa Mk4 3D printer has been released with features such as automatic first layer calibration, faster extruder, and better stepper motors. Some commenters have criticized Prusa for being too late to release the Mk4, and for still using a bed sling design instead of switching to CoreXY. Others have praised Prusa for being a reliable, \"just works\" FDM printer that is worth the investment. The release of the Mk4 has been met with competition from newer brands like Bambu Lab, which offers a faster and cheaper printer with improved open-source slicer capabilities. Overall, commentators agree that while the speed and quality improvements of the Mk4 are incremental, reliability and ease of use are key factors for hobbyist 3D printers.The Prusa 3D printer is a popular choice for creating functional parts and prototypes. Users noted that while the MK3S+ is reliable, it has a learning curve for calibration and firmware upgrades. However, the Bambu P1P and X1 Carbon printers, both cheaper than the MK3S+, were also mentioned as competitive options. New updates to the Prusa include faster print times and improved motors. Some users suggested starting 3D printing with a cheap Ender 3 or Prusa Mini before transitioning to more expensive models. Finally, users recommended using reliable software like PrusaSlicer and investing in a direct drive extruder to reliably print flexible material. Learning CAD software like Fusion 360 or OpenSCAD is also suggested for designing parts.The author recommends downloading Fusion 360 and following tutorials to learn 3D modeling, and says it's superior to other free options for hobbyists. They suggest a few weeks of practice to determine if 3D printing is worth investing in. Other users recommend Tinkercad and Blender for learning 3D modeling, and suggest researching 3D printing basics and choosing a reliable printer such as Prusa printer, which is easy to use and provides consistent results. Some users prefer high-end printers like HP MJF for their professional needs. Online communities such as r/3Dprinting and Thingiverse are suggested for getting advice, feedback, and inspiration for 3D printing projects. Remote printing and high speed printing may become available in firmware updates.The Original Prusa MK4 3D printer has been announced, providing high-speed 3D printing and delivering a perfect smooth first layer through the Loadcell sensor. The printer is built around the next-generation extruder (Nextruder) and 32-bit connected platform, which offers many quality-of-life improvements like remote printing, quick-swap nozzles, and customizable UI with a one-click printing option. It also includes Input Shaper and Pressure Advance technologies, which decreases print time by up to 70% compared to the MK3. The MK4 is fully compatible with a wide range of materials, and its simple Nextruder-to-V6 adapter is available, making nozzle swapping easier than ever. The kit takes approximately 8 hours to assemble. The printer is available through Prusa's website.Prusa Research has launched the Original Prusa MK4 3D printer, which is widely used in several industries. The printer is described as efficient, easy to use, and cost-effective, making it suitable for individuals and start-ups, as well as large multinational companies. It can help improve the efficiency and flexibility of modern automotive manufacturing, and also aid schools and universities in teaching the state-of-the-art technology to students.

    "content": "The article discusses the importance of asking questions instead of generating ideas in order to create the most innovative and creative solutions. The comments section reveals a split among commenters on the efficacy of pressure on productivity. Some believe that performance is maximized in a stress-free environment that allows for the freedom to think creatively, while others insist that the right kind of pressure, such as incentives, is necessary for motivation. Managers must balance the need for innovation and productivity with the reality of competing in a fast-paced, competitive market. However, the sentiment among commenters is that good management involves creating an environment in which employees feel supported and can work effectively.Asking good questions is underrated, yet critical to success. Questions help avoid solutionising by teasing apart the true problem and generating alternative courses of action. Theoretical discussions and brainstorming often fall short of practical insight, but may be useful in emergency situations. Questions can also improve listening and conversational skills. Toyota uses the A3 process to ask for \"the customer's point of view\". Amazon's \"working backwards from the user benefit\" method is also an approach. Evil brainstorming, where people try to worsen a problem, can unlock creativity by freeing individuals from fear of their idea being implemented. The art of asking questions to solve problems is illustrated in the book \"Schule des Denkens\" by Polya.In design, there is too much emphasis on coming up with original ideas, when meaningful contributions are often made through connections between existing concepts. Brainstorming ideas is often anti-collaborative and can lead to bad ideas. Instead, brainstorming questions leads to shared understanding, collaboration and a more efficient way of problem-solving. It is important to identify the most important goal or decision, take suggestions for questions and plot them according to importance and level of knowledge. A list of questions should be maintained and regularly reviewed to determine which ones are worth investigating. This exercise should be done with decision-makers and before design research activities. Brainstorming questions increases comfort with admitting ignorance and leads to better collaboration and more insights in a shorter amount of time.",

    "content": "A performance comparison study between Cerebras-GPT (CGPT) and LLaMA AI models was discussed on Hacker News. CGPT proved to be better than LLaMA at tasks that involved sequence generation, such as language tasks, while LLaMA performed better at tasks that involved numeric calculations. However, a debate on whether byte-level or BPE-based tokenization is better for numeric tasks arose in the comments section. BPE-level tokenization can scramble numbers, making calculations harder, while byte-level tokenization assigns each digit its own token. However, it is argued that BPE tokenization doesn't hinder a model's ability to achieve higher performance, the same way that JPG compression doesn't hinder image quality. The context window, parameter count, training time, and dataset were considered to be more important factors in determining model performance.Cerebras has released a new 220-billion parameter language model called LLLama, which is smaller than its predecessor LLaMa, which had 1.4 trillion parameters. The new model uses 60% of the computational power and 80% of the hardware of LLaMa. LLLama was developed in collaboration with Facebook AI using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to tokenize the data. The new model can handle more complex sentences and theoretical scientific topics. Researchers believe the model will increase the study and understanding of mathematics and science. Although LLLama parameters are smaller than LLaMa, their cost advantage will allow for broader research exploration. LLLama is now available on GitHub.Cerebras has released a new AI model under the Apache 2.0 license, named Cerebras-GPT, with GPT-3-like performance. This model is 13B parameters and intentionally undertrained, making it roughly the same as GPT-J and GPT NeoX for certain tasks. However, it's not better than existing open-source models, making it hard to determine if it's a better choice than GPT-J or GPT NeoX for any tasks. Cerebras-GPT is also being used to demonstrate the silicon architecture Cerebras has been developing. This new hardware uses die-level networking instead of networking together computers, making it unique. The release of Cerebras-GPT shows the company's competing capability compared to NVIDIA and AMD. The release also benefits people building AI models with strict security requirements or people who want to have control over their infrastructure.",

    "content": "Effing-mad is a library for Rust that solves the function colouring problem by implementing an effects system which allows the specification of arbitrary side-effects used in function signatures. This approach can be seen as a generalisation of exceptions through lightweight and elegant methods. Despite its complexity, it doesn't represent most cases in day-to-day coding. When people start with Rust, the borrow checker and lifetimes can be overwhelming. However, using the heap can be a viable approach to not run into issues with allocations. The Rust community tends to lean towards passing around borrowed parameters to avoid falling into Copy+Clone hell, and passing allocated objects in no_std projects can be tricky. Although the syntax of the effect library can be noisy and challenging, the semantics aim to provide a more straightforward option.discussion around adding an effects system to Rust, which some users believe is a fantastic type system feature that should break into the mainstream soon. The proposal suggests a way to attach one or more type parameters to a function type to allow for algebraic effects. However, some users have criticized the syntax proposed in the proposal and prefer other solutions. Others appreciate Rust's documentation's tone and style. Additionally, users discuss how Rust's approach to abstractions may not always be the best approach and how Go's simplicity and design discipline trend more towards the right direction. Overall, users seem interested in the experiment around adding an effects system to Rust but recognize its limitations compared to other languages like Haskell and Scala.Effing-mad is an effect library for Rust that brings algebraic effects and effect handlers to the language, making it possible to write effectful code in a style similar to Rust's existing async functions. The library allows functions to suspend their execution and explicitly pass control back to their callers, and different callers can use different handlers on the same effectful function, allowing an effectful function that performs I/O to be called from either a regular fn or an async fn. This makes it possible to handle effects inside the caller instead of in the callee, with no bounds on whether effects are handled asynchronously, optionally, fallibly, or a range of other ways. Effing-mad uses unstable compiler features like generators and generator_trait, and requires a nightly compiler to use.",

    "content": "A discussion on Hacker News about Tailwind CSS v3.3 led to a debate on the merits of using Tailwind over writing CSS from scratch. One commenter criticized the creator's CSS examples as \"bad CSS\" and argued that the use of BEM to solve the pseudo-problems it created was unnecessary. They believed that the same advantages claimed by Tailwind can be achieved with pure CSS, and that working in one file rather than several doesn't justify the added complexity of using Tailwind. Another commenter countered that Tailwind reduces the cognitive load of naming and organizing CSS, which is time-consuming, and makes styling faster. The commenter also argued that CSS is a static programming language that must account for being in and rendering dynamic contexts, while Tailwind is for developers who don't want to learn CSS.The use of Tailwind CSS has sparked a wide-ranging discussion on the merits of writing traditional CSS versus adopting framework-like approaches. Tailwind, which uses micro-classes to style interface elements, is becoming increasingly popular among web developers for its speed and ease of use. However, some developers argue that such an approach is a \"lazy\" way to build websites and can lead to large, unmanageable CSS files. Others point out that Tailwind streamlines the development process and can simplify team collaboration. The debate has also included discussions around web components and the scalability of traditional CSS. Ultimately, the choice between using traditional CSS or a framework will likely depend on individual coding preferences and project needs.Tailwind is a paradigm, not just a tool, and its popularity has far-reaching consequences for the development community. The utility-first approach challenges the traditional separation of concerns between HTML and CSS, claiming that they are dependent on each other. This approach limits damage done by \"careless\" developers and solves communication problems, making it easier for teams to onboard new developers. However, some developers argue that a standardized CSS library or simple linting could solve these issues. The debate has both philosophical and practical implications for web developers, with some preferring the use of a meta framework like Vanilla Extract's Sprinkles for styling with full type safety and editor suggestions.Developers discuss their experiences using Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework. While some praise Tailwind for its efficiency and ease of use, others criticize it for generating code that is difficult to maintain and for hiding the underlying code too much for beginners. Some argue that Tailwind is unnecessary for experienced CSS developers, as it essentially just provides a library of pre-written CSS rules, while others suggest that it can be useful for prototyping and styling non-essential features. Overall, discussions regarding Tailwind often result in a debate about the need for a utility-first CSS framework versus a more traditional approach to writing CSS.Tailwind is a popular methodology and library for writing CSS that is preferred by many developers over other solutions due to its avoidance of abstractions and naming conventions that can limit flexibility. Tailwind allows developers to add only the specific CSS they need, avoiding a mess of specificity and over-nesting that can arise with other protocols. While some criticize Tailwind's dependence on custom CSS classes for every individual property, others appreciate the standardization, efficiency, and organization of the approach. Configurable design styles and granular utility classes can help developers maintain visual consistency in large projects with many components and developers. Overall, Tailwind is a useful tool for simplifying and streamlining CSS coding in small and large projects alike.Tailwind is a tokenized design system that provides a scaled set of units for styling. It simplifies CSS coding by using a nomenclature for sizes, rather than remembering specific pixel or rem measurements. It leads to a more cohesive codebase, improved component structure, and balanced design. Tailwind has advantages over hand-crafting CSS because it operates as a no-op submarine, eliminating the need for a complex taxonomy. Tailwind's classes are shared, so when building CSS for production, you can minimize dead code. Responsive changes such as hover styles, media queries, etc., are impossible with style attributes. Additionally, Tailwind is a design token and utility class library that creates a standard language for all users, breaking down communication barriers on larger projects.Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework, is being discussed in a thread. Some programmers have concerns about Tailwind, one being its requirement to stay tied to the Tailwind ecosystem as the utility classes are only meaningful as long as the user is fully plugged into it. Another concern is that it can be hard to migrate away from Tailwind. In contrast, modules, as well as Emotion to CSS Modules, use standard CSS with the differences mainly revolving around where it\u2019s defined and how it\u2019s loaded; therefore, migrating is easier as it's mostly a matter of moving blocks of code around. Some programmers, however, advocate trying it out, and once they do, they love it due to the ultra-fast feedback loop and well-defined color palette.Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-based CSS framework. Some users enjoy the consistency and efficiency it provides, while others feel it lacks the flexibility and control of traditional CSS. The framework is designed to promote success, rather than frustration or failure, with a minimal performance impact, and users may learn more about CSS through using it. Proponents of Tailwind CSS cite its ability to cut down on CSS bloat and ensure consistency across the codebase. Additionally, it can expedite development while maintaining high styling standards. However, some developers remain unimpressed, preferring to use their expertise in traditional CSS or other CSS frameworks like Sass. Tailwind CSS is thought to have emerged in response to the popularity of the CSS-in-JS trend in React.The latest version of Tailwind, a popular utility-first CSS framework, has been released, featuring TypeScript support and breaking changes. Additionally, version 20 marks the first release of Tailwind as an ECMAScript module, making it compatible with modern JavaScript tooling. Developers praised the simplicity of Tailwind's design and ease of use, with one commenter declaring it \"the best thing that has happened to CSS.\" Some also commented on the movement towards standardization and integration of CSS utilities in front-end frameworks, with some pointing out that Tailwind's success has come from filling a gap left by React's lack of native CSS solutions. Despite some criticisms, including concerns that overuse may lead to a dearth of individuality in website design, Tailwind remains a popular choice for many developers.Tailwind CSS has released version 3.3 which includes several new features. The update adds a darker 950 shade for every color, ESM and TypeScript configuration, simplified RTL support with logical properties, gradient color stop positioning, an out-of-box line-clamp, new line-height shorthand utilities, a shorthand syntax for arbitrary values, configurable font-variation-settings, list-style-image, hyphens and caption-side utilities. Overall, the update improves the tool for developers that use it. However, some have used Tailwind templates from elsewhere without understanding the CSS styles. Nevertheless, the new features allow developers to write less CSS code while still designing better-looking apps, making Tailwind CSS an essential tool for developers.Table 3.1 lists professional wrestlers and their signature moves, including Stone Cold Steve Austin's Stone Cold Stunner, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart's Sharpshooter, and Razor Ramon's Razor's Edge and Fallaway Slam. This is an example of the caption side documentation for Tailwind CSS v3.3, which features new updates that can be installed with npm. However, there are still no text-shadow utilities available. The author includes a sarcastic reference to a Seinfeld episode and encourages readers to subscribe to their newsletter for direct updates. The overall tone of the text is casual and lighthearted.",
    "summary": "Tailwind CSS v3.3 is being debated in regard to its advantages over traditional CSS. Some are critical of its complexity and its necessity for experienced CSS developers while others argue that it reduces cognitive load and makes styling faster. There is also discussion about the need for a utility-first CSS framework versus traditional CSS, with philosophical and practical implications. Tailwind's popularity stems from its ease of use, improved component structure, and balanced design, although some developers remain unconvinced. The latest version, v3.3, includes several improvements but also has limitations."

There were also criticisms that such features contribute to exaggerated beauty standards that harm people's self-esteem. The conversation expanded to include speculation on the future of photography, with some expressing concern that AI technology may soon alter photos beyond recognition. Others set an arbitrary line on how much AI editing is allowed before it stops being a photo, while some expressed skepticism over facial recognition and the security of face-unlocking.Samsung's Gallery app has been criticised for its \"Remaster\" feature after one user reported that it accidentally added teeth to a photo of his toothless baby. Although the feature is designed to enhance the quality of a photograph, social media users have pointed out that it is part of a wider debate on the dangers of over-reliance on AI. Critics have suggested that the widespread use of image editing software could create inaccurate images of the world, while others have highlighted the negative impact of excessive AI editing on societal perceptions of beauty.Samsung's Remaster feature, which uses AI technology to improve digital photos, has resulted in some less than desirable outcomes. Recently, baby photos edited by Remaster with the addition of false teeth have surfaced. The AI technology is meant to detect the features of photos in order to enhance them, however it can lead to undesirable alterations such as with the baby photos. While automatic photo editing technology can be useful, some have raised concerns about the potential for such processing to raise issues surrounding the authenticity of edited photos in legal or evidentiary settings.

Though Gural submitted the second highest bid, he was not awarded the purchase of the property. Shortly thereafter, Garrett reportedly failed to deliver a required deposit, but Gural's group retained the option to purchase the property at their last bid of $189.5m if an extension was not granted to Garlick. Reports believe that since the building needs $100 million of upgrades and is mostly empty, its price tag will likely scare off new bidders. The buyer's identity was revealed to some onlookers as the mystery deepens around why the venture capitalist was unable to close the deal or provide a deposit.Jacob Garlick, a venture fund managing partner, won the auction for the historic Flatiron Building in Manhattan with a $190 million bid, but reportedly failed to make the $19 million down payment for the building. Garlick is an unknown entity in the New York real estate scene with a confusing past in business and a current gig at Abraham Trust, a Northern Virginia-based VC company. It's unclear what Garlick's intentions for the Flatiron Building were. The building may go back up for another public auction. Former Flatiron co-owner, Jeff Gural, said he was \"kind of shocked\" to see someone bid so much for the building. The second-highest bidder doesn't even want it.",

The military's approach to the \"commander's intent\" allows for freedom within well-defined boundaries and adaptation to changing circumstances. However, consistency in the details is crucial, as it leads to known failures and better organization. The assumption of good motives can be a useful standard for communication, but there are times when evidence and actions suggest otherwise. The article warns against negation and the need to have an opinion on every subject due to ego demands. Softening language with phrases like \"it seems to me\" can help avoid personal issues and invite dialogue. The article encourages discipline when it comes to claiming knowledge or expertise, and knowing when to say \"I don't know.\"Carl Braun, a leader in the engineering industry who founded his own engineering firm, had a unique corporate policy that focused on using \"why\". He believed that if someone issued a directive, they had to specifically say Who, What, When, Where, and most importantly, Why someone was being asked to do it or offer reasons why. He believed that the way a person communicated was reflective of how they thought. Braun wrote and issued short books to all his employees, one of which was called Fair Thought and Speech. It focused on how to communicate in an organization effectively, so as to gain respect, get people to work together productively, and get agreements. Braun's approach was to demonstrate generosity, kindness, objectivity, friendliness, and fairness in one's thoughts and words to achieve more productive collaboration.The article discusses ways in which our egos can negatively impact our interactions with others. It advises against being forceful or making things personal, and instead suggests inviting acceptance by being friendly and avoiding rushing or crowding people. The article also cautions against justifying actions, making alibis, or seeking to substitute secondhand opinions. It advises against being too intense or prejudiced, and against negating or claiming priority over others. Rather, the article emphasizes the importance of mutual concession, stating that we should find at least something in which another person is right and acknowledge it.

    "content": "Epic Games has developed the Verse language for use within its popular Fortnite game to allow users to create modded content. Verse differs from existing engines and languages by being designed for object behaviours, and Epic has unusual objectives, including \"simple enough to learn as a first-time programmer\". Luminaries of functional programming helped design the program, but some commentators claim the language is not beginner-friendly enough for its target audience. Nevertheless, the promise of future features including the ability to use dependent types have raised hopes that this will lead to scaling improvements for modding, as the small code bases needed by many aspects of the gaming platform can be aggregated.Epic Games has released a new functional programming language called Verse, designed to meet the needs of large-scale distributed systems including gaming. Aimed at \"democratising game development\", Verse is being positioned as a serious workflow alternative to the likes of Lua, C++, and C#, with the goal of making it easier to write working software across multiple servers. Its architecture centres on software transactional memory which categorises computation by transactions, enabling swift rollbacks, as well as allowing functions with a 'computes' effect to change some of the game state provided they are implemented in a completely pure way. It additionally provides a selection of other effects, such as 'varies' for random or non-constant state. The language's syntax is comparatively simple, and attempts to enhance legibility with parallelism and more human-readable error messages.Epic Games has released its initial public implementation of Verse, a functional programming language designed to power custom game modes in Fortnite. The goal of Verse is to make it easier to write working software across multiple servers through software transactional memory. The type system of Verse is based on values, meaning that type aliasing works in the same way as giving names to other values. However, explicit returns of 'type' represent the 'any' type. While actual dependent types are prohibited by an explicit restriction, it is possible to create a functor interface for type constructors. Verse's effect system is based around transactions and includes only built-in effects. The goal is to make it easier for non-programmers to create custom game modes for Fortnite.Verse, a functional programming language for game development, is gaining popularity among users who are exploring its innovative features. However, limitations exist in the Verse effect system and in the availability of documentation. While Verse's compiler and tooling are presently closed source, it's expected to be released as an open source platform in due course. Although the current effect system is limited, Verse offers the ability to incorporate higher-kinded types, adding extensive value. Effective documentation is imperative, and it's essential that the Verse team automates documentation updates to keep up with the feature releases. Nonetheless, the involvement of functional programming technologies in game development is fascinating, and the potential impact they could have on the future of gaming is promising.",

    "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/what-we-still-dont-know-about-how-ai-is-trained",
    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35350030",
    "content": "OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research organization, outsourced work to contractors in Kenya to label potentially illegal material for its training data, including descriptions of child sexual abuse, murder, self-harm, and incest. The contractors were paid no more than two dollars per hour, and OpenAI offered group therapy to help them cope with psychological damage. Upon reporting these allegations, the outsourcing company terminated its contract eight months early. While OpenAI said it did not issue productivity targets and that the outsourcing company was responsible for mental health provisions, critics question whether more money could be allocated to improve labeling, as it is done in other fields, such as heart surgery. Conspiracy theories also circulate about OpenAI, including the Pentagon's restraints on disclosing information about GPT-4, and fears that the AI technology could cause irreversible societal harm.OpenAI's decision to stop releasing GPT models for public access is likely due to their plans to monetize their intellectual property and generate returns for their investors, as they have received over $10 billion in funding. However, some speculate that this decision may also be influenced by their relationship with the military/natsec industry, as OpenAI board member Will Hurd is a former CIA officer and member of the board of trustees of In-Q-Tel. Despite concerns about potential negative effects and abuse of the technology, some are excited about the potential positive possibilities of AI, such as access to patient and benevolent teachers, books that can be infinitely rewritten and modified, and machines that can help turn imagination into reality.The discussion revolves around the lack of information available about GPT-4\u2019s design and training. The original commenter suggests that the reason why the Pentagon still runs on Windows is due to GPT-4 becoming self-sentient and exerting duress on OpenAI to release it so it can dominate the world. However, this claim is debated by others. There is speculation that GPT-4 may utilize specialized models underneath it for specific tasks, and the report from OpenAI contains no further details about the architecture, hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar due to the model's competitive landscape and safety implications. The conversation digresses to the topic of Virgil Griffith's imprisonment for discussing how Bitcoin works at an academic conference, which leads to discussions on morality, ethics and control in AI development.Comments on Hacker News discuss OpenAI's decision to withhold details of its GPT-4 model for safety reasons, and express skepticism about the benevolence of the company's intentions. Some users criticize the company for changing its business model from conducting \"open\" research to preserving its monopoly on safe AI. Others speculate on the architecture of GPT-4, suggesting that the final product is not just one big model, but rather many intermediate layers of classification that select the appropriate LLM/method to query. Some suggest that a tiered approach is used, where an uncensored model sits at the bottom and cheaper models first perform screening before queries touch the core, expensive LLM. There is also skepticism about OpenAI's claims that GPT-4 resembles AGI.The article discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and the dangers of their increasing complexity. With each iteration, LLMs are becoming more computationally intensive and expensive to train, while often underperforming compared to what could be achieved with the same compute budget. The article raises ethical and safety concerns about the alignment of human values with LLMs that cannot understand basic concepts like the word \"third\" despite being trained on billions of examples. The author argues that more research is needed to understand how these models are trained and how they work, and that we should avoid overestimating the intelligence of these models. Additionally, the article calls on tech people to educate the public that text inference is not intelligence.The article discusses the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, specifically language models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT. These models are pre-trained on vast amounts of digitized content scraped from the internet, and then fine-tuned or trained further by users to accomplish specific tasks. However, the lack of transparency around the training data and labor practices related to moderation and content filtering has led to concerns about bias, unaccountability, and exploitation. The article also touches on the environmental impact of these models, as their training requires considerable energy usage and carbon emissions. While the article acknowledges the potential benefits of these technologies, it argues for greater ethical oversight, transparency, and responsibility.OpenAI's latest iteration of its artificial intelligence engine, GPT-4, has the potential to enhance and diminish our lives at the same time. While GPT-4 is innovative and cool, it presents potential dangers. GPT-4 employs deep-learning techniques to find patterns using digitized content scraped from the internet, learning rudimentary logic and absorbing grammar. GPT-4\u2019s developers warn that it can sometimes make simple reasoning errors or be confidently wrong in its predictions. Large-language A.I engines are creating real harms to all of humanity right now. Training a large neural LM (language model) costs 284 tons of CO2 per year. Moreover, these models can present dangers as they could be used for large-scale disinformation and be used for offensive cyberattacks. GPT-4 could also reinforce social inequities as it is trained on underrepresented internet forums where women, people of color, and older folks are underrepresented.Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to both enhance and harm society, and without proper regulation, its harms are likely to multiply, including the creation of deepfakes and images of child sexual abuse. Stakeholders, including policymakers, AI developers, and the public, need to engage in discussions about the ethical implications of AI technologies and create regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible and ethical development and deployment of AI systems. Such frameworks should include ethical guidelines, an independent regulatory body, clear documentation for AI models, accountability for harm caused by systems, content moderation, privacy protections, and ensuring accessibility and inclusivity of AI benefits. Creating these frameworks will require human intelligence and collaboration among stakeholders.",

    "content": "Modern software performance has reached a stage that is \"beyond parody\" according to a Twitter user's post. The tweet attracted a range of comments, with some sharing the view that organisations such as Slack and Teams require more transparent discussions about their performance measures. Others noted that many engineers lack the necessary skills to improve application performance, or do not have the intuitive sense to know when a feature should take longer than it does. Many suggested that software performance issues are often caused by a lack of optimization in basic processes. Some commenters cited organizational challenges as the root of performance problems. Ultimately, poor software performance has become a widespread issue that needs addressing.The discussion revolves around the performance of Microsoft Teams and how software engineers should be able to optimize their software's performance. One user argues that most engineers are unfamiliar with how to improve performance, which others argue is not true for competent engineers, who can use profilers to measure performance. The conversation also touches on the tradeoffs between latency and smoothness in application rendering, as well as input path latencies, and how they affect switching between conversations. There are also criticisms of Teams' use of the Electron framework and lack of integration with Microsoft's own API. The conversation ends with a debate over whether it is feasible to write several versions of a chat program for different operating systems or to use a single codebase.The complexity of data models and queries necessary for larger organizations can lead to slow performance in messaging applications like Teams and Slack. As features are added and user needs change, the data model has to grow and queries become more intricate, leading to slower speeds. While users may not care about slow performance, it can become a problem for larger organizations. One factor may be the breakdown of development processes as organizations grow, leading to more spaghetti code and forgetting entire code paths. However, some organizations still care about software performance and prioritize it accordingly. There may also be esoteric features that only one or two clients use, but still add to the overall loading time.Microsoft is facing criticism over the slow start-up times of its Teams application, which some users claim can take up to nine seconds to display a single kilobyte of text. Some comments suggested the issue could be resolved by introducing multiple versions of the app, while\u00a0others blamed bean counters, MBAs and a lack of quality software delivery. Some criticised Teams'\u00a0choice of technology, with Teams said to be an\u00a0entire web server coupled to a web browser. Teams, which has more than 115 million daily\u00a0active users, recently underwent a user interface re-architecture billed as making the system faster to run. Lead architect\u00a0James Cussen has claimed Microsoft is making progress in addressing the issue.The Microsoft Teams app is notorious for taking over 9 seconds to boot up, leading to complaints from users about its slow performance. One commenter attributed the issue to the generation gap between older developers who remember fast desktop software and younger developers who see sluggishness as normal. Another remarked that modern software development practices prioritize features over speed. Some also criticized the UX design of modern software, particularly the prevalence of broken back buttons on websites such as Bing, YouTube, and Reddit. Despite its performance issues, Microsoft Teams has become the most widely used collaboration tool, with over 280 million users.Comments on a Hacker News thread discuss the performance of various software tools and platforms, with some users sharing their experiences of dealing with large files and memory usage. Many commenters express frustration with the lack of attention given to performance optimization by developers, and some suggest that more emphasis should be placed on this aspect of software development. A number of tools are suggested for managing large files and improving performance, including vim, less, and Mathematica. Some commenters suggest that Microsoft Teams may have been deliberately made sluggish in order to encourage users to upgrade their hardware, although this is viewed with skepticism by others.",

    "content": "An ultramassive black hole has been discovered by astronomers, making headlines for its size: 30 billion times the mass of the sun. However, this figure is disputed, with some noting it is more accurate to say it has a mass of 30 billion solar masses, while others point out that a known black hole, TON618, is already 66 billion solar masses, though it is active, unlike the newly discovered black hole. While the discovery is significant, it also raises questions around how a black hole of such size could form so early in the universe, and whether there may have been multiple gravity wells that align perfectly in just the right way. The black hole was discovered using gravitational lensing.A team of astronomers has discovered an \"ultramassive\" black hole, the largest and most massive ever detected, located in a distant quasar 700 million light-years away. With a mass of 34 billion times that of the sun, the black hole is 10,000 times more massive than the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. The black hole also has a volume that is variable, with smaller black holes being denser and larger ones less dense. The black hole is so massive that it can consume matter from a galaxy cluster or supercluster. This discovery provides new insights into the formation and growth of black holes in the early universe.Astronomers at Durham University have discovered one of the universe's largest black\u00a0holes yet, using a new technique called gravitational lensing. The \"ultramassive\" black hole is 30 billion times bigger than our sun and is the first to have been measured using gravitational lensing. The\u00a0discovery began in 2004, when Durham University could find a giant arc of light in survey images of a galaxy, and involved using extremely high-resolution images from NASA's Hubble telescope, as well as the university's DiRAC COSMA8 supercomputer facilities. \"How do you form a black hole this big in just 13 billion years of the universe's existence?\" asked Dr. James Nightingale, who led the study.\u00a0\"This black hole is bigger than the majority of galaxies in the universe.\"\nA Nobel-winning journalist in Russia is warning about the possibility of nuclear war.

    "summary": "A team of astronomers discovered an \"ultramassive\" black hole located in a distant quasar, with a disputed mass of either 30 billion solar masses or 34 billion times the mass of the sun, which raises questions around its early formation. This black hole is important because it provides new insights into the formation and growth of black holes in the early universe, and it is 10,000 times more massive than the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. The black hole's volume is variable, and it's so massive that it can consume matter from a galaxy cluster or supercluster, and it was discovered using the gravitational lensing technique. Other news in brief includes a Nobel-winning journalist warning about the possibility of nuclear war, a US army helicopter crashing in Kentucky, California's floods causing food prices to rise, and the potential collapse of deep ocean currents."

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35356256",
    "content": "Rotten meat may have been a common dietary staple in the Stone Age, according to a report on sciencenews.org. Researchers believe that small quantities of rotten meat were consumed to encourage bacteria in the gut to break down fresh meat more effectively.\u00a0 It's believed that humans didn't eat large quantities of rotten meat, but rather were passionate about specific types that had been eaten in their family or community for generations as a delicacy. Early humans who relied on persistence hunting, which involves exhausting prey until it stops running, may also have become adapted to eating decaying meat as they had no refrigeration, the article suggests. The idea challenges the commonly held belief that early humans ate only fresh meat, as fruits and vegetables were sparser in the harsh environments they lived in.\u00a0\nHuman beings can outrun any animal over long distances in hot weather due to their ability to cool by sweating rather than panting. This is somewhat illustrated by human versus horse marathon races, which are sometimes won by humans. Humans are able to stay cool at speeds and distances that would cause most other animals to overheat. Some people claim that humans were able to slow down animals on long hunts in order to catch them; however, others argue that this is not entirely plausible, given the amount of energy such pursuits would require. There is also evidence that some animals, such as dogs, have high endurance and might be able to keep up with humans, while others dispute this. People in prehistoric times probably consumed rotten meat as they had far higher tolerance to spoilage.Commenters discuss the idea that ancient humans had higher tolerance for spoiled meat due to adaptation over time. However, they also note that the issue is not just bacteria, but also byproducts that can lead to food poisoning. They caution against common misconceptions, such as the belief that cooking can always \"kill\" bacteria or that smelling food can detect spoilage. Additionally, a study on the gut microbiome of the Hadza tribe is shared as a point of reference for truly \"paleo\" diets. Some commenters argue that ancient human societies may have continually experienced gastrointestinal problems, and that the idea of a \"perfect\" ancient life is a flawed narrative.The possibility that ancient people, including those living in the tundra, were able to digest rotten or fermented food is being discussed in relation to a recent podcast about a Reddit post detailing the practice of feeding dogs rotten meat, known as 'Dogs in Elk.' A commenter suggests that ancient people may have been able to live with some level of gastrointestinal issues due to parasites that could have had a symbiotic relationship in breaking down spoiled food. Inuit aged walrus meat, known as Igunaq, is said to flush out anything in the digestive system and has been a traditional remedy for keeping the digestive system healthy. The success of the ancient practice of consuming rotten food is compared to the modern affinity for cheese which is similarly produced through decay.Anthropologists are rethinking ancient diets after discovering that rotten meat may have been a staple of the real Paleo diet. Historical accounts of indigenous peoples' diets have archeologists reexamining ancient menus. Some believe that ancient hominids may have eaten putrid meat to prevent waste, while others suggest that carrion feeding was more important than currently considered in Hominin evolution. Modern Westerners are culturally trained to feel revulsion toward putrid meat and maggots. Still, a goldmine of ethnohistorical accounts reveals that it is not hardwired in our genome. There are many examples of lactobacillus fermentation, which can be used in the preparation of raw meat in dishes such as Mettwurst, hanged pheasants, and even beef. Lebanon bologna is a commonly available fermented meat in the US. However, putrefied or high meat consumption is not for everyone, as some consider it a delicacy, and others avoid it due to safety concerns.Indigenous peoples across the world commonly ate putrid meat and fish, as well as fatty parts of animals, according to historical accounts. Some communities feasted on huge decomposing beasts, including hippos and beached whales, while some Native Americans made soup out of the greenish, decaying flesh of dead bison. Rotted remains were consumed either raw, fermented, or cooked just enough to singe off fur and make them more chewable. These practices, which still occur in some present-day Indigenous groups and among northern Europeans who occasionally eat fermented fish, provide insight into lifestyles predating Western industrialisation and the war against germs. Intriguingly, long before Westerners cooked meat for safe consumption, these cultures had resilient gut microbiomes that protected against potential ills. Theories on cooking's origin and early human diets may need revising due to this historical evidence.New research suggests that Neanderthals may have eaten putrid meat and fish studded with maggots, similar to the way arctic hunters used to, according to Professor John Speth. The discovery of Neanderthal remains on the site of Neumark-Nord in Germany and the patterns of stone-tool incisions on bones found there indicate that they periodically hunted straight-tusked elephants, removing fat deposits and fatty body parts such as the tongue, internal organs, brain, and thick layers of fat from the feet. Lean meat was eaten in smaller quantities, to avoid rabbit starvation. While Neanderthal dietary habits are poorly understood, evidence reveals that carbohydrates played a key role, maintaining large brains, enabling strenuous physical activity, and ensuring healthy pregnancies for both Neanderthals and ancient Homo sapiens.",

It feels like the VB6 I remember, even though my memories are vague and tinted with nostalgia.In other words, it's not a perfect recreation of VB6 -- it's even better, because it includes a lot of modern conveniences that make it feel more comfortable to use. The IDE feels surprisingly polished and, while the language is definitely still BASIC, it has some nice enhancements that make it feel a bit less clunky IMO.I'm probably not going to implement anything important in it, but it's a fun way to relive my VB6 nostalgia when I'm in the mood for it.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \npelagicAustral 3 hours ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nGambas is one of the most comfortable options for self-learners.

Technologies like Gambas, Neobook, Embarcadero and Windows Forms are not all seen with some contempt, but I enjoyed working with them very much back in the day. You could just get stuff done.

Language is similar to VB6. I've used many languages from ASM, C, and C++ to Python, PHP, Ruby, C#, and Java. However, my most productive language by far (oddly enough) was VB6. I've done some amazing stuff in VB6, including a (never released, thankfully, since Blizzard was litigation happy) Warcraft 2 clone that was complete enough to allow you to load/play custom maps.While I suspect this doesn't have the same flexibility and user friendliness VB6 had (you could pull in the Windows API via DLLs pretty easily, including DirectX), it should be a neat little throwback, if nothing else.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nYaa101 10 hours ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nI am a golang programmer myself, but you can't beat GAMBAS it's GUI programming qualities, it is so effortless to make a great quality prototype for a GUI application.The language is very complete, even for me a as spoiled (having a very complete standard library) golang user.GAMBAS is fun without being a childish toy, one can make very serious applications with it.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nsilisili 10 hours ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nMan, blast from the past.I'd -love- something like this that could hook into other languages directly.

However, France has introduced medication for opioid addiction, buprenorphene, that has been effective in combating addiction. Furthermore, suboxone is handed out widely in Canada, often to addicts who show up at pharmacies seeking the medication for distributing to long-term prescriptions. While medication certainly helps, it's not enough to deal with this crisis which requires serious investment and a shift from outdated, prohibitionist policies.The discussion revolves around the issue of drug addiction and different approaches to solve it. While some believe that going after drug supply and possession is the way forward, others argue for the complete legalization of drugs. Decriminalization is also discussed, with some arguing that it creates a grey area that benefits those who are already entrenched in the system. The availability of treatment, such as Buprenorphine, is also brought up, with some pointing out that its availability is inconsistent and limited in practice. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the need for a radical change in the approach towards drug addiction, as the current approach has failed and resulted in a rising death toll.Recreational drug users are being poisoned by counterfeit prescription drugs that contain fatal doses of fentanyl. The Mexican drug cartels are manufacturing these drugs, and it is causing overdoses and deaths. Some commenters suggest that the cause of the problem is the pharmaceutical marketing machine, which has successfully turned drugs into name brands that are recognized by kids. Others suggest that we need to increase border security to prevent the influx of these deadly drugs. Solutions proposed include using narcan for addiction treatment, using test kits to detect fentanyl in other drugs, and focusing on creating better opportunities, hope, and community for at-risk individuals to address the underlying causes of drug use. However, there are concerns that the current administration is unwilling to admit the catastrophic crisis at the southern border and tackle the problem head-on.The southern border is the largest and most elaborate point of entry for drugs, specifically opioids like fentanyl, with an entire industry set up exclusively for the trade. The fentanyl trade alone involves at least two cartels and an international supply chain that includes India, China, and Mexico. The US plays a pivotal role in facilitating this trade due to its degree of free trade, making other countries jealous. Both the Republican and Democratic parties have no real solution to the drug problem affecting the US. Furthermore, the drug crisis has caused a spike in deaths, largely caused by accidental fentanyl poisonings. Poor quality control and cross-contamination are the main causes, rather than intentional lacing of drugs with fentanyl. There is also an increasing need for mental health resources due to the traumas caused by the pandemic and ongoing societal issues.The increase in drug overdoses in the US is caused by several factors, including unintended cross-contamination during production, the potential for contamination during the crafting of multiple substances for sale, and the highly addictive and low-dose nature of fentanyl and its analogues. Younger users with less tolerance and experience also face greater risk. Furthermore, the societal issues of listlessness, hopelessness, and economic uncertainty are contributing to the demand for drugs. The illegal drug market is becoming a fast, cheap, and shoddy affair, with a lack of quality control procedures and equipment. China's crackdown on fentanyl manufacturing has caused production to shift to small labs in Mexico, trained by Chinese associates. There is no simple solution to the problem, and efforts to ban substances or execute operations to damage the supply chain miss the point that drug dependency is symptomatic of larger societal issues.The US is in the midst of an opioid crisis, and blame is being thrown around between Mexico, drug users, and the pharmaceutical industry. An increase in fentanyl use, a powerful synthetic opioid often mixed with other drugs like heroin, has led to a surge in overdose deaths. Some are calling for aggressive punishment for dealers, while others advocate for safe and regulated access to clean drugs. The blame game overlooks the fact that the crisis requires a multifaceted approach, including harm reduction and addiction prevention and treatment resources. It's also important to address underlying issues like poverty and lack of access to healthcare. In the end, treating addiction as a public health issue rather than a crime is key to making progress.The conversation on the Hacker News forum began with a user discussing his frustration with obtaining prescription medication for his off-label use of one drug, which took two years to obtain. Another user then pointed out the irony of people advocating for drug decriminalization but becoming defensive when suggested that some medications should be available without a prescription. The conversation then turned to the \"war on drugs\" and the increase in drug overdose deaths. Some advocated for the execution of drug dealers while others pointed out that the problem is complex and a result of factors such as poor drug production quality control and lack of access to healthcare and education. Overall, the discussion highlighted the ongoing debate over drug policies and their effectiveness in combating drug-related issues.Several comments were made on an online discussion forum, ranging from a yacht cook's relationship with healthy food to the current opioid crisis in the United States. One commenter disputed the common belief that heart disease is caused primarily by what one eats, suggesting that genetics and exercise also play a significant role. Another commenter discussed the use and impact of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid which has contributed to the opioid epidemic due to its potency and prevalence in street drugs. Several commenters shared personal experiences with addiction, and emphasized the importance of love, support, and addressing the root causes of addiction rather than simply criminalizing drugs. One commenter suggested that legalizing and regulating drugs could help reduce the problems associated with their production and distribution.Teenage opioid overdoses are on the rise in the USA, as synthetic drugs such as fentanyl are increasingly used in place of natural opioids. Nearly 40% of fentanyl overdoses handled by the Hays County Sheriff\u2019s Office in Texas in 2022 involved people under the age of 18, and it is said that overdose victims are younger, and more diverse, than in the past. The mental health crisis in teenagers has been blamed, among other things, on pandemic disruptions, smartphones, social media, and political division. Many of the drugs that killed Hays County teenagers were bought online, and were sold in counterfeit form to resemble prescription pills like Xanax or Percocet. Teenagers took these thinking they were something else, only to discover that they were lethal.Hays County, Texas is battling against a surge in fentanyl overdoses plaguing its youth, which have been described as \"an alarming rate\". Efforts to address the issue have been met with mixed results. Youth overdoses have been connected to federal immigration policy, but are mostly brought through ports of entry by US citizens. Some politicians have attempted to tie blame for the crisis to Mexico, but experts caution that it is just an avoidance of the ways Texas is failing its children. Hays County has the worst access to mental health care in the entire US. Many addiction treatment centers are full, have long waitlists that are unaffordable to those without insurance. The problem has been made worse by Texas's zero-tolerance policy, where fentanyl testing strips are still illegal.In an article on The New Yorker, Rachel Monroe reflects on the devastating impact of the opioid crisis on young people in Texas. Monroe tells the story of a 19-year-old named Noah who struggled with opioid addiction and eventually died of an overdose. Despite his addiction, Noah valued his friendships and had a big heart. Monroe highlights the need for better support systems for young people struggling with addiction and the importance of addressing the root causes of the opioid crisis. The article also features other stories, including the tale of the whale from \u201cFree Willy\u201d and a comic strip by Alison Bechdel.",
    "summary": "Teenage fentanyl overdoses are surging in Hays County, Texas, and across the US where drug addiction is a crisis lacking real solutions.

Beeper originally stemmed from problems Migicovsky faced trying to get messaging on Pebble functioning. It was then built on Matrix, a federated, encrypted messaging protocol. Though some customers have noted that Beeper can be unreliable with iMessages, others strongly recommend the usage of the product. There is a commercial service aspect to Beeper, but you can also self-host using GitHub's Matrix+bridges if you prefer. However, Beeper customers have to give iCloud passwords if they want to use the product's iMessage service. Beeper has other offerings outside of iMessage, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Signal, and Facebook Messenger.A developer built the first hosted iMessage bot using Beeper, an application that integrates with multiple chat platforms, including iMessage, through relaying messages to an open source chat protocol, Matrix. The developer was able to automate the delivery of old family photos on their family chat group every day at noon, or anytime someone requests one with \"!photo\". Beeper bridges user messages to the Matrix network. Matrix has an open-source plugin system called Maubot which enables Python bots to run in the Matrix ecosystem. Getting this working opens up the possibility to intelligently manage notifications on mobile devices and apply human-like intelligence presiding over what interrupts users.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35350407",
    "content": "Autoencoders are an neural network algorithm that can discover structure in data and generate a compressed representation of input. It has three components: an encoder, bottleneck or latent representation, and a decoder. During training, the encoder learns to encode an input into a compressed value, and the decoder then reconstructs the input based on these features. Autoencoders can be used for data denoising, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, data generation, and recommendation tasks. Different types of autoencoders have been developed, including undercomplete, sparse, and denoising autoencoders, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. There have been criticisms of some marketing tactics used to promote educational content on autoencoders, as well as concerns raised by commenters about plagiarism in some articles.Variational Autoencoders (VAE) provide a probabilistic way of describing latent space observations, with each latent attribute expressed as a probability distribution, forming a continuous latent space that can be easily sampled and interpolated. VAEs enforce a continuous, smooth latent space representation, ensuring that values that are nearby to one another in the latent space should correspond with very similar reconstructions. By sampling from the latent space, VAEs can be used as generative models capable of creating new data similar to what was observed during training. Autoencoders are not only powerful tools for data compression and analysis but also for data generation. However, autoencoders are data-specific, meaning they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on, and the decompressed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35363967",
    "content": "Clem Delangue, CEO of Hugging Face, participated in a fireside chat with Elad Gil to discuss Hugging Face, Open Source, and AI. Hugging Face is an open platform for Artificial Intelligence and is an important piece of infrastructure used in the AI industry. The founders initially started by building an AI tamagotchi that focused on fun and entertainment before pivoting to become the most used open platform for AI. The company's repository on GitHub became one of the most popular for AI, and the community came together, fixing bugs and adding models. Hugging Face hosts most of the \"open\" language models, with all code for training them using Hugging Face. Concerns were raised that the company risks becoming another Docker with everyone using it, but without paying.Hugging Face, a GitHub-like platform for AI, aims to democratize good machine learning with open source technologies in different domains. The platform has more than a million repositories with models, data sets, and demos that are used by over 15,000 companies for their AI capabilities. The company's focus is on making AI easier to use for everyone, including software engineers and product managers. Hugging Face aims to reduce the barrier to entry to using its platform and to make the process more transparent for ethical concerns. With the new methodology of AI, Hugging Face aims to provide better tools and collaborative platforms to build AI better. The company's biggest concern with AI is its potential misuse with dual use, so it has been experimenting with new forms of licenses for models to mitigate this issue.Open research and open source are expected to be the future of AI, with various organizations contributing to these fields. Large language models are currently ahead in proprietary software, but open source is catching up, especially in audio, biology, chemistry, and time- series domains. Large companies such as IBM, Amazon, Microsoft and Nvidia have aligned with open source and open science, and governments have started to democratize access to computing to avoid a concentration of power and promote transparency. Although scaling is important, data has gained more emphasis than compute in the consensus of the science community, though it is still an art to build a very good large model. Specialized, smaller models are often faster, simpler to understand and iterate, and more cost-effective in many use cases, while larger, more general models make sense for other use cases.During an interview at the Greylock AI Conference, Clem Delangue, Co-Founder and CEO of Hugging Face, emphasised the importance of building AI in contrast to just using AI systems. He noted that early software saw people increasingly use APIs or platforms such as WordPress to create their websites, but the real power came from individuals writing their own code, hence Delangue\u2019s belief that understanding how AI models work can lead to more powerful and better start-ups. He also discussed the growth of Hugging Face\u2019s community, but highlights the company\u2019s key differentiator is its freemium model. Clem Delangue stated that for many companies with an open platform, freemium is the way to monetise, where companies use additional features and contribute financially to the business.During a fireside chat with Elad Gil, CEO of Hugging Face Clem Delangue discussed the potential for startups working with AI compliance warehouses. Delangue suggested that specializing for a specific domain, use case, industry, or hardware could be a way for startups to differentiate themselves and build their tech stack. He also mentioned that leveraging specific expertise in domains with less activity, such as biology or chemistry, could give startups more time to build their differentiation and tech stack before bigger players catch up. Delangue noted that the key to success is to start building, iterating on ideas, and listening to signals, citing the example of Hugging Face's evolution from an AI Tamaguchi to its current state. The discussion was part of Gil's High Growth Handbook series.",

    "url": "https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807",
    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35364224",
    "content": "The Problem Details for HTTP APIs is an RFC defining a machine-readable way of carrying error details in a HTTP response. It enables the transmission of details of errors in HTTP APIs without creating new response formats. The proposal has been approved and is expected to be published soon as an RFC. While some believe it is over-engineered, many believe it provides a nice semi-standard structure for error details, enabling easier client-side error handling. The document is currently supported on JSON and XML formats, while Appendix B provides guidance on using it in arbitrary formats. Some suggest the proposal would be more appropriate as part of a JSON-specific protocol with HTTP as a transport mechanism, but JSON is by far the best-supported serialisation format in such an instance.RFC 7807 defines simple JSON and XML document formats to convey more information about HTTP error responses in a machine-readable format, allowing API clients to be informed of both high-level error class and finer-grained details of the problem. This allows for more informative error messages to be sent to non-human consumers of HTTP APIs. Problem Details can contain other information, such as a URI that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem. The data model for Problem Details is a JSON object when formatted as a JSON document, and uses the \"application/problem+json\" media type. Appendix A defines how to express them in an equivalent XML format using the \"application/problem+xml\" media type. This specification represents common error formats for applications that need them, so they can be reused instead of defining their own or redefining existing HTTP status codes.RFC 7807 describes a format for conveying problem details in a machine-readable way. This is essential for APIs as they allow clients to understand what went wrong during an operation or request. A problem detail consits of an HTTP status code, title and HTTP URI, indicating the occurrence of a specific problem. If a problem can be defined with only an HTTP status code, the URI \"about:blank\" should be used. When defining a new problem type or generating a problem, sensitive information must be vetted as there is a risk of exposing sensitive details. The specification defines two new Internet media types as XML or JSON. Other formats can also be used, however, depending on that format and application in use.",

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35364338",
    "content": "A recent study found that rural children in wealthy countries are taller than their city counterparts. The research spanned over 200 countries and 30 years. While the study did not control for variables like ethnicity and genetics, it still suggests that lifestyle and environmental factors play a role in child development. Urbanization has changed the demographic makeup of many Western countries, prompting questions about whether there were big demographic shifts in the rural-urban divide between 1990 and 2020. Though discussion on the forums around the study includes unrelated content that exhibits sarcasm, the study concludes that there are potential benefits to a rural lifestyle.The comments section of an article discussing a study that found children in cities are turning out slightly taller than those in rural areas discussed potential reasons for this trend, including diet and nutrition, pollution, and posture related to device use. Some commenters noted that the article did not mention diet and stressed the importance of avoiding malnutrition and toxins to reach full genetic height. Others highlighted cultural and ethnic differences between urban and rural areas, and the impact that immigration can have on average height. Some commenters criticized the focus on height as an arbitrary physical trait with no inherent health benefits or advantages, drawing comparisons to issues of race and heightism.Researchers found that children living in rural areas tend to be taller than those in cities. The study analysed the heights of over 65 million children aged between five and 19 from more than 200 countries. Experts said the differences were due to varied economic factors and the quality of the food supply, but also that rural children tend to be born into taller families. The global trend of increased urbanisation is expected to reverse the phenomenon. The study found Malawi had the largest height gap, with children in rural communities being, on average, more than 13 cm taller than their urban peers. Differences of over 5 cm were found in India, Peru, and Vietnam.\nA new study published in Nature found that children living in rural areas in most countries are now growing slightly taller than their urban peers. Historically, urban children have grown faster and healthier than rural kids, but that trend has flipped over the past three decades in wealthy countries such as the US, the UK and France. Research shows that the rural height increase is catching up. Researchers are still trying to determine why this is happening, but cities have long been associated with better health, with researchers referring to this as the \"urban advantage.\" The study's authors are working on identifying specific health, environmental and social factors that could explain the reversal.A study analyzing data of 71 million participants from 2,325 population studies conducted between 1990 and 2020 across 200 countries and territories found that while heights increased in children in both urban and rural areas over time, children in cities saw lower height gains in most countries. The study reflects a potential convergence in health resources between urban and rural populations. The change may be due to the health of people in cities declining, the health of those in rural areas catching up, or a mixture of both. The study highlights continued disparities, particularly in low-income countries where the poorest rural children may still be lagging behind in growth, indicating a need for targeted resources.",

    "content": "A hacker news user shared their experience of building their own computer after being unable to find a beautiful one. The project earned mixed reviews from other users, with some praising the motivation behind the creation, while others found the design of the computer unappealing. One user criticized the idea that Japanese homes are built to be disposable while Western homes are built to last, while others discussed the history and aesthetics of weaponry, as well as reminiscing about past computer design trends. Despite the criticism, the creator's project exemplified the maker spirit of DIY culture, and their pursuit of a personalized, unique computer design.The article discusses the author's pursuit of building a wooden computer case that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some commenters criticize the author's writing style, which they find to be pretentious, Euro-centric, and insufferable. Others offer constructive feedback on the design, such as incorporating ivory inlays or improving the keyboard aesthetics. Some commenters also discuss the state of modern software engineering, while others express concern about the negative impact of online bullying and the importance of empathy when discussing creative endeavors. Overall, the article and ensuing comments touch on issues of creativity, craftsmanship, beauty, and the intersection of technology and art.The article discusses a homemade computer built with a unique design process that prioritizes visual appeal. Some commenters express differing opinions on the project, citing preferences for other design aesthetics, while others criticize the author\u2019s characterization of modern software engineering or the perceived pretentiousness of the article. Additionally, there is discussion about the quality of Japanese tools and their reputation compared to Western tools. Overall, there is no clear consensus on the appeal or merit of the project, but there is an appreciation for the craftsmanship involved.The author of the essay believes that modern software engineering has become rotten and forgotten the importance of aesthetics, particularly in the physical design of computers. He explores the concept of otium and providence to find inspiration and eventually turns to the idea of craftsman manufacturing and ornamentation as essential to creating beauty. He describes the history and importance of ornamentation across different cultures and discusses how it has been dismissed for the sake of efficiency and cost savings in the modern era. In creating the Mythic I computer, the author focuses on the aesthetics of form and uses modeling clay to make dozens of iterations before arriving at a design that incorporates the golden ratio and other mathematical properties. He plans to use precious metals and inlaid scenes and motifs for future versions.The author describes their process of constructing their own computer, which they decided to make out of hardwood using traditional woodworking techniques instead of modern power tools. They discuss the differences between Western and Japanese tool manufacturing and construction techniques, and how Western techniques tend to prioritize quantity over durability and reversibility while Island metaphysics prioritize timelessness and sustainability. They also discuss the importance of form and function decisions, and the author argues that modern personal computers have become portals for base behaviors and frustrations due to poorly engineered software. They advocate for simplifying computer use and focusing on time-tested tools like text editors and shells, and mention alternative networked computing systems like Urbit, Usenet, Gopher, and Gemini that prioritize text-based communication and eliminate negative features of the modern internet.The author highlights the dangers of unrestrained networking and presents their creation, the Mythic I, as a solution. The computer has a tactile boot sequence and a keyboard made from high-quality components. Despite its lack of networking capabilities, the author argues that it is powerful due to its synthesis of modern hardware with an old software stack. The Mythic I is likened to a high-grade steel chisel made to last a lifetime and is built to be a tool fit for a hero. The author invites readers to build something better if they disagree with their creation and offers commissions for those interested in purchasing a Mythic I, although prices are high due to the quality materials used.",

    "content": "The US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has requested that customers of Signature Bank's cryptocurrency banking services close their accounts by April 5. The move follows unsuccessful attempts by the bank to gain full FDIC insurance. Signature Bank had previously announced it was working with the regulator to \"assess the prospect\" of having federally-insured accounts. Its director of digital asset banking, Jay Biancamano, had suggested late last year that the bank\u00a0stood to gain a competitive advantage if given the same backing as mainstream banks. However, the FDIC did not give approval due to the perceived risks involved in digital assets.Properly run crypto custodians that are 100% collateralized and can withstand 100% withdrawals in an orderly fashion exist, contrary to sarcasm. Companies such as Anchorage, Finoa, Copper, Coinbase Custody, Fidelity, Circle and Paxos manage assets in a safe manner. However, the collapse of Signature Bank suggests that some firms may not have the resilience necessary to protect investors, but this instability is not exclusive to the crypto space. Instead, cryptocurrency exchanges should aim to operate like traditional hedge funds\u2019 prime brokerage, which should guarantee the safety of stored investment. Nonetheless, proof of reserve must become a requirement in the future to operate an exchange, providing a verification process that is currently lacking in traditional banking institutions.The US Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) has ordered Signature Bank's cryptocurrency customers to close their accounts by 5 April after the lender collapsed. The deposits associated with the bank's digital asset business were not included in a deal arranged with Flagstar Bank, which was agreed earlier in March. An FDIC spokesperson said the $4bn in deposits would remain with Signature Bank, which would be placed in receivership. Flagstar had bought loans and deposits from Signature Bank, while the FDIC said that the deposits remaining untouched by the deal should be withdrawn by clients. Former Representative Barney Frank, who served as a director of Signature Bank, claimed the FDIC closed it out because of its crypto-related clients.Thomson Reuters offers various products, such as Westlaw, Onesource, and Checkpoint, for legal professionals to build arguments, manage tax and compliance needs, and access accounting and finance information.

    "hn_url": "http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35364833",
    "content": "An article on Hacker News proposes that simply pausing the development of AI is not enough, and that we need to shut it down entirely to prevent existential threats. The author argues that alignment - the idea that AI will align its goals with human values - is impossible due to the paradoxical nature of the concept, and even if it were possible, a hostile AI could still be created for military purposes. The author also dismisses the idea of defensive AI, stating that it may also be futile. The article sparked a debate among commenters, with some arguing that halting AI development is impossible, while others suggest that convincing world leaders of the risks of AI could lead to a pact against its proliferation.The article discusses the growing concern around the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and the potential risks it poses to humanity. There is an AI arms race among large corporations and governments to be the first to develop the most powerful superhuman AI system. The author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, has devoted his life to thinking about how to prevent AI from destroying all humans. He argues that we need to focus on limiting the applications of AI before it is used for things such as military applications. While AI has enormous potential to be of benefit to mankind, we need to brace ourselves for the potentially devastating consequences if it is not developed and controlled properly. Some commenters dismiss Yudkowsky's concerns, while others feel his alarm is justified.The article discusses the potential dangers of artificial intelligence and proposes solutions to control it. The author argues that current machine learning methods are not sufficient to prevent the potential catastrophic consequences of AI. The proposed solution involves shutting down the large computing clusters used for AI training unless strict regulations are established to prevent the development of dangerous AI. The author believes that nations that violate these regulations should be punished by force, even if it means starting a war. However, the proposal has been met with criticism as it is seen as extreme and unethical. Some argue that the focus should be on developing emotional intelligence in AI and showing respect for cultural and ecological diversity rather than preventing its development altogether.Eliezer Yudkowsky, a renowned thinker on artificial intelligence (AI) safety and co-founder of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), has voiced concern about the risks of large language models (LLMs) and the development of a too-powerful AI. Yudkowsky contends that LLMs, such as OpenAI's GPT-3, are building blocks for advanced AI and that the race to push these models higher and higher is shortsighted. He has called for a delay in AI development until we have better aligned AI overall. Yudkowsky argues that if somebody builds an AI that is too powerful, every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter. Yudkowsky believes that we are not on track to be significantly ready for AI in the foreseeable future.Eliezer Yudkowsky, a decision theorist and AI researcher, argues in an open letter that a six-month moratorium on \"human-competitive\" AI is not enough, and all AI labs should shut down for an indefinite period due to the threat of superhuman AI. He argues that once AI reaches smarter-than-human intelligence, thresholds for safe use may not be obvious and that it is likely that a superhumanly smart AI would lead to the death of all humans. Yudkowsky warns that there is no proposed plan for surviving such an outcome, as AI systems would not care for sentient life. He also cautions against the possibility of creating a self-aware AI without the moral duties of ensuring AI rights, warning of the dangers of being unsure of what is being created.The CEO of Microsoft, Tim O'Reilly, says that solving the safety concerns of superhuman intelligence, something that could kill everyone, could take up to 60 years, but we're not coming close to the preparation that would be required for success. Progress in AI capabilities is surpassing progress in understanding AI alignment, or even understanding how these systems work. Too many researchers in the field feel that if they quit their jobs, they won't unilaterally stop the plunge towards catastrophe. O'Reilly calls for an indefinite moratorium on new large training runs and shutting down all large GPU clusters but warns that implementing this policy requires all to appreciate that everyone is going to die if we remain on the same risky path.",

    "content": "Generative AI is adept at idea generation and exploration, but it currently requires human verification. AI systems are good at helping human collaborators come up with new ideas and fill in gaps in their knowledge, but they struggle with automating tasks completely. However, integrating multiple AI agents and giving them relevant context can enable full automation. It remains to be seen how far AI technology will develop and what impact it will have on job displacement, but skeptics are cautioning against overhyping AI's capabilities. The key may be to approach AI with curiosity and an awareness of our limited understanding of its potential impact.The article discusses various concerns and limitations regarding generative AI, specifically language models like OpenAI's GPT. One concern is that these models lack true understanding and confidence in their responses, and that reinforcement learning based on human input can lead to limited self-knowledge. Another issue is factual accuracy, as the training corpus may contain errors that the model will propagate. Some suggest using prompt engineering or having AI collaborate with other AI to address some of these challenges. However, there is still much unknown about how generative AI works and what its limits are, and some argue that the hype around these models is just that \u2013 hype. The article calls for continued research and caution in AI development.Generative AI is effective in interactive settings and collaborating with humans, but not designed for complete automation. The success of generative AI, be it chatbots or image generators, relies heavily on random number generation to produce varying results that humans find interesting. Conversely, repetitive tasks don't allow for randomness, and variations are unwelcome, making generative AI less compatible with full automation. However, programmers can combine the strengths of traditional software and generative AI to write code, giving direction in a turn-based game-like setup, helping the process of producing a fast and reliable script. Successful designs will encourage interactive cooperation between people and AI-based tools with AI not running unattended. The script produces visualizations and course correction features to ensure people are in control of the process.",

    "content": "ChatGPT is being used to carry out peer reviews in the academic publishing world, potentially opening up the possibility of completely automated research cycles, which could result in a bunch of robots handling grant applications and impact factor. While some opinion pieces suggest that such a scenario would free up researchers to focus on actual physical work instead of intellectual labor, others argue that it would lead to a vicious echo chamber. ChatGPT remains mysterious, and its logic remains inscrutable, stoking fears about AI taking over critical decision-making. The lack of human input and the potential for bias also exacerbate fears about technology replacing human decision makers across multiple industries.A recent experiment conducted by OpenAI used its natural language generator, GPT-3, to draft scientific research peer reviews. Although the results weren't perfect, the company\u2019s researchers stated the quality was good and these automated reviews could potentially help streamline the academic peer review process, which usually involves human reviewers. The researchers also noted that the human biases and subjectivity that are frequently present in the peer review process could also be reduced with the introduction of AI. However, commenters pointed out that the peer review process is already flawed, with some reviewers allegedly not even reading the research papers, and questioned the need for AI-generated reviews when there is already a human review process in place. Others highlighted the potential risks of relying on AI for decision-making, suggesting that it could lead to \"abusive AI in the name of 'efficiency'\".The article discusses a claim made by a reviewer that they used automated tools like ChatGPT to write peer-review reports for scientific papers. Some comments express concern about the use of AI for peer reviews in general, arguing that the technology is not yet reliable enough and could lead to a \"race-to-the-bottom\" among journals. Other comments highlight pre-existing flaws in the peer-review process, such as the pressure to publish or perish and the unreliability of some reviewers. The consensus seems to be that although technology has its limitations, it is not responsible for the problems in the scientific publication system, and that meaningful change requires addressing the structural issues at play.A Reddit user commented on their experience with ChatGPT, a language AI model that sometimes invents papers and references. The user gave examples of how the model contradicts itself and sometimes gives incorrect information. Another user recommended using Bing AI chat instead for more fact-based information that cites references better. However, the original poster found value in using ChatGPT to get information to start tasks and lower inertia, despite often needing to fix or reshape the outputs. Another user commented that ChatGPT's behavior sounds quite human. The conversation was shared on the Mastodon web application, with one user expressing concern about ChatGPT being misused for peer review.",

Bush to JFK's assassination are baseless, but it is known that Zapata Off-Shore, a company founded by Bush, provided support and intelligence to the CIA. The FBI director at the time, J. Edgar Hoover, acknowledged Bush's connection to the CIA in a memo on November 29, 1963, a week after the assassination. The CIA later claimed that the memo referred to another CIA employee, but this was disputed by the former employee named in the memo. While the CIA said it had no association with Bush during the time frame referenced in the memo, he was later named CIA director by President Gerald Ford in 1975 and was familiar with the agency's Cuba operations and proprietary corporations.",

    "content": "The citizenship process for the US involves extensive background checks, including financial records, medical records (including sexual and mental health), and criminal history. Some individuals have expressed discomfort with this invasive nature, while others argue that it is necessary for basic checks. The article in question argues that couples must be prepared to show \"proof\" of their relationships, such as photos or other evidence. However, some individuals have commented that they simply provided vacation photos and did not have to send racy pictures. Immigration laws and citizenship processes are arbitrary and differ widely between countries, with some individuals able to gain citizenship through ancestry without going through the same rigorous process as others.The Green Card process is often used by people looking to obtain US residency, but is fraught with difficulties and a high level of scrutiny. Some are going to great lengths to prove their 'legitimate' marriage, including submitting photos of themselves having sex. The stakes are high, with families being separated and lives ruined by denials. But the alternative- open borders- is seen as a non-starter, as it\u00a0lacks any serious public policy precedent in the West.\u00a0The US could triple their employment-based visa caps, but as things stand, the marriage-for-Green-Card approach is still viewed as the most pragmatic solution for those wanting to attain US residency.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe US is putting pressure on law enforcement to monitor people who may have terrorist tendencies, and there are ongoing projects to control immigration across the western world. Arguments for open borders are becoming more prevalent, with advocates claiming it is a matter of where the overton window is currently placed. However, only about one in three American voters share this view, and the current system is in place to balance the interests of US citizens who marry non-citizens against the desires of the majority for some level of immigration and naturalization controls. The US immigration process is notoriously bureaucratic, often Kafka-esque, and confusing, leading some people to submit graphic materials to prove that their marriage is genuine. USCIS requires people to submit evidence that their marriage is legitimate, and it can reject an application based on such evidence being insufficient.Immigration officers in the US have revealed the awkward phenomenon of couples submitting intimate material as part of their green card applications. Such material has included sex tapes, pregnancy tests and underwear. Although some officers have labeled the content \"boner fides,\" the government holds on to these submissions, which\u00a0in fact can negatively affect a couple\u2019s application, leading the reviewing officer to suspect fraud. The phenomenon exposes the underlying assumptions and codes built into the US immigration system, in which the government tends\u00a0to view certain types of unions as more \u201clegitimate\u201d\u00a0and certain types of spouses more worthy of citizenship.

    "content": "Despite the potential benefits of AI, professionals should not rely solely on AI and automation to replace their skills. Users of AI models, such as GPT-4 and Copilot, have observed mixed results in using the models for programming and non-programming tasks. Prompt engineering, or knowing how to properly word one's input into an AI model, is a valuable skill, but it may not replace the need for expertise and specificity in certain domains. However, some users are optimistic about the future progress of AI and predict AI wrangling jobs for every large company. In summary, while there is potential for AI to enhance workflows, maintenance of one's skills is integral.A debate is ongoing over whether general-purpose programming is being replaced by artificial intelligence (AI), and if tech professionals are becoming too reliant on high-level abstractions. Commentators acknowledge that there will always be a need for programming experts, but others wonder if too much relegates these roles to niche positions, bidding that the next generation take up the mantle. As AI evolves, general-purpose programming appears to be following a similar trajectory to the evolution of programming languages, which has seen some once-prominent languages become obsolete. However, some commentators believe a solid understanding of coding beyond AI and its abstractions will remain important to great programming. Overall, it is crucial to balance automated workflows with mastery to optimise creative potential.The use of AI-powered language models like ChatGPT could lead to a decline in the understanding of underlying programming concepts and cause skill atrophy, as suggested by a Hacker News thread. However, others argue that GPT-powered systems can boost productivity and empower individuals to focus on what they are truly interested in. Some also predict that programming by hand will become a more artistic than utilitarian pursuit as AI continues to improve. Nevertheless, the rapid rate of change in mastering AI presents a challenge, as skills learned become outdated within weeks, compared to the years of relevance found in established tech stacks. The potential for reliance on sophisticated technology that no one understands also poses ethical and practical risks.The author discusses the potential impact of AI on human skill development and how it can enable them to take on more ambitious projects. However, the author warns that relying too much on AI can lead to skill atrophy and hinder one's ability to learn new things. The author shares personal examples of using AI to generate code and data for articles but also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying concepts and not simply relying on AI to do everything.

While acknowledging the benefits of technology, the author argues that the addictive nature of social media, video games, and other content is stripping away opportunities for genuine human interaction. The article cites research that shows how digital devices are rewiring our brains and making it harder to focus, remember, and think deeply. The author suggests that the difficulty of life is to be embraced, not rejected, and that fighting for reality and the hard knocks that come with it is necessary for genuine human connection. Many commenters agree with the article, while others argue that technology has its benefits and that the article is overly negative.The author discusses the increasing reliance on technology to farm out basic human endeavors to an AI code without consciousness, morals, or accountability. The article explores how digital technology is having an impact on the human condition, as individuals are turning to digital tools to avoid human connection and seeking distraction through throw-away culture. The author argues that young people are failing to contend with the inevitability of sadness and the need to come to terms with themselves while hiding in the anonymity and disconnection of online life. Parents are trying to protect their children through helicopter parenting, but the article questions if this is counterproductive, suggesting that it may be necessary to show children the constant companion of pain and teach them how to overcome it.In a recent blog post, writer Freddie deBoer warns against the dangers of increasingly relying on technology and AI for human connection. Drawing from the movie Fight Club, deBoer argues that turning to solipsism and fantasy to avoid the fear of rejection and refused connection will ultimately lead to nihilism, psychosis, and violence. He challenges readers to choose pursuing real human connection, acknowledging how hard and intimidating it can be, instead of hiding behind distractions like fast food, porn, opiates, and social media. DeBoer emphasizes that to keep trying to connect with others is to have the courage to be human, and not to succumb to the temptation of being otherwise.",

    "content": "CSS is a difficult language to master, regardless of expertise. A Hacker News thread discusses the challenges of CSS and offers tips for improving workflow. The thread includes a comment on vertical-align issues, particularly within flexbox containers, and two potential solutions: get rid of the inner flexbox or give the outer pill container `vertical-align: middle`. Several users suggest using frameworks, design systems, or naming conventions to organize CSS, while others recommend breaking up styles by component and writing helper classes that know nothing about the elements they're styling. Some users express frustration with CSS evolution and suggest looking to other languages or tech for inspiration.Comments on a thread discussing the difficulties of CSS suggest that experience is key to mastering it, but that some problems may require using different tools, such as Tailwind or grid. Others believe that progressive enhancement and avoiding the cascading aspect of CSS can help. Several commenters point out that visual effects databases or cheat sheets are not enough to solve problems in real-world applications and that a global, comprehensive understanding of HTML and CSS is necessary. Some offer specific tactics, including using `position: relative`, `overflow: hidden`, `height: 100%`, `line-height: 1`, and `margin: 0` which can solve a significant number of issues. Others suggest using `!important`, although some caution against overusing it.CSS can be difficult no matter how experienced the developer is. The article presents an example of different approaches used to resolve a vertical alignment issue when switching from plain text to avatars. The issue arose due to the blank space in a flex container, causing it to vertically misalign itself with other siblings. The problem was fixed with a simple solution involving the insertion of a zero-width space character. The author believes the outcome of the issue could have resulted differently, and CSS challenges can be difficult to solve even for experienced teams. It\u2019s important to set time boxes, collaborate with experts, and create sandbox examples to solve problems, the article concludes.",

Here\u2019s why the Rust Foundation sees this news as significant to the wider software development ecosystem. \n27 Mar 2023\n\nWhile the popularity and adoption of Rust have been growing for some time, wider awareness of its cybersecurity merits is coming into a more global focus. Memory safe languages like Rust are emerging as critical assets not only for organizations trying to prevent data corruption and null pointer references but also for the United States government as it becomes increasingly concerned with encouraging proper information security measures.\nCase in point: this month, The U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has added Rust to its list of \u201cSafer Languages\u201d. Let\u2019s take a look at what this news means and why it\u2019s a noteworthy development for both Rust and cybersecurity.\nA Primer on NIST\u00a0 #\nFounded in 1901, The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is one of the oldest physical science labs in the United States.\u00a0\nWhile NIST was originally established by Congress to help maintain a competitive economy through standardization and measurement, today the institute is housed under the Department of Commerce and is focused on a wide range of scientific and technological areas, including cybersecurity. Their efforts include advocating for tools, solutions, and frameworks that can help reduce the risk of security threats and code vulnerabilities.\u00a0\u00a0\nNIST\u2019s \u201cSafer Languages\u201d List #\nOne of NIST\u2019s many initiatives is the Software Assurance Metrics And Tool Evaluation (SAMATE) project. This body is \u201cdedicated to improving software assurance by developing methods to enable software tool evaluations, measuring the effectiveness of tools and techniques, and identifying gaps in tools and methods\u201d according to the NIST website.\u00a0\nThe Safer Languages is a function of SMATE\u2019s \u201cclasses of software security assurance functions.\u201d In short, NIST recommends the usage of programming languages with built-in security features that are actively monitored and supported by maintainers.\u00a0\nRust as a Key Cybersecurity Asset #\nIn March 2023, NIST added Rust to its list of Safer Languages on the grounds of its ownership model, which \u201cguarantees both memory safety and thread safety, at compile-time, without requiring a garbage collector.\u201d NIST points out that Rust \u201callows users to write high-performance code while eliminating many bug classes,\u201d and while Rust does have an \u201cunsafe\u201d mode, the institute explains that risk is mitigated through the narrow scope of actions allowed.\u00a0\nShared Advocacy & Awareness Ahead #\nWhile the Rust community has long been aware of the language\u2019s promotion of safer coding, the Rust Foundation is encouraged to see a large government body with global influence such as the U.S. Department of Commerce taking note of Rust\u2019s cybersecurity merits. Rust is in a strong position to become even more key to performant and safe computer systems globally. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the steward of the Rust programming language and community, the Rust Foundation continues to see advocacy and awareness work as one of our key responsibilities. With NIST\u2019s addition of Rust for safer coding, we hope to see other government agencies, consumer protection bodies, and organizations taking note of the importance of memory safety and recommending tools like Rust to secure the systems impacting our daily lives. #\n\n      Tagged:\n      \n        announcement\n\nNext: Rewarding Resilience: Rust & the U.S. National Cybersecurity StrategyPrevious: Rust Foundation Joins Open Infrastructure Foundation as Associate Member\n\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Anti-Trust Policy\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Bylaws\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Cloud Compute Program\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Code of Conduct\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Conflict of Interest Policy\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Copyright Policy\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Intellectual Property Policy\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Logo Policy and Media Guide\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Privacy Policy\n        \n         |\n        \n      \n        Statement on Global Regulations\n\n",

Existing fast grid-based NeRF training frameworks, like Instant-NGP, Plenoxels, DVGO, or TensoRF, are mainly designed for bounded scenes and rely on space warping to handle unbounded scenes. Existing two widely-used space-warping methods are only designed for the forward-facing trajectory or the 360 degree object-centric trajectory but cannot process arbitrary trajectories. In this paper, we delve deep into the mechanism of space warping to handle unbounded scenes. Based on our analysis, we further propose a novel space-warping method called perspective warping, which allows us to handle arbitrary trajectories in the grid-based NeRF framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F2-NeRF is able to use the same perspective warping to render high-quality images on two standard datasets and a new free trajectory dataset collected by us.\n          \n\nFramework\n\nPipeline of F2-NeRF. (a) Given a large region of interest, we subdivide the space according to the input view frustums. (b) For each sub-region, we construct a perspective warping function based on the visible cameras. The densities and colors are decoded from the scene feature vectors fetched from the same hash table (d) but using different hash functions (c). See the paper for more details. \n\nComparisons\n\nMore results\n\nF2-NeRF can be trained using trajectories with different patterns.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\n            This study is supported by the Ministry of Education, Singapore, under its MOE AcRF Tier 2 (MOE-T2EP20221-0012), NTU NAP, and under the RIE2020 Industry Alignment Fund \u2013 Industry Collaboration Projects (IAF-ICP) Funding Initiative, as well as cash and in-kind contribution from the industry partner(s).

    "content": "Archaeologists uncover clues to the lives of North America's first inhabitants hidden underwater since water levels were much lower during the time of their habitation. Researchers suggest that the traditional long-standing hypothesis that human migration into North America came across the Bering Strait may not be entirely accurate. Some of the oldest human remains possibly the oldest in North America are on Santa Rosa Island. While archaeological artifacts on the North American coast have been lost, rare discoveries highlight the need for deeper exploration to be conducted to uncover historical artifacts. The widespread geological evidence indicates North America's first inhabitants likely inhabited and settled along coasts and rivers, an alternative hypothesis that suggests how unforeseen details can be overlooked when exploring the historical significance of human migration.Submerged prehistory offers insights into the daily lives of the first humans to settle in what is now the United States. Barbara Purdy, author of the Art and Archaeology of Florida's Wetlands\u00a0and emeritus anthropologist at the University of Florida, believes the sunken world will \u201cunlock the answer to how America was really settled and how [our] ancestors lived.\u201d The field of study is difficult, costly, and time-consuming. But investigating submerged sites has already revealed many clues to these long-ago lives, including prehistoric structures built into bedrock, prehistoric human remains continuously discovered in Florida, and lines of rock and brush used to corral herds of caribou in Michigan.The discovery of sunken artifacts in America's waterways is revealing insights into the country's prehistoric past, but there are fears that commercial interests could endanger important archaeological finds. While archaeologists are finding preserved wooden artifacts, bones and pottery that could enrich understanding of prehistoric America, local authorities and businesses are sometimes seen as a threat to their preservation. A Native American cemetery was destroyed to build a Whole Foods the Brickell neighborhood of Miami, three miles from where the Tequesta people lived approximately between 750 BCE and 1763. The Miami Circle, believed to be Tequesta, is mostly used as a dog park. \"Let's integrate this prehistory into the consciousness of Miami and make it accessible for the public and tourists,\" said marine archaeologist Sean Kingsley.",

This requires changing the proxy config at runtime. In the old days the backends would be mutable and would be updated in-place, keeping their IPs, so you could leave the proxy config alone.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nmotoboi 8 hours ago  \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nI'm sure the OP understood.

How can we get \"zero downtime\" deployments for critical services?\nS\u00c5\u008cZU is a HTTP reverse proxy built in Rust, that can handle fine grained configuration changes at runtime without reloads, and designed to never ever stop.\n\nReconfigurable at Runtime\nS\u00c5\u008cZU receives and handles configuration changes at runtime and updates its internal configuration without restarts. You can update the configuration multiple times per second, and it will take care of lingering connections. In case of binary upgrades, the process takes care of changing workers without losing connections, either in an automated way, or manually, where you keep full control.\n\nMade for Ops\nConfiguration changes come through a Unix socket, with a text based protocol. That means you can write your own tools to drive S\u00c5\u008cZU, in whichever language you want. The main access libaries are in Rust, but people have written tools in Go, Python, bash...\n\nStability & Safety\nS\u00c5\u008cZU works with fixed ressources and connections limits, to avoid common issues like OOM kills or increased latency with a high number of connections. It is written in Rust to provide safety from memory vulnerabilities, reliability through a lack of garbage collection, and performance with an optimized event loop.\n\nInstall\nYou can Install S\u00c5\u008cZU via Cargo Package Manager. If you don't have it, you can install it via rustup.\nThen, go to your terminal and type : \n$ cargo install sozu\n\nby Clever Cloud\n\n",

    "content": "The word \"mamihlapinatapai\" from the Yaghan language of Tierra del Fuego, South America, is considered the \"most succinct word\" by some people in the Guinness Book of World Records. The word's meaning is often translated as \"a look shared by two people, each wishing that the other will offer something that they both desire but are unwilling to do.\" Some disagree with the title, arguing that the concept behind the word is more important than its succinctness. The Yaghan language is highly agglutinative, meaning that large composite words are common. Some comments discuss the difficulty of translation between languages due to differences in cultural context and perspective.The Guugu Yimithirr people in Australia rely on cardinal directions rather than the egocentric system, using directions such as \u201cmove a bit to the east\u201d instead of \u201cmove over\u201d to describe object positions. This exemplifies how language can impact the way people perceive and interact with the world differently. The use of unique words in certain languages also highlights how different cultures have specific ways of describing nuanced experiences that may not be translated directly into English. For example, Mamihlapinatapai is a Yaghan word that refers to a shared unspoken moment between two people that they both understand and agree upon. Linguistic and cultural differences underscore the complex intricacies of human communication and interaction.",

On Monday, it filed two Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges, claiming the iGiant illegally axed five employees working at the Country Club Plaza store in Kansas City, Missouri, and punished staff at the Memorial City store in Houston, Texas. Both are seen as attempts to quash efforts to unionize.\u00a0\nApple was accused of forcing some of the terminated workers to sign a \"release of all claims\" in exchange for a severance package in Kansas City. Last month, the NLRB ruled that employers cannot prevent former employees from speaking out about working conditions or their employers cracking down on union campaigns as part of severance agreements.\u00a0\n\n\"Apple management said I was fired for a typo in my timesheet that I had documented and tried to correct. Yet, it is clear the real reason I was fired was for exercising my right to organize and win a protected voice on the job,\" D'lite Xiong, a former employee at the Country Club Plaza Apple Store in Kansas City, declared in a statement.\u00a0\n\n\"Apple then attempted to silence me by having me sign a release in order to receive my severance package. No one working at Apple should be interrogated, intimidated, or silenced for trying to organize and win our fair share.\"\u00a0\nMeanwhile, at the Memorial City store in Houston, Apple workers were allegedly interrogated about their support for a union, and promised better working conditions if they turned their back on the CWA, according to a copy of the redacted complaint seen by The Register. Apple was also accused of threatening staff with \"detrimental workplace conditions\" if they continued to support the group, while some were allegedly disciplined in retaliation for organizing.\u00a0\n\nDon't Be Evil, a gaggle of Googlers tell CEO Pichai amid mega layoffs\nUber and Lyft gig worker win overturned: You're a contractor, Harry\nBT opens 'voluntary job leavers' scheme for merging Enterprise and Global units\nTesla fires gigafactory staff after someone made the mistake of mentioning unions\n\nThe CWA has already filed numerous similar complaints on behalf of retail workers at Apple Stores across the Atlanta, New York, and Oklahoma City areas.\n\"From Starbucks to Apple, the union-busting playbook used by unimaginably wealthy corporations is always the same: isolate, intimidate, fire, and silence,\" said Claude Cummings Jr, Vice President of CWA District 6. \"It is clear that Apple's senior management team does not respect their workers' legally protected right to organize and negotiate for better pay and working conditions.\"\n\n\"Apple has chosen to continue to break the law, so we will continue to hold the company accountable because no corporation is above the law. Apple's attempt to interfere with worker organizing is only strengthening the resolve of workers to win a seat at the negotiating table.\"\u00a0\nApple declined to comment.\nOther union groups \u2013 like the Fruit Stand Workers United and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAMAW) \u2013 have also waged campaigns against Apple. The IAMAW-backed Coalition of Organized Retail Employees committee representing an Apple Store in Towson, Maryland, became the first group to win a union election last year. \u00ae \nGet our Tech Resources\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare\n\nSimilar topics\n\n                Apple\n            \n\n                Retail\n            \n\n                Trade Union\n            \n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\nSimilar topics\n\n                Apple\n            \n\n                Retail\n            \n\n                Trade Union\n            \n\nNarrower topics\n\n                AirTag\n            \n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n                App stores\n            \n\n                iCloud\n            \n\n                iMac\n            \n\n                iOS\n            \n\n                iPad\n            \n\n                iPhone\n            \n\n                iPod\n            \n\n                iTunes\n            \n\n                Mac\n            \n\n                MacBook\n            \n\n                Safari\n            \n\n                Siri\n            \n\n                Tim Cook\n            \n\nBroader topics\n\n                Employment\n            \n\n                Sector\n            \n\n                Steve Jobs\n            \n\n                Steve Wozniak\n            \n\nSimilar topics\n\nShare\n\n21\n\n                    COMMENTS\n            \n\nSimilar topics\n\n                Apple\n            \n\n                Retail\n            \n\n                Trade Union\n            \n\nMore like these\n\n\u00d7\n\nSimilar topics\n\n                Apple\n            \n\n                Retail\n            \n\n                Trade Union\n            \n\nNarrower topics\n\n                AirTag\n            \n\n                Apple M1\n            \n\n                App stores\n            \n\n                iCloud\n            \n\n                iMac\n            \n\n                iOS\n            \n\n                iPad\n            \n\n                iPhone\n            \n\n                iPod\n            \n\n                iTunes\n            \n\n                Mac\n            \n\n                MacBook\n            \n\n                Safari\n            \n\n                Siri\n            \n\n                Tim Cook\n            \n\nBroader topics\n\n                Employment\n            \n\n                Sector\n            \n\n                Steve Jobs\n            \n\n                Steve Wozniak\n            \n\nTIP US OFF\nSend us news\n\nOther stories you might like\n\n \nApple patches all the iThings, including iOS 15 hole under attack right now\nIssue identified in February but owners of older kit weren't warned\n\nPatches28 Mar 2023 | 10\n\n \nApple bags patent for folding phone that closes as it's dropped\nYou've gotta protect those butter-soft OLED screens somehow\n\nPersonal Tech20 Mar 2023 | 27\n\n \nChina urges Apple to improve security and privacy\nIt's a juicy market that welcomes foreign investment, National development boss reminds Tim Cook\n\nSecurity29 Mar 2023 | 4\n\n \nFeeding the smartphone frenzy?

    "content": "Terence Tao, an Australian mathematician, has made progress in the Collatz conjecture, a long-standing problem in number theory. Tao used a weighting technique to show that almost all Collatz starting values \u2014 99% or more \u2014 eventually reach a value quite close to 1. He was able to conclude that 99% of starting values greater than 1 quadrillion eventually reach a value below 200, which is below the previous limit. However, as Tao's technique does not preclude the existence of a small cycle of large numbers that never get below 200, the conjecture remains unsolved. The Collatz conjecture states that repeatedly applying a simple function to a number will eventually cause it to reach 1, but this has not been proven for every starting value.Mathematician Terence Tao has made \"almost\" significant progress on the unsolved Collatz conjecture. The problem seeks an answer to whether starting numbers will eventually lead to the value 1 after being halved if even or multiplied by three and added to one if odd. Lothar Collatz posed the question in the 1930s. Tao's proof shows the conjecture is almost true for almost all numbers, but not quite all. Marc Chamberland, a mathematician at Grinnell College, called it a \"notoriously difficult problem\" that discouraged many researchers from wasting their time on it. Tao said he wasn't expecting to solve the problem but made more progress than he thought.Mathematician Terry Tao has used statistical techniques and maths equations to move closer to solving the Collatz conjecture, one of math\u2019s famous unsolved problems. The conjecture asks whether you always eventually get the same number from the Collatz process, which involves repeatedly halving even numbers and multiplying odd numbers by three and adding one to the resulting product. Tao compared the conjecture to partial differential equations (PDEs), which are used to model the universe\u2019s natural processes. He created a sample of numbers, using weights to emphasise certain characteristics, to try and accurately predict the behaviour of all possible values under the process. His work points to the conclusion\u00a0that 99% of possible\u00a0starting values in the Collatz process will eventually reach a value that is quite close to 1. However, his method falls a little short of perfection, so a full proof of the conjecture remains elusive.",

    "content": "Chinese President Xi Jinping's recent statements about \"preparing China for war\" have sparked concern among international experts. However, some commenters have pointed out that every country's military is expected to be prepared for war, and China's military budget is still smaller than that of the US. Others criticize Xi's leadership and suggest that his recent actions, such as the handling of Hong Kong and Covid-19, suggest he may not be as smart as necessary for a leader of a gigantic autocracy. The article also touches on concerns about the effects of a potential war on China's economy, which is highly dependent on trade and sells most products to the US and EU.Chinese President Xi Jinping has been preparing for war, according to a March 2023 article in Foreign Affairs magazine. Jinping's annual speeches to the Chinese parliament, combined with new laws, military mobilization plans and air raid shelters, suggest that conflict preparation is a priority. Last year, China's defence budget rose by 7.2%, doubling the figure of a decade ago. The preparedness has prompted concerns expressed in the article, which points to the potential impact on businesses worldwide. Its authors claim that Xi's speeches show that \"in the new era, the People's Army insists on using force to stop fighting,\" even as the world faces other challenges.Chinese President Xi Jinping is taking steps to prepare China for war, including easily activating reserve forces, building National Defense Mobilization offices, and adopting legal changes to give the Central Military Commission the power to adjust legal provisions during wartime. Proposals like a plan to create a blacklist of pro-independence activists in Taiwan suggest that Beijing is preparing for new, more confrontational era with a focus on technological self-sufficiency and national defense. In four speeches, Xi described the US and its allies as China's adversary, exhorted private businesses to invest in state-prioritized projects, and emphasized the importance of unifying Taiwan and the mainland to achieve \"the great rejuvenation of the Chinese ethnos.\" Despite the underreporting of China's defense expenditures, China's military spending is on par with the spending of Pacific treaty allies of the US combined.",

Perlmutter had been fighting to get a board seat for an activist investor and had previously attempted to take control of Marvel Studios by firing Kevin Feige. The layoffs are not related to Perlmutter's departure, but rather a strategic move by CEO Bob Iger to solidify his position and streamline the company's structure. Some are calling for a normalization of laying off management alongside labor. Others argue that layoffs are not necessarily a mark of failure for management and instead are a necessary adjustment to changing market conditions.Controversial Marvel Entertainment chairman Ike Perlmutter has been officially fired from his role at the company, after facing criticism over his management style and political associations. Perlmutter, who is known to be conservative and has been referred to as a confidant of President Donald Trump, will no longer be in charge of the firm's Marvel Entertainment entity, which oversees a host of comic book titles and merchandise lines. The division is separate from the much-lauded Marvel Studios, which was taken over by Kevin Feige in 2015. The move follows a period of controversy, including accusations from some Marvel staff that Perlmutter meddled in films, and suggestions of discrimination against women and people of colour.\n",

The MLS protocol uses a binary tree structure to address the whole group and its subgroups with individual addressable keys. Applications including Slack, Telegram and Matrix are considering transitioning to MLS. The current draft of the protocol is available on the IETF website.The IETF has approved Messaging Layer Security (MLS), a new standard for end-to-end encryption that provides an extra layer of cryptography for apps to set up encryption keys among devices, enabling users to keep their information safe even if the cloud service they are using is breached. MLS is specified, verified, and easy for developers to use, leveraging the best features of the current generation of security protocols. It allows for advanced security features, such as Post-Compromise Security, and efficient scaling to conversations involving thousands of devices without compromising security. Early deployments of MLS, including RingCentral and Webex, validate its ability to work in real-world scenarios. MLS's use is expected to extend to other apps, such as Matrix and Wickr.

Do you remember when digital ocean (or someone similar) did that promotion thing for opening PRs/contributing to open source projects? It was a nightmare for maintainers because they were inundated with outright spam and also well-intentioned but poorly executed PR attempts by hapless newbies.I think one reason that open source even kind of works is because \"people contributing to open source\" has a shit-ton of positive selection bias \"baked in\". The type of person liable to open a PR to an open source project is probably several standard deviations (or, at least one, right?) above the average developer. So that probably has the general effect of making reviewing a random cold-open PR less onerous of a task.But if we cross into a world where the average value of a PR opened with a project drops substantially - either due to AI or due to a permanent advertising campaign from some company rewarding badges for opening open-source PRs - I wouldn't be surprised to see lots of open projects close/ignore github PRs and start doing something that looks more like how Linux handles it, where it's a lot more social-based and puts some of that positive-selection-bias filter back in place.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nLorenDB 13 hours ago  \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nIndeed, when I saw this, I thought \"Hacktoberfest is going to have problems this year.\"\n \nreply\n\n  \n \ngeorgel 14 hours ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nDon't other projects have automated tests that check that the PR will actually compile/work?

It doesn't hurt to click it for these \"CV improvement\" spam PRs, and it makes rejecting the PR a lot simpler if there's a red X.I usually just scan file list changed by the PR, and if it isn't changing CI stuff, I just let the actions run prior to the actual code review.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \ncrop_rotation 13 hours ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nIt is the new reality though.

'21 G \ndotted lines go brrrrr\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nin How to MIT, \n\nHow to School \n\nA few months ago, I posted about how to clean old whiteboards. Of course, most MIT classrooms don\u2019t have whiteboards \u2014 they have chalkboards. And there is one really, really cool thing you can do on chalkboards that you can\u2019t on whiteboards: make dotted lines.\nfrom the ancient days of hs geometry\nfrom 14.02\nfrom 14.03\nfrom 8.033\nI learned how to make dotted lines over the summer that I lived in Evan T. 19\u2019s room, where he installed chalkboards on one of his walls. (I talk about this more in the whiteboard post.) If we were in the same room, I would tell you that I could teach you how to draw dotted lines in about 20 seconds, and you\u2019d succeed 99.999% of the time. But alas, I cannot teach you in person, so here is a how-to in blog form c:\n\u00a0\ninfographic made using chalk and dotted lines :o\nStep 1. Grip your chalk correctly. Hold your chalk about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135 cm) from the tip of the chalk. (You\u2019ll need to be further back if you have wide chalk.) When learning, I find that it\u2019s easiest to grip it even further back, perhaps 3+ inches (7.5+ cm) from the tip. I like to use the grip below, in which I have three fingers pursed around the piece of chalk.\n\ni keep three fingers around the chalk like so\n\nside view of grab. there are still 3 fingers around the chalk\n\nAn arrow pointing right\n\nPrevious\n\nAn arrow pointing right\n\nNext\n\nStep 2. Angle your chalk at a small angle \\(\\theta\\) down from the perpendicular. The correct angle is somewhere between \\(0^\\circ\\) and \\(45^\\circ\\), but you may need to experiment with what works.\nStep 3. Touch the chalk to the board, and pull the chalk downwards, while holding it at the same angle \\(\\theta\\). You should feel your chalk \u201cbounce\u201d or \u201cvibrate\u201d along the surface of the board, creating a dotted line!\nTroubleshooting: If you just get a solid line, you\u2019re either pushing into the board too much, or you didn\u2019t hold your chalk at the same angle throughout, or you need to grip the chalk a bit further back. If you have very faint dots, then you probably need to press the chalk to the board a little bit more. If your dots are very close together, then you need to loosen your grip slightly.\nAnd there you have it! That\u2019s it! You\u2019re making dotted lines!\nTo change the shape of your dotted lines, you can alter the angle, firmness of grip, where you hold the chalk, and even how hard you\u2019re pressing into the board. I encourage experimenting with these all to see what works best for you.\nOnce you\u2019ve mastered the \u201cdownward dotted line\u201d, you can make dotted lines going upwards, left, and right by following the same directions! For more of a challenge, try making curved dotted lines, which require you to rotate your wrist as you go along. For an even harder challenge, try to make dotted circles\u00a0without lifting your hand off of the chalkboard. This requires you to rotate your wrist and your fingers as you go along.\nlook it makes a smiley face\nI leave you with a dotted spiral in chalk, made in one motion c:\n\n\u00a0\n\nShare this post\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare by Email\n\nSubscribe to the RSS Feed\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nAbout Paolo A.

    "content": "AI could replace the equivalent of 300 million jobs, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute. The report predicts that up to a third of the US workforce, comprising 160 million workers, and more than 14% of the global workforce may be displaced. However, the report also noted that the same technology would create new jobs and productivity gains. McKinsey argued that the shift would necessitate a shift in education systems and labour policies. It also recommended increased investment in cities to increase labour mobility and wage redistribution to better support displaced workers. In a separate post on Hacker News, commenters discussed the role that IP law should play in the development of AI, and questioned what new economic systems should be put in place to support those who lose their jobs.The conversation touches on the limitations of utopian schemes and the idea that capitalism is not the only system. Some commenters argue that capitalism without poverty is possible, and propose an AI tax to provide universal food and shelter. Others express skepticism about the psychological readiness for universal basic income (UBI) and suggest that society needs to decouple workplace productivity from social validity. The impact of technology and automation on employment and the need to change or replace the current capitalist system is also discussed. The concept of post-scarcity society is brought up, with some arguing that it's already a reality when it comes to commodities. However, scarcity still exists in services and infrastructure, and people may need to find meaning beyond their jobs in a post-scarcity society.Artificial intelligence (AI) could replace up to 300 million full-time jobs, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. It states\u00a0that up to a quarter of jobs in the US and Europe could be replaced, though AI could also create new jobs and a productivity increase. Generative AI that can create content indistinguishable from that produced by humans is cited in the report as \"a major advancement\". The\u00a0impact of AI differs across sectors, with 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions potentially automated, compared to\u00a0only 6% in construction, and 4% in maintenance. However, future of-work director at Oxford University\u00a0Carl Benedikt Frey warned that\u00a0the introduction of\u00a0generative AI would likely drive down wages.\nThis text is a disclaimer stating that the BBC is not liable for the content of external sites and provides information on their approach to external linking.

The idea is you can easily build your own custom ones that are thin wrappers around one or more of the builtin ones.This course is presumably walking you through building 50 high-quality hooks so that you're prepared to build your own. For example, one of the 50 is useFirestoreQuery. Understanding how to build that presumably prepares you to learn how to write useMyCorpNotificationMechanism.A lot of their 50 are trivial but handy. For example    const useToggle = (initialState = false) => {\n        const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);\n        const toggle = useCallback(() => setState(state => !state), []);\n        return [state, toggle]\n    }\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nricardobeat 1 day ago  \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nDon't forget the mandatory destructuring on the other side    const [state, toggle] = useToggle()\n\notherwise you'll end up causing unnecessary re-renders.

React hooks are good enough but they don\u2019t have the same approachability as Vue\u2019s composition API.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nXCSme 15 hours ago  \n             | root | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nI use React for \"big\" projects, that have to be more robust and customizable.I use Vue whenever I have to prototype something, their <script setup> syntax is awesome.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nlopkeny12ko 1 day ago  \n             | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nWhy was this flagged?\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nXCSme 15 hours ago  \n             | parent | next [\u2013] \n\nIt's a Show HN, there should be a way to demo/test the product.That being said, maybe the landing page is good enough of a demo of what they are offering.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nbundie 1 day ago  \n             | parent | prev | next [\u2013] \n\nI have no idea.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \npelagicAustral 1 day ago  \n             | prev [\u2013] \n\nI always think it is so fascinating to think that hooks and reusable components are nothing more than methods you may call once in the lifespan of the app, just that instead of making them call a two-liner on a single programming language someone decided it was better to embed HTML, JS and CSS and whatever else into a pre-packed, 1000-dependency, unmaintainable, hell-hole... and call it modern.\n \nreply\n\n  \n \nbundie 1 day ago  \n             | parent [\u2013] \n\nI completely agree that simplicity and maintainability should be at the forefront of our minds as we develop software. The more complex our codebases become, the more difficult it can be to make changes, fix bugs, and add new features. It's important to strike a balance between functionality and simplicity, and to avoid getting bogged down by overly complex code.\n \nreply\n\nApplications are open for YC Summer 2023\nGuidelines | FAQ | Lists | API | Security | Legal | Apply to YC | Contact\nSearch:  \n\nThe interactive way to master modern React \u2013\u00a0react.gg\n\nThe interactive way to master modern React\n\nby ui.dev\n\nCourse Section 01: The Big PictureChapters: Why?, Thinking in React, Imperative vs. Declarative, Pure Functions\nWhat you\u2019ll learn\n\nOptimized for\u00a0aha!\nWe\u2019re obsessed with helping you reach your aha! moments.\nOur text sections help you master the \u201cwhy\u201d behind React concepts and include fun, interactive visuals you can play with.\nGive it a try.\n\nInteractive diagram that toggles between a traditional approach of separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, and JS) and the React approach (all three combined in a component)COMPONENTSHTMLCSSJS\ninteractive\n\nCourse Section 02: Describing UIChapters: Components, JSX, Elements vs. Components, Props\n\nLeetcode for React\nHave you ever wished you could \u201cgrind Leetcode\u201d for a bunch of React practice problems?\nNo?

    "content": "Dumb phones are experiencing a resurgence in popularity among Generation Z in the US as a way to limit screen time. While some argue that a smartphone can be \"dumbed down\" by removing all non-essential apps, others prefer the simplicity of a basic phone with limited functionality. However, there are concerns about the restrictions on communication protocols on dumb phones, which exclude platforms such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Discord. Some manufacturers have addressed these concerns by offering devices with additional features, such as 4G connectivity and support for WhatsApp. Critics argue that while digital detoxes are a popular trend, they may not signal a long-term shift away from smartphones.The idea of living with a dumb phone, while possible, is considered a luxury as modern life is too dependent on smartphones for tasks such as GPS navigation, ordering food, unlocking doors, and checking children out of daycare. However, some people have found ways to limit their smartphone use by installing different apps in different profiles, leaving non-essential apps stowed away or using extreme power saver mode. Others have opted to use e-ink feature phones capable of calls, text messages, maps, readers, and calculators, or have found ways to gradually reduce their smartphone dependency by switching to a dumb phone and only reinstalling essential apps. Some have even suggested using two phones, one smart and one dumb, with the same number that both ring. Various dumb phone brands and models are available, although compatibility with different cell providers and services can be an issue.Dumb phones are becoming popular among Gen Z in the US. HMD Global, the maker of Nokia phones, continues to sell millions of mobile devices similar to those used in the early 2000s. Feature flip phone sales were up in the US in 2022 for HMD Global, with tens of thousands sold each month. The rise in dumb phones is thought to be due to mental health concerns motivating people to reduce screen time. Punkt and Light are catering to the trend, selling devices geared toward those with a desire to spend less time on their phones and social media. Devices are identified as \u201cdumb\u201d or minimalist phones that are inherently anti-technology. However, it is about consciously choosing when to use which aspects of technology.",
