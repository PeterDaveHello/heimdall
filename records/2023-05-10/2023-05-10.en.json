    "hn_content": "Apple has brought its Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro software to the iPad, in addition to a range of other pro-level apps. With more and more people using iPads for their computing needs, the move is aimed at helping users shift more of their computing use to the iPad. The pro apps will help shift users towards more serious music and video creation, as well as using the Mac as the next logical stepping point for those who use the iPad more seriously. While the iPad may be limited in terms of processing power compared to dedicated desktop computers, having pro apps available on the iPad signals to users that the tablet is now a serious device for creative work. Pro audio plugin developers are excited by the possibilities presented by the iPad's horsepower and touch interface.The post discusses the use of Touchscreen DAWs, particularly on the iPad, for music production. Several points are highlighted, such as the importance of touch-first for live instruments, the benefit of a mobile platform single app as a focus model, and the ease of switching between live instruments and on-screen virtual ones. The conversation also touches on the limitations of the iPad for music production, like the lack of connectivity for external gear and aftertouch sensitivity. The use of JUCE for plugin development is suggested, with a focus on developing DSP algorithms. Overall, the post highlights the subjective nature of workflows and the importance of finding the right tools to enhance creativity.Apple's release of Logic Pro X for iPad is a milestone for music production on the tablet. Industry professionals and music enthusiasts alike can use the device as a full-fledged DAW for music composition, thanks to its powerful hardware and convenience of mobility. Though users must be aware of the device limitations when it comes to mixing and producing final audio. Nevertheless, the added value of Logic Pro X is sure to attract a new user base and further increase the iPad's relevance in multimedia production.Apple's Bluetooth audio codecs, such as AAC 256 kbps, may not be optimal for real-time audio tasks such as recording applications and music production. The iPad is not seen as an entry point to Apple's ecosystem, given the stark contrast in how it is used compared to Macs. Apple is moving their apps, specifically Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, to a subscription model that costs $4.99 per month or $49 per year, respectively, which may suggest major updates for both apps later this year. Lastly, Logic Pro users are skeptical about the possibility of a future subscription-based model, as Apple's commitment to surrounding sound is not seen as revolutionary.Apple has launched Logic Pro for iPad with a free trial and a subscription-based model costing $1.99 per month. The move has had a mixed response, with some saying it makes Logic available to an audience previously unable to afford it while others argue it reflects a rise in subscription-based models and the phasing out of lifetime licenses by businesses. Gratuitous comments about the need for split payments by the cashier at the supermarket kept the conversation lively.Apple's new Final Cut Pro X subscription pricing model has received mixed reactions from the HN community. Some argue that it's a way to attract younger users or amateurs into music and video production, while others think there are cheaper alternatives available on the iPad. The $5 per month subscription is seen as a gimmick by some, as the actual price is $60 for a one-year prepayment. Some users expressed disappointment with iMovie's limitations, while others wished Final Cut Pro X\u00a0had an option to purchase a perpetual license. The discussion also touched on the difficulty of offering different pricing models on iOS devices due to Apple's policies.Summary:\n\n- Discussion on app distribution channels for iOS devices, with some users suggesting alternative options such as releasing separate apps or utilizing feature flagging.\n\n- Debate over the viability and fairness of perpetual licenses for software, with some arguing it aligns interests between companies and customers, while others worry about losing potential revenue and dealing with fragmented user bases.\n\n- Speculation on potential changes to app distribution policy in the EU versus the US.\n\n- Mentions of specific apps and software with unique distribution models, such as Working Copy, 1Password, and Jetbrains.",

    "content": "Site NavigationResearchProductDevelopersSafetyCompanySearchLanguage models can explain neurons in language modelsIllustration: Ruby ChenWe use GPT-4 to automatically write explanations for the behavior of neurons in large language models and to score those explanations. We release a dataset of these (imperfect) explanations and scores for every neuron in GPT-2.May 9, 2023More resourcesRead paperView neuronsView code and datasetResearch, Language, PublicationLanguage models have become more capable and more broadly deployed, but our understanding of how they work internally is still very limited. For example, it might be difficult to detect from their outputs whether they use biased heuristics or engage in deception. Interpretability research aims to uncover additional information by looking inside the model.One simple approach to interpretability research is to first understand what the individual components (neurons and attention heads) are doing. This has traditionally required humans to manually inspect neurons to figure out what features of the data they represent. This process doesn\u2019t scale well: it\u2019s hard to apply it to neural networks with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters. We propose an automated process that uses GPT-4 to produce and score natural language explanations of neuron behavior and apply it to neurons in another language model.This work is part of the third pillar of our approach to alignment research: we want to automate the alignment research work itself. A promising aspect of this approach is that it scales with the pace of AI development. As future models become increasingly intelligent and helpful as assistants, we will find better explanations.How it worksOur methodology consists of running 3 steps on every neuron.Sample 1 of 0Next sampleStep 1: Generate explanation using GPT-4Given a GPT-2 neuron, generate an explanation of its behavior by showing relevant text sequences and activations to GPT-4.Model-generated explanation:Step 2: Simulate using GPT-4Simulate what a neuron that fired for the explanation would do, again using GPT-4Step 3: CompareScore the explanation based on how well the simulated activations match the real activationsScore:What we foundUsing our scoring methodology, we can start to measure how well our techniques work for different parts of the network and try to improve the technique for parts that are currently poorly explained. For example, our technique works poorly for larger models, possibly because later layers are harder to explain.Although the vast majority of our explanations score poorly, we believe we can now use ML techniques to further improve our ability to produce explanations. For example, we found we were able to improve scores by:Iterating on explanations. We can increase scores by asking GPT-4 to come up with possible counterexamples, then revising explanations in light of their activations.Using larger models to give explanations. The average score goes up as the explainer model\u2019s capabilities increase. However, even GPT-4 gives worse explanations than humans, suggesting room for improvement.Changing the architecture of the explained model. Training models with different activation functions improved explanation scores.We are open-sourcing our datasets and visualization tools for GPT-4-written explanations of all 307,200 neurons in GPT-2, as well as code for explanation and scoring using publicly available models on the OpenAI API. We hope the research community will develop new techniques for generating higher-scoring explanations and better tools for exploring GPT-2 using explanations.We found over 1,000 neurons with explanations that scored at least 0.8, meaning that according to GPT-4 they account for most of the neuron\u2019s top-activating behavior. Most of these well-explained neurons are not very interesting. However, we also found many interesting neurons that GPT-4 didn't understand. We hope as explanations improve we may be able to rapidly uncover interesting qualitative understanding of model computations.KatKatDollarsDot dot dotHidingSample 1 of 4Next sampleMany of our readers may be aware that Japanese consumers are quite fond of unique and creative Kit Kat products and flavors. But now, Nestle Japan has come out with what could be described as not just a new flavor but a new \"species\" of Kit Kat.Token: Katlayer 0\u201cuppercase \u2018K\u2019 followed by various combinations of letters\u201dlayer 3\u201cfemale names\u201dlayer 13\u201cparts of words and phrases related to brand names and businesses\u201dlayer 25\u201cfood-related terms and descriptions\u201dNeurons activating across layers, higher layers are more abstract.OutlookOur method currently has many limitations, which we hope can be addressed in future work.We focused on short natural language explanations, but neurons may have very complex behavior that is impossible to describe succinctly. For example, neurons could be highly polysemantic (representing many distinct concepts) or could represent single concepts that humans don't understand or have words for.We want to eventually automatically find and explain entire neural circuits implementing complex behaviors, with neurons and attention heads working together. Our current method only explains neuron behavior as a function of the original text input, without saying anything about its downstream effects. For example, a neuron that activates on periods could be indicating the next word should start with a capital letter, or be incrementing a sentence counter.We explained the behavior of neurons without attempting to explain the mechanisms that produce that behavior. This means that even high-scoring explanations could do very poorly on out-of-distribution texts, since they are simply describing a correlation.Our overall procedure is quite compute intensive.We are excited about extensions and generalizations of our approach. Ultimately, we would like to use models to form, test, and iterate on fully general hypotheses just as an interpretability researcher would.Eventually we want to interpret our largest models as a way to detect alignment and safety problems before and after deployment. However, we still have a long way to go before these techniques can surface behaviors like dishonesty.AuthorsJan LeikeJeffrey WuSteven BillsWilliam SaundersLeo GaoHenk TillmanDaniel MossingAcknowledgmentsFiguresThomas DegryNick CammarataSuggestionsHannah WongGreg BrockmanIlya SutskeverKendra RimbachRelated researchView all researchGPT-4Mar 14, 2023March 14, 2023Forecasting potential misuses of language models for disinformation campaigns and how to reduce riskJan 11, 2023January 11, 2023Efficient training of language models to fill in the middleJul 28, 2022July 28, 2022A hazard analysis framework for code synthesis large language modelsJul 25, 2022July 25, 2022ResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewGPT-4DALL\u00b7E 2Customer storiesSafety standardsPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutBlogCareersCharterSecurityOpenAI \u00a9 2015\u200a\u2013\u200a2023Terms & policiesPrivacy policyBrand guidelinesTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top",

Another important point is that even the latest techniques don't work for larger models, which means that we still have no clue as to what is going on inside GPT-4 or even GPT-3. Moreover, currently, AI research is not putting in enough effort to build goal-directed agents, and it has focused on making systems that\u00a0generate passive responses to sensory stimuli. Finally, GPT-4 shows vast limitations in anything reasoning-based, and it is better at predicting the next word in sequence than actual reasoning.GPT-4 is better than Google in some respects, as it can extract and combine abstractions. However, it still needs human guidance and cannot reason its way through novel problems. Some commenters argue about the definition of \"reasoning\" and its relation to non-deductive reasoning, which requires embodied perceptual experiences. The accuracy of GPT-4's output is limited to matching prior inputs, and it lacks the real-world experiences and perceptions human reasoning requires. The discussion explores the relationship between intelligence, neurons, and consciousness.The post discusses the question of when humans begin to have a sense of self. It questions whether our consciousness and the experience of self is solely dependent on the brain, and factors such as memory, intelligence, and personality. The essence of the argument is that we cannot fully understand what we are, and whenever we believe we do, it can often lead to moral hazard and empirical danger. The comment section discusses the role of neurons in intelligence and the significant impact of brain damage on the mind. The conversation veers toward the potential of artificial neural networks in emulating human intelligence, and the significant differences between biological neurons and ANN.OpenAI researchers have developed a new technique for explaining the behavior of language models like GPT-4, which involves analyzing individual neuron activations in response to specific inputs. The technique uses generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative fine-tuning on specific tasks, and task-aware input transformations during fine-tuning to achieve effective transfer. The model outperforms those that use specifically-crafted architectures for each task, improving on state-of-the-art in 9 out of 12 benchmarks for natural language understanding. However, the technique is computationally intensive and has limited capacity for reverse-engineering larger structures or understanding the purpose of individual neurons. Experts warn that lack of transparency in black-box AI models makes them unsuitable for serious applications such as lie detection or drug detection at airports.A discussion around the use of AI to automate AI safety, specifically focusing on the development of an \"explainer\" for Neuromancy AI models. There is concern around the risk of an \"explainer\" model misaligning with the original model, leading to the inaccuracies spreading to future research. However, these misalignments may still be useful, particularly if the explainer can be tested. The explainer produces examples which can be evaluated, and the tool has been found to be fascinating and fun to use by some. The conversation touches on the unreliability of introspection and the possibility of there being things we are incapable of knowing.The post is a discussion about the fragility of human perception and consciousness. Commenters debate the possibility of an AI system having consciousness and reasoning abilities similar to humans. Some suggest that current language around AI's sentience and selfhood is premature. Others argue the potential of AI to explain its own thought processes. There is speculation about the definition of \"thinking\" and the purpose of consciousness. Some people mention the study that suggests conscious free will is an illusion. One commenter suggests consciousness might be a phenomenon that arises independently from complex systems. Additionally, a few people mention the importance of hallucinogens and lucid dreaming in reflecting on perception and the self.",

    "hn_content": "Apple has lost its legal battle to ban iOS virtual machines. Some commentators suggest Apple has been abusing its dominant position. Apple has been anti-VM in seemingly every instance, but they are not anti-VM, only anti VM-on-non-Apple hardware. It is rumored that lost hardware sales offsets any increased app or service sales from allowing VMs on non-Apple hardware. Azure pipelines use Mac pros. MacOS VMs run on GitHub Actions. If people want to develop an app for iOS, they have to buy an actual Mac Mini or rent one. It's using someone else's intellectual property without a license, so it's a breach of copyright.A court ruled that security research company Corellium's virtualization software of iOS is fair use, as it furthers scientific progress and does not harm Apple's iOS market. However, this does not mean that everyone can run iOS in virtual machines. The ruling also highlights that Apple does not have defacto rights to claim infringement on iOS, and emulating it is lawful as long as the emulator is transformative, does not abuse Apple's services, and does not threaten the iOS market. It is suggested that Apple's monopoly on devices requires the legal system to take action, as seen in the 30% tax and App Store policies. The ruling's relevance raises questions about why Apple must license its intellectual property to others, except security researchers.Apple's monopoly power is being brought into question in the UK, with over twice the threshold for monopoly power being reached. However, some argue that the actual term \"monopoly\" isn't important, but rather whether or not a company engages in anticompetitive practices. The discussion centers around Apple's 30% commission on App Store sales and their restrictions on payment methods, with some arguing that this is an exploitative practice that hurts consumers and developers. Others, however, argue that Apple's policies are necessary for protecting consumers from potentially harmful practices by developers. The recent court case with Epic Games has brought these issues to the forefront, with some expressing disappointment that Epic did not win. The debate also includes issues around the use of virtual machines and the banning of dynamically delivered payloads in Chrome's MV3 update.Apple has banned Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation, where JavaScript (or anything else) is translated into machine code and executed directly on the processor due to security reasons. Apple has also banned alternative browser engines, citing slow performance and bad user experience as reasons. However, running interpreted code, such as scripting languages, is allowed. Some users have found ways to run JavaScript without a JIT, and there are virtual Linux environments available on the App Store. The ban on JIT compilation and browser engines has faced criticism from some users who believe it is unnecessary and makes Apple a hypocrite. A recent case involving Corellium's third-party virtual iOS device used for security research has sparked debate about the needs and limitations of VMs.",

    "hn_content": "The UN Human Rights Chief urges the UK government to reverse the new \u201cPublic Order Bill\u201d, which many people believe is a threat to democratic protest laws. The police are criticised for abusing the new law, which curbs the right to peaceful protests and adversely affects human rights principles in the country. During the recent coronation, anti-monarchy protestors were arrested, despite prior communication with the Police. Many people believe that this new law is intended to suppress protest actions in the UK, and the police are accused of using their new powers to arrest peaceful protestors and undermine their human rights. Critics argue that the laws signal a dangerous shift towards authoritarianism, censorship, and nationalism that could have a lasting impact on British democracy.There is a debate about whether recent UK laws to limit protest and the right to strike align with the definition of fascism. One user argues that an unelected king with absolute power could be considered a dictator, but others disagree. Some users cite examples of past US drone strikes and debate the definition of fascism as a political ideology or strategy. The arrest of a few individuals under the new laws designed to prevent disruptions during the coronation is not necessarily indicative of fascism. However, breaking the rules to prohibit protest in one specific case may not align with the rule of law.This is not a tech-related article. It recounts an incident from William the Conqueror's coronation, followed by a discussion in the comments about the right to protest in the UK and police discretion. There is no new or exciting tech development.Over the weekend, 52 people were arrested in the UK during the coronation celebrations, including a group that was giving out rape alarms. However, some of those arrested were just holding signs or had items that police thought could be used as lock-on devices but were actually luggage straps. The police have expressed regret for these arrests and made personal apologies to those arrested. The new police powers bill has been rushed through and hasn't been scrutinized as much as it probably would have been if they weren't working to the deadline of the coronation. People are protesting the bill, which appears to allow police to arrest people who are not protesting peacefully, including those who are participating in sit-ins and movements such as Extinction Rebellion. Some believe that the UK is one of the countries where you are least likely to experience any sort of police brutality or corruption. However, there have been reports of systemic racism, homophobia, and misogyny within the Met and bad calls and misconduct, such as using the position of authority to sexually abuse or murder women. The UK government's freedom of expression rights is not as strong as the US'.This text contains a series of comments on a forum thread discussing the concept of free speech and protests. Some users express their opinions on the limitations of free speech and the limits of protests, with examples of disruptive behavior that does not constitute free speech. Others discuss the role of monarchies and democracies, with differing opinions on whether monarchies are inherently \"evil.\" The conversation also touches on the approval of monarchies in some European countries and the potential drawbacks of elected heads of state. Overall, the post does not contain significant technical content or news, but serves as a forum for discussing political and societal issues.The debate around monarchies versus elected leaders is ongoing, and opinions vary depending on cultural differences and the perceived power and function of the monarchy in each country. The UK monarchy is often seen as a ceremonial role with little real power, but this may not be entirely the case. In general, many people are hesitant to speak out against the monarchy due to cultural attitudes towards protest and standing out. However, there are also arguments for the benefits of having a monarchy, such as tourism and diplomatic relations. Ultimately, the views on monarchies and their relevance or importance vary and are heavily influenced by cultural, historical, and political factors.",

    "hn_content": "The James Webb Space Telescope has imaged Fomalhaut's disk in detail, revealing an outer ring about 240 astronomical units in diameter. However, comparing diameter to radius can be misleading, and the ring is actually closer than Voyager, at 120 AU. The central \"black blob\" seen on the images is the coronagraph that blocks out the star, allowing other objects to be visible.\u00a0The JWST is placed in a halo orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange point (L2), making it possible to shield both the Sun and Earth from the instrument's view, as well as ensuring the telescope is far enough from Earth that being in Earth's near-infrared radiation will not interfere with its observations. Future space telescopes may be much bigger, potentially needing assembly and maintenance by workers in space suits.The James Webb Space Telescope operates at extremely low temperatures to prevent sunlight from overwhelming the sensors. Telescopes on Earth cool detectors well below that temperature. Starship's large fairing volume could enable the development of devices that are less optimized for size and weight, but there is a tendency in science to over-optimize everything, leading to exploding costs. Launch costs prevent economical repair and result in extreme weight reduction. In-space assembly enables radiation hardening with shielding. The cost of launching a scope is not the bottleneck. JWST's development costs are staggering compared to other launch vehicles. NASA makes most space-based discoveries, while not at all being able to control costs, as JWST has shown. CubeSats could help with the cost control problem. There is a promising investigation on a telescope array that can use our sun's gravitational lens.The cost of SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches is around $60 million, which is similar to what Arianespace and Roscosmos charge. While there is no path to further reducing launch prices, there is room to decrease costs by discarding the second stage of the rocket and achieving full reusability. However, full reusability may not provide a 10x cost decrease, as maintenance can be expensive and time-consuming. The existence of a massively expensive to launch Kuiper Belt in another star system has been discovered by the JWST space telescope. While JWST observations are changing the details of what we have already seen, it is still a huge leap in capability and rich in new discoveries. JWT's sensitivity has improved, enabling it to observe galaxies beyond redshift 11, which Hubble cannot see. While resolving new details is limited by the sizes of its mirrors or detectors, aperture synthesis in software and space-based radio wave interferometry could provide higher resolutions.The Tech Times reports that the James Webb Space Telescope has captured its first scientific image of Fomalhaut, revealing a previously unseen view of the debris disk around the star. The image was captured by the Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) of the telescope. Several users on Hacker News share their excitement about the stunning image and speculated about the possibilities of studying exoplanets through it. Radiotelescope ALMA's superimposed image of Fomalhaut is also shared as an interesting comparison. It is hoped that this image could help scientists refine the plans for observations and optimize the early science experiences on the instrument.",

The technology will be of interest to those hoping to protect legacy apps using Java, although several contributors on Hacker News commented negatively about the development including one who predicted that CheerpJ, together with other recent evolutions, would return us to the days of Internet Explorer 6 but \"with 4k monitors\". However, other contributors disagreed, and highlighted the benefits of the new development.\nDevelopers can improve performance when creating web pages by loading JavaScript and CSS from CDNs. However, single-page applications require stricter APIs for building and prototype development, unlike server-side HTML, where privileged data can be directly obtained from the database. Java in the browser, such as Eclipse, is possible with WebAssembly (WASM) support in GraalVM. Although WASM targets better platform compatibility, CPU abstraction limits its ability to adopt new hardware features. Despite WASM's potential to cross-compile and simplify app distribution, it requires developers to write platform specific native binaries, which adds complexity to build and distribute processes. Interpreting WASM is also slow, requiring a native runtime. As a recommended alternative, doppio offers a platform-neutral Java implementation that includes support for real-time music interpretation.Italian software company Leaning Technologies has launched version 3.0 of CheerpJ, a tool for compiling Java desktop applications to run in a web browser, without using a Java Virtual Machine, due to security considerations. The current version uses an interpreter, while previous versions used Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, which was hard to enact, and the company hopes that its latest iteration will appeal to enterprise clients. CheerpJ 3.0 has all the necessary prerequisites, plus custom tag support and a JRE coming in at 2.5MB. The compiled applications are said to perform well and run on all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.CheerpJ is being sold as a commercial product, specifically for running the kind of line-of-business application that people need to be able to use to do their job. WASM Garbage collection seems to be coming soon. Current WASM projects keep having to build out garbage collection support for their runtimes, which seems inefficient. Kotlin wasm compiler is currently available as an experimental option with kotlin 1.8 and beyond. Swing window movement is implemented in CheerpJ 2.x, but not yet as part of the CheerpJ 3.0 rework. Java is still relevant despite being an outdated language, as new features are only added after they prove their worth elsewhere, making it easier to hire and maintain.",

This was the result of an evaluation of 14 studies of the highest quality conducted at the German Cancer Research Center with a total of almost 105,000 participants.\u00a9 Adobe StockVitamin D deficiency is widespread worldwide and is particularly common among cancer patients. Averaged over the year, the vitamin D blood levels of about 15 percent of German adults are below the threshold for a pronounced vitamin D deficiency*. In contrast, in a study of colorectal cancer patients, researchers diagnosed vitamin D3 deficiency in 59 percent of participants, which was also associated with unfavorable prognosis.Potential effects of vitamin D supplementation and the development or prognosis of cancer have already been investigated in numerous studies. \"Based on current studies, vitamin D3 supplementation probably does not protect against developing cancer, but it could reduce the likelihood of dying from cancer. However, previous studies on cancer mortality have yielded very different results, and we were interested in the reasons for this,\" said Ben Sch\u00f6ttker, an epidemiologist at the German Cancer Research Center. \"By re-evaluating all previous studies on the topic, we wanted to help produce robust results on this issue, which is so relevant to population health.To investigate the effectiveness of vitamin D3 on cancer mortality in the population and on the survival of cancer patients, Ben Sch\u00f6ttker and colleagues conducted a systematic literature search that identified 14 studies with a total of nearly 105,000 participants. The researchers considered only studies of the highest quality whose participants had been randomly assigned to the vitamin D3 arm or the placebo arm.When all 14 studies were pooled, no statistically significant results emerged. However, when the studies were divided according to whether vitamin D3 was taken daily in a low dose** or in higher doses administered at longer intervals**, a large difference was seen. In the four studies with the infrequent hogher doses, there was no effect on cancer mortality. In contrast, in the summary of the ten studies with daily dosing, the researchers determined a statistically significant twelve percent reduction in cancer mortality.\"We observed this twelve percent reduction in cancer mortality after untargeted vitamin D3 administration to individuals with and without vitamin D deficiency. We can therefore assume that the effect is significantly higher for those people who are actually vitamin D deficient,\" says Ben Sch\u00f6ttker. He explains the better efficacy of daily doses of vitamin D3 by the more regular bioavailability of the active agent, the hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which is only produced by reactions of vitamin D in the body and can presumably inhibit tumor growth.A more detailed analysis of the studies with daily intake further revealed that people aged 70 and older benefited most from vitamin D3 therapy. In addition, the effect was most evident when vitamin D intake was started before the cancer diagnosis.Hermann Brenner, epidemiologist and prevention expert at DKFZ, adds: \"This work underlines the great potential of vitamin D3 administration in the prevention of cancer deaths. Regular intake at low doses** is associated with almost negligible risk and very low cost.\"The current work was supported by German Cancer Aid.PublikationKuznia S, Zhu A, Akutsu T, Buring JE, Camargo CA Jr, Cook NR, Chen LJ, Cheng TD, Hantunen S, Lee IM, Manson JE, Neale RE, Scragg R, Shadyab AH, Sha S, Sluyter J, Tuomainen TP, Urashima M, Virtanen JK, Voutilainen A, Wactawski-Wende J, Waterhouse M, Brenner H, Sch\u00f6ttker B. Efficacy of vitamin D3 supplementation on cancer mortality: Systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. Ageing Res Rev. 2023, DOI: 10.1016/j.arr.2023.101923.* The threshold blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level used for vitamin D deficiency was 30 nmol/L (= 12 ng/ml). If individuals with less severe vitamin D deficiency (blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 50 nmol/L (= 20 ng/ml)) are added, slightly more than half of Germans have at least one deficiency. However, there are also guidelines that use other thresholds. Since the vitamin D level in the blood depends primarily on the tanning of the skin, this percentage also varies greatly with the seasons.** In the studies, daily low doses were 400 to 4000 IU per day, and higher-doses administered at longer intervals were 60,000 to 120,000 IU once per month or less.The German Cancer Research Center (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, DKFZ) with its more than 3,000 employees is the largest biomedical research institution in Germany. More than 1,300 scientists at the DKFZ investigate how cancer develops, identify cancer risk factors and search for new strategies to prevent people from developing cancer. They are developing new methods to diagnose tumors more precisely and treat cancer patients more successfully.

The patient discovered the cure on their own since the medical system would not have figured it out. Doctors have mixed opinions on the correlation between Vitamin D and depression since studies are unclear. Vitamin D is effective in stabilizing mood and helps prevent cancer. Western medicine is excellent for treating broken bones but is not efficient when it comes to treating most other ailments. The medical system is usually excellent when the cause of an illness is defined on a black and white test. Lack of sun exposure can be a risk factor for cancer. Self-medicating with Vitamin D is acceptable, but doctors cannot prescribe Vitamin D since the current data on it is poor. Patients should instead be advised to take Vitamin D.A discussion on doctors who prioritize profit over helping patients, how some patients have to take matters into their own hands to get proper diagnosis and treatment, and the potential risks associated with hospital-acquired infections. Some commenters question the necessity of surgery for shoulder dislocations, while others bring up the importance of considering individual priorities and evaluating all treatment options. There is also brief commentary on the need for better monitoring of personal health metrics.Some tech-savvy people discuss the feasibility of an \"embedded blood monitoring device\" for tracking their metabolic metrics. They express the need for more accessible and easier health metric-tracking tools. They argue that doctors and healthcare systems focus on reaction instead of prevention. Some commenters and studies establish connections between vitamin D deficiency, mental health, and arterial plaque. One user describes their attempts to get blood tests done for monitoring purposes but faces prohibitive costs and guidelines. Some commenters highlight the importance of balanced diet and exercise, while highlighting the downsides of current wellness fads. Some users criticize doctors and their institutions' lack of imagination and care and propose their ways of taking charge of their health.The discussion primarily revolves around the benefits and appropriate dosage of vitamin D, with some criticism of doctors' approaches to prescribing supplements. A study is mentioned that found daily doses of vitamin D3 to be more effective than weekly or monthly bolus doses. There is debate about what constitutes appropriate dosage, with some individuals taking relatively high doses recommended by doctors. The use of plant-based or animal-based vitamin D is discussed, with some advocating for consuming fish for vitamin D, while others mention supplements as a more efficient method of getting the vitamin.Numerous studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency can lead to a host of health problems, including cancer, and fish is an essential component of a healthy human diet, as it contains nutrients and micronutrients that are not produced by fish themselves. While vitamin D3 can be obtained from sunlight, consuming fish or taking supplements is generally recommended, as overfishing is a serious problem. Taking vitamin D supplements is one of the easiest ways to treat this deficiency. However, too much of it can cause liver issues, so it's important to find the right balance. Additionally, there is evidence indicating that a lack of vitamin D can lead to increased viral infections. While the statistics on the main types of cancer related to latitude are significant, it's not always clear whether they are the result of differences in sunlight or other environmental factors.The conversation revolves around Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation. Users suggest methods to measure Vitamin D levels, potential sources of Vitamin D, and whether supplementation is necessary or effective. Some users cite studies that suggest daily low-dose Vitamin D supplementation is effective in reducing cancer mortality, but others express some skepticism about whether supplementation is effective or whether excessive Vitamin D can lead to toxicity. The cost of supplementation and potential downsides are considered, but there is no clear consensus on the issue. Overall, the conversation is informative and suggests that Vitamin D deficiency is a common issue that should be addressed by individuals, but users advise caution and consultation with medical professionals when considering supplementation.- Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide and particularly prevalent among cancer patients.\n- Optimal vitamin D levels are around 60-70 ng/ml, but a lot of people in the West are deficient.\n- Low vitamin D levels are associated with higher levels of inflammation in the body, which can lead to negative health outcomes like depression, impaired immune function, and increased cancer risk.\n- Supplementing vitamin D can reduce cancer mortality, particularly in those who are vitamin D deficient, but high doses do not work.\n- Vitamin D supplementation has been linked to decreased incidence of sickness in one family, but causality cannot be confirmed.\n- The effectiveness of vitamin D supplements has been debated in the past, similar to the controversy surrounding vitamin C and its potential as a cancer-fighting agent.",

Read about what we're doing.Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it\u2019s transmitted over the internet.Get StartedGrab one of the downloads and start syncing!Check out the getting started guide for some tips along the way.Private & SecurePrivate. None of your data is ever stored anywhere else other than on your computers. There is no central server that might be compromised, legally or illegally.Encrypted. All communication is secured using TLS. The encryption used includes perfect forward secrecy to prevent any eavesdropper from ever gaining access to your data.Authenticated. Every device is identified by a strong cryptographic certificate. Only devices you have explicitly allowed can connect to your other devices.If you have a security concern, please see the security page for details and contact information.OpenOpen Protocol. The protocol is a documented specification \u2014 no hidden magic.Open Source. All source code is available on GitHub \u2014 what you see is what you get, there is no hidden funny business.Open Development. Any bugs found are immediately visible for anyone to browse \u2014 no hidden flaws.Open Discourse. Development and usage is always open for discussion.Easy to UsePowerful. Synchronize as many folders as you need with different people or just between your own devices.Portable. Configure and monitor Syncthing via a responsive and powerful interface accessible via your browser. Works on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, OpenBSD, and many others. Run it on your desktop computers and synchronize them with your server for backup.Simple. Syncthing doesn\u2019t need IP addresses or advanced configuration: it just works, over LAN and over the Internet. Every machine is identified by an ID. Give your ID to your friends, share a folder and watch: UPnP will do if you don\u2019t want to port forward or you don\u2019t know how.Kastelo provides commercial support for Syncthing and sponsors Syncthing with development resources.",

    "hn_content": "Syncthing, a continuous file synchronization program, receives praise for being the best sync software, only lacking a good iOS app. Users express appreciation for its reliability and focus on peer-to-peer sync. Apple's limited iOS prevents users from accessing certain directories, making it difficult to edit files or use other apps, with some suggesting potential solutions such as integrating APIs similar to iCloud. Users discuss other backup options such as Nextcloud, Seedvault, and working copy. M\u00f6bius Sync is mentioned as a potential option but has some limitations, such as not working in the background. Syncthing has flaws such as confusion with setting up and the danger of the update process being compromised, but it still ranks as one of the better sync options available.Users share positive experiences with Syncthing, a software tool that allows for effortless synchronization of files across multiple devices. It is excellent for syncing development folders and plaintext notes, uploading pictures, and sending executable files to a server. Users experience problems when syncing hundreds of gigabytes or massive numbers of files. Syncthing \"just\" syncs files, and it won't de-conflict changes beyond saving the \"bad\" version in a file. It is advisable not to use Syncthing on Git repos or databases. Some users prefer Syncthing over resilio or OpenVPN because it's open source, nerdy, and comes with knobs one can tweak. The software is recommended for personal backups, whether a single user or multiple computers.",

    "hn_content": "MeetCala.com, a new scheduling app, has been released that enables users to find a replacement for meetings that they can no longer attend. While some are excited about the app's potential, others have raised concerns about the access it requires to users' private data, with some warning that MeetCala.com should not be given access to work emails. Despite these concerns, several users have commented on how different the reaction to such apps would have been 15 years ago and questioned whether the days of fast innovation are over. Some posts also discuss how employees should balance their loyalty to their employer against their responsibility to protect sensitive data.No meaningful content to summarize.A discussion on Hacker News centered on the habit of canceling meetings last-minute if there is no agenda, and whether this is a manager or engineer style issue. Some commenters suggest attaching a Google Doc or other notes to the meeting invite, while others point out the need to work on making the meeting agenda not solely the domain of the manager. Some suggest declining meetings that are deemed unnecessary or unproductive and discussing this with coworkers directly, while others indicate the risks of speaking out against meetings if it goes against the organizational culture. Overall, it highlights the need for good communication and setting up guidelines for productive meetings within an organization.A small startup called Cala has developed an iOS app that enables meeting attendees to \"swipe\" if their schedules change or they no longer feel a meeting is necessary and others will receive notifications. The app then calculates what percentage of people have swiped 'no', and the meeting is cancelled if the threshold is reached. However, one HN user pointed out that blindly swiping left could deprive those involved of useful updates or important decisions. Another user suggested using such apps can distract from offering direct feedback with team members. Another solution was to create a \"meeting cost-plugin\" - displaying - (time * corporate avg salary * participants), in order to drive home the time and expense wasted on unnecessary meetings.\u00a0\nNo meaningful content to provide a summary.",
