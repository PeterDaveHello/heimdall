    "originBody": "Reverse Engineering TicketMaster's Rotating Barcodes (SafeTix) Conduition 2024-02-04 code “Screenshots won’t get you in”, but Chrome DevTools will. Click here to skip the rant and go straight to the nerdy stuff. I recently purchased tickets to a concert from TicketMaster. If they had issued me normal, printable PDF tickets I could save offline to my phone, this article would’ve never been penned. But of course this is 2024: Nothing we do online can be simple anymore. After finalizing the purchase, TicketMaster discloses that I can’t print off tickets for this event. Instead, they issue tickets via a system called Mobile Entry, AKA SafeTix. This takes the form of a rotating barcode displayed inside TicketMaster’s web-app or android/ios app. Perhaps I’m getting old, but I remember a time when printable tickets were ubiquitous. One could print off tickets after buying them online or even (gasp) in-person, and bring these paper tickets to get entry into the event when you arrive. They can be saved as PDFs and viewed on pretty much any device on the planet. PDF tickets work even if your phone loses internet connection. Paper tickets work even if you don’t have a phone. If you bought the ticket off the event’s official ticketing agency (not a sketchy reseller), you know for sure that they’re real. There’s no risk that your ticket won’t get you in. You can easily send them to a friend over WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, email, or even by-hand with printed tickets. These rotating barcodes on the other hand are far from perfect. I experienced this first-hand last year when I attended another very popular concert where they used a similar rotating-QR-code-ticket system. Numerous people including myself and my friends were floundering at the entry gate citing a bevy of broken barcode problems. The #1 was: My phone has no internet connection, so my QR code won’t load. The venue was so crowded that cell-towers and WiFi were overloaded. Internet access was spottier than a Dalmatian with chickenpox. The company responsible for this ticketing nightmare (I can’t remember their name) obviously had no phone support line, and even if they did it probably wouldn’t have worked. The venue employees were completely helpless. Our only hope was to keep refreshing the ticket app, wildly waving our phones in the air in the hopes we might catch a brief moment of cell-network coverage with which to fetch and then display the ticket QR codes to the venue staff. In the end, I luckily caught some cell-service and loaded our ticket QR codes. We left behind a slew of other ticketholders waving their phones around at the gate. I have no idea whether they ever got through. I paid three hundred US dollars for this high-tech experience. The Marketing TicketMaster markets their SafeTix technology as a cure-all for scammers and scalpers. SafeTix™ are powered by a new and unique barcode that automatically refreshes every few seconds so it cannot be stolen or copied, keeping your tickets safe and secure. Ticketmaster SafeTix are powered by a new and unique barcode that automatically refreshes every 15 seconds. This greatly reduces the risk of ticket fraud from stolen or illegal counterfeit tickets. Source Our secure ticket technology reduces the risk of ticket fraud, eliminating the possibilities of theft or counterfeiting. Once you’ve purchased your mobile tickets on Ticketmaster, you can always rest assured you’re getting the seats you paid for. Source There’s also this gem: If you take a closer look at your ticket, you may notice that it has a gliding movement, making it in a sense, alive. That movement is our ticket technology actively working to safeguard you every second. Bullshit, TicketMaster. It’s a CSS animation. Get over yourself. The part that got me worried: The barcode on your mobile ticket includes technology to protect it, which means screenshots or printouts of your ticket will not be scannable. This triggered flashbacks to the concert last year, and I pictured myself once more haphazardly waving my phone around, praying for service like Saul Goodman in the desert. But TicketMaster was prepared for this anxiety: Concerned about cell phone service at venues? This ticket has you covered. Once you view it in our App, your ticket is automatically saved so it’s always ready. Great, so as long as I trust their app not to have a seizure on the day of the concert, I should be fine. Too bad I really don’t trust that, besides the fact that I don’t want to install their spyware on my phone. Motivations It’s pretty clear why TicketMaster is pushing this technology: SafeTix makes it harder for people to resell tickets outside of TicketMaster’s closed, high-margin ticket-resale marketplace, where they make a boatload of money by buying low and selling high to customers with no alternative. It pushes users to install TicketMaster’s proprietary closed-source app, which gives TicketMaster more insight into their users’ devices and behavior. People can’t save and transfer tickets outside of Ticketmaster. This forces ticketholders to surrender their friends’ contact information to TicketMaster, who can use this data to build social graphs, or conduct other privacy-invasive practices. TicketMaster will never admit to these motivations, but it cannot be doubted that these effects have manifested regardless of TicketMaster’s intent, and they’re all good news for TicketMaster’s shareholders, if not for their customers. The Contradiction If you have any experience with computers and software, then having read all of TicketMaster’s marketing, you might come to the same question I did. How can tickets be saved offline if they can’t also be transferred outside of TicketMaster? This ticket is digital. Saving data offline is the same as copying it to your hard drive. If data can be copied, it can be transmitted. If it can be transmitted, it can be shared. If it can be shared, it can be sold. This is a contradiction in TicketMaster’s marketing. They can’t have robust DRM on their tickets if those tickets can still be viewed offline. So what is TicketMaster really doing to create these rotating barcodes? Reverse Engineering My first order of business was inspecting the barcodes themselves to see what I could learn. Their format is quite simple. They are PDF417 barcodes which encode UTF-8 text. As I mentioned earlier, that blue bar which sweeps across the barcode is just a gimmicky CSS animation: It doesn’t actually prevent screenshots of the barcode from scanning, because PDF417 has error correction properties built-in. It seems like some older barcodes encode different formats of text, but the barcodes my TicketMaster web-app was generating embed data which looks like this: 1 B4cq2BdFCpFl90TDuYD3pWfRDSO6eQ3bR0YQqsDnyfciuVFkKp+m0zI+a2lgfonY::140013::481994::1707070843 Disclaimer: This isn’t from a real SafeTix barcode. I don’t want TicketMaster to be able to identify and harass me. This looks like four distinct pieces of data, delimited by colons. First, there is some Base64-encoded data, followed by two six-digit numbers, with a unix timestamp trailing at the end. When the barcode rotates every 15 seconds, its content changes slightly. The base64 data remains static, but both 6-digit numbers and the timestamp change. 1 B4cq2BdFCpFl90TDuYD3pWfRDSO6eQ3bR0YQqsDnyfciuVFkKp+m0zI+a2lgfonY::358190::038184::1707070859 These six-digit numbers behave a lot like Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTPs) - This is what powers 2FA apps like Authy or Google Authenticator. These are rotating 6-digit codes which can be generated from a shared secret and a timestamp. My instinct was that the first two numbers are indeed TOTPs, generated from different secrets, using the unix timestamp appended at the end of the barcode data. This makes sense: TicketMaster wouldn’t want to reinvent the wheel with this system, so they used a tried and tested cryptographic tool as a building block. The base64 data was still a mystery. Decoding it into its constituent 48 bytes, it doesn’t seem to contain any meaningful data structures that I could discern. It seems more or less like random data, and since it doesn’t change when the barcode rotates, it’s probably some kind of random bearer token which identifies the ticketholder and their ticket. When the ticket is scanned at the venue, TicketMaster (or perhaps the venue) looks up the ticket metadata using that bearer token, and then validates the two OTPs against two secrets stored in its database. If both steps pass, then your ticket is valid and the staff can let you in. Here’s the Secret TOTPs are very customizable, but generally the software industry has settled on a set of common defaults for TOTP standardization. You really only need to have two things to generate a TOTP: The shared secret, which is just a byte array. A working clock. If you have both of those, you can generate as many TOTPs as you’d like, entirely offline. There are two TOTPs in the barcode data, so there are probably two shared secrets I need to find. If I have both of those, plus the bearer token, I can create as many valid barcodes as I want. So now my goal is much clearer: I need to find out where these tokens & secrets come from. Debugging the Web App I booted up an Android phone and connected its Chrome browser to the Chrome DevTools on my desktop computer. This gives me a view into TicketMaster’s API and source code. By recording network requests as I loaded the TicketMaster barcode viewer, I found one particularly interesting request: 1 POST /api/render-ticket/secure-barcode?time=1707071877481&amid=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&_format=json Its response data: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 { \"deviceId\": \"8f651107-acad-42a4-b3a6-019aaac41960\", \"deviceType\": \"WEB\", \"deviceOs\": \"ANDROID\", \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 10; K) XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\", \"nfcCapableDevice\": true, \"tickets\": [ { \"eventId\": \"myevent.50.38991943985838B9\", \"section\": \"3\", \"row\": \"A\", \"seat\": \"1\", \"barcode\": \"481848590102K\", \"addedValue\": false, \"generalAdmission\": false, \"fan\": null, \"token\": \"eyJiIjoiNDgxODQ4NTkwMTAySyIsInQiOiJUR1JMWUNxQWYyQ1MvQmxILzh5dThZdkhoV055TW8xUW9CYTI5UTVqVkN4V2xBcE5NbnczSlJkeU9UcFVVWUFDIiwiY2siOiJiOTg0MzJlZDIzYjhmMmJkYTgyMzQ4MjE2MjI5ZjRkMjdjZTlkMDYzIiwiZWsiOiJiMzUxOTM2NGUwYzc5MTRjMWY5ZDU5ZDM1NjUyYTA0MDY3ZDJmNjQ3IiwicnQiOiJyb3RhdGluZ19zeW1ib2xvZ3kifQ==\", \"renderType\": \"rotating_symbology\", \"passData\": { \"android\": { \"jwt\": \"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY\" } }, \"bindingRequired\": true, \"deviceKeyBindingRequired\": false, \"deviceSignatureRequired\": false, \"segmentType\": \"NFC_ROTATING_SYMBOLOGY\", \"ticketId\": \"50.3.A.1\" } ], \"globalUserId\": \"k39Fj4lNfOS4Zq481bxIWg\" } Disclaimer: Identifying data has been scrambled to protect the guilty. Note the token property in the object in the tickets array. I base64-decoded it, and I found it was actually just a another JSON object: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 { \"b\": \"481848590102K\", \"t\": \"TGRLYCqAf2CS/BlH/8yu8YvHhWNyMo1QoBa29Q5jVCxWlApNMnw3JRdyOTpUUYAC\", \"ck\": \"b98432ed23b8f2bda82348216229f4d27ce9d063\", \"ek\": \"b3519364e0c7914c1f9d59d35652a04067d2f647\", \"rt\": \"rotating_symbology\" } The b property seems to be the same as the barcode property on the ticket object. The rt property seems to be the same as the renderType property on the main ticket object. The t property is a base64-encoded byte array, 48 bytes long. The ck and ek properties are both hex-encoded byte arrays, each 20 bytes long. I re-scanned the latest barcode shown on the TicketMaster web-app: 1 TGRLYCqAf2CS/BlH/8yu8YvHhWNyMo1QoBa29Q5jVCxWlApNMnw3JRdyOTpUUYAC::492436::240860::1707074879 Nice. So t is the static bearer token. I wonder if ck and ek are the TOTP secrets I’m after. Upon some further investigation into TicketMaster’s minified website source code, in a file called presence-secure-entry.js, I found the actual function the web-app uses to generate barcode data, which is labeled generateSignedToken. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 key: \"generateSignedToken\", value: function(t) { var e = arguments.length > 1 && void 0 !== arguments[1] && arguments[1]; if (this.displayType === l.ROTATING) { var n = [this.eventKey, this.customerKey] , a = t; if (this.eventKey) { var u = new Date(a); a = u instanceof Date && \"Invalid Date\" !== \"\".concat(u) ? u : new Date } var A = n.reduce((function(t, n) { if (n) { var u; try { u = i.b32encode(o.a.hexToByteString(n)) } catch (t) { u = \"\" } var A = r.a(u, 15).now(a, e); t.push(A) } return t } ), [this.rawToken]); if (this.eventKey) { var s = Math.floor(a.getTime() / 1e3); A.push(s) } return A.join(\"::\") } return this.barcode } The minification makes it a bit harder to read, but it seems like ek and ck probably refer to the eventKey and customerKey respectively, while the bearer token t is referenced as rawToken in the above code. It appears the two TOTPs are generated with a 15-second time step interval, but are otherwise constructed in the same way as the ubiquitous industry-standard SHA-1 TOTPs we see in any mobile 2FA app. The first one is generated with the eventKey, and the second with the customerKey. Finally, the unix timestamp used for both TOTPs is appended to help with verification on the server-side. To verify my interpretation, I installed oathtool, a TOTP command-line tool. I plugged ck, ek and the unix timestamp into a SHA-1 TOTP generator with a 15-second step interval: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 $ sudo apt install oathtool -y ... $ date=$(python3 -c 'import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(1707074879).isoformat())') $ oathtool --totp --time-step-size 15s -N \"$date\" b3519364e0c7914c1f9d59d35652a04067d2f647 492436 $ oathtool --totp --time-step-size 15s -N \"$date\" b98432ed23b8f2bda82348216229f4d27ce9d063 240860 Bingo! 🎉 This matches the TOTPs in the barcode: 1 TGRLYCqAf2CS/BlH/8yu8YvHhWNyMo1QoBa29Q5jVCxWlApNMnw3JRdyOTpUUYAC::492436::240860::1707074879 The eventKey is probably unique to the particular event that is being ticketed, and customerKey is probably unique to the ticketholder. They don’t appear to change at all, unlike the rawToken which seems to rotate every time I refresh the TicketMaster web-app. However, if I leave the page alone for several hours, the rawToken doesn’t change, suggesting it should remain valid even after closing the web-app. What about the passData.android.jwt field? Does that come into play anywhere? I’ll save you some work on that front. Turns out it’s not actually needed for ticket verification at all, but rather just an authentication token used for saving the ticket to a user’s Google Wallet. I don’t use Google Wallet. Being a rather privacy-conscious individual, I stay well clear of Google services as much as possible. Pirating Tickets I now know everything I would need to duplicate TicketMaster’s barcodes in a custom app, or even resell a ticket outside of TicketMaster’s closed marketplace. All I would need to do is extract the base64 token property from the /api/render-ticket/secure-barcode API endpoint, or engineer a way to fetch that token dynamically using TicketMaster session credentials. That base64 token string IS the ticket, as far as the venue staff at the gates are concerned. If you have a valid rawToken, eventKey, and customerKey, you can generate valid PDF417 barcodes, indistinguishable from the official TicketMaster app. Short of checking photo IDs at the entry gate, the venue staff can’t tell whether the person at the gate is the same person who the ticket is registered to on TicketMaster. Quite hilariously, TicketMaster actually makes token-extraction easy on us: The token is logged to the browser console automatically when the barcode renderer component is mounted on the web page. 1 2 3 4 5 6 r.a.log( \"'render' called on '\".concat( \"pseview-\".concat(J.get(this)), \"' with token '\", this.token, \"'\" ) ) This means we don’t even need to mess around injecting custom user-scripts into the page to get the token out. You can just open your SafeTix barcode on the TicketMaster web-app, connect your phone’s Chrome instance to your laptop’s Chrome DevTools, and open the console. You’ll see the token printed right there. You can copy and use it wherever you’d like. Lifetimes The only unknown factor here is the rawToken lifetime. It’s difficult to know for sure how TicketMaster’s backend server uses rawToken to look up the ticket. It’s likely that a new rawToken is generated every time the client contacts the /api/render-ticket/secure-barcode endpoint. I have no idea how long each rawToken remains valid. It’s possible that only a single rawToken could be valid for a given TicketMaster account at a time. Indeed TicketMaster devs probably designed the system that way to prevent extracting multiple tickets which are concurrently valid. If multiple tokens are valid concurrently, one person could buy dozens of tickets, extract however many ticket tokens they’d like, and resell them under-the-table. I would really love if TicketMaster didn’t think of that, because then I could extract the ticket tokens for my friends and distribute them without having to go through TicketMaster’s data-harvesting pipeline. The only authoritative source I could find on this is an obscure document on TicketMaster’s developer API docs website. Partners will need to refresh the token 20 hours prior to the start of the event and whenever the ticket is displayed in your app. FAQ How often must the token be refreshed? You should refresh the token anytime a fan opens and views a ticket within your app and 20 hours prior to the event. If you are unable to refresh the token when the fan views the ticket at the gate, then the SDK would attempt to use the token refreshed 20 hours prior. The token should still be valid. You do not need to refresh the token every 20 hours. Based on this, it might be reasonable to assume the rawToken is only valid for a 20 hour period, which would mean you’d need to fetch the rawToken at most 20 hours before the event to be able to resell or transfer it without TicketMaster’s permission. However, if all you want to do is save a ticket offline, this is more than adequate. I even built a little Expo app I call TicketGimp which renders SafeTix barcodes if you give it a token. I look forward to testing it out when my concert comes around. Conclusion I think we can all agree: Fuck TicketMaster. I hope their sleazy product managers and business majors read this and throw a tantrum. I hope their devs read this and feel embarrassed. It’s rare that I feel genuine malice towards other developers, but to those who designed this system, I say: Shame. Shame on you for abusing your talent to exclude the technologically-disadvantaged. Shame on you for letting the marketing team dress this dark-pattern as a safety measure. Shame on you for supporting a company with such cruel business practices. Software developers are the wizards and shamans of the modern age. We ought to use our powers with the austerity and integrity such power implies. You’re using them to exclude people from entertainment events. Have fun refactoring your ticket verification system. Break up TicketMaster.",

(I realize there's a line somewhere, you wouldn't excuse a prison guard at Auschwitz the same way, but I can't get too worked up about a developer making a ticketing app even if I hate the ticketing company.) Developed countries long ago came to the conclusion that companies should not be allowed to have monopolies because it is bad for society as a whole, and it's hard to think of a current monopoly as egregious as this one. There is absolutely no reason one company should have exclusive rights to 85% of large venues, also be an evebt promoter, and also be the ticket seller.

That doesn't sound very societal top-tier to me. We're definitely not witches or wizards, at most we are scholars or [specialized] craftsmen. \"Knowledge workers\" if you will.

Removing the self delusion is maybe tricky for the individual, but it's easy for people around the individual to see. Societal tools like shame are generally used to encourage people in the right direction, but we don't do a great job of this in America, because money tends to override everything else and I don't think we have good structures around expressing non-monetary values like honor. Especially on the west coast, we're so passive in our shaming of people that it probably doesn't translate to action. There are people who work at Evil companies like Facebook, etc, who are otherwise nice, but I find myself not including them or turned off to them as friends because this sort of contradiction is hard to square in my brain. Of course I wouldn't communicate to this, being a passive PNW raised wimp, and it's not even super explicit in my mind, it's really more of a bad vibe than anything else.

Sorry, what? Surely business travelers pay more just by virtue of traveling by business class?

They don't check your ID at the gate, it's just TSA that checks your id (if you have one). drewg123 23 minutes agorootparentprevLast minute / next day fares have traditionally been far more expensive than 3 week advance, and that was intended to impact business travel more than leisure. If there was a 3rd party marketplace for airline tickets, last minute tickets would not be nearly as expensive and the airlines would make far less money. Consider an example where we have a business traveler \"Bob\" and a leisure traveler \"Larry\". Bob needs to get to LAX tomorrow to put out a fire at a client site. Larry has a trip booked to LAX tomorrow, but can't go because he's sick. Larry has paid $500 for the trip 3 weeks ago. Today: Larry cancels his trip, and maybe, if he's lucky, gets an airline credit for the original price of the trip that expires in a year and which may be hard to use for his next trip. When he cancels, a seat opens up on the plane, and the airline sells it to Bob for $1200. If resale was permitted: Larry auctions off his ticket at an airline ticket reseller. He gets $700 from Bob. So if resale was permitted, Bob's business saves $500, and Larry makes $200, and the airline looses $1200-$1700. You can see why they hate resale. reply qazxcvbnmlp 29 minutes agorootparentprevBusiness travelers != travelers in business class.

Then with ticket master, require a login to buy tickets. Register the tickets to the ID and then do the lookup with a combination of the ticket id, rotating qr code, and the user id. That requires the admitter device to send the challenge back to HQ, but that shouldn't really be much of a challenge. Tickets then become linked to the user's account (perhaps you allow transfer). This is effectively what Disney does with their ticketing system, along with at the gate them taking a picture of you so they can confirm \"Yes, so and so looks like the photo\". But yeah, all of this is ridiculous on its face as the cheaper and easier solution is ticket plus ID. If you are worried about flow have signs up before check in that say \"be sure to have your ID ready before you get to the counter\". The ticketmaster solutions are just bad/half assed.

Which is going to be a problem if tickets need to be transferred in contexts where users don't have internet access (but they do have local connectivity between devices) or in contexts where the venue doesn't have internet access. Or in cases where the single source of truth might be vulnerable to attack or doesn't have the resources to handle the load at certain times. I don't have the solution explicitly, but it seems like it ought to be possible to do this such that PII need not be collected. Tickets could be cryptographic proofs that a chain of custody exists and meets certain criteria. The proofs could be constructed at transfer time and verified at admission, no servers in the loop anywhere.

Only the vendors on T-Mobile are able to take purchases for a big part of the day, and a few other people who use the rare billing system that is fine queuing up Visa transactions until after the bulk of people leave. The line for the cash machine sucks up a substantial part of your time budget for the faire, meaning you probably miss out on some things altogether. reply PaulHoule 29 minutes agoprevA system like that could work in an entirely disconnected mode where the \"ticket\" device has a cryptographic token whose signature can be checked at the door without either side having internet access. The weakness of that system is that you can't \"revoke\" or sell tickets. Such revocation would be possible though if either the ticket or the validator device is internet connected. I saw the New York Red Bulls play not long ago and had to use Ticketmaster's system for the first time. I travel with a tablet, not a smartphone, and I was expecting trouble. Turns out the only trouble I had was that they didn't want to let me in with a tablet but they did when I explained my ticket was on my tablet. It did require an internet connection but Red Bull Arena has great WiFi so that was no problem. reply mattmaroon 1 hour agoprevOff topic (though the post does go into it a bit): Ticketmaster's current form is entirely due to a failure of government. Decades from now, case studies will be written on how one company managed to have a monopoly on an industry that is so not a natural monopoly. reply irjustin 2 hours agoprevI agree with the bad implement but the opening complaining that \"old way of printable tickets was great why change it\" have so many problems. Scalpers are the problem that you have to accept. At the time of purchase, there's no way to tell the difference between a legit purchaser and a scalper or even someone who bought it and simply can't go and needs to resell. IDs, ticket limiters, CCs, etc, etc. All methods can be circumvented by someone dedicated enough. You can only make it \"not scalable\" but the tickets still need to be transferable, securely. Unless we're willing to go ID checking at the gate, there's not going to be a true solution. reply jjmarr 2 hours agoparentBuying something at a low price and selling it at a high price is arbitrage 101 and is free money. The \"true solution\" is to sell tickets at their actual market price instead of pretending that the face value of concert tickets isn't increasing due to a larger population and greater demand. reply compiler-guy 4 minutes agorootparentBuying a single-use item at any price and then selling it on at any price to multiple people is fraud. Fiddling with the prices does absolutely nothing to fix that problem, because it isn’t a problem with price, but a problem with developing an unduplicatable token. Ticketmaster is evil, and most resellers are fine, but some are evil and that’s a problem this at least attempts to solve. reply coldpie 2 hours agorootparentprev> The \"true solution\" is to sell tickets at their actual market price That is *a* solution but it isn't *the* solution. The fact that many smart people are not choosing that solution is an indicator that there are some factors to the problem that you aren't considering. reply xp84 1 hour agorootparentprevPeople will scream (including in this thread) that it’s “unfair” that ‘only the wealthy can afford them then’ but their beef is with scarcity and thus with reality. It’s always “unfair” to the 10,001st person who wants to attend the concert with 10,000 capacity. Today it’s a weird lottery with 6 different fan and credit-cardmember presales, which each sell out immediately, and the “backstop” at the end which is the ability to buy expensive scalped tickets. There are finite tickets but unbounded demand. A lottery means you can slightly adjust the distribution of poor vs rich, but in practice today it still advantages those comfortable enough to sit around refreshing their computers at the right moment, instead of working. And lots of opportunists will snap up those tickets you are hoping poor people will get, to sell them to the wealthy. In my opinion for in-demand shows it should just be a Dutch auction (all of the highest 10,000 bids win, awarded at some fixed cutoff date before the event). If not enough bids are received, the concert isn’t sold out, so then the rest go on sale for the lowest bid. reply its_ethan 1 hour agorootparentprev> Buying something at a low price and selling it at a high price is arbitrage 101 and is free money. A bit of a nit pick, but this isn't \"free money\" unless you have a guarantee that someone will actually buy at the higher price. You could buy low, be unable to sell, and end up eating the \"buy low\" cost. > sell tickets at their actual market price How do you know what their actual market price is? You have to open it up to a market, where supply/demand get to play out. IIRC some ticketing company tried doing something to this effect by scaling prices in realtime based on how many people were also trying to buy. I believe it was widely criticized as unfair/exploitive. So you're back to square one then, where you have to set some price. reply fluoridation 1 hour agorootparentI mean, it may very well have been criticized, but how is it any less fair than the alternative? As for being exploitative, that's kind of the point. The company figures for most shows it's leaving money on the table for scalpers to take. The other side of it is that if a show bombs the ticket prices can be reduced to encourage people to come. To be honest, it seems overall a better solution. reply bubblethink 45 minutes agorootparentprevThe reason they don't do that is to have an organic fan base of poor people who drive up the prices for the rich people. If you eliminate the poor people, the rich people aren't going to take the band forward. They'll move on to whatever the next shiny thing is. You need a hardcore fan base of poor people to support and grow your valuation. reply danudey 1 hour agorootparentprevIOW the true solution to scamming is to raise prices so high that only the extremely wealthy can afford them, regardless of how accessible the actual concert/act/group/promoter wants the show to be. The \"real\" solution here would be for Ticketmaster (or whoever) to actually make a ticket non-transferrable somehow, and then allow for tickets to be transferred directly through the original website for at most the original ticket price, and refund me the money. For example, if I have a $200 ticket and I can't make it and want to sell it, I can post up a link to the original ticket seller's website (in this case Ticketmaster) where someone else can go buy it, and, if they do, I get a refund of the amount they paid. I can say how much I'm willing to accept (full price, $150, whatever) and someone can go buy \"my\" ticket, potentially at a loss if I'm willing to accept it. Ticketmaster can make money on these tickets by charging a non-refundable processing fee or whatever to everyone (the original buyer and any subsequent re-buyers). They make a tidy profit, everyone gets what they want. The only complications are 1. making the tickets non-transferrable but also work offline is a difficult technology problem 2. Ticketmaster is an unregulated monopoly and thus has no incentive to behave in the best interests of the market or its customers when they could rake in millions more by screwing everyone except the scalpers reply xp84 1 hour agorootparentCan’t someone hack your system by selling access to the link you mentioned for $500? Thus getting you the refund Ticketmaster knows about, and the private payment from the desperate buyer. Also, credit card processing fees used to be refunded when you refunded a transaction, but now I think some processors have now decided to start keeping the fees, because why not. Another 3% margin to apply at each sale (though that can be included in the transfer fee you suggest) reply BobaFloutist 49 minutes agorootparent>Can’t someone hack your system by selling access to the link you mentioned for $500? Not if they index the resales on their website and make them searchable. People could still perform arbitrage by snapping up any resales significantly under the original price and reselling them at the original price, but at that point they're not making that much money and people are paying less than the original price, so the impact is just that you can't get a discounted resale. Which still sucks, but it sucks a lot less. reply tptacek 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's only free money if there's no risk, and if there's no transaction cost to acquiring at the lower price.

Personally, any time I have to buy or sell through a reseller, I use StubHub, but I know plenty of people who don't want to use them as they charge high fees and they aren't much better than TM from a moral stand point.

And learning to download the digital tickets in advance -- either to the app or your Apple wallet -- is just a thing you learn to do, the same way you learn to download a bunch of podcasts before your airline flight that charges for (or doesn't have) WiFi.

If it doesn't work they will simply be turned away the door like so many others who have been scammed. Nobody would notice the test. But if each ticket is for a particular seat, would ticketmaster notice if too people came with tickets for the same seat? I bet not. I bet they just trust their ticketing system to be foolproof.

For example, I understand for the screen position you might have a 1000x1000 canvas, which can be represented with 0-1,000,000 numbers. Even if we add 10 sub-pixel divisions, that's still 100,000,000, which still fits very comfortably within JS. Similar for speed (dx, dy), I see you are doing \"(Math.random()*2-1)*10\" for calculating the speed, which should go from -10,+10 with arbitrary decimal accuracy, but I wonder if limiting it to 1 decimal would be enough for the simulation, which would be [-10.0, +10.0] and can also be converted to the -100,+100 range in integers. Which needs 10,000 numbers to represent all of the possible values. If you put both of those together, that gives 10,000 * 100,000,000 = 1,000,000,000,000 (1T) numbers needed to represent the particles, which still fits within JS' MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. So it seems you might be able to fit all of the data for a single particle within a single MAX_SAFE_INTEGER or a single Float32Array element? Then you don't need the stride and can be a lot more sure about data consistency. It might be that the encoding/decoding of the data into a single number is slower than the savings in memory and so it's totally not worth it though, which I don't know. reply dleeftink 8 hours agoparentYou may be interested in bitfields and JS optimised vector operations, the @thi.ng universe has some useful implementations (also a WASM simd one): [0]: https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/vec...

Float16Array would immediately halve your memory requirements Another possibility would be to have separate precision arrays. eg. Float16Array for x,y and even Int8Array for dx/dy, but, in both cases you will would get some motion artifacts, especially for Int8 from the clamping and aliasing of dx/dy. reply codelikeawolf 5 hours agoprevThis is really awesome!

JS is blazing fast. Especially if written well. reply jsheard 7 hours agoparentThe problem is that idiomatic JS and blazing fast JS are diametrically opposed to each other, in practice the latter is more like a bad C dialect. You're not allowed to allocate GC objects in fast JS but the language doesn't have good non-allocating alternatives. Nobody is actually going to make a complex JS app where all memory allocations are pointers into a giant ArrayBuffer, it's easier to just switch to WebAssembly at that point. reply dgb23 6 hours agorootparentIf JS had typed structs (like they have type arrays) it would definitely be more convenient. However, that's not where the problem starts. A lot of web sites are slow because they simply run too much code that doesn't need running in the first place and allocates objects that don't need to be allocated. We don't need lower level constructs if we can simply start by removing cruft and be more wary of adding it.

The company also agreed to pay a $243.6 million fine and for a third-party monitor to be installed to keep track of Boeing's compliance. The deal spares Boeing from a trial just as the plane maker is trying to turn a corner in its safety and manufacturing crises. In this article BA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Rescuers work at the scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash near Bishoftu, or Debre Zeit, south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Monday, March 11, 2019. Mulugeta AyeneReuters Boeing has agreed to plead guilty to criminal fraud tied to the fatal 737 Max crashes, a decision that brands the U.S. aerospace giant a felon but allows it to avoid trial while it tries to turn the page from safety and manufacturing crises. Under the deal, Boeing would face a fine of up to $487.2 million, though the Justice Department recommended that the court credit Boeing with half that amount it paid under a previous agreement, resulting in a fine of $243.6 million. The plea deal requires the approval of a federal judge to take effect. If the deal is accepted, it could complicate Boeing's ability to sell products to the U.S. government as a felon, though the company could seek waivers. About 32% of Boeing's nearly $78 billion in revenue last year came from its defense, space and security unit. An independent compliance monitor would also be installed to oversee compliance at Boeing for three years during a probationary period. Boeing would also have to invest at least $455 million in compliance and safety programs, according to a court filing. Boeing also agreed for its board of directors to meet with crash victims' family members. The Justice Department unveiled the deal late Sunday, months after U.S. prosecutors said the aerospace giant violated a 2021 settlement that shielded it from prosecution for three years. The plea deal offer forced Boeing to decide between a guilty plea and the attached terms, or going to trial, just as the company was seeking to turn a corner in its manufacturing and safety crises, pick a new CEO and acquire its fuselage maker, Spirit AeroSystems . \"We can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle on terms of a resolution with the Justice Department, subject to the memorialization and approval of specific terms,\" Boeing said in a statement after the court filing. In May, the Justice Department said Boeing had violated the 2021 settlement. Under that deferred prosecution agreement, Boeing agreed to pay $2.5 billion, including a $243.6 million criminal fine, compensation to airlines and a $500 million fund for victims' family members. That 2021 settlement was set to expire two days after a door panel blew out of a nearly new 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Airlines on Jan. 5. While there were no serious injuries, the accident created a fresh safety crisis for Boeing. A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board found that key bolts that hold the door panel in place were not attached to the aircraft. The U.S. accused Boeing of conspiracy to defraud the government by misleading regulators about its inclusion of a flight-control system on the Max that was later implicated in the two crashes — a Lion Air flight in October 2018 and an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019. All 346 people on board the flights were killed. U.S. prosecutors told family members of the crash victims on June 30 that they planned to seek a guilty plea from Boeing, a plan family attorneys called \"a sweetheart deal.\" Paul Cassell, a lawyer for victims' family members, said he plans to ask the federal judge on the case to reject the deal and \"simply set the matter for a public trial, so that all the facts surrounding the case will be aired in a fair and open forum before a jury.\" Don’t miss these insights from CNBC PRO An AI data center boom is coming, Jefferies says, naming top stocks to buy right now Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway raked in billions from BYD, the China EV maker Munger called a ‘damn miracle’ These Nasdaq stocks are expected to fall as the latter half of the year begins S&P 500 to tumble 30% as recession hits later this year, says BCA Research WATCH NOW VIDEO15:04 Why the Boeing 737 Max has been such a mess Subscribe to CNBC PRO Subscribe to Investing Club Licensing & Reprints CNBC Councils Select Personal Finance CNBC on Peacock Join the CNBC Panel Supply Chain Values Select Shopping Closed Captioning Digital Products News Releases Internships Corrections About CNBC Ad Choices Site Map Podcasts Careers Help Contact News Tips Got a confidential news tip?

Particularly if you're talking about federal inmates, state, or both. 2) It's disingenuous (re: primacy bias) to lead off with murder and rape, which account for a far smaller portion of \"violent\" crime than robbery (which I assume includes burglary, in which the victim and perpetrator don't make contact) and assault (which, again, does not require the victim and perpetrator to physically make contact (that's battery)). All of this is aside fact that an individual who allegedly commits a heinous act against another person or small group of people is in a completely different class from a large corporation whose products put millions at risk (and the executives and managers who sign off on those company's decisions). There is quite the destructive myopia behind the increasingly punitive (rather than rehabilitative) nature of incarceration for the former, when the latter get off so easy. reply sitkack 1 hour agorootparentThank you for the call out.

To summarize, 44% of current federal inmates are there for drug-charges. The second most category is weapons charges at 22%. So a good 2/3 of current federal inmates are there for non-violent crimes. Sex offense is third most common at 13% I’m sure many are there for illegal sex work or consumption rather than for sexual violence. A whopping 4.6% is in federal prison for immigrating (which isn’t even a crime; unless this category includes human trafficking, which I would call a violent crime). reply spacecadet 4 hours agorootparentprev1000% reply tsunamifury 3 hours agorootparentprevYou really want the engineer who was last on the line of decisions to go to jail?

When I need to convince other engineers I want to be able to point to such consequences as to why we shouldn't be dangerously cutting corners. And even if you only punish engineers it will decrease the pool of talent / cost effectiveness of workers available to the unscrupulous managers such that cutting corners could very well not be worth the cost. Money saved on cutting corners would be lost in trying to find competent engineers that were willing to cut those corners. Of course I want the entire chain of those involved criminally punished but punishing people anywhere on that chain, even those at the bottom is a start. reply WalterBright 59 minutes agorootparentWhen you start criminally charging people for mistakes in critical systems, what you're going to get is coverups. With a no-fault system, mistakes are not covered up, but fixed. With a fault system: 1. if a mistake is discovered, it will not be fixed because that would be an admission of criminal liability. 2. Quality will not be improved, because that is (again) an implicit admission that the previous design was faulty. 3. You won't get new airplane designs, because (again) any new design is an inherent risk. I understand the desire for revenge, but there are heavy negative consequences for a revenge/punishment/fear based system. P.S. I worked at Boeing on the 757 stabilizer trim system. At one point, I knew everything there was to know about it. It was a safety critical system. I did a lot of the double checking of other peoples' work on it. I did not work in an atmosphere of fear. The 757 in service proved an extremely reliable airplane. I've flown commercial on many 757s, and often would chat a bit with the flight crew. They were unanimous in their admiration for the airplane. Made me feel pretty good. reply cjbgkagh 41 minutes agorootparentYou're not the first person I've head of this idea from; it's from the NTSB charter The NTSB does not assign fault or blame for an accident or incident; rather, as specified by NTSB regulation, “accident/incident investigations are fact-finding proceedings with no formal issues and no adverse parties … and are not conducted for the purpose of determining the rights or liabilities of any person” But there was plenty of blaming / faulting going around outside of the NTSB. Hence the fraud we're currently talking about where Boeing tried to blame the pilots who rather conveniently for Boeing died and are no longer around to defend themselves. I'm glad you feel personally assured though your enthusiastic personal connections but that does not work for me. That it works for you actually makes me feel less safe flying. reply WalterBright 15 minutes agorootparent> That it works for you actually makes me feel less safe flying. Feel free to ask the flight crew next time you're on a 757. The service record of the 757 speaks for itself. I fly Iceland Air because their fleet consists of 757s. I literally bet my life on my work. > Boeing tried to blame the pilots The pilots were partially responsible. 1. First incident - the LA crew followed emergency procedures and continued the flight safely. 2. Second incident - the LA crew restored normal trim 25 times, but never turned off the stab trim system, which is supposed to be a memory item. 3. Third incident - Boeing sent an Emergency Airworthiness Directive to all MAX pilots. The EA crew did not follow the simple 2 step procedure. A contributing factor is the crew was flying at full throttle, and ignored the overspeed warning horn you could hear on the cockpit voice recorder. > who rather conveniently for Boeing died and are no longer around to defend themselves. The flight voice and data recorders spoke for them. We know what they did. If you want to know the truth, read the official government reports on the crashes. Ignore what the mass media says. reply cjbgkagh 0 minutes agorootparentWeird to see such a strongly held belief of not blaming people abandoned so quickly. It's pretty standard to blame the pilots, as we know there is a Swiss cheese model for statistical analysis of risk and from my vantage point opening such large holes in the MCAS layer with the expectation that events are caught at the pilot layer is inadequate. That not all events are caught at the pilot layer is to be expected. WalterBright 51 minutes agorootparentprevP.P.S. My work was checked by others, like the stress group, my lead engineer, and the test group. reply swozey 1 hour agorootparentprevYou had the privilege of being able to quit the job over ethics / concerns. I'm assuming you didn't wind up homeless with starving children. I have definitely not always had that in my career and many people don't. reply cjbgkagh 49 minutes agorootparentI have ME/CFS which means for most of my life I've barely been able to make enough in the good times to cover the extended bad times. Running out of money for me is basically a death sentence as it would become increasingly impossible to dig my way out of such a hole. Normal people at their worst could probably stack shelves or wash dishes for a living but that option is not available to me. I'm better at managing my condition now but at the time I quit jobs for ethical reasons I did so knowing that if I didn't find something else quickly then I would eh. end up taking a long walk on a short pier. To make matters worse I'm highly noise intolerant and have to spend more money to live in quieter places otherwise my already precarious health would rapidly deteriorate. As engineers we are often responsible for the creation of assets more valuable than ourselves and I think it's an essential part of the job to put our lives on the line in much the same way an airplane passenger does. And as engineers we are often also airplane passengers ourselves and must trust that other engineers that they too have put our safety ahead of their personal wellbeing. As the middle class is crushed then sure, such ethical boundaries will fade out of necessity, and I see this as part of a descent into a low trust society and why I expect more planes to fall out of the sky, both metaphorically and literally. Once a culture tolerates such flexible ethics the boundaries will continue being pushed - there isn't a lower bound. This corruption inhibits the creation of valuable assets and will result in a massive erosion of our standard of living. An often touted solution is Universal basic income (UBI) that would create a safety-net for engineers and those with my type of disability - but having experienced constant gaslighting on ME/CFS from doctors informed by state funded research and given the expansion of Canadian MAID style solutions to people like myself I'm very fortunate that the capitalists opportunities existed such that I did not have to rely on state 'care'. reply swozey 35 minutes agorootparentI was homeless at 17 in high school before going into the Marines in 2002. I know what having negative money is like, health problems or not. That doesn't change the fact that it comes from absolute privilege to tell someone that they should just quit their job because you don't agree with the ethics or morality of work they're doing. If you HAVE the privilege, the savings, the good health not needing COBRA, etc, then by all means walk away. You also don't mention having children, I know a LOT of parents and they absolutely don't have the money to be able to just walk away and keep their kids lifestyles, healthcare, etc until finding something new. But judging someone potentially desperate and on already on the edge for where they work in most cases is pretty off. You have your own story someone wouldn't be aware of without telling them that as you say may make it impossible to dig yourself out of a hole. Who knows what situation someones in? reply cjbgkagh 29 minutes agorootparentI disagree again, and I would much rather be homeless than have ME/CFS, I'd still make that trade today.

Absolutely weird thought process, especially from someone who has never been homeless but would prefer to be homeless than xyz. Very im14andedgy vibe. quasse 2 hours agorootparentprevYes. This might be unfamiliar to software engineers, but there's a reason mechanical engineering and architecture (there might be more, but these are the ones I'm familiar with) schools put students through at least a semester of ethics classes. We are literally the last line of defense in a lot of industries. From the first line of the ASME code of ethics: > Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public in the performance of their professional duties. If you can't do that, you should be in another field. Maybe software engineering at Meta would be a better fit. reply balls187 1 hour agorootparentI went to a Science and Engineering school, and everyone had to take ethics: ME's, ChemE's, CompEng, Civs, etc. This is such an important part of engineering as a profession. reply tsunamifury 2 hours agorootparentprevThis is a noble goal but unrealistic and unfair at scale. Also it belays just a wildly unrealistic understanding of how risk distribution works in corporations. It’s as if in your mind one engineer makes the singular call and sees the entire picture of the project and its risks. Where as more likely a downstream worker who very likely had an incomplete picture will be blamed. Also the personal insult is not needed. It just makes you out to be an ass rather than someone making a point. Consider your romantic notions might not be realistic. reply sho_hn 2 hours agorootparentI didn't read it as a \"personal insult\". It's true that most software engineers never work on safety-critical systems. The nature of the products they work on, or the nature of their contributions to those products, limits the possible impact of flaws and mistakes. Once you work on a product with safety-critical features and/or become responsible for one, there really is a marked psychological change that takes place. I've lived through that change in my own career, and many comments (including some I've written, I'm sure) now strike me as callous and trivializing important matters to an extent that grates. It's important to hold engineers accountable for their work in proportion to their impact, which is typically very significant. If you build machines that can kill, stakes should exist for you as well. reply bumby 2 hours agorootparentprev>It’s as if in your mind one engineer makes the singular call and sees the entire picture of the project and its risks. To a certain extent this is true. To extend the OP's example, a mechanical or civil engineer who stamps a building design takes responsibility for that design being safe enough for public use. The same could apply to the MCAS design, or the quality engineer who signs off on how the plane was put together. These are not \"romatic notions\"; the latter is already common practice in aerospace. Do you think if a QE stamped that the door bolts were installed should not bear responsibility for the bolts being missing? In those cases where the engineer is supposed to be aware of the risks, there should be processes in place to account for, and mitigate, those risks. For the example of MCAS, the software was categorized as hazardous in the hazard analysis document. As such, Boeing processes required it to have redundant inputs as a default. It did not (the redundant sensor was sold an optional equipment); as such, I think the engineer who signed off on the hazard analysis may bear some responsibility. If, on the other hand, there were no business processes in place to require redundancy, that seems like a CEO responsibility. reply FrojoS 2 hours agorootparentprevTo the contrary, there is usually _several_ engineers who see the ethical/safety problems and talk about them with colleagues. They just don't report it to the right authorities. reply underlipton 1 hour agorootparentprevI don't see a personal insult, but maybe SWEs should take the ethics of their work more personally. Maybe the shape of our epidemic of social and psychological dysfunction would be different (if not smaller). When I worked at a retailer, we were told to push buy-now-pay-later schemes on our customers (on top of the corporate credit card, and insurance plans, and service plans). Most of my coworkers simply decided that they weren't going to - in part, because such schemes are nakedly predatory, but also because it was yet another dumb metric we knew we'd be held to if it were successful. I don't know of anyone who was fired or docked pay or denied a promotion because of it, and it's not worth luring someone into financial ruin over a TV and an entry-level sales position. Which leads me to another thought: if you're so low in the chain that you have no say in how and what you work on, is it a job that's worth sacrificing your morals for? Maybe take advantage of that increased earnings potential from job-hopping and get out of dodge. reply bumby 2 hours agorootparentprevProfessionally licensed engineers are required to take an oath to protect the public. What many don't realize is that manufacturers like Boeing operate under a licensing exemption, on the assumption that business and manufacturing processes are sufficient to protect the public. In cases like this, there is a case that is insufficient. There has been a movement in some states to remove the manufacturing exemption, in which case the cognizant engineer would bear the responsibility. The optimistic view is that this will help balance the power between the engineer and the C-suite. The cynical view is that this will allow the C-suite to push responsibility down to the engineer. reply vlan0 3 hours agorootparentprevI'm sure they can try. But put yourself in the shoes of that engineer. Imagine what would go through your head. My entire MO would be CYA.

For just this reason. reply harikb 2 hours agorootparentI don't get what you are trying to say though. If companies can use 'a mile long paper trail', why can't the engineer do the same?.

This is the basic structure of many aerospace designs. If you ever watch a rocket launch, they are literally checking in with every system owner for that decision. Prior to even getting to the launch date, there are meetings where they are checking with the designers for similar decisions. There are good documentaries/movies that show this dramatized in examples like the shuttle Challenger. reply tsunamifury 1 hour agorootparentYea and with challenger only one engineer raised the alarm while a large group of well meaning engineers overrode him. This is reality. Decisions aren’t kill/not kill. reply bumby 57 minutes agorootparentYeah we both agree that the decision isn’t “kill/not kill”. It’s much more ambiguous and murky, especially when dealing with low probability events. That’s why it takes expertise, but it doesn’t mean there shouldn’t be accountability for those “expert” decisions.

But I'm curious, where do you think that stops being relevant? Do you not hold medical doctors liable for decisions because a patient will just find another \"incompetent patsy\" to prescribe them whatever they want? Do you not expect civil engineers to be responsible for a structural design of a bridge because a company will find an \"incompetent patsy\" to sign off on a sub-standard design that is better for profit margins?

The victims don't play a prosecutorial role here and are not actually parties to this case. The appropriate venue for the victims is a civil jury trial (lawsuit), where recovery of losses is possible because the victims then become party to the case (plaintiff). The reason this lawyer is requesting this is so that the government will be forced to lay its cards on the table during trial, which provide much stronger proof/evidence of Boeing's wrongdoing (which otherwise would likely be much harder to discover), and make it far more likely for a jury to award a huge award to the plaintiffs.

At which point the defendant can either withdraw their guilty plea and try their luck with a jury - or maintain it and accept whatever sentence the judge wants to impose-which could potentially be a lot harsher than what was agreed in the plea deal. Unlikely relevant to this case, but judges are legally required to reject guilty pleas if they conclude that the defendant is being coerced, doesn’t understand what they are pleading to and the likely consequences of their plea, lacks competence to plea (due to severe mental illness/etc), or that the plea lacks a “factual basis” (e.g. if the conduct alleged by the prosecution and admitted by the defendant fails to legally constitute the elements of the crime; or if the judge has good reason to believe that the conduct in question never actually happened despite both prosecution and defence agreeing that it did) On the last point-the prosecution is allowed to offer the defendant a plea deal for a lesser included offense, but not an unrelated crime that doesn’t correspond with what they are accused of doing-e.g. you can plead drug charges down to lesser drug charges, but you can’t plead drug charges down to possession of stolen goods if there is no evidence anything was actually stolen-in such a scenario the judge is supposed to reject the guilty plea reply alistairSH 2 hours agorootparentprevYou don’t. But the judge can reject the plea deal that’s leading to the guilty plea. Boeing isn’t pleading guilty in a vacuum - there’s a deal in place.

Practically, their career would be affected by it too. reply sandworm101 4 hours agorootparentThere are nuances between jurisdictions, but while a US judge can reject a plea deal they generally cannot reject a guilty plea. A judge cannot force a trial between parties that don't want one. And a trial isn't really possible where the parties agree the facts. The judge can certainly impose a sentence different than that which was agreed between the parties, but any such punishment would have to be based on the agreed facts/charges/pleadings. If the prosecution decides to only charge a lesser offense, the judge's power would be limited to the maximum penalty associated with those reduced charges. reply qingcharles 3 hours agorootparentRight. And prosecutions aren't between the victim and the offender. Prosecutions are between The People and the offender.

Plea deals are \"I'll plead guilty and save you the trial in exchange for this sentence.\" Depending on the court, plea deals can be a horrible gamble by a defendant. Generally you have to enter your guilty plea first, and then the judge decides if they want to let you have that sweet, sweet sentence the prosecution offered. I know someone who went to court having been offered a plea deal for probation and got 80 years instead when the judge rejected it and sentenced them. reply thetedhogan 43 minutes agorootparentYeah, this shocked me when I learned it. The actual \"deal\" is the defendant agrees to plea guilty in exchange for the prosecution giving a specific recommendation of sentence. (In most cases, there are some exceptions of course) reply alistairSH 3 hours agorootparentprevWhat's the difference (in practice)? Boeing isn't pleading guilty on its own - it's also agreed to damages. I agree that a defendant pleading guilty on their own (and throwing themselves on the mercy of the court) would be hard to reject. That isn't what's happened here - the prosecution has, presumably, agreed to the damages, so this is a plea deal, right? reply sandworm101 3 hours agorootparentWithout turning this into a criminal procedures lecture, the practical difference surrounds who decides the punishment. When a judge rejects a deal they are asserting control over punishment. But a prosecutor can fight back by dropping charges, or reducing to lesser-but-included charges [insert lecture re elements] which would place a cap on the max punishment the judge could adopt. It is a back-and-forth fight between the prosecutor and the judge about who decides punishment, who represents the wishes of the people. reply abeppu 2 hours agoprev> If the deal is accepted, it could complicate Boeing’s ability to sell products to the U.S. government as a felon, though the company could seek waivers. About 32% of Boeing’s nearly $78 billion in revenue last year came from its defense, space and security unit. My understanding is that getting security clearance involves a bunch of checks and statements about your character, and having a federal felony conviction on one's record would be a hard blocker. Absolutely, I think that the real punishment, beyond the $245M fine, ought to be losing its many many billions of DoD contracts. After all, once a firm has demonstrated this kind of behavior, how on earth should we trust it with not only taxpayer dollars but the lives of servicemen/women and critical military resources? reply abeppu 2 hours agoparentAlso in the \"corporations as people\" x \"criminal justice system\" vein, I would be in favor of moving towards a standard where, if a person convicted of the same crime would receive a prison sentence, a company should be forced to cease operations for an equivalent period, and put all its assets into frozen fund which can only be used to pay out debts/obligations, and which earns no interest. reply maeil 19 minutes agorootparentGarnish valuation increase and dividends for X years, just like wage garnishing. At the end of every quarter, if the market cap of the company has increased by $X b/million, $X b/million has to be paid as a fine to the government. This means that effectively the share price cannot increase during the period, only go down. Of course, this needs to be done retroactively, starting from the time the illegal act is believed to have been committed. Now it wouldn't be sensible to just \"destroy\" market cap, but there's an obvious solution here. Looks like the 737 MAX was announced in Aug 2011, when Boeing's market cap was around $50B. Currently it's $114B. You issue new shares, roughly 1.28x as many as the current number of outstanding shares. The government gets all of them and by law is made to sell 20% of them per year. It's only after 5 years, when all of the shares have been sold, that the X years of market cap garnishing starts. I'm sure there's a loophole or two that I missed, but this can all be accounted for. A simple, DMA-like \"spirit of the law\"-clause works well enough, as we're seeing with Apple suddenly being very quick to accept the Epic store in Europe. Suddenly a whole lot of people will start caring. Sure, it would be great to jail those responsible too, but with that alone you will eventually end up with boards full of fall guys.

Boeing, if it had no prospects of continued DoD contracts, would naturally want to offload teams and facilities dedicated to that work. If this situation was handled right, it could spark the creation of multiple new American firms with the means and know-how to deliver the various products and services that Boeing formerly provided, while simultaneously delivering a very clear message to shareholders and C-suite officers that this sort of conduct will not make them rich. reply t_mann 50 minutes agorootparent> the funds previously marked for Boeing would be open for new firms even if staffed by former Boeing employees > delivering a very clear message to shareholders and C-suite officers that this sort of conduct will not make them rich And the best way to make that point is to create new investment opportunities that will make some former employees of the same company and many of the same investors rich? reply abeppu 16 minutes agorootparent1. Boeing investors should take a substantial haircut. If those investors subsequently in on new firms, good for them (though initially these new firms may be private). I see no reason they should expect to \"get rich\" from the investment. The top institutional shareholder is Vanguard whose involvement will have been minimal and whose future behavior is unlikely to change. But Boeing execs whose compensation is largely in stock packages should take a really large hit, and any shareholders who are more apt to be more activist will be more likely to express concern about this kind of conduct sooner. 2.

While a C firm does _often_ protect board member personal assets from civil cases, it also does not guarantee protection. Also, international investors do not usually create a US LLC given it usually trips 2 tax codes. Talking with awesome AMCHAM reps about this area is probably in your best interest, but most international firms create a Type C corporation on US soil. Ask your local corporate tax lawyer about liabilities to confirm whether your jurisdiction has harmonized corporate laws.

This seems similar to Wells Fargo, where ok, the company was fined, sued, made to pay restitution (somewhat) to victims. But underlying it all, the culture and incentives at the company that produced the situation didn't get fundamentally changed. Which often perpetuates across specific leaders, boards, and is a part of what a company is -- and doesn't just get replaced by removing one or two people. What does it take? You have to dismantle a company before it changes these kinds of deep-rooted issues? Or can a government penalty call for that? That is hard to achieve. Who's going to change the evaluation procedures that HR has in place to measure what rating or bonus you get this year? That seems to me as important as who is CEO. None of the penalties courts mete out (short of dissolution/fined into bankruptcy) seem to be able to achieve this level of change needed. reply constantcrying 11 hours agoparentThe problem is that finding the people responsible can be extremely hard, so you have to go against the corporation itself. Punishing a corporation is easy, but the government hates doing it for obvious reasons. It means ruining something which is useful to you and punishing tens of thousands of completely innocent people, with inevitable layoffs. What Boeing really needs is a complete change in management culture, as that was the real root cause for the MAX disasters, but that is impossible to enforce, you can't even really verify that it has happened. I also think people don't understand how extremely lucky Boeing is. If all of this had happened during a time of low demand the company would be facing a far more dire situation, likely with many major airlines canceling orders.

Until it is legally the case that corporate leadership must prioritize the benefits to labor above investors, nothing functionally is going to change. reply sitkack 33 minutes agorootparentprevThe board and the c-suite of Boeing should be replaced, and they should personally have to pay life changing fines and serve jail time. reply constantcrying 10 hours agorootparentprevYou can not punish someone for a crime they didn't commit and had no knowledge of.

If they are not aware of the crime but they should have been, it can be seen as gross negligence. As far as I understand, the legal theory is that the CEO and the directors are organs of the company rather than natural persons when acting in their roles. Therefore some of the usual legal protections do not apply. Assigning liability like that is an inherent part of the social trade-off that allows limited liability companies to exist. reply bilbo0s 6 hours agorootparentYou are all arguing irrelevant points. Because the premise is false. You can identify the people responsible. I won't bother to explain it all, but at very step of the manufacturing process different workers signed off on the integrity of their work. All of that paperwork was logged with the US government. If you let me peruse those papers I could tell you who designed each and every component of the landing gear, and which workers assembled that landing gear on each and every MAX out there. I can tell you which executives signed off on it, and if you subpoena the documents I could even tell you what they were all emailing back and forth. More importantly, I can tell you which QA engineers and executives were involved in the QA and testing process for that landing gear and give you the results of the tests they ran. So on and so forth, all the way up to the CEO. We can identify people. We've simply decided that we won't. You guys are arguing an orthogonal point as to whether or not to hold C level executives accountable. I can tell you right now you're going to effect much better change if you target key executives at the director-VP level than if you target C level people. We do need to get rid of the rats.

Again, the buck stops at the top. That person on the floor must be, and usually is, indemnified, because it's more important to get open and honest feedback from them on what happened. That way we know the changes the CEO failed to implement to prevent it from happening, and should now implement to prevent it from happening again.

This is more important in safety critical industries, but less so for something like a luxury goods company, so you wouldn't want to force every company to this structure.

Typically these orders solve only some routine choices that were anticipated, and for anything extraordinary the master should be awoken at once and consulted. The junior watch officer should have summoned the master long before the ship hit an iceberg, if they are inattentive (e.g. they fall asleep in the warm dark of a bridge at night) the BNWAS will alarm to try to wake them, then eventually summon senior officers (typically the master, but maybe also a chief engineer and others) to the bridge. The master is responsible for ensuring the BNWAS is operable. It would be extremely unusual for a commercial vessel (not to mention military vessel) to allow officers to drink booze, especially enough booze to fall \"asleep in a drunken stupor\".

It's not about the result or what the CEO \"believes\", it's about what they reasonably did to avoid bad outcomes. Did the CEO do anything to be certain his people are competent, or that an incompetent person cannot tank the quality of the product? Did they take any reasonable measures, implemented checks, ordered audits, spent more to prioritized safety and quality? The CEO has the highest executive authority and the highest pay. This means the highest level of accountability. Until the shit hits the fan, or the ground, and then the employees were incompetent, the processes were weak, the consultants that weren't picked by the CEO said it's all good.

For the C-suite to take on personal risk is literally a part of the role where I live. the central business registry register those holding these roles for that exact reason. reply actionfromafar 9 hours agorootparentprevWe need them energetic and vigorous! /s reply maxsilver 5 hours agorootparentprev> Who would want to be in charge of an aerospace company if there was a real risk that you'd get charged with murder if you don't have an almost psychic insight into the technical decisions of your company? You say this like it's crazy, but we literally already do this with Doctors and Surgeons, it's not as tricky as you make it sound. There's no valid reason that CEO/C-Suite folks get to forever escape any responsibility and accountability. reply Nuzzerino 5 hours agorootparent> it's not as tricky as you make it sound. Citation needed + dubious analogy reply perilunar 5 hours agorootparentprevSounds good to me. We'd end up with aerospace companies run by engineers who understand the technical decisions in detail, instead of MBAs and accountants. reply soco 8 hours agorootparentprevIf what Boeing management has to offer means \"quality\" then I'll gladly take less of it, thank you. Same with VW and all those managers which went away unscathed enjoying their golden parachutes, for basically leading schemes for killing people. reply sgarland 6 hours agorootparentprevGee, maybe we’d get people who are knowledgeable and care about engineering rigor, instead of MBAs whose sole goal is to make the share price go up. reply TylerE 4 hours agorootparentprevWill that make the best and brightest avoid it, or the worst, cheatingest, and laziest? reply jajko 7 hours agorootparentprevNo its called a healthy society. The reason - There is usually surprisingly little actual skill gap between good seasoned (higher) middle managers and c-suite. What gets you up there is politics, clever sociopathic games, tenacity, connections, and often a bit of luck. If you look for words like additional competence among that list, you wouldn't find it. The only reasons some folks push up there to the top are 2 - power, and money. They receive extra money because they are holding massive responsibility for their part or whole corporation. Lets stop finding reasons why there is actually 0 real responsibility on them. Its literally part of the deal they sign up for, and they know it very well. Yes, it may sometimes mean that they get the heat for something caused by their predecessors, its part of the risk they take on themselves by pushing into such role. Its still firmly their failure, ie to a) identify it; b) act upon it. But as we see this wasn't a priority in Boeing, and I presume it still isn't. reply smackeyacky 5 hours agorootparentprevThe board is responsible for keeping the C suite honest. They need to be removed. reply BSDobelix 9 hours agorootparentprev>The CEO and the other C-level people. Yes the Captain of a Ship is always responsible for everything that happens on his ship 100%. reply doctor_eval 10 hours agorootparentprev> Who is ultimately responsible for management at a company though? Technically the board is ultimately responsible for management. It’s the board’s responsibiity to hire delegates and to monitor their performance. That’s how it’s supposed to work, but it seems to me it’s been a very long time since board have been anything other than rubber stamps for the CEO. reply rob74 9 hours agorootparentprevWell, ultimately responsible are the shareholders who demand ever higher profits, and the top management has to deliver that, even if it hurts the company long term; or, to generalize even more, capitalism. reply adwn 9 hours agorootparent> ultimately responsible are the shareholders who demand ever higher profits, and the top management has to deliver that That's not how this works. The shareholders don't have direct authority over the decisions made by the company's chief officers. They can demand \"higher profits\" all day long, but that doesn't absolve the board of directors or management from their responsibility, and it doesn't give them a blank check to behave unethically or even criminally. > or, to generalize even more, capitalism. Ugh, that is such a knee-jerk, fallacious take. Short-sightedness and misalignment of incentives are traits that are hardly specific to capitalism. reply llamaimperative 6 hours agorootparentA problem doesn’t need to be specific to capitalism in order to be caused by it. Of course this is all a result (a predictable one) of a certain type of capitalist theory, namely extreme shareholder primacy. reply archerx 10 hours agorootparentprevMake the CEO responsible, want those big rewards (high ceo pay) get ready to deal with big responsibility. I’m sure if CEOs were criminally liable things would change very quickly. reply Arnt 8 hours agorootparentSo the CEO says in court: «I am now aware that some of the issues on your jira backlog caused damage to our customers. The very-well-compensated programming team leader and the highly paid programmers reported to me that there were no such issues in the backlog, and based on their written assessment I decided to release the new version. It would be impossible for me to check every detail, and therefore unreasonable for the jury to expect that.» And the jury agrees, and someone goes to prison but it isn't the CEO. reply A4ET8a8uTh0 5 hours agorootparentEh, my current project manager does not even seem to check every detail and we appear to be moving by pretty dashboards, so I expect CEO will have even smaller, simpler dashboard. Fwiw, if CEO got in front of the jury, I would expect things to look bleak for the CEO ( it is not exactly a favored class now ). There is a reason it does not happen often ( for example outright fraud ala Bankman ). reply archerx 8 hours agorootparentprevNice strawman. The prosecution reminds the jury that the CEO got paid 33 million before bonuses and the programmers only got 150k. reply constantcrying 10 hours agorootparentprevThe criminal precedent of punishing a person for a crime they didn't commit and had no knowledge of is so bad that I honestly didn't think any reasonable person could come up with this. reply Gujdek 6 hours agorootparentIn cases like this it should be even harsher than a prison or monetary punishment, I like what China is doing by executing White collar criminals such as CEO's for negligence, fraud, causing death etc: https://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-white-collar-crimina... reply doctor_eval 10 hours agorootparentprevThere were two crashes. The CEO most certainly should have known about the problems after the first one. It’s the CEO’s job to ensure that sufficient measures are in place to prevent failure. They should not be punished for accidents; they should be punished if the accidents were reasonably predictable. Which was most certainly the case when they decided to the redundant AoA sensor an optional extra. reply constantcrying 10 hours agorootparent>There were two crashes. The CEO most certainly should have known about the problems after the first one. Then drag him to court for that. But this is totally different to charging him with the crimes of other people he couldn't have known about. reply doctor_eval 10 hours agorootparentWhat are you talking about? From [1] in 2021: > The airplane manufacturer broke the agreement by “failing to design, implement, and enforce a compliance and ethics program to prevent and detect violations of the U.S. fraud laws throughout its operations,” the DOJ said. He’s not being held responsible for the crime, he’s being held responsible for looking the other way. The CEO is 100% responsible for designing programs to ensure that the business operates within the parameters of the law. What else do you think their job is?

The CEO most certainly should have known about the problems after the first one. Possibly, but not if it were a one-off. Are the airlines that chose to keep flying Boeing 737 MAX not equally (or more) responsible? reply doctor_eval 9 hours agorootparentAfter the first accident, Boeing was said to be blaming the pilots, in private, despite knowing about MCAS but not revealing it. They deliberately misrepresented the design (and in particular they minimised the severity of the failure modes) of MCAS to the FAA during the certification process. There are transcripts of the test pilots discussing this stuff. Boeing also heavily lobbied the FAA not to ground the Max 8 despite other jurisdictions grounding the aircraft. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that Boeing knew what was going on, and if the CEO didn’t know then he wasn’t doing his job. There really is no reason to give them the benefit of the doubt. reply bombcar 5 hours agorootparentWhat amazes me is that the first crash is arguably \"pilot error compounded by MCAS\" but they didn't just immediately pay the tens of millions it would have cost to retrofit all existing planes with the double-sensors that were an option but not required. reply sudosysgen 10 hours agorootparentprevThere is immense precedent to punish a person for a crime they were responsible for and that they should have known was happening. reply constantcrying 10 hours agorootparentThe software issues definitely were not something the CEO should have known about. reply pmontra 9 hours agorootparentThe CEO has the responsibility to make the company work well. If a company build products that injure or kill people, the CEO should be in trouble too. Instead of looking the other way and still get big paychecks and bonuses, improve design, testing, all company processes and make the company build products that work. reply lordnacho 10 hours agorootparentprevYeah, this is key. I don't see why the system shouldn't be set up that way. Company does something criminal, now boss is considered a criminal. reply constantcrying 10 hours agorootparentThat is a perversion of justice. You can not transfer criminal liability for money. Your employees can be criminals regardless of culture. The precedent this would set is ridiculous. reply abenga 10 hours agorootparentWho should be responsible for a company's crimes if not the people who make decisions in the company? If we want companies to have legal personhood, how about they suffer the same perils of breaking the law (prison time, etc)? Fines are just a price we set on breaking the law. reply constantcrying 10 hours agorootparent>Who should be responsible for a company's crimes if not the people who make decisions in the company? The person committing that crime. >If we want companies to have legal personhood, how about they suffer the same perils of breaking the law (prison time, etc)? Companies can not be put to jail. reply abenga 9 hours agorootparentThe people committing the crime include those who make the decisions. Hiring an assassin makes me guilty of murder. reply endominus 8 hours agorootparentI'm almost certain that's not true (at least, not in my own jurisdiction). Conspiracy to commit murder, perhaps. \"Murder for hire\" is apparently the DoJ term (https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/murder-hire-convict-sen...). But that's not the situation here anyway. Is an architect guilty of murder if a building he designs collapses? Flaws in his design may have contributed. What about the construction company that built it? Perhaps they were incompetent and sloppy in their construction. The suppliers might be at fault as well; they could have sold inferior steel or concrete. What about the politicians that passed faulty legislation for building codes? Does some of the blame not fall on them too? Or the maintenance company that skimped on their maintenance checks and could possibly have seen the cracks forming? There is very rarely, despite the assurances of five-whys and other incident response practices, a clear-cut and obvious point of failure when complex systems break. The Boeing situation was a failure of culture, people say. Maybe. They justify criminal charges on the C-suite as a result. Maybe even that is just, for a certain definition of justice. But the buck doesn't have to stop there. Where are the criminal charges for the shareholders, who chose to keep these criminals at the head of the company? Where are the charges against the FAA, who continued to do leave Boeing to be its own regulator? Why not cast blame on the previous CEOs as well? After all, culture takes a long time to change, and the current CEO has only been in the role since 2020 - the MAX's first flight was in 2016! reply thoronton 9 hours agorootparentprevThe people in charge have to ensure that the right measures are in place to prevent illegal behavior. If they do not do that, then they are liable. At Boeing, effective measures are obviously not in place. reply ben_w 9 hours agorootparentprev1) It's the CEOs job to know. Carelessness, recklessness, wilful ignorance, malice, these are all terms of art and can lead to different liabilities; as a non-lawyer I don't trust my own understanding as to the exact boundaries between them. 2) If the CEO knows, then the word \"conspiracy\" comes to mind, does not require them to perform the criminal act, only their agreement to act. reply ralferoo 6 hours agorootparentprev> I also think people don't understand how extremely lucky Boeing is. Disagree. I think most people can see how lucky it is for them that they can avoid an expensive and protracted court case, just say \"oh yeah, we're guilty of a serious fraud\" and the only consequence is some fines that amount to about 1% of their annual revenue. With consequences like that, it seems like the government is actively encouraging them to commit fraud... reply marcosdumay 1 hour agorootparentprev> It means ruining something which is useful to you and punishing tens of thousands of completely innocent people, with inevitable layoffs. There are no layoffs of you apply the punishment into the shareholders. Confiscate enough of the company proportionally to the fine value. Shareholders are, of course, free to sue the actual decision makers afterwards to pin down any non-mandated illegal behavior and recover their losses. reply dralley 6 hours agorootparentprev>I also think people don't understand how extremely lucky Boeing is. If all of this had happened during a time of low demand the company would be facing a far more dire situation, likely with many major airlines canceling orders. But since airplane demand is very high and order books are full, airlines have to keep their orders at Boeing if they want new planes. And as it stands they've already been losing money for the past 5 years. They could be losing a lot more money. Granted a lot of those losses are due to their own mismanagement of projects like KC-46, Starliner, AF1, etc. reply tgv 10 hours agorootparentprevThis is such a \"this looks tough, I don't feel like doing it\" take. Who is responsible? As others have said, the structure of a corporation defines that. If person A has to do what person B says, then B is responsible. If B \"didn't know\", then B has been lacking. It also avoids sacking the \"innocent people\" and it sets an example for other companies. The greedy corporate culture really needs a bit of check-and-balance. reply bluGill 5 hours agorootparentWe do however have to allow for person A intentionally hiding from person B what they are doing. Person A should check, but it is impossible to see everything so we do have to allow for person B committing fraud to hide from audits. reply tgv 5 hours agorootparentSure. But then B should prove that A did so. And even then, if B had threatened A, even implicitly, B can still be considered responsible for the fact that A didn't inform. reply lordnacho 10 hours agorootparentprevWhy can't the government mandate a board replacement? The board can figure out for themselves who is responsible, I would guess the finger would typically point at the CEO. reply davedx 10 hours agorootparentBoards are often toothless though, just look at Tesla's. Replace the C-suite. This is done frequently in M&A's and other corporate strategies in extremis. Fire the guys at the top and replace them with people with good track records. reply ryandrake 7 hours agorootparentYou can rotate people in and out of the C-suite, but incentives and culture aren’t going to change. These people are largely figureheads that get paid a lot of money because they are Ivy Leaguers whose friends on company boards who set their salaries are all Ivy Leaguers, too.

    "originBody": "jackkelly.nameBlogTalksWiki I'm Funding Ladybird Because I Can't Fund Firefox Posted on July 6, 2024 by Jack Kelly Tags: rants, web I’ve been meaning to write this one for a while, but the announcement of the Ladybird Browser Initiative makes now a particularly good time. TL;DR: Chrome is eating the web. I have wanted to help fund a serious alternative browser for quite some time, and while Firefox remains the largest potential alternative, Mozilla has never let me. Since I can’t fund Firefox, I’m going to show there’s money in user-funded web browsers by funding Ladybird instead. You should too. Why Browser Diversity Matters An open web requires a healthy ecosystem of several competing browsers, where each has enough market share that no one vendor has de facto control over web standards. That’s the world we used to have, after Firefox cracked the dominance of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) in the 1990s. IE’s poor support for internet standards held back web development all through the late 1990s and early 2000s, and competition from Firefox allowed developers to build “for the web” instead of “for IE6”, forcing browser vendors to catch up. Unfortunately, we are back in a world without healthy browser competition. statcounter.com claims that Chrome, Google’s browser, has over 65% market share. Add Edge (which uses Blink, Chrome’s browser engine, under the hood) and you’re over 70%. This market dominance allows Google to push through changes like its “Manifest V3” format for browser extensions, which coincidentally cripples ad blockers. Sidebar: Ad companies had their chance This is also the case for other user-hostile features like “Encrypted Media Extensions” (aka “DRM for the web”). A healthy browser ecosystem would have been able to vigorously push against features that take control from the users; instead, Mozilla caved in the hopes of maintaining Firefox market share but didn’t even get that. Why won’t Mozilla let me Fund Firefox? According to the Mozilla Foundation’s Donation FAQ, “Firefox is maintained by the Mozilla Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation. While Firefox does produce revenue — chiefly through search partnerships — this earned income is largely reinvested back into the Corporation”. “Search partnerships” means “Google”, who made up 81% of Mozilla Corporation’s revenue in 2022. This means Firefox’s primary revenue source is also their direct competitor, and they seem to have little ability to change that. Mozilla has backed themselves into a very poor position. In recent years, Mozilla Corporation has made several controversial moves in pursuit of revenue. Off the top of my head, there was the Mr. Robot addon, automatically loaded into people’s browsers to advertise a TV show; sponsored links in the address bar; sponsored “top sites” on the “new tab” page a reading list startup called “Pocket”, integrated into Firefox without warning; and a Mozilla VPN service, complete with in-browser pop-up ads. Cal Paterson has another good list. Meanwhile, Firefox market share falls and the outgoing Mozilla Corporation CEO gets paid millions (6.9 million USD in 2022 — see page 8). The problem is that many people specifically use Firefox because they’re sick of advertising and cross-promotion everywhere and want a browser that’s “just a browser”. On top of that, silently installing addons like the Mr. Robot extension undermine user trust in one of the most sensitive software projects people use. Despite desperately trying to find more revenue sources, Mozilla Corporation stubbornly refuses to just let users fund Firefox. Mozilla Foundation even has a specific donation form for Thunderbird (Mozilla’s mail client), but not Firefox. I’m sure they could have found some way of making it work with their corporate structure, and it baffles me that they haven’t. Ladybird Ladybird used to be the web browser for SerenityOS, a from-scratch hobby operating system written by Andreas Kling (and community). On 2024-06-03 (about a month ago), he forked Ladybird into a separate project and stepped away from SerenityOS. Presumably this was prep-work to launch the Ladybird Browser Initiative, a non-profit dedicated to building the rest of the browser. They are very open that the browser is unfinished — the first alpha release is planned for 2026. But they have running code, and I can actually help fund them. Wesley Moore runs some numbers in a similar post to this one, and concludes that 15 USD/month (~22.50 AUD in July 2024) is a good amount for a recurring donation. I’m in; are you?

Mozilla is an online advertising advocacy project. Just try suggesting to anyone from Mozilla the idea of web without ads. They will be 100% opposed, unwilling to even consider alternatives, as if they are being paid to defend this pro-advertising position. They are indeed being paid indirectly from the coffers of an advertising company. \"Free and open web\" apparently means web open for advertising. The presence/absence of advertising on the web is a non-negotiable. Mozilla insists advertising is a must-have. Why was the original internet free of ads before it went public. Are there more important uses for a computer network. ISPs privatised the financing for the network. We pay for internet. It is not free. Funding from advertising has never been a necessity. But Mozilla argues advertising is 100% essential. reply wkat4242 15 hours agoparent> even consider alternatives, as if they are being paid to defend this pro-advertising position. There's no way they would manage to exist like a business with a multi million dollar a year CEO without all that sweet Google money. So they are totally beholden to advertising straight from the top down. It doesn't even matter who is at the top, the whole step setup guarantees it'll be one of the big business players. Basically when they moved Firefox from a foundation to a corporation, this was pretty much inevitable. They don't even want our petty donations anymore. We can donate to the foundation's pet side projects but not too Firefox. reply cdumler 15 hours agorootparentGoogle funds Firefox and Mozilla knows its purpose is to prevent regulators to looking at Chrome the same way they did at Internet Explorer. reply soganess 13 hours agorootparentPeople always say that like it is a problem. I shit on Firefox every damn day, but that's because I'm a tech-brain(rot) weirdo. Truth is I absolutely love it. Firefox, or one of its derivatives, is the main (often times only) browser on every device I own. I literally wouldn't buy a device if I knew I couldn't install Firefox. Right now, our options are a world without Firefox or a world where Firefox is supported by the dominant market player. Maybe that changes in the future? Maybe it doesn't. But a chance for a future that isn't just the children of KHTML can't happen if Firefox doesn't exist. The obvious Apple in the 90s comparison comes to mind. reply pegasus 10 hours agorootparent> But a chance for a future that isn't just the children of KHTML can't happen if Firefox doesn't exist.

I realize they get a ton of money (probably most of their funding in fact) from Google, but still have they actually made such a statement? For now at least, they support ad-blockers a lot better than Chrome (because of Manifest v2). reply ndriscoll 17 hours agorootparentWhile it doesn't directly say it, their acquisition announcement for Anonym (an ad/tracking company) comes about as close as you can by saying Anonym believes it (and implicitly they support the viewpoint)[0]: > Anonym was founded with two core beliefs: First, that people have a fundamental right to privacy in online interactions and second, that digital advertising is critical for the sustainability of free content, services and experiences. Mozilla and Anonym share the belief that advanced technologies can enable relevant and measurable advertising while still preserving user privacy. Which completely ignores non-profit uses of the web, which is interesting since they're a non-profit and all. They've made similar statements in the past[1]: > Advertisements pay for all those “free” services you love, as well as many of the products you use on a daily basis — including Firefox. There’s nothing inherently wrong with advertising Which is of course true because they don't accept donations to fund Firefox despite people complaining that they want to be able to make such donations for years.

For the old alt OS people, also an ex-NetPositive dev. With that context, I'm on board with not giving money to Mozilla Corp. Late last year I cancelled my subscriptions to Pocket, the VPN, and recurring donations. That said, I recommend that you support Servo instead of Ladybird. Reason #1) C++ is just dumb in 2024 and choosing it is a big red blinking sign that the devs make bad decisions. Now they're considering a rewrite in a better language? So, starting again from scratch... No thanks! Reason #2) Given the track record of the main author of being an ass to people who aren't willing to be marginalized, I don't have high hopes that he can lead anything as complex as a competitive browser. No, Serenity OS is nowhere near the same level of complexity thanks to el GOOGs insistence that the modern web includes every API found in OSes. Serial port access, really? Anyway, please don't just jump on a hype train. Fund Servo. reply jadbox 2 hours agoparentHow is Servo going these days? I didn't even know that Servo was still active, but judging on the blog (https://servo.org/blog/) it looks like a lot of recent development has been happening. Maybe it would help if Servo had an active browser implementation (beyond the downloadable shell). reply xigoi 4 hours agoparentprev> Given the track record of the main author of being an ass to people who aren't willing to be marginalized That’s a quite strong accusation without any evidence. reply dieulot 6 hours agoparentprevWhere is said track record of the main author being an ass to people who aren't willing to be marginalized, or anything along those lines? reply gatlin 5 hours agoparentprev> Please don't jump on a hype train > Give capital to another project because C++ is \"dumb\" and Rust is not. I applaud you for disclosing your biases at the top but I was so hoping the disclosure wouldn't be a spoiler for the rest. reply lawgimenez 19 hours agoprevIt feels like websites are not testing their sites on Firefox anymore. Apple’s App Store Connect yesterday just won’t login anymore, tried Chrome and it works. So many broken headers, weird fonts, overlapping elements, etc. reply scoofy 17 hours agoparentI wrote a extension for a janky old website I used frequently that is broken for Firefox. It’s a simple js file, and I now have a couple dozen subscribers. A nice project. reply lolinder 20 hours agoprevThe inability to fund Firefox development is completely baffling to me. The finances seem pretty obvious: Open up a fund for Firefox donations. Hire contractors under the non-profit to work on Firefox. When you have enough to pay a full time developer, hire one under the non-profit. Rinse and repeat. If, as some claim, there isn't ever enough money to really fund development, fine, they've now proven that. But not even allowing it as a possibility is completely insane! I'm left in a position where I'm assured repeatedly that the best way to fund Firefox development is to pay for a side project I have no use for like Pocket or their VPN and then hope that that payment doesn't get consumed paying for said side project or future side projects. OP's thoughts were mine the day that the LBI was announced: finally there's a non-profit that is actually committed to maintaining browser diversity. It's just a pity that it's one that's starting from behind and not the existing non-profit whose browser at one point enjoyed a majority market share. reply llm_trw 20 hours agoparentBut how will the CEO get millions in compensation for running the browser into the ground while funding her side projects?

You'd have to go back to 2009. reply skissane 20 hours agorootparentBrendan Eich might not be the perfect CEO. But still I think he would have done better than Mitchell Baker did. He's interested in technology in a way in which she isn't. reply lern_too_spel 17 hours agorootparentEich wasted effort on FirefoxOS because he doesn't understand business. Now he's a cryptogrifter. reply timschmidt 16 hours agorootparentFirefoxOS had potential to pick up the pieces from the outstanding WebOS. We could have seen continued funding for Servo as well. reply lern_too_spel 15 hours agorootparentThe business model for FirefoxOS didn't make sense, just like the business model for WebOS didn't make sense. Android was cheaper than free to put on phones because Google was willing to share search revenue with carriers. They would not have done that on a FirefoxOS phone before it reached scale, nor would Microsoft, which was pushing its own phones. reply SahAssar 10 hours agorootparentThe business model for webOS was the same as the one for iOS though. Make OS, put it on devices, sell devices. Sell apps. reply timschmidt 15 hours agorootparentprevI don't buy it. Apple owners pay premium prices for a perception of increased safety and convenience. I feel that way about what WebOS was. There is always market space available for a device people want. reply lern_too_spel 14 hours agorootparentYou feel that way, and WebOS failed on phones. reply timschmidt 5 hours agorootparentHP played musical CEOs - 3 in less than a year - and one decided they shouldn't be in the phone or PC business.

He was also part of the same old guard and wasn't exactly aiming for some radical changes inside Mozilla. Imo one of the only things that could've made Firefox more relevant would've been to focus on an electron alternative, especially early on in 2013-14 as it would've been an entirely new \"product segment\", which could've made Firefox the standard engine for a lot of apps. But there's no indication that anyone high up at Firefox wanted to do something like that. It's a non-profit and non profits are rather conservative, for better or for worse. reply lolinder 7 hours agorootparentHe would have at least avoided getting distracted by every single liberal cause that popped up along the way and kept his focus on technology. You can complain about Brave's crypto stuff, but at least it was trying to solve a real problem with internet monetization instead of being whatever Colorways was. reply mardifoufs 3 hours agorootparentSure but that's just a symptom not a cause. Even without making Mozilla turn into a regular non profit that just happens to have a browser project (as opposed to a browser project non profit), the strategy they had just couldn't work. Every monetization attempt failed (even with stuff centered around \"privacy\", a niche where Firefox is well known). I've seen numbers that indicated that the Mozilla foundation donations are almost equal to what they profit from their commercial products. reply lolinder 1 hour agorootparent> Every monetization attempt failed (even with stuff centered around \"privacy\", a niche where Firefox is well known) Again, though: they have yet to try the obvious, which is allowing people to donate to Firefox. I have zero interest in supporting all the random distractions that Mozilla engages in, but if they gave me a donation box for Firefox specifically I'd set up a recurring payment today.

What a great vision. reply mardifoufs 3 hours agorootparentprevYeah I heard about it, but I don't know why they gave up. There's a lot of stuff that could be done to improve on electron (especially back then), and Mozilla was in a nice position where they controlled their web engine (as opposed to electron), so they could've made a very solid product... anyways that's not happening now... Edit: okay from what I understand in the blog, one of the reasons for abandoning it was that it was hard to keep up with the electron API changes and keep it compatible. That just goes to show that they were completely outplayed early on, otherwise they wouldn't have had to play catch up by merely being an electron shell around Spider monkey... >But Tofino is dead (long live the Browser Futures Group!), and Electron compatibility isn’t essential for a viable Gecko runtime. It’s also hard, since Electron has a large API surface area, is a moving target, requires Node.js integration (itself a moving target), and is designed for Chromium’s process architecture, which is substantially different from Firefox’s. reply edflsafoiewq 18 hours agorootparentprevI don't think the CEO matters.

A small monthly donation helps with that in a way that feature sponsorship doesn't. reply fabrice_d 18 hours agorootparentWhy do you believe that a monthly donation will help against Google influence on the web more than dedicated feature work? That seems backward to me. reply sdk- 19 hours agorootparentprevFolks on HN are good to talk the talk but not really to walk the walk. Not only they could give to developers or company like Igalia but they could also get a Firefox Relay/VPN subscription. They don't even need to use it and their money is going to be 100% profit for MoCo. Also, if we are realistic, the total money in donation that Mozilla could get would probably represent a drop in the ocean compared to their annual budget and the amount of money you need to develop a (complete) browser.

They publish their annual financial report but it isn't splitted per project so it's hard to know for a fact with the public information we have access to. However, it isn't unreasonable to think that at the very least a percentage of the smaller products revenues are reinjected elsewhere in the organization (e.g Firefox) since the goal seems to be to diversify their income sources. > People keep saying this, but given that it's never been tried you have no proof.

Few projects are able to get decent money with donations (e.g. Thunderbird). However, it's nowhere near the complexity of a web browser. For example, Thunderbird made almost $7M (USD) in 2023 for an average of $20 per donation which is 350k users out of 20M monthly active users [1]. Firefox has 10 times that number of users so we could estimate that they'd make $70M/year. That's far from $500M/year they're doing right now. [1]: https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/05/thunderbird-is-thriving... reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparent$70m is just $5m shy of their entire \"subscription and advertising revenue\" line item, with none of the extra cost of getting that revenue. Your back-of-the-napkin math would suggest that donations could render all of Mozilla's for profit side projects unnecessary and allow them to focus that energy exclusively on the browser.

Instead revenues from their other services (VPN, Pocket, etc) had been increasing steadily. And indeed we can verify those numbers on Wikipediaᵃ, where we see \"Revenue derived from Google\" trending downward every year. So it seems she's been A) successful with continuing the search engine deal with Google; and B) increasing revenue from their other services (VPN, Pocket, etc.) so that Google's contribution to the revenue pie chart slowly shrinks over time. † https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1dg7ejv/co... ‡ https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1dg7ejv/co... ᵃ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation#Finances reply PmTKg5d3AoKVnj0 20 hours agoparentprevI would imagine that there is caution about becoming beholden to user donations to continue operations.

You could argue that's the one use-case where it is objectively the best language to use. It's so valuable for that purpose that every large company has rewritten at least some crucial components in Rust. I also think Rust will be one of the only languages strict enough to enable the use of AI-generated code without compromising security. I certainly don't want AI-generated code for high-security applications, but there's nothing we can do to stop it at this point. reply atombender 20 hours agoparentI believe the team has said they are currently evaluating different languages, though they have not divulged which ones. From the FAQ on the Ladybird website: \"We are actively evaluating a number of alternatives and will be adding a mature successor language to the project in the near future.

All `unsafe` means is that the code inside the block doesn't have Rust's guarantees and should be inspected extra carefully by hand, much the same as you'd ideally inspect every single line of C. If sprinkling `unsafe` everywhere allows an organization to quickly adopt Rust's guarantees elsewhere and they're aware of that caveat (hard not to be given the naming) that can only be a net improvement over doing the entire thing in C. You can always go through and systematically remove unnecessary `unsafe` later if needed, but there's no need to do so upfront if that would prevent adoption. reply 1oooqooq 15 hours agorootparentthere's literary two other patterns on the one example in this thread... refactoring those unsafe will never happen in the kind of place that put them in place to begin with. reply wakawaka28 19 hours agoparentprevC++ is an awesome language for this.

Ladybird started as a component of the SerenityOS hobby project, which only allows C++. The choice of language was not so much a technical decision, but more one of personal convenience. Andreas was most comfortable with C++ when creating SerenityOS, and now we have almost half a million lines of modern C++ to maintain. However, now that Ladybird has forked and become its own independent project, all constraints previously imposed by SerenityOS are no longer in effect.

The languages that are memory safe either impose too much of a straightjacket to be productive (Rust), don’t give you a GC or a memory safe way of writing one (Swift, Rust), or give you a GC with the wrong semantics (Java, Go, etc). Yes, the browser needs to have a GC. No, there’s no way around that. I’m not saying it can’t be done - but there are good reasons to stick with C++ to get this job done. Not an ideal situation but it’s where the world is at. reply fabrice_d 20 hours agorootparentBoth Firefox and Chromium are moving to Rust, incrementally. There are good reasons for that, like the fact that even their very good C++ developers are on board. reply ethanol 20 hours agorootparentprevGC is but one component of the massive operating system that is current web browsers. This is classic anti-Rust \"argument\" which states that code with tiny islands of well tested and thoroughly reviewed unsafe functions is somehow equal to 100% unsafe C++. reply pizlonator 19 hours agorootparentIt’s not an island. The whole rest of the browser has to interact with the GC the right way (barriers, pointer tracking) or else you escape memory safety reply Dylan16807 17 hours agorootparentA ton of things using the GC code fits fine with what they meant by \"island\". You shouldn't need unsafe code all over, just normal ownership tracking that calls into the GC. And while I wouldn't normally call a GC \"tiny\", browsers are pretty enormous. reply pizlonator 15 hours agorootparentThat's not what happens in the browser at all. The JS engine - about 1/3 of the browser engine, ish - is tightly coupled to the GC through-and-through. Let's even assume you have a JS engine that doesn't JIT. (If it did JIT then rewriting it in a memory safe language isn't going to do much for you at all.) The interpreter, the runtime, and the libraries are going to have to be making decisions on behalf of the GC (for stuff like weak maps, at least) and is going to have to play along with the GC's tracing (every class in the JS engine participates in the JS GC and so must tell the GC how to mark - or worse, move - outgoing references). The rest of the browser has to play along as well, just not as much. The DOM is basically JS's \"standard library\" within the browser and it also needs to have its objects play along with the GC's semantics. So, maybe there is code out there where the GC can be an island. The browser is not that. reply Dylan16807 12 hours agorootparentTight coupling is not a problem. Ignore the word \"island\" if that's your issue. Pretend it talked about sealing each unsafe system behind a safe API. And yes, you can make that happen. Marking references for a GC is in the same ballpark as a custom allocator. It doesn't have to fill the code using it with unsafe. reply eknkc 20 hours agoparentprevAll the major operating systems these browsers are running on, are written in c and c++. How can you have a real memory safe application when the memory itself is managed by a shit ton of code written in an unsafe language? reply Sayrus 20 hours agorootparentIn many cases, you'd need to escape the browser before exploiting the OS itself. Security is not an all or nothing, layers and layers are effective at mitigating or increasing the time it takes for exploit to work. For instance ASLR is absolutely not a bulletproof solution, but many exploits are order of magnitude more complex to execute when enabled. In addition to that, the browser is executing third-party code all the time while making it a good point of entry. reply eknkc 20 hours agorootparentMy remark was a little more abstract and frankly, absurd though. I mean, the most memory safe language will invoke syscalls. It will ask for memory pages and stuff. If we assume the app is running on a pile of shit because the OS is written in C, how can we be sure that the language is memory safe? I understand the value of memory safe languages but people bashing on C/C++ code does not make sense to me when everything is essentially running on C. That’s all. > In addition to that, the browser is executing third-party code all the time while making it a good point of entry. This made me curious about something. Has there been many exploits stemming from JavaScript engines? I honestly do not know but as far as I can tell, most of the issues originate from faulty image decoders screwing up memory and tls implementations etc. reply heinrich5991 20 hours agorootparentAFAIK most of modern web browser vulnerabilities come from JavaScript engines. reply parl_match 20 hours agorootparentprev> How can you have a real memory safe application when the memory itself is managed by a shit ton of code written in an unsafe language? It turns out actually pretty effectively? There are going to be more bugs and boundary issues of the OS, but memory unsafety isn't some goop that oozes into your runtime. reply dmurray 20 hours agorootparentRight, or equivalently, you can rely on the million eyeballs and the million developer-years poured into those OSes, while developing your project with a much smaller team. reply eknkc 20 hours agorootparentprevYeah just a hyperbole. My point is, people act like anything built with non memory safe languages is shit ever since Rust became the Jesus. We have the actual operating systems written in C, working ok. It is fine. Yeah maybe Rust would be better but it is not a magic bullet and memory safety comes with many caveats in design of the code and possible performance issues when you are building something low level like a browser. reply lkdfjlkdfjlg 20 hours agoparentprevDo you know that memory safety is relevant for security, compared to other causes of exploits? Or are you just guessing? reply lolinder 20 hours agorootparentAs a very relevant example, Chrome found that 70% of their serious security bugs were memory safety bugs. 36% of them were use-after-free. https://www.zdnet.com/article/chrome-70-of-all-security-bugs... reply mkopinsky 20 hours agorootparentprevThe developer of curl has done an analysis of what percent of his CVEs would have been avoided in a memory safe language.

Do you have an example? reply timeon 20 hours agorootparentprevSeems other way around. Since you can focus more on other security issues instead of memory safety and other security. reply amelius 20 hours agorootparentNo, because the memory safety part comes at a cognitive cost. You may be right if you're talking about a GC'ed language, which gives memory safety and at the same time frees up the developer's mind. But if you're talking about constructs like borrow checkers then they do add cognitive load that is perhaps better spent elsewhere. reply dtx1 21 hours agoprevnext [33 more] [flagged] phendrenad2 21 hours agoparentHow much does Mozilla spend hardening Firefox?

Quote: If you have a very large (millions of lines of code) codebase, written in a memory-unsafe programming language (such as C or C++), you can expect at least 65% of your security vulnerabilities to be caused by memory unsafety. The quote is from https://alexgaynor.net/2020/may/27/science-on-memory-unsafet... reply marcus0x62 20 hours agorootparentprevIt might prevent 70%[0] or so of exploitable bugs.

[0] Given that Ladybird is yet another C/C++ browser, it will be riddled with these vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited. I don't think many here are thinking about the costs involved with security fixes and maintenance, at it is in the hundreds of millions of dollars a year just to keep up with Firefox alone. That is the minimum requirement for any serious competing browser. There's a clear reason why Chrome, Safari and Firefox need hundreds of millions of dollars of developer maintenance a year.

My Argument is that it takes likely 10s of millions of dollars to secure a large CPP Browser from the metric shitload of memory safety issues the average C/CPP Programmer leaves behind.

I'm really wary of a \"from scratch\" web browser at this point. I looked at their project and their main selling point is that they're building both the rendering engine and the JS runtime from scratch \"Driven by a web standards first approach\" - what exactly does that mean? Firefox has always had that approach and web standards are more complex than they've ever been. I don't understand why not using code from other browsers is supposed to be a selling point when all the major browsers have open source rendering engines and runtimes and there's independent runtimes being built like Bun that they could use. We're talking decades of features they have to support - unless they're planning on strategically dropping support for older unused/deprecated parts of the standard? Even in 2008 Google made the decision to use Webkit for their browser because they understood what an enormous undertaking it would be to write their own rendering engine. That was 16 years ago. reply SahAssar 20 hours agorootparent> I don't understand why not using code from other browsers is supposed to be a selling point when all the major browsers have open source rendering engines and runtimes and there's independent runtimes being built like Bun that they could use. Th selling point is to have multiple implementations of browser engines. Currently we have three (gecko, webkit and blink, where blink is based on webkit and webkit is based on khtml). If you consider how much of the modern world is based on browsing standards it seems pretty self-evident to not have it depend on a few corporations. Bun is a wrapper around JavaScriptCore (the JS engine used for webkit just like v8 is used for blink or node), so not at all an independent JS runtime and is not at all a browser. > We're talking decades of features they have to support If this is proven not to work because the standard has grow too big as you imply then we should absolutely look into either dropping old standards or slowing the pace we introduce new standards.

The internet _as the Western world knows it today_ will not be the same in a few decades. But then again, it's hardly the same today as it was 30 years ago either. A few things affect this: - Advertising. It's everywhere and corrupts every form of media. Content is made to appease advertisers, and web services are built to extract data from users. The internet experience is getting gradually worse. - Politics. For some reason, it's only dawning on governments now that providing uncensored and unfettered connections to their political adversaries can be used for information warfare. The idea that connecting the world will make it a better place and undo the millennia of tribalism is a romanticized platitude of the 1990s. - Artificial intelligence. The situation will only be exacerbated by letting AI loose on the internet. Whatever humans can do online, AI can do much, much better—or worse, depending on your perspective. The outcome of these things will be that countries will have a more restricted and censored version of the current internet. We'll follow China's example, and have a European internet, US internet, etc. The internet will survive. It will just be very different. reply account42 5 hours agoparent> Politics.

The idea that connecting the world will make it a better place and undo the millennia of tribalism is a romanticized platitude of the 1990s. Or another point of view: Those who call for internet censorship and country-level firewalls are NOT looking for the world to get better and instead are just afraid of losing their control over the population. Which is why you first see those measures being employed in openly totalitarian systems before now being slowly adoped in supposedly free societies whose rulers like to claim to represent the population they rule over. reply squigz 1 hour agoparentprev> The idea that connecting the world will make it a better place and undo the millennia of tribalism is a romanticized platitude of the 1990s. shrug Certainly a better place than a disconnected world. reply woooooo 2 hours agoparentprev> romanticized platitude of the 90s. I'm staying in romantic land, it beats the heck out of the government moderating which information I see for my own good. reply JohnFen 4 hours agoparentprev> The internet will survive. It will just be very different. The internet will continue to exist, certainly. However, it does become a more hostile and unpleasant place over time. Because of that, it's much less useful to me than it used to be and that trend doesn't appear to be changing. reply nooormal 3 hours agorootparentMore hostile as in... you open some random webpage, you get 3 popup windows with porn ads playing at full volume? And when you close them, infinitely more open, like a hydra, until it locks up and you have to reboot. Or you drop into a public game of CS, and a dozen teens start screaming at you over low bitrate compressed audio streams, to logoff and kill yourself because you sound like an n-word. This was my internet experience in 1999. I think the derangement has been a constant over time. reply JohnFen 2 hours agorootparentIt's true that the internet was already well down that road in 1999, but it has become much worse since then. I'm really comparing it to internet earlier than that. It was about 2000 when I started considering the internet as effectively dead in terms of being able to provide the value I used to get from it. But \"more hostile\" includes not only advertising and tone, but spying, overtly hostile actors such as crackers and other criminals and so forth. > Or you drop into a public game of CS, and a dozen teens start screaming at you I don't count this as part of the general degradation of the internet, though. That's more about the online gaming community. Things were that way before the internet was the most common method of online gaming. reply nooormal 5 minutes agorootparentInteresting. My frame of reference for the internet started in 1998, after \"eternal september\" and the earlier culture. Which makes me curious about baseline expectations. I agree many aspects are growing... overtly bad. I think LLMs are well on their way to rendering the mainstream internet, search, and social media effectively worthless. The signal to noise ratio is unfixable. I still get value from my habits, which haven't changed for decades: niche forums, personal websites, blogs, podcasts, youtube. I would be satisfied as long as those remained more or less intact, the rest can go. Requires a lot of curation though. reply hellojesus 2 hours agorootparentprev> Or you drop into a public game of CS, and a dozen teens start screaming at you over low bitrate compressed audio streams, to logoff and kill yourself because you sound like an n-word. I do have a strange nostalgia about those days. It was a culture that didn't exist in meatspace, and there was something fun about that. However, when covid hit and my wife and I started playing games, I quickly learned my wife severely disapproves of typing \"kys\" to others in games, and now I try to only say positive things. It is a better experience, but then again I'm now a parent and hoping to spare my children from interacting with college me. reply Lammy 1 hour agorootparentkeep yourself safe :) reply shrimp_emoji 2 hours agorootparentprevIt's what the Internet is for -- a place where things don't matter and where you could go to blow off steam. The Dionysian night to real life's Apollonian day. Needing to be polite in every aspect of our lives because of this stupid demand to collapse down to the lowest common denominator of humor or mental fortitude is ruining the Internet and making the world and media less fun. It's also Orwellian. There's people who want to dox you and make sure you get fired or never get hired for being mean in a CoD lobby. That's psychotic. Those people are mentally ill, and we've let them run the show and tell us what to do. And of course, it's symbiotic with corporations and advertisers who want things as anodyne and rated E as possible since that makes the most $$$ (if only we can collectively accept more mediocre art and experiences as we forget what better ones we had). I'm glad the pendulum seems to be swinging back as people are figuring out that having had less for fun for the last 10 years accomplished absolutely nothing worth caring about. reply InDubioProRubio 11 hours agoparentprevI think what we will also see - are pocket universes. As in- to circumvent censorship, people will download and run an ai, that mimicrys the free internet for them. reply benfortuna 6 hours agoparentprevThe Internet (and especially the Web) is not so much the content, but how it is linked. Without a doubt the way we link (quality) content and hide the drivel should|will|MUST evolve. And that evolution may produce something unrecognizable from the Internet of today. reply torginus 10 hours agoparentprevHonestly I welcome the 'death' of the internet with open arms. Irrespective of the enshittification flavor of the day, the end result is the same - face to face human relationships will be back in vogue again, and the internet will go back to a complimentary role at best. I would also like people to let go of the idea that the internet is Serious Business. People who live their lives on Twitter, discussing political matters of grave importance, people getting 'canceled' over inane shit is just ridiculous. It should go back to trash talk and funny memes, and cat pictures and sharing baking recipes. reply account42 5 hours agorootparentThe \"Internet\" didn't kill direct human interactions, the engagement economy did. This economy will continue to exist and continue to outcompete direct contacts as long as it remains profitable, with or without the Internet. reply Galatians4_16 11 hours agoparentprev> The idea that connecting the world will make it a better place and undo the millennia of tribalism is a romanticized platitude of the 1990s. This only applies in media that allows censorship, and controls visibility. If it doesn't, the bigots are easy to identify and weed themselves out. If it foes, the bigots can form bubbles, and foster tribalism. reply breuleux 2 hours agorootparentFully open and uncensored platforms do not force bigots into bubbles, but they do not prevent them from creating them willingly. If it serves the bigots' interests to form bubbles in order to foster tribalism, then they will. Basically, if there exists a strategy for an ideology to spread under censorship, it is hard to believe that removing restrictions would make it any less effective. Bigots won't out themselves and discredit themselves on an open platform just because they can, they are not idiots. reply chpatrick 10 hours agorootparentprevI think you'll find bigotry is actually quite popular worldwide. reply account42 5 hours agorootparentGood observation.

To varying degrees? reply itishappy 2 hours agorootparentI'd be more surprised if they didn't! I'd argue that's just how culture works. The counter-examples are probably a lot more interesting. reply p5a0u9l 5 hours agorootparentprevAssuming you’re serious and not just trolling - what even is wokism, aside from a name thrown at people you disagree with? Bigotry is a known, studied phenomenon. Are you saying there is not a natural tendency to prefer one’s own kind and mistrust foreigners? Are you saying that groupthink respects no particular ideology? reply shrimp_emoji 1 hour agorootparentWokism is a rejection of common sense, exchanged with an embrace of exotic rationalization flowers bred in the left-leaning echo chamber hothouses of academia and Tumblr. You can reduce anything to \"a name thrown at people you disagree with\", and anything can be \"a known, studied phenomenon\". Especially if researchers can safely study it when academia is captured by an ideology that's hostile to certain viewpoints. ;D reply dyauspitr 3 hours agorootparentprevExactly. It just makes my point. reply InDubioProRubio 11 hours agorootparentprevInformation wants to be free - the ideology - downvoted into disappearance and death.. the irony.. reply nickdothutton 19 hours agoprevWe got the Internet that advertising built. This was not how we (well some of us early 90s and before) users assumed it would pan out. It has been my experience that private Internet communities (groups, forums, messaging chats) are where the quality discussion happens these days. Away from the advertising and the controversy seeking (and anti-tech) mainstream media reporters. reply weitendorf 13 hours agoparentSmall private communities are contrary to some of the most important, biggest promises of the Internet (and the web): that it would be open and really big. It was supposed to be a place where some kid in rural Africa with only 8 years of schooling could learn how to be a software developer, or where people could naturally find and join communities too small to have a local presence (eg people really into collecting vacuum cleaners). I don't think it's just an advertising/cancel culture problem. It's partially a problem with the internet being so decentralized that spammers and scammers can operate with impunity, pushing a ton of work onto people running online communities because countries like India and Russia don't properly go after cybercriminals - even if someone SaaSified forums, this is still a significant burden. It's also kind of a UI problem: if Google search starts to suck and gets filled with trash, as has happened, it breaks the core pull-model of the web. If Reddit starts to suck and get filled with trash, as has happened, it breaks the core push-model of the web.

There's a reason the US election system isn't by popular vote, our founders believed that \"the mob\" couldn't be trusted and there needed to be a electoral escape hatch to make sure reasonable people were elected. With that said, what's the problem with people having ideas that seem crazy and baseless? Does it really harm you at all if someone else believes 5G causes covid?

Revolutions are messy and its easy to lose sight of that when you're on the winning side. I'm personally very glad to not live under a imperial monarchy, but I do wish the founders could have kept their concerns over voters out of the way. There are historical examples of why trusting the mob goes poorly, but keeping that on the table fundamentally ruins the point of a democratic society. Its all well and good to say we need an educated populace, but the system should offer the public a chance to live up to the ideal rather than guard against their failure. reply kjkjadksj 2 hours agorootparentI don’t think the founding fathers much less the ancient greek democrats anticipated the level of idiocy in the public discourse we are dealing with today.

I don't think I've seen anyone argue for restricting voter rights over speech before. I'm very opposed to limiting either, the US is already more restrictive with regards to both voting rights and speech than I'm comfortable with.

I guess she realized I was a bit more antic establishment than normal and thought I'd like that hypothesis. It was a small minority, but there were (and are) absolutely people who believed this.

Crazy uncles have existed long before the Internet. reply _heimdall 4 hours agorootparent> literally nobody thought this Well it seems relevant because the comment I replied to was minimizing the number of people who thought 5G may have caused covid to a miniscule number of people. I raised my experience because I only know a small number of people and did in fact know someone in real life who believed this and sent me plenty of links and whitepapers making the same claims. Is my anecdotal experience statistically significant? Absolutely not. But I also hesitate to believe that the number of people who bought into the idea was so small as to effectively not exist. reply smackeyacky 3 hours agorootparentprevCrazy uncles were unable to find other crazy uncles and coagulate into the fatbergs of information flow before the internet.

Which is also playing out in politics and the media/advertising, and the macroeconomic fed rate situation. They’re all related. Business cycle wise: - it starts out mellow, with lots of positive ROI and few downsides. Few know about it at first. - as awareness grows, so does competition. While there is a ton of room to grow, this isn’t a problem. Growth doesn’t have to be at the cost of a competitors market share, there are tons of available untapped opportunities. - eventually, it starts to become crowded. Now competition starts to become more heated and cut throat. Old tricks to stay competitive stop working, and there is an arms race to develop new ones. - at some point, some/many players don’t feel they can compete based on fundamentals (positively), and it starts to become a race to the bottom. With some/many players starting to scam or commit fraud, be scary/manipulative, squeeze suppliers to a destructive degree, etc. Zero sum game instead of green field. - this causes demand side restrictions and additional costs as customers start to get scared/overwhelmed, and cut back or get more demanding on quality. - this causes a downward spiral that worsens the situation industry wide, eventually bankrupting marginal suppliers and maybe even big ones, until things stabilize or change. On the social side, a lot of people population wide are flat out not doing it anymore. Including women. Similar to dating apps. Which is why some advertisers, politicians, businesses keep getting even more insane and craven trying to extract even more value from the remaining people - to keep the numbers going up and right. So they don’t have to ‘look down’ and be potentially bankrupt. The loudest players in this type of environment are almost always the ones in the worst position. This is also playing out in American Politics and Media right now. It isn’t just engineer or blue collar types, who IMO were already predisposed to not engaging with it.

I haven't really seen behind the invite veil much, since I'm about as far as it gets from someone cool you'd want in your group chat, but from what I've seen, \"good\" things are happening and thoughts are thought. It's just happening in private. There were comments or an article somewhere about someone being sad about \"very deep technical discussions being held on discord servers and that knowledge being ultimately lost\". I don't think it's that bad of a thing though since that knowledge was never intended for the public and being ultimately lost and forgotten is what the people writing said messages are expecting of it.

We don't allow political discussion, which mostly allows members of diverse backgrounds to interact safely, since triggering discussions don't come up very often. It's not even a particularly novel idea, right? Chatrooms have been a thing just about since packet switching was a thing, this one is just a polished implementation of that idea.

Ironically, you find a lot of this on places like Reddit, including an excess of uninformed and repeat questions. I am of the opinion that Discord does any niche community a great disservice by first locking content behind an invite link and, once invited, content is locked behind pages and pages of search results if the content is even still available. I’m sure there is bias on my part because I cut my teeth on forums of the ‘00s to the mid ‘10s, but the siloing and fragmentation of information has ultimately divided up centers of knowledge into smaller and smaller pieces.

They get coopted for misinformation. I think a lot of fear about \"new media\" whatever form it might be is simply reactionary from a media literacy perspective. The adult of the radio age might understand that one can have some media literacy with the radio, not believe everything they say, waste their time on it, etc. But their kids who are watching TV all day didn't get that lesson in school, clearly the case from watching TV all day and not playing like a normal kid over the last millenia, and since they are kids they don't understand nuance so its simpler to put the foot down, and say \"shut that damn TV off.\" I think better lessons in media literacy would help a lot of situations like this, however there is very strong incentive in our world to prevent a high degree of media literacy from taking root, as it would obviate a lot of methods used for controlling subsets of the population. reply samatman 14 hours agoparentprevAh yes.

Setting aside what does \"end of the world\" actually mean, who's making this statement? Almost nobody is, since practically every instance is someone referencing somebody else with little commitment. Essentially this is arguing against a person instead of some wide-spread view. Even if it was wide spread, does it even matter? It obviously can't be true since end of the world in any reasonable understanding contains end of the internet. So what exactly is this point and argument against it trying to show? I have no idea since believing or not in something dying generally matters little to it being (or not) in such process. Let's say it is important. What are the arguments that it is incorrect beyond being obviously so? Well, some unrelated people before you were incorrect about unrelated shape of future so you, but not the author, probably are too. Then he follows this by putting words in mouth of the people he disagrees with, before he swerves into his own experiencing of internet consumption and resulting numbness. I guess based on his expectations of near future there's an expectation of universality of his experience, but even if it was universal (and huge amounts of emotions exhibited online create at least some doubt that it is), why would it contribute to internet's death? It obviously doesn't stop him from scrolling, or writing and otherwise engaging on internet. Again, I have no idea. So all of it does not really add up to much, but I admit it is entertainingly written which is more than most of us manage. reply chipsrafferty 5 hours agorootparent> It obviously can't be true since end of the world in any reasonable understanding contains end of the internet. No, it obviously can be true. I can imagine many ways \"the end of the world\" could occur. Also, maybe it's not crystal clear what \"the end of the world\" means to you, but for me, and likely other people, it means the collapse of human civilization, which could happen from nuclear war, climate change, etc. Just because \"the end of the world\" would include \"the death of the internet\" doesn't imply that by imagining the end of the world you're also imagining the ways in which every aspect of the world get destroyed. When I imagine the end of the world I don't focus on what happens to say, Paris, specifically, but I do know, implicitly, that the end of the world would include the end of Paris. reply shoubidouwah 22 hours agorootparentprevIt also was how N. saw his thoughts at times. An evidence, disgraced for being explained. And stylistic flamboyance around a theme is hardly foreign to philosophers, this one in particular (any chapter of Zarathustra can be read as a blog post in the same way). I still advocate that style - and being drunk with style - can lead the writer to singularly original and contemporaneous ideas. Language is a dynamic object, filled with the spirit of the age, and very high sensitivity to it within a philosophical context can act as a catalyst. reply chipsrafferty 5 hours agorootparentAgreed, and for me, the main thesis of the article was that we should create things that we want to create, without concerning ourselves about how much engagement, reach, impact etc. they will have. reply samastur 21 hours agorootparentprevAs someone with sweet-tooth I don't mind the style, but I do think it masks how empty his arguments are and how unsubstantiated.

They are going to try all they can to get into that community and use it for advertising, to make some use out of it versus to leave it be on the table. Entropy favors enshittification. The race to the bottom never ends, the bottom just keeps moving as low as it possibly can be. Individual incentives have also shifted substantially. Having a post go viral or be of some help to someone else used to be enough of an incentive to post on the internet. Now people want to make a job out of it, which shifts the nature of the posts due to different incentives requiring different optimizations. Also people aren't hosting their own websites that they support out of their own pocket that often anymore. People would rather post their content on other people's websites that are ad supported and therefore have incentives that bias what is posted there or gets traction on that platform. reply DocTomoe 13 hours agoparentA big part in that was ISPs who often enough deliberately killed self-hosting with dynamic IP allocation and asynchronous upload/download rates, necessitating hosting somewhere else, which came with an extra cost, either in ads or in money. reply account42 4 hours agorootparentDynamic IPs for residential connections where already the norm in the early 2000s (remember dyndns.org and freedns.afraid.org?) yet self-hosted content was much more prominent than it is now.

No one cares about Billboard anymore now that everything is on Soundcloud and Spotify, and no matter how niche someone's tastes are, there's probably an entire ecosystem of content for it. I recently found out dungeon synth was a thing. >Innovation--its documented that everything is now IP sequels and the number of original things is way down. Where is it documented?

But as far as impact goes, again, it's simply impossible for any music to have the same impact in the internet age as it did pre-internet.

For example, uber recently added advertisements into their app. You may not know this, because they are only seen when you are riding in your ride already, but you get an ad for Tim Hortons because the car is within a half mile of one. On paper this looks good for the marketer. Why yes, we can take our captured population and send them ads to local partners who now get these customers patronizing their business. Seems like it would be a great lucrative deal for both parties, right? Of course logic says it doesn't work like that. Like I said, no one sits there looking at uber ads the entire ride. No one tells the uber driver \"hey wait, I know I was trying to get where I was going but all the sudden I am surprisingly hungry, lets divert a half mile and potentially 20 minutes so I could get a $4 bacon egg and cheese.\" It just doesn't happen. But the dance must continue of course. Maybe the uber people responsible for this feature don't even care at all that it works, only that their shareholders think it works and their advertising partners also think it works. That is incentive enough to keep up the farce even with no supporting data because the money, in the end, is very real.

The observations are correct, it's just most of the conclusions the author comes to are deranged. And how they're written? It all just sounds like it was written by a tinfoil hat wearing english major desperate to stay relevant. First of all, the internet isn't on the verge of imploding, it's just in flux, as per usual. It also isn't stagnating, at least not on such a grand scale. Though it does feel as though it's lost a bit of steam in the last few years. That could be due to the homegeneitiy of the current investment landscape. The author tries to sell us a doom spiral by comparing the state of services. They attempt to connect different services as if they're representative of a pulse for the internet as a whole. But the differences between Facebook and Tik Tok are vast, between Twitter and MySpace, between forums and Discord. Declining numbers in any of these does not indicate decline in any other service, nor the internet as a whole. Not to mention most of these are controlled by monolithic entities who also don't contribute to the web outside their bloated bubbles, the performance of these services are largely based on the performance of these companies and their investments. If one dies, it's a largely isolated event. All the most recent, negative changes were made by spurious investments into anything that even seemed remotely profitable by eager investors. These bubbles will burst, and when they do, some people won't even notice the change. Some, of course, will be forced to adapt, or to leave the internet entirely. That'll likely mean the www will lose a lot of its traffic, but that doesn't sound bad for the internet as a whole... in fact it sounds good. Companies are only making the internet worse because they believe there's money to be made. That, as the author points out, is not really going to be true for much longer, at least not for the current wave of companies. And when that happens, new companies will have to step in and pick up the pieces if they want to profit off the internet. Unfortunately for them, there's just not enough lubrication to keep an aging population of users relearning all their old habits in new environments. I believe the internet, as it is now, will not survive for the individual. However, every individual must make that journey on their own terms. The author clearly made their journey ages ago, or perhaps was always skeptical. Others, however still have to make that trek. I have a few younger friends still in the beginning of their internet obsession where they (somehow) can still find regular content that interests them on the www. This group is likely to be the last large wave for advertisers. So, when they're done, that's it; The internet won't be worth investing in, and everyone who only ever used it kill time will go along side the companies. Those that made the journey will stay if they have use for a post-corporate internet. The article, of course, assumes that the internet is just for fapping and killing time, when in reality it's used for a lot more than just that. Fapping and killing time is just what's being subsidized by the numerous companies invested in the internet. The article doesn't consider this, it doesn't consider that there were points before the current one, or that there are even corners of the internet where people share software and ideas. No, it just assumes that once this fad dies, the internet dies. I personally believe the internet has uses outside what companies invest in, and it's not hard to use it for just those purposes. That's enough of a reason to keep coming back. All that being said, I do agree with the author regarding causes on the internet. One essentially does nothing when they try to devote their time to a cause online. Unless one explicitly uses the internet to organize action with others in meatspace, the internet is essentially worthless as a medium for revolution. Actually, it's worse than worthless, it's detrimental as it encourages non-action. In most cases even supporting forces who would ostracize those that would push for more forceful and aggressive action against the status quo. The corporate internet has largely made revolutionaries into pacifists, a trait which makes them non-threatening to those in power. Even calmly explaining all this is a bit mastubatory and counter-productive. What I should be doing is running in local elections, organizing meetups, or sabotaging power structures in a variety of ways. I should be speaking in plain language about all of this, and freely expressing myself.

I had a boss 15 years ago who had watched all things Star Trek, just like me; Knew all the things. But at one point he mentioned he wasn't really a fan, it was just \"required reading, part of the literature\". This is an interesting one. There used to be certain things that all nerds knew, and could talk about, use as analogies and metaphors. Something to talk about just like sales people (stereotypically, used to) talk about sports. I realized early in my career that's why some people in business follow sports, so they didn't get cut out of conversations. I always had nothing to say when that topic came up. But it's tricky because geeks and nerds shouldn't be gatekeepers about what the entertainment is, or the literature, because that cuts out a lot of people who should feel included. But at the same time most people think it's generally nice to have some common things to reference, talk about, and normalize on. I think social media, politics, streaming services, etc. have totally blown away these shared frameworks in society, and it's kind of a bummer, even though it's great to have lots of choices.

In my mind, an IDE needs to be able to read all the files I can read myself, it needs to be able run arbitary tools like compilers and linkers then run the resulting compiled code, it needs a debugger that can attach to running processes and mess with them, it needs to be able to pull from the language's package repository when you ask it to, it needs to talk to your git server when needed, it needs access to your SSH keys to do that. About the only thing the IDE doesn't need is to run as root - and if you're working with Docker it basically needs that too. The idea of an IDE with pluggable language support safely running plugins from untrusted sources? I can't imagine how such a thing could even be possible? reply II2II 6 hours agorootparentA different (Visual Studio Code) example that uses network access and runs executables from untrusted sources: embedded development. You have everything from tools like PlatformIO, that manages the toolchain for microcontrollers from multiple vendors; to ESP-IDF, that manages the toolchain for microcontrollers based upon multiple architectures; to Raspberry Pi Pico, which uses the IDE as a simplified installer for their toolchain. With some compilers leaning on user side, rather than system side, toolchain management (e.g. Rust), I would imagine that plugins managing that would be desirable as well.

It's a shame these actions have to even exist in IDE, it's like they know there's a bug in caching mechanism but can't find it, and no, I'm not using any fancy networked filesystems, just native macOS directories. On another point I spent 2 hours setting up a Ruby interpretter because no matter what I did Intellij would not recognise my RVM ruby, I think compiling without yjit and setting up a specific gemset for the project plus a few Restart IDE and Invalidate caches later did it, but not sure. For tailwind specifically the extension is lacking compared to VSCode, I do not have color squares for my color classes and the classes are not recognized in more difficult filetypes (i.e. erb templates). Many other extensions seem much less loved than on VSCode, i.e. continue.dev, you can read their reviews and quickly get a sense that it's much more niche ecosystem.

In a thread about additional components being installed without prompts, a user jumps out to complain about missing functionality in another editor because they refused to install an additional component when prompted. reply alias_neo 10 hours agorootparentQuite. VSCode asks with a little pop-up in the bottom right (for me, on Gnome) when you open a project that might benefit from a particular component, and you can accept or decline it. It tells you what/why it's needed, it's up to you to accept or decline, but you should accept that things won't work well if you don't.

For a rather large framework we are developing an engineer at DY introduced a somewhat similar problem. A binary was being installed, from a trusted source in this case but a binary was being compiled/installed none the less. It never made its way to an actual release and I personally took the time to change this approach so that we weren't installing binaries on people's machines without their permission. We now pre-compile and vendor. This approach likely isn't what Zed can do as in this case we can target just Intel/Apple Silicon machines but the point here is I recognized the problem and rather than just hand-wave dismiss it as a #wontfix I took responsibility for it and fixed it myself.

Questions: What control does a user have right now over what gets installed automatically? What are the levers we can pull to get more control? (These levers include configuration options, pushing back on the project, and so on.) P.S. Not that this is an excuse, but VS Code's security posture (sandboxing, prompting users, etc.) probably didn't happen overnight without user pressure. Who knows the history? reply xpe 4 hours agoparentSome highlights from the Github issues thread [1]: > Ideally you would be able to turn off auto-download but still be able to use a [language server] if it’s already on the users system. > There is not a binary choice between \"friendly to end users\" and \"secure\". You can have your cake and eat it too. The main thing that should be considered is less of a user facing popup or preference (where opt-in vs. opt-out is an issue, as is noise & friction), but developer facing options. If Zed offered compile time configuration this could be fixed to everybody's satisfaction. Distros could ship a pre-configured package with all the dependencies already provided so that the user experience is just \"install and run\" while also not having an app that downloads (or attempts to download) binaries behind teh users back. Meanwhile if Zed wants to ship a binary package upstream that defaults to downloading things they can.

When I was editing some JS or HTML file I noticed that my laptop is quite warm. I checked all processes and there was some node process taking up 100% of one of CPUs. It was some language server running in the background in some non-efficient way. The problem with Zed is that its mission is to be \"engineered for performance\", while in the background they cut corners and run some heavy unoptimized stuff.

Co-founder at Zed. Sorry that we haven't replied to that GitHub issue yet. We try our best to listen to the community (here, on GitHub, on Discord, ...), but we're a small team and, admittedly, it's tricky to keep up with everything. I agree that we should ask users for consent before downloading language servers (and other executables). For everybody who's come across the ticket here or on Reddit and hasn't worked with the Zed codebase yet, let me provide some context on how language support is implemented. In Zed, we have three ways of supporting a language (and its language servers): 1. Extensions that users can install from the `zed-extensions` repository [0] 2. Pre-bundled extensions that ship with the Zed binary, but still need to be installed [1] 3. Built-in language support [2]. For (2) and (3), the code is owned by the Zed team and we make a conscious effort to review contributions from the community in that area. That code can automatically download language servers, but we try to vet which exact scripts/binaries are downloaded from where. For example: we heavily use rust-analyzer ourselves and keep up to date with its releases, the Go language server `gopls` is downloaded from the Go team using the official `go` tooling, the ESLint language server comes from Microsoft, etc. For the longest time, we only had built-in language support (3). A couple of months ago, we shipped extensions for Zed (point 1 and 2 above, parts of it described in [3]). The goal was for built-in language support (3) to gradually move to pre-bundled extensions (2) so that users had the ability to choose which ones to install. We did make some progress, but we haven't ported all languages yet. We're a small team and can only do so many things at once. So after investing quite a bit of time into extensions, we chose to pause that work and invest into other areas for a while (porting Zed to Linux, for example). Once those areas are in a better state, we plan to come back to extensions, build them out some more, and port the remaining languages. So, TL;DR: we hear you loud and clear. We try to vet things that are currently installed automatically. But we agree that we should ask users whether they want to install arbitrary binaries on their computer. We also plan to transition all language support to manually-installed extensions once we finish other projects.

Zed is awesome, haven't been able to switch to it full-time due to [1] https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/5065, but do appreciate what's being built. It's a new product, which is clearly seeing quick changes every week, so hopeful you'll get to this one soon. The internet will always be extreme around any issue, and make it seem like the end of the world, to those folks, maybe try zed again later? It's still a good editor to keep in mind. Although one minor thing about this, getting users accustomed to this flow and then later asking for consent might also raise issues, like this one, just with a more \"Zed now prompting for every little thing\" in future. So might want to keep that in mind. Loving zed for go development (especially with a decent suite of Vim bindings), just haven't been able to use things like Flutter , due to lack of debug support, which VSCode does quite well (albeit crashes a bunch). reply nijave 7 hours agoparentprevI think some middle ground might be including an extension lock file that gets committed to the repo. For internal projects, users will get auto configured by trusting the other internal users that setup the repo. For external projects, users need to trust the project they're pulling down anyway since it's arbitrary code. That would also help mitigate the risk of supply chain attacks (since versions are pinned and ideally verify package integrity) reply sakisv 8 hours agoparentprevHi Antonio, thanks for Zed, love it. If I may offer a small piece of feedback based on your comment here: Apart from its speed, the single thing I loved about Zed and made it stand out from the likes of vscode, was the built-in language support. This made for a great first time experience where I didn't have to search and download anything and everything was working out of the box. In fact it was so good an experience, that when I had to download another thing for terraform support, it struck me as much more annoying than usually Reading that your plan is to move in the exact opposite direction is disappointing and, I'm sorry to say, I hope it doesn't come to pass. reply cowl 9 hours agoparentprevthis answer makes things even worse. \"we are a small team so its ok for us to expose your pc to risks\". If you dont have the bandwidth to do things securely dont do them at all.you are asking the devs to wait until you have time to return to it to plug the holes you have opened because you needed a bulletpoint for your release. and this is not just a lack of time, its your attitude in regard to the devs, see also the optout telemetry for another example of total lack of respect for privacy. reply perryizgr8 7 hours agoprevThere is a balance between asking too many confirmations and not asking at all. VS code had this feature called \"Workspace Trust\" or something like that. It was so incredibly annoying. Always asking me for my own repos or repos which are in my org, if I trust the authors. I ended up disabling it completely and it will remain that way. I hope Zed finds a way to strike the balance in a better way than bombarding the user with confirmations, otherwise I'll be completely disabling that too, probably to the detriment of the security of my computer. reply AlexDragusin 12 hours agoprev> We created the hackable text editor, Atom, and the pioneering software platform that launched an entirely new generation of desktop apps, Electron. reply lpcvoid 10 hours agoparentI'd rather wish they hadn't to be honest reply AlexDragusin 7 hours agorootparentThat's the point I was trying to make :) reply airhangerf15 4 hours agorootparentI agree.

It can be assumed to have some setup permissions. Also it's far better than the packaging the remote code with the installer or binary. The same people who will complain about this do t really understand how package managers work also. Take npm as an example, you manually install one package. You do not consent explicitly to have all of its dependencies added also. This sounds like typical Reddit behaviour. As you said, a better approach would have been to ask the maintainers to mention it in the readme. No drama required. reply vladvasiliu 10 hours agorootparentI don't use NPM, but that means NPM's behavior isn't that great and maybe shouldn't be an example for others to follow. Linux package managers with which I'm familiar will absolutely prompt you with the list of dependencies they'll install when you ask for some package and give you the possibility of bailing out. reply mrweasel 8 hours agorootparentFrom the report on Github it seems like Zed will also download LSP for other languages without prompting, so it is initially an issue with Zed, but enhanced by the fact that NPM is misused. It should be noted that other package managers can also run post install scripts. That being said, I also don't use NPM and actively discard any software that requires me to run an NPM command. It's somewhat funny to me that people are complaining that Python have a package management problem, while we at the same time have NPM which basically took the ideas from Python and said \"What if we made this worse?\". The worst NPM misuse, from my perspective, is people viewing NPM as a platform agnostic package manager. I can understand not wanting to build .deb, .rpm and Brew packages, but that doesn't mean that just plunking a pre-build binary into NPM is a good choice. reply bilekas 9 hours agorootparentprevI don't think NPM is a model for anyone to follow to be honest, my gripe is just the hill to die on isn't Zed for this issue. reply consp 12 hours agoparentprevMaybe make a cve out of it since it is an obvious exploit path running unchecked automatically downloaded binaries without user interference. reply bilekas 12 hours agorootparentI don't know if this is sarcastic but doesn't a CVE require an actual proof of attack and not just hypothetical? reply consp 12 hours agorootparentIt was sarcastic but on point, and many cves do not have poc exploits so at best it is murky. reply MereInterest 7 hours agoparentprev> Instead they go on calling it \"completely unacceptable \" repeatedly, using language that implies that the devs have caused grave offense. Downloading and executing untrusted code is a security vulnerability. If a library does so accidentally, avoiding such an accident should be the primary focus of the report. If a library does so intentionally due to an accidental error in design of a feature, then the report can focus on how to provide the same functionality without introducing a security vulnerability. This is neither of those cases. This is a feature whose core functionality, automatic download and execution of arbitrary code, cannot be introduced without causing a security vulnerability. This trade-off, in which marginal functionality is introduced by sacrificing any and all security, was a decision made at some point. > but would it have killed the person reporting it to have formulated it something like \"I appreciate the convenience of automatic downloads but I'd prefer to be able to opt-out because of [...]\". This phrasing is not equivalent. Stating \"I appreciate the convenience of automatic downloads\" does not seem accurate at all. Nowhere does the convenience show up as something that the reporter appreciates. Stating \"I'd prefer to be able to opt-out\" implies that an opt-out is sufficient. Avoiding a security vulnerability based on a per-user opt-out is something that should only be done for a hotfix until a better solution can be implemented. I could see the report being updated with a minimum list of design changes that would be necessary for the feature to be implemented in a safe manner: \"While locating and recommending a package to be downloaded is convenient, the download must only be performed when the user explicitly approves it, with the user informed of the recommended package, its version and checksum, and the download URL prior to any download. Anything less than that is a security vulnerability.\" However, I don't fault the report for not doing so, as a reporter may not be familiar with a project's design roadmap. Describing an existing feature's design as \"completely unacceptable\" is sufficient. reply timeon 10 hours agoparentprevEverything is now rage-bait.

    "originBody": "Marc's Other Blog About Me My name is Marc Brooker. I've been writing code, reading code, and living vicariously through computers for as long as I can remember. I like to build things that work. I also dabble in machining, welding, cooking and skiing. I'm currently an engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Seattle, where I work on databases, serverless, and serverless databases. Before that, I worked on EC2 and EBS. All opinions are my own. This is my less-technical blog on non-work topics. For my main blog, visit https://brooker.co.za/blog/. Links My Publications and Videos @marcbrooker on Mastodon @MarcJBrooker on Twitter Do skis get blunt? Of course they do. Last winter, I rode a ski lift alongside a guy who claimed to be a retired Olympic ski tuner. Ski tuning, he said, was all a scam. If you keep your skis dry between days out they’ll stay sharp for their entire lifetime. Don’t get him started on waxing. His specific claim was that skis get blunt from corrosion, and all you have to do is keep them dry. That didn’t seem right. In fact, it sounded like complete bullshit. Snow and ice are quite abrasive stuff, and even hard steel gets abraded after a while. It’s not unusual for a ski day to include 30km or more of sliding the edges on ice crystals, and so it’s hard to believe that abrasion doesn’t happen. Turns out it does. Because, luckily, I do keep my skis dry. And I own a very impressive inspection microscope (OK, it’s a $30 one off Amazon, but whatever). Here’s what one of my ski edges looks like after ~4 days since the last tuning: If that doesn’t make any sense to you, I don’t blame you. Here’s what you’re looking at: The ideal ski edge is a metal strip with a ~88° angle between the base and the sidewall of the ski. Here, you can see the base edge, and a “corner” on the edge. I’m not a metallurgist, but this sure looks like abrasion damage to me. Corrosion damage is more pitted, more rounded, and a lot more uneven. Further down the ski, thing get even worse. Here, the edge isn’t only rounded over, but small chunks of metal have ripped out to create tiny serrations in the edge. I suspect this effect is why blunt skis can feel “grabby” in some snow conditions. Luckily, fixing this kind of damage isn’t hard. I use a 3D printed jig with a 500 grit diamond stone. A couple of glides down the edge is enough to completely clear this up. This is what the edge looks like after basic tuning: Here, the “corner” has completely disappeared, and been replaced with a nice clean sharp angle. The serrations are gone, and the edge is clean. For me, a sharp ski is the difference between fun and terror on an icy day. But maybe I’m in the pocket of Big Ski Tuning. Knife sharpening nerds will notice that I’ve raised a significant burr here. I believe that race tuners will strop that burr off, but I’ve never noticed a difference (and, let’s be honest, the level of my skiing isn’t exactly “Olympic downhill”).

    "commentBody": "Do Skis Get Blunt? (brooker.co.za)218 points by luu 13 hours agohidepastfavorite161 comments oldandboring 5 hours agoFormer junior and Masters racer here. Glad to see there's some very qualified voices in these comments, including a few who are currently involved (as racing parents). I very much appreciate the level of technical detail and accuracy in those comments. I'll talk base bevels all day. Pretty much agree with everything those folks have written. Most definitely sharp edges, and your bevels, matter when you are really pushing it, especially if you are racing, and most especially if you are on extremely hard or even water-injected snow. Outside of that type of skiing, the ski tech on the lift was, I think, making a point that is true enough for most \"normie\" skiers, and inadvertently the blog author validated it with the microscope experiment. The short version is that once your edge angles are set, \"polishing\" them with a diamond stone should, generally, mostly, be all that is necessary to restore the edge shape after use. No filing should be necessary. If the edge get damaged with rocks or rust, this is no longer true. All caveats apply. The ski tech is just trying to say \"don't pay a shop to run your skis through the machine when all you need is to rub your edges with a diamond stone for a minute.\" Now, just how practical this is, again depends on who you are. You'd have to be: - A regular enough skier to own your own equipment - Good enough to benefit from a tuned edge - Technical and handy enough to buy a diamond stone and learn to use it - It has to not be impractical to go through this ritual after skiing (try doing this with two or three young, tired kids in tow) Anyway I just enjoyed having this be on the front page of HN today. I'm good at like 2 things and this is one of them. reply SkyPuncher 3 hours agoparentOne thing the conversation seems to be missing is rocks and handling. Rocks are mostly an off-piste issue, but I have seen it happen on piste. Especially early and last season when cover can be low. Will occasionally also happen near the lift when a spot gets warn low. When I get rock gashes, it's always easier to just send them to the shop's machine. Handling also introduces a fair amount of nicks. In theory, the edges should never meet at an awkward angle, but it happens. Skis slide around on the rack, skis flip out a position while carrying them, things shift in the car, etc, etc. reply oldandboring 2 hours agorootparentI addressed this when I wrote, > If the edge get damaged with rocks or rust, this is no longer true. reply stephencanon 4 hours agoparentprev> It has to not be impractical to go through this ritual after skiing (try doing this with two or three young, tired kids in tow) Anecdotally I do all the routine waxing and edge maintenance on my family's (wife and two kids) skis, and it's not that big a deal. Slightly less of a hassle than bringing gear to the shop to do it would be for me, and the kids enjoy hanging out with some hot cocoa and helping a bit. Once you have everything in your workspace set up right, it goes pretty fast. reply anytime5704 4 hours agorootparent> Once you have everything in your airspace set up… The great filter of self-maintaining ski equipment. I don’t have the space for a permanent setup and it’s just more convenient to drag the skis to the store once a year than buy the equipment, learn to use it, store it somewhere, remember where, etc. I imagine many others (most?) feel the same. reply burningChrome 1 hour agorootparent>> it’s just more convenient to drag the skis to the store once a year I agree. I've been skiing and snowboarding for over 30 years. I used to tune my skis and board religiously myself. Once I got married and had a few kids, it got cumbersome to tune my board, then two to three additional pairs of skis. Then I went back to just tuning mine and realized how much of a mess it makes and how time consuming it can be. When I was younger, I loved doing it because it was a sort of a 'zen' process for me to lose myself for an hour or so and the idea of tuning my board like a pro and having to live with the results, for better or worse I always thought was cool. The idea of telling people you knew how to do this and you were really good at it also was apart of the mystique of being able to do it. Now? I just take my stuff to a shop where I know the guys and they do a bang up job for me. Saves me the time and the people I ride with don't give a hoot whether I can tune my board, they just want to know if I can still ride those double black D's with them. reply cmrdporcupine 1 hour agorootparentThe funny thing is that I started tuning our own equipment because of the kids. It's just too much $$ to be getting all 4 sets (and multiple in my case because I have GAS) tuned regularly. It's too much $$ and hassle to be dragging them off to the shop all the time and then waiting to get them back. Plus, I have had to learn to mount my own bindings because I telemark, and the local shops around here won't touch it, warranty it, or do a decent job. That alone has made me \"fear\" ski tech a lot less. A lot of bullshit mystique set up by \"pro\" ski shops.... reply swader999 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, I only tune my U12 kids skis religiously. My own skis, wife's and my other retired ski racer kid get far less tuning attention. I'm at a resort that is mostly soft snow too. reply pmart123 2 hours agoparentprevI'm no expert in this, but I think one common misconception among regular skiers is that a ski tune is \"free\" rather than each ski only gets so many full tunes as it wears down the base and edges. Obviously, if you get a core shot or something like that, it becomes more necessary. I always understood waxing skis as more protective though? reply emgeee 1 hour agorootparentCould definitely be wrong but I always thought waxing was about reducing the friction between the ski and the snow by both creating a uniform surface and because the wax has a lower coefficient of friction than the plastic of the skis. edit: learned something new! reply jcgrillo 1 hour agorootparentA uniform surface is actually not ideal, as it causes a lot of suction between the base and the snow, that's why ski and snowboard bases have \"structure\" ground into them with a stone grinder--that's what getting a base grind does, it restores the base's structure. Hot waxing permeates the pores in the ptex with oils from the wax, but you really want to scrape and brush it all off--there shouldn't be any residual wax remaining after. reply thereisnospork 1 hour agorootparent>but you really want to scrape and brush it all off--there shouldn't be any residual wax remaining after. I for one have always been a proponent of the lazy-man approach of letting the mountain do the scraping. Avoids the messiest part of the job. Sure the first run or two will be a touch slower, but unless you are serious enough to have a dedicated pair of race skis to schlep to the start, you aren't going to have a pristine base anyway. reply jcgrillo 56 minutes agorootparentI used to just scrape (no brushing) and let the first few runs do the work but then at some point I started brushing and realized that it made a big difference. I think what was happening (could be checked with the author's microscope) was the snow was wearing off the wax on the lands of the base structure but the grooves still had at least some wax--so it was essentially forming a less sharply structured base. reply jcgrillo 4 hours agoparentprevAnother important tuning dimension is base structure. I never realized the impact of base structure until I got a GS board that had been ground with a very aggressive base. That thing absolutely flies on wet snow. reply abakker 4 hours agorootparentA fellow hardbooter? I feel like the base size on snowboards benefits even more from good tuning than a lot of narrow race skis. And, obviously, you only have 1 edge instead of two, so the load on the edge is bigger. apropos of this discussion, my main board probably never gets a serious tune now that I live in the rockies. back in VT, it was critical daily maintenance due to the amount of ice you actually encountered. reply jcgrillo 1 hour agorootparentYeah current setup is Tanker 201, Upz RC11s, and F2 race bindings. I also have an F2 GS board with these awesome big rubber riser plates and F2 bindings as well but I don't ride it very often as I can carve the Tanker much tighter and slower, which as you know is important on narrow, icy east coast trails reply swader999 4 hours agorootparentprevYes, structure adds more speed than wax does, especially on wet snow and in speed events. Wax makes the ski easier to turn though. reply jcgrillo 1 hour agorootparentThe most important thing with wax is to brush it all out of the base structure, otherwise you basically just have a flat wax base. I went years (maybe 10?) before I learned that scraping alone wasn't enough. I used to think brushing was like a small optimization that you'd only do if you're racing, but it actually makes a tremendous difference. reply swader999 5 hours agoparentprevNice clarification about the polishing once you have it setup. This is fairly quick to do too. reply oldandboring 5 hours agorootparentBelieve it or not, as a junior I had the hardest time believing this. We'd be down in the waxroom filing our edges to death every other day and it would feel like I couldn't get an edge otherwise. The idea that the edge could be \"polished\" back to sharpness was alien to me. That being said, on skinny skis in the 90s, it took a lot of work to set an edge and little kids were at a disadvantage. I was basically skidding around and the sharp edges were just keeping it at bay. reply swader999 4 hours agorootparentFor super G or WC downhill skis, they barely have enough edge. The techs at these levels probably don't file at all, maybe one time per pair. reply datavirtue 4 hours agoparentprevSame with cycling. When I lose enough weight and get so fast that I have to change my clothes to get faster, then I will clip in if I need to win a race. reply oldandboring 4 hours agorootparentInteresting read about the science of how body hair slows you down: https://nautil.us/winning-by-a-hair-341059/ reply gorbypark 12 hours agoprevIt totally depends on the type of skier and the type of skis you have. I worked in the ski industry and thus lived and worked in ski towns for 15 years. If you are a ski racer, tuning edges matter. If you aggressively ride groomers all day, then they will matter. Riding big fat powder skis everyday, inside and outside of the resort? More or less doesn't matter. Are you a park rat that only ever skis the park? Those folks will actually detune their edges on purpose. If you are a beginner / intermediate skier (someone who never to rarely carves a ski), edges on the blunter side of things can actually help you out. Sure, it's a bit more sketchy on ice, however just doing a \"slide turn\" is going to be much easier. It will take less force to make your skis point where you want them too, making you much more confident. It's one of the reasons they put beginners on smaller skis. Less edge = easier turning. I have skis that were kept dry and haven't been sharpened in years and ski perfectly fine and it's exactly how I want them. reply swader999 12 hours agoparentFor park or intermediate on ice, I would still give them a decent tune but use a one degree base bevel, that'll rarely hook but give a lot of confidence on ice. reply bamboozled 12 hours agoparentprev\"Riding big fat powder skis everyday, inside and outside of the resort? More or less doesn't matter.\" Until you stop off at the bar on a Sunny day and ride home on dusk once everything has frozen again, then you'd be like \"oh I wish I didn't tell everyone not to keep their edges in decent shape\", as you fly off the cliff edge. reply denhaus 10 hours agorootparentI laughed out loud at the “fly off a cliff edge” On the real however, getting down the mountain safely after dusk etc with dull vs. sharp edges will likely only affect intermediate skiers. Beginner skiers are going to crash no matter what they’re riding if on steep and icy terrain. Expert skiers know when and how to ride conservatively and can basically ride anything in any conditions “safely” (even if that means just sliding a firm patch rather than carving it), as long as they’re aware of the limitations of their gear. 90% of the year I ride pow skis in any conditions (including melt freeze etc) with super dull edges - it’s totally fine. The other 10% is just to have a little more fun on very firm days. Intermediates, on the other hand, will be overly aggressive beyond their capabilities. They’ll bounce their helmet off a melt-frozen knoll at first opportunity, similar to what you said! reply aeyes 11 hours agorootparentprevIt's easier on fat skis which haven't been waxed in a long time. They aren't as fast so I rarely have to really put them on the edge on ice. I do a slide turn while keeping as much contact with the surface as I can. That's also the biggest downside, you can't really rip it with fat skis. Not even if you go down dead straight. reply denhaus 10 hours agorootparentOn most firm conditions, I absolutely think you can rip it on fat skis with awful edges. Especially on groomers. I do it every year on 120mm waist skis. It is highly dependent on skill level. For an example, watch freestylers carve switch down some rock-solid melt frozen 45deg park feature on detuned $200 skis they picked up at a swap meet 8 years ago. The result is much more dependent on the rider, not the equipment. I’ve watched pro dudes rip harder than 99.999% of skiers on joke trash skis from the 90s (rusting, holes in the base, chunks missing from edges) and broken snowblades. On true ice, NO ONE is ripping it except racers or ex-racers with good equipment. reply swader999 11 hours agorootparentprevFat skis put a lot of torque on the knees on ice if they are properly tuned and your carving in a high G turn. It's the wrong tool for that job, best to just slide around and chill like you mentioned. reply fragmede 12 hours agorootparentprevYeah but the whole way down you're saying to yourself \"I shouldnta have that last drink\" because you coulda made it home in time, instead of blaming your tools, unless you're a bad craftsman. reply jtnielsen 11 hours agoparentprevI detuned my edges under the boot area when I was younger and only focused on park skiing. Catching an edge on a box or rail was a fear I had. Never tuned the edges on any of my twin tips. I did wax them though! reply swader999 11 hours agorootparentThere's times in a pipe where you'll want grip on the ice there. You'll use a one degree base bevel to prevent hooking. If you ride metal rails though, I give up trying to discuss tuning. reply jtnielsen 10 hours agorootparentYou are right! Pipe is a different discipline where you actually want an edge. reply cmrdporcupine 8 hours agoparentprevSki here in the northeast or midwest and on the ice we get? You're going to want sharp edges. reply ptero 5 hours agorootparentI ski mostly in the Northeast and my old, unsharpened skis work just fine for me. I don't ski double blacks now (for the knees that feel it much more than 30 years ago) but I am doing just fine on single blacks and below. Do I ever wish for a sharp edge when I occasionally end up on an icy plate scrubbed by snowboarders at the end of the day? Yes. But so rarely, that I never care enough to actually sharpen them. reply cmrdporcupine 4 hours agorootparentI started skiing before there were ever snowboarders, and let me tell you that slopes were just as scraped out then as now. Probably worse as groomers and snowmaking weren't as competent. reply SailToSki 5 hours agorootparentprevI grew up in Maine skiing at Sunday River but spent my entire childhood in the park never once cared about my edges. Had I been in the pipe, maybe a different story. reply cmrdporcupine 5 hours agorootparentEdges are not... what you want in the park. Hence Armada and others making literally edgeless skiers for park rats. Making your way down free ride or even groomed terrain at Tremblant or Whiteface etc after a typical northeastern rain->refreeze cycle... Nice sharp metal edges are a godsend. reply sgt 12 hours agoparentprevYeah, I grew up with skis, but I don't think I have ever heard of anyone sharpening the edges. Waxing the skis yes. reply rhcom2 11 hours agorootparentThis might be location dependent because in the Northeast US getting your edges sharpened almost every season isn't rare. reply AmVess 9 hours agorootparentI was a scrub level skier, and had mine sharpened a few times a season. Slopes varied between powder and crusty, wind blown snow. Hitting crusty snow at mach 17 on dull skis, and you'd end up doing a high performance uncontrolled flight into terrain routine. reply denhaus 10 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a racing thing, mostly. Most shops offer a basic service for a machine wax + edge sharpening so that’s when most people get it done (even if they don’t really know what they’re paying for) reply madaxe_again 11 hours agorootparentprevI grew up with skis too, and my dad and I would sharpen our GS skis together in the garage every Friday evening, for a weekend of racing. Used to finish them with a sealskin strop, literally as sharp as razors - for the first few runs. reply matsemann 11 hours agorootparentSame. Kind of a nice ritual and I look back at that time spent together fondly. I also feel a bit sorry(/grateful) for all the time my parents spent on this. Driving me ungodly early so I could get to a race a few towns over, and then waiting there all day for me and my team mates to do our thing and then drive us home. You really do notice the difference on well maintained edges. On groomed slopes I can ski anything, and it doesn't really matter. But I don't think most people realize how icy a race track can become. reply sgt 11 hours agorootparentThey got to spend time with you, which is its own reward. I only realized this now when I got a kid (he's 3). Never thought about it that way before. Do you have kids? reply matsemann 10 hours agorootparentYes, that is true. And no, no kids. But if I do, I'm thinking I'd like them to do something not as expensive and time consuming. But with my own 50 days skiing this winter, it might just end up being skiing anyways, heh. reply swader999 5 hours agorootparentSkiing is a great family sport. You get to build cameraderie together exploring a big mountain. It's quite an undertaking for a parent and yes, expensive. Most other sports, the parents are typically just watching. reply watwut 11 hours agorootparentprevThey do it in services centers for few bucks and in a few minutes. It actually does massive difference on icy slopes - it makes difference between being helpless and being able to control where you are going. reply skittlebrau 6 hours agorootparentprevTell me you don’t ski in New England without telling me you don’t ski in New England. reply buildsjets 4 hours agorootparentHah, as a child I fractured my skull on a 7'th grade school trip to Brodie Mountain. Maybe somewhere around 1988? A quick check on Google Maps will show that Brodie Mountain is only 2600 feet high and very near Albany NY, therefore is unlikely to produce good skiing conditions. It turns out that a 15 minute lesson from your math teacher is insufficient to develop the skills necessary to stop on a completely iced over intermediate trail, so I did the snowplow directly into a rack of ski equipment going 30mph or so and wrecked myself. reply jcgrillo 6 hours agorootparentprevI grew up in VT skiing and snowboarding 4 days/wk, edge tuning was a daily ritual and base prep was about once a week (although probably should have been twice) reply paddy_m 40 minutes agoprevI'm in a ski share house in the northeast. Last winter I organized a ski tuning clinic put on by the local ski shop that does race tunes. I thought that only the expert nerdy skiers in the house would be interested, but everyone was fascinated. Most of the attendees won't tune their own skis, but they will know what to look for in their skis, and when to take them in. Also, in the north east, tuned skis absolutely matter, whatever level you are. My wife has been learning to ski and had trouble with ice. So I put on her beginner skis, and said, ahh no wonder, went back and tuned them. Then I put her on my slalom skis because she didn't trust her skis to initiate a turn (slalom skis are famously quick to initiate), and she could turn them quickly. Then I tuned one edge of each slalom ski with a more aggressive tune, but she could swap back to regular if she wanted. Finally, she was skidding her turns too much, so I put her on my GS skis, which forced her to patiently start the turn then follow it through. She now has a good idea of when she's having trouble with the ski shape, the conditions or the ski tune after 35 total days of skiing. If you put a beginner or intermediate on race skis, make sure the tune is mellow enough. Slalom skis at 0.5 and 86, will hunt when not turning, and can grab an edge throwing you to the ground. At the steeper angles (86/87 vs 88/89) it is much harder to skid the ski for speed control. When you head out with a beginner, you can always bring a diamond stone and detune the tip/tail, on the mountain even. They will notice the difference and appreciate it. reply swader999 13 hours agoprevI'm a ski race parent. I tune every couple of days on snow. My U12 boy skis on 0.5 degrees base bevel, three degrees side edge.

I really doubt the fine tuning of the edge matters that much. I don’t think there is any objective way to settle this debate. I think if you enjoy tuning skis, go for it. I like sharpening knives and tools so I get it. But I don’t bother with my skis. reply oldandboring 5 hours agorootparentRespectfully, this is incorrect. That would be like telling someone who games competitively that their GPU and CPU don't matter. Once you can tell, you can tell. If you gave a blind test, same exact skis but varied the tuning, most serious racers would be able to tell you what changed after a few turns. Edge or base bevel angles, wax, tuned or de-tuned. I haven't raced in years and I wager I would do pretty well on that test. reply swader999 12 hours agorootparentprevEdges matter a lot for racing and carving, impossible to learn and progress without tuned skis and propper angles. Like going to ice hockey practice with dull skates, it just doesn't work. Parents obsess over wax at this age but it actually only adds a bit of speed, but boots and edges are critical. reply xarope 11 hours agorootparentI was going to mention this too; I used to have my hockey skates sharpened regularly, but I don't recall ever needing ski edges sharpened. Waxed, yes. Sharpened, no. reply swader999 11 hours agorootparentHigher level ski racing uses water injection. They'll hook up the snow making water hoses to a bar that shoots water right into the snow. So it really becomes a 3D hockey rink. reply amluto 12 hours agorootparentprevIt sounds entirely straightforward to do a randomized, blinded test of freshly sharpened vs unsharpened skis. (Okay, the skier can feel the edge or look closely, but a cooperative skier could just not do that for the purpose of the experiment.) reply swader999 12 hours agorootparentYes! And coaches will typically pull the kids from training if they show up dull. They'll go in the race shack and tune their edges and visually improve to all after fixing them. reply strstr 11 hours agorootparentprevYou could also sharpen just one edge of each ski (opposite edges across the pair), then put the skis on random feet. Then see if they can tell which edges are sharp! Most of a typical skier’s weight is supported by the inside edge of the downhill ski while carving. Youth racers tend to ski with one set of edges on the inside for training, and the other edges inside for racing (under the theory that the inside edges take more of a beating. Who knows if that is accurate). If you ever see youth racers on slalom skis (which are chiral, since they have tips that deflect ski gates), you’ll often notice that the skis are on the “wrong” foot. reply oldandboring 5 hours agorootparentTrue enough at younger levels but as you move up in age and skill, the weight distribution between the downhill and uphill ski gets closer to 50/50. What you're saying has a kernel of truth and young skiers are still taught downhill ski as a fundamental but shaped skis have really changed the game on this. reply swader999 3 hours agorootparentNo, you never weight each ski evenly.

Note that when you race, you often do it on watered+salted hills where hundred people have followed the exact same track. Really icy. It also might be a thing we're you're just not good enough to notice. I don't mean that as a slight, but seriously changing the angle of the edge of a ski is basically like racing a completely different pair. The feel of how it engages can quickly become too aggressive or lax. reply strstr 12 hours agoparentprevDo you mean .5 or 5 for the base bevel? 5 is quite far off the snow. reply swader999 12 hours agorootparent0.5 for base bevel with three degrees for the side is very aggressive for his age but his cuff alignment is dialed and he can handle it. reply strstr 11 hours agorootparentThanks for the correction. I had just never heard of 5° degrees as a base bevel. Not sure why you seem defensive. Isn’t 0.5° (or lower) the factory tune for slalom skis? Might only be a thing for U16+. reply swader999 11 hours agorootparentAll good, I didn't type it correctly initially. A lot of coaches in the past have been critical of those angles he's been on so I was probably anticipating it lol. Most kids that age are likely 0.75 and two degrees for Sl.

I can’t imagine dealing with coaches. reply swader999 11 hours agorootparentYeah that is dialed like an F1 car and four degrees will shorten the life of the edge a bit. Some will do that much just under boot but go 3 at tip and tail. Another approach is to never debur and file every run.

If one skis less than that, it's possible to get away with every other season, but keep a gummy stone to deburr the edges as needed. If anyone has any methods to reliably grind edges at home, I'd be interested. I have one of the edge tools and a bunch of files, but I basically destroyed a pair of skis (thankfully an old crummy pair, put to new use as part of an adirondack chair built from my busted skis) when trying to get it right. Considering a local shop will do it for $40 / pair, that seems like a better use of my time. Still, I've got that DIY itch to scratch about this and haven't seemed to get it right. reply svl7 11 hours agoparentA local shop might as well make things worse if they do not care too much and give your skis the standard treatment (e.g. different angle than before). Once you have a good edge, it's kind of similar as keeping a knife sharpened. No need to really grind every time, a fine polishing after skiing for a day is more than sufficient and makes your edges last a long time. Been using tools from here for 10+ years, they also have informative instructions: https://www.tooltonic.com/ reply Kon-Peki 32 minutes agorootparent> kind of similar as keeping a knife sharpened. Professional chefs get their knives sharpened once or twice a year, depending on how often they use them. They hone their knives before every use. The honing rod that comes with your knife set is there to realign the steel molecules along the blade edge. Sharpening your knife removes metal and creates a new blade edge, which you have to hone frequently for it to stay as sharp as you want it. I wonder if the ski tech person was using terminology correctly but the skier/blogger didn't quite understand. reply matsemann 11 hours agoparentprevNot sure how you managed to destroy a pair of skis? It's mainly just to clamp the file onto a metal piece with the correct angle and grind away. Normally I put pen marks every few cms on the edge before I begin, then all those should disappear and I know I've grinded about the same all places. Or with a tool like Swix TA3008 it's hard to do wrong.

Up to that point, I had rarely been disappointed by them releasing too easily, and always relieved when they did release. Make sure that they use one of your boots for the test. reply swader999 11 hours agoparentTwenty days is still pretty serious, $1500 for a pass or $150 for a day ticket, gas, gear etc. So pay for at least one tune per year, maybe even three if you ski groomers with groomer type skis a lot. An effective way to test your bindings - put your skis on at a flat area and with boots done up, dig your edge in and try to twist your boot out of the ski binding with your own muscular power.

However, I would imagine corrosion makes much of the surface of the ski more abrasive and that could explain the grabbiness. Is there any science behind the edge assertions? almost all of it is anecdotal. I can't help but think of overengineering and a/v systems. For example, I can't tell any difference from different speaker wires (except bad cables), but I do notice hiss in amplifiers. And I think OLED might be superior, but honestly dark scenes are horrible during daylight hours unless you have blackout curtains in the room with the panel. No review or marketing ever talks about these practical details. Same with reflections with glossy screens. reply swader999 12 hours agoparentYou will see rust on your edges if you leave them wet and don't wipe them off. It can be removed with a soft gummy stone. A thick layer of wax left on the skis and edges keeps them rust free over the summer. Typically done for race skis or higher end skis. I don't worry about corrosion much, but I'm tuning the skis I use on ice every couple of days. My powder skis get waxed every few days, edges only to set up the angles once. Maybe once a season after that or to fix as best I can when hitting rocks. reply jajko 12 hours agorootparentEdges makes bigger difference in ski touring or more appropriately ski alpinism. Meaning tricky steep slopes where you sometimes switch skis for crampons and ice axe and put them on backpack, wildly varying conditions on the slopes. Or using ski crampons when its less extreme. There, any advantage is very important, ie how precisely you put skins on skis to leave that little bit of edge for... edging, at least thats what we call it. I don't think it makes a massive difference there how sharp your edges are, but in steep icy/crusty slopes where your skis don't even leave a mark as you pass, only crampons a bit, everything helping is more than welcome. I never clean them thoroughly though so edges are rusty, 10-15 years of moderate use of skis makes no difference to me. Also, in usual piste skiing in resorts, if you go really fast, at least relative to rest of skiers, and slope is a bit icy, sharp edges make a lot of difference in how stable skis are in turns. There even I can feel difference between dulled and sharpened ones. reply JumpCrisscross 7 hours agorootparent> Edges makes bigger difference in ski touring or more appropriately ski alpinism East Coast?

I kinda suspect this alleged olympic tuner didn’t cross compare, or just doesn’t ski in ways where you’d notice (he might just like skid turns through packed powder). Or he just uses backcountry noodles on groomed snow, and can’t tell since he’s using skis that won’t let him. Going from dull edges (even “well maintained” ones) to freshly sharpened is quite noticeable on icy days. I use 0°/4° and like the responsiveness and grip. From my long past race days (when I had to maintain several pairs simultaneously), I could tell that the wax design temp mattered deeply, though mostly >25f vs lower temp. High temp waxes are down right sticky in cold snow (and vice versa). But cold waxes are largely fine for middle temps (~10-20f or whatever). The (horrifying) fluoro stuff was also very effective, though probably banned by now if anyone is sane. I wasn’t able to tell the difference beyond the temp though, unless the skis were damaged. Though, I mostly just don’t wax these days since I’m not trying to eek out extra speed. Base bevel (the angle trimmed off the metal edge from the side that sits on the snow) matters and is largely ignored by skiers/snowboarders, since tuners are cautious, and skiers don’t know to ask. It determines how responsive the skis are (going from 0° to 1° means you need to tilt your leg an extra degree). You can only decrease it (or clean it up) by flattening the entire base and then sharpening, which requires specialized equipment. Edge bevel matters, but allegedly has diminishing returns. It (allegedly) gives a bit of extra grippyness. I’ve never quite understood why it matters, since it seems like it just narrows the metal very slightly. From my A/B testing, the freshness of the sharpening seems to matter more than the edge angle, but I’ve also never set it below 2°. reply jcgrillo 6 hours agoparentSwitching to more aggressive edge angles (1° base, 3° side from 0° base, 1° side) on my snowboard made a huge difference. I can lock in a carved turn much easier on ice and don't catch my tails or any other sketchiness in slow floating transitions across the board. I think most of the improvement is attributable to base bevel, and I agree with your assessment that freshness of sharpening is important. I hit my edges with a fine grit stone and a gummy stone every morning before heading out, and by afternoon they're noticeably more dull and hold less well. One test you can do to measure this is to drag the top of your fingernail across the edge in a perpendicular manner. If the edge is sharp it'll shave a little ribbon of fingernail off, if it isn't it won't. I only ever use a file to change angles or if I need to take a bunch of material off to fix a large rock gouge (like something that would require also ptex repair).

Having used those rentals in icy conditions, I've had a lousy time due to their shoddy edges. A tool like this would make my day(s) on the slopes so much better. Anybody know of a place I could buy something like this, so that I could bring the rentals into \"serviceable\" condition? reply huskdigselv 3 hours agoparentA rental should be able to sharpen them if you address it. (And at least here in Europe all rentals sharpen their skis frequently enough). A good tester is to see if the skis edge grips the surface of your finger nail, the same way you would test a knife or a sharp tool (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHEuV2CPE3w). If it slides across it with no friction, then it's a blunt ski. Personally, I would advice against trying to tune skis manually, because you might just as easily blunt the edge as you might sharpen it if you don't have a good jig and tools. Through my 12 years of teaching skiing, I will say that more often than not people who complain about icy conditions are held back by their technique; are you skid steering or carving, because when you are skid steering no level of ski tuning can make your edges stay on hard snow. (Tip: This guy has made an incredible amount of videos about the topic and has even himself progressed from being a skid steering freestyle skier to now being an excellent carver. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwWFlltWQTU). reply baggachipz 1 hour agorootparentA fair point; my technique is... slightly less than stellar.

All snow has some level of particulates, especially older snow (moreso if there has been melting, because the particles/dirt/whatever concentrate on top). 2.

Snow and Ice aren't the only things you ski over as there is a ton of dirt and other debris mixed in. Sometimes you get rocks and pebbles near trail edges. Heck, spring skiing will put you on trails with thin snow cover in addition to patches of grass and dirt that will destroy your skis (fun fact: hitting grass at speed is NOT fun - instant stop.) My father was also of the opinion that wax was a scam as he stated it would likely wear off in the first few runs. The idea was it filled in the scratches on the ski bottoms leaving a flatter surface. Maybe it works. maybe it doesn't. I always enjoyed watching the guys in the ski shops apply it by taking a slice of wax and then using a clothes iron, melt it like a pat of butter along the bottom. reply swader999 3 hours agoparentWe could talk for pages about wax. Your father is partly right, it does wear off quickly, especially if you apply it correctly. I'd say wax is important in that it prevents the base from oxidizing. A dried out base is more difficult to turn and slower. Structure (small grooves in the base) will make you a second faster) Wearing a race suit vs a normal tight coat will make you two seconds faster. Proper setup edges vs no tune rounded edges will make you 5-6 seconds faster and with much lower chances of dsq. The type of wax is much less important.

Do you ski much on ice? reply creato 12 hours agorootparentI’ve certainly skied ice and all kinds of crust. In my experience true ice isn’t that bad in terms of grip, it’s rarely so smooth that edges can’t easily grip on surface imperfections. It’s not fun to ski because it’s very high impact. I think what most people talk about as icy and slippery that seems to form on skied off groomers is actually some kind of crust that is hard to get edge hold in because the snow is somehow very firm but not well bonded to itself either, so what little edge penetration you get just scrapes off easily and doesn’t support the ski. When I try to picture what is going on in such snow, edge sharpness doesn’t matter, you might penetrate marginally deeper but that just means you’re scraping marginally more snow off. reply AtlasBarfed 54 minutes agorootparentYeah the East Coast is often nothing but the base ice pack with some snow on top to make it more slippery. reply huskdigselv 4 hours agoparentprevI have been an Austrian trained ski instructor since 2012 and I can tell you that a sharp ski is essential if you want to have carve in any conditions below where the snow isn't slushing or soft. I.e. any run that is either early day, windblown, mid-season (generally colder) or shadow side. HOWEVER 99% of the skiers on a mountain (and yes I mean 99%) do not actually ski on their edges, they do skidded turns (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4hioJ4ThJA). And the same 99% will typically just slide off of hard and icy parts of a slope as they aren't comfortably riding their edge. To these people sharp edges matter, but less than to the few who successfully carve. But if you are within that 1% of skiers that do ski mostly on the edge, then a sharp edge is extremely important; you see true carving technique is a delicate skill: In order to carve properly you need to need to get your skis in a steep angle with the snow, which means you need to get your feet in a steep angle, which can only be maintained if you move your center of gravity into a position that isn't above your feet. Which effectively means your body is in a position that is out of balance. Similarly to how sprinting essentially is just leaning forwards and playing \"catch up\" with our legs, carving technique tries to do the same. Exception being that we use the rhythmical centripetal forces of turns and the resistance of the snow to create the balancing force (https://d3t7modobimpp4.cloudfront.net/uploads/_1200xAUTO_fit...). And this is why edges matter; because if the centripetal force provided from the carving turn isn't generated because the skis blunt edges cause them to slip, then instead of generating movement towards the skiers body (reestablishing balance), the skis will drift away from the skiers body (removing balance) resulting in poor turns if not slipping down onto ones hip. TL;DR: Very good skiers NEED sharp edges to ski well. Most skiers will be fine. (As a matter of fact I think 99% of all skiers will do just fine on ANY ski, and make more significant improvement from 2 days of ski school than any equipment upgrade or tuning that money can buy). reply trompetenaccoun 2 hours agorootparent>and yes I mean 99% In which country? I thought carving was relatively popular with locals in the Alps (Switzerland, Austria, etc). At least it looks like that's what they're doing to me, but maybe they still do it wrong. reply swader999 3 hours agorootparentprevI aggre with this and boots are 90 percent the secret to progress. You could teach a beginner how to carve on a very flat slope though. The 99 percent that slide are just on too steep of a slope for their carving ability. Which is fine by the way. It's fun to go down steeper runs, even if you arent carving. reply ReleaseCandidat 13 hours agoparentprev> does it get blunt enough to affect performance Edges matter on ice.

Well fitted ski boots are more critical though. reply jcgrillo 5 hours agorootparentprevI do edges every day (usually just a few passes with a fine stone and a light deburring with gummy stone), base wax as required by the conditions. reply swader999 4 hours agorootparentYes, this kind of maintenance is quick to do and a best practice once you've setup the angles.

Carving skis simply weren’t available, at least not at my beginning level reply matsemann 7 hours agorootparentAnd if you sharpened your edges on straight skis, you would often intentionally blunt the front and back and only keep it sharp around the foot/middle, in order to have grip when going diagonally but have it easy to twist around turns. reply oldandboring 4 hours agorootparentEverything old is new again.

Definitely a project to keep an eye on :-) I love the approach of having it show you the code (and diff) and control on writing it back. This seems like it may be very useful! As an AOLPress user back in the day, it's both really surprising that in 2024 we don't have more WYSIWIYG tools, but also understandable because of how hard it is to design one. Most tools end up trying to find a sweet spot between targeting a developer and targeting a designer, and as a result end up doing neither well. There's also the problem of what kind of code it generates, and how to generate good/maintainable code that doesn't tie you to the WYSIWYG tool for the rest of its life. I haven't had a chance to try this yet (though I plan to) so I'm not certain where it falls on each of these, but from the video I get the impression that you are well aware of these challenges. Thanks for sharing, and thanks for making open source! Edit: Adding a couple of question: 1. Are you planning to monetize? If so, what are some of your ideas? 2. What is the grand scope for Studio? It sounds like the immediate focus is on editing styles. Are you planning to keep the scope limited to that, or would this eventually become an everything-you-need-for-building-a-website type of tool? reply hoakiet98 2 hours agoparent> 1. Are you planning to monetize? If so, what are some of your ideas? Yes, though my plan is not concrete, yet. I plan to offer a hosted version for teams with fewer technical members to be able to contribute the same way a front-end engineer would without self-hosting. This involves potentially hosting their app along-side the editor and creating friendlier abstractions on top of the git process such as creating branches, PR's, etc. Secondarily, I want to explore collaboration as a feature. The overall theme is to bring less-technical folks into the front-end. > 2. What is the grand scope for Studio? Short-term, I want styling to be very good. Then text content for copy-writing. Then structural changes such as reordering, inserting, and removing DOM elements. I want to keep it in the UI as much as possible since the surface area for logic is very large. I don't know if we can really be Webflow while letting users maintain full control of their code so if we have to compromise, I would lean more into giving control to the user instead of doing powerful features. Please let me know your thoughts on this plan, it is still in development :) reply freedomben 2 hours agorootparentNice, thank you! Yeah monetization is always tough, especially with something like this. My thoughts (were I in your position) would be to offer a full/unrestricted and open source single-player mode (open core model, with core licensed AGPLv3) that just modifies files on disk and is otherwise completely ignorant of git or anything else. Then for paid/hosted version, on top of it being hosted, you get full integration with github so PRs and diffs and things can be sent directly from the tool (which is great for designers). That also wouldn't require devs to do anything to buy in since the interface for them is just standard PR workflow. If it were me personally, I'd probably make the whole thing (\"enterprise\" features and all) open sourced under AGPLed with monetization being a hosted version available for paid stuff. Make sure you own the copyright so you can relicense in the future should that become necessary. I think you still get the vast majority of users that would be willing to pay that way, but you also get that crucial group of people who want the option of ejecting from you as a vendor should you go a directin they don't like (enshittification, etc). It's also IMHO a very ethical way to do business. Register trademarks on your app's name and stuff, and defend them proactively. Worst case scenario if someone forks and tries to compete with you, at that point you exercise that copyright to relicense the different parts to the \"open core\" model. It isn't likely to ever be an issue, but if it did you have a move. For targeting devs vs designers, IIWM I'd probably make the UI modal. I.e. design mode vs developer mode. Design mode can cater to designers, dev mode to devs. That way you can make UX decisions for one group that would irk the other group. reply hoakiet98 4 hours agoparentprev> Most tools end up trying to find a sweet spot between targeting a developer and targeting a designer, and as a result end up doing neither well. Emphasizing this because this happened to us. The initial version was trying to cater to designers and it was very hard for them to get value out of the to-code part because they need to convince the engineer to set up the codebase. Then when we add more support for engineers, it alienates the designer. > generate good/maintainable code that doesn't tie you to the WYSIWYG tool for the rest of its life Personally, this keeps me off most WYSIWYG. We don't have a great answer to this yet besides having a very narrow scope that works for our internal setup without polluting the code. reply rsp1984 4 hours agoprevThis looks pretty awesome but, speaking only for myself here, the thing I actually want is just Webflow but without the BS and predatory pricing. A visual editor that produces plain old HTML, CSS, JS and that anyone in our company can use to make changes to pages or create new ones. That's it. I don't think it exists (if so, pointers would be very welcome!), so here's my comment to incentivize someone to build it. reply freedomben 4 hours agoparentI agree. What I personally would love is a WYSIWYG front end to a static site generator that uses eex or erb. If the tool is sufficiently open source and works well with some hand tweaking of generated HTML, then eex/erb isn't strictly necessary. I'm optimistic about this though, because my suspicion is that since this tool just exports React, you could relatively easily achieve this using Next.js SSG building. As long as you aren't doing any build time or runtime dynamic data loading, by adding one more step you can use this for that, with the bonus that if complexity goes up to the point where you would want to componentize, your tool is ready for that. reply rchaud 3 hours agorootparentPinegrow Web Editor and Bootstrap Studio could fit the bill. No subscription, no cloud, one-time purchase. Exported HTML is fully readable and editable outside the app. reply hoakiet98 3 hours agorootparentprev> because my suspicion is that since this tool just exports React, you could relatively easily achieve this using Next.js SSG building At the core, we generate pure HTML and CSS, then serialize those into React and Tailwind.

This is a good suggestion. My plan is: 1. We start with packaging the Electron app as a downloadable. You'll still have to run your localhost app with it. 2. Then we'll add some UI support for cloning and running your project directly from the app. 3.

It was initially a Chrome extension [1] but there were limitations with local file access and UX from jumping around to multiple pages. Very early on I developed this as a web app but it was also difficult to inject styles into iframe, especially for ones that we didn't own directly. Electron ships Chromium by default so it was easy to leverage into an editable browser plus allowing us to do an infinite canvas style editor.

What does `UX from jumping around to multiple pages` mean? reply freedomben 4 hours agoparentprevHaving it edit local files might be a difficulty of having it work in a browser instead of electron app. That said though, Electron apps I've worked with in the past usually have a \"dev\" mode already that just serves locally and you hit it with your browser (i.e npm run dev), and that browser allows using the APIs normally not allowed so long as it's being served from localhost. Might be a good solution. reply hoakiet98 3 hours agorootparent> that just serves locally and you hit it with your browser This is an interesting take. My interpretation: You can host this on a server, then expose a port remotely which will have all the access of the electron app, making it a pseudo SAAS? I will need to test this out but this has some cool implications. The other worry is multiple client support but you can just provision a personal instance. reply freedomben 2 hours agorootparentDepending on which APIs you use, that could work. I tried it with Logseq because I really want to have my knowledge base on a VPS which I can access from anywhere via browser, and because of the APIs they use the browser will only allow it if the remote is localhost.

How are you solving for that? reply DrewADesign 4 hours agoparentWhile that might be true at the moment, this is a (well designed) electron instance (edit: exists? I only saw install instructions for NPM so maybe it just needs built executables? it says it uses electron) away from being a modern replacement for WYSIWYG editors like Dreamweaver. I could see an easy integration to push your page up to a CDN or GH Pages instance. Even without, there are tons of places for moderately technical people to host static websites, and “upload the code and pictures to a server in this folder” is within many more people’s technical grasp now than it was 20 years ago. Most people don’t need all of the scaffolding most modern dynamic websites have. Online SAAS WYSIWYG web authoring tools— wix, squarespace, Wordpress, et al— have been the only practical option for people without front-end dev skills; beyond that, you’re in SSG land which requires a big jump in knowledge for very little gain in utility until you really start getting some dev knowledge, and most people don’t want or need that knowledge. Being able to stand up a site and tweak the code here and there to do something a little different is a great spot to sit in. Hell it’s what got me started on web stuff with my geocities site nearly 30 years ago. I think this is a great example of why we need more product people involved with FOSS. Having worked in dev for quite some time before I got into design, I’ve experienced the blind spots inherent to having a purely technical focus. From the dev perspective, user needs often seem straightforward or even intuitive, but that’s heavily skewed by a completely different approach to using and reasoning about software than end users have. Developers are often pessimistic about users that seemingly always fail to grasp something they consider trivial, but developers rarely have to confront the actual complexity of other people’s jobs. Lots of people are smart and can solve problems, even if they don't have a formidable mental model of software development. Tweaking basic HTML/CSS generated by something else is well within their problem-solving capability and doesn’t require much technical know-how. reply hoakiet98 3 hours agorootparent> I only saw install instructions for NPM so maybe it just needs built executables Sorry for the confusion, this is an Electron app. I just didn't ship an executable with it at the moment. > I could see an easy integration to push your page up to a CDN or GH Pages instance. That is certainly in the cards. Though, in my opinion, it becomes more useful to edit complex web application since there are many tools supporting static sites but not many for production web apps. > user needs often seem straightforward or even intuitive, but that’s heavily skewed by a completely different approach to using and reasoning about software than end users have I am guilty of this. My long-long term hope is to be able to collaborate better with my product folks where they are able to enact their own intuition in the product instead of having to go through me for every change needed. While this is easy for a marketing page, it's much more difficult to do in a complex application context. reply DrewADesign 11 minutes agorootparentI'm in a rather odd demographic: I've got about a decade of experience as a developer (as a paid full-time dev working on some FOSS projects) but recently switched careers to design. The design and dev mindsets are definitely different. I obviously prefer tweaking things in code, but designing a layout is fundamentally a visual communication task, so working visually is preferable. I've just started working on a new portfolio site and was wondering if I could skip the Figma/whatever wireframe phase and just use a local WYSIWYG tool for a static page. > there are many tools supporting static sites but not many for production web apps. The funny thing is that the only true WYSIWYG tool I can find that isn't part of a paid SaaS ecosystem or complete inflexible garbage is Adobe Dreamweaver, which has been dying a slow death for decades. It has a few positive traits-- it makes responsive designs, works with bootstrap 4 and a few CSS libraries which make relatively clean code rather than spinning up the inscrutable spaghetti monsters it did in the aughts, and has a really solid built-in code editor (which I assume is Brackets on the back end) but there are bits of primary functionality that have just been broken for years and clearly not on the docket for an update. I looked at it for a few hours last week and decided it probably wasn't long for this world. Of course you can't spit without hitting an SSG with hot reloading and in-editor previews are de rigueur, but none of those offer a visual-first workflow for page design, which is what a professional designer really needs. You can have document-style WYSIWYG editing a la TinyMCE, but if you want to put together the structure of a page from the ground up, you're still context switching between an editor and a browser window which is an ineffective way for designers to work, even if they have the knowhow. > While this is easy for a marketing page, it's much more difficult to do in a complex application context. Sure, and this would have saved me some time in the various complex web apps I've made. But for the simpler use cases like my portfolio page, unless you're going to use Squarespace, Wix, Artstation, Webflow, etc etc etc and buy into their ecosystem, there really is no option for people that need reasonable control over the site's design without a code-first approach. Aside from Dreamweaver, I think the only one I could actually locate and install was part of Sea Monkey, and it seems to be an... uh... let's say under-loved part of an already under-loved suite of tools. reply hoakiet98 5 hours agoparentprevThis is very astute. We went too far in the non-technical route the first time. It was unrealistic to expect a non-technical person to clone or run code locally so it was hard to get to the value point for them. Hence, we're focusing on this being more efficient for the engineer. We're limiting to just injecting clean styling for now which is where I personally spend too much time with UIs. The initial goal is to shorten the loop between code, save, check the browser, adjust code, repeat... and just give engineers the ability to edit the page directly like you would a Figma prototype. reply toddmorey 5 hours agoparentprevThis... isn't that. Changes made in the visual editor are translated into code and submitted to your project as a GH pull request for review.

Even being pretty savvy with this stuff, I thought this was an open-sourced webflow when I skimmed it and I assure you, if they even vaguely consider this a future threat to any of their business at all, their counsel will use it as a legal cudgel to bludgeon you. reply lukan 4 hours agorootparent [–] I agree \"the power of webflow\" implies a connection. \"inspired by webflow\" would be probably better, but even there I am not sure if it is safe enough. reply DrewADesign 4 hours agorootparent [–] Absolutely. If I came out with a project that said \"Get the power of Oracle with a simple javascript API\" people would think I had a new Oracle API for javascript, not that I had a JS-friendly database I thought was as good as Oracle. But before I even mentioned webflow at all, I'd first want to make sure they didn't have any related patents I'd be bumping up against without being able to clearly show prior art. Only after that might I consider saying \"webflow-style workflow\" or something along those lines. It's sad, but you have to assume their lawyers will use every legal tool at their disposal to protect their client's bottom line whether its reasonable or not. reply hoakiet98 3 hours agorootparent [–] Point taken, we'd do better without the headache for now until further legal counseling.

    "originBody": "Noam Zeise Best Latest Archive About GitHub Itch A Mini Monitor for a Pi 05 Jul 2024 This post outlines how I used a small 2 inch display as a monitor for my pi. Where it can display tty terminals and X desktops and applications as if it was a normal screen connected over hdmi. My overall goal is to have a sort of handheld “console” that I can connect a keyboard to and use as a normal computer. This post implements the display functionality needed to fulfill part of the goal. I lay out the steps needed for interacting with the display over spi and the issues I encountered trying to use it like a monitor. The end result is a system service that runs on startup, consuming 2.5 mb of ram and ~2% of the CPU. It also respects the X display power management system (dpms) to save on battery life by going to sleep and turning the backlight off. an x screensaver code editing web browsing using the terminal Source code for the display mirroring program. Below I outline the journey of how I created the mirroring program. At the end I also include instructions so you can set up your hardware in the same way. Hardware I have a 2 inch 240x320 ips tft display sold by adafruit, driven by an ST7789 controller by Sitronix. It cost around £20 when I bought it. The info on how to interact with the display with commands and data, is in the display datasheet. Which was my source of information for writing the code which interacts with the display. Adafruit also has some docs, but they are unspecific and don’t say very much. For a computer, I’m using a Raspberry pi zero 2 w. It costs around £15. This has the same processor as the pi 3, but only 500mb of ram. The software/setup should work with any pi. None of the pins came with headers presoldered for the pi and the display, so to make it easier to wire and prototype I recommend soldering on headers and using dupont wires for connecting the circuit together. Wiring I wired the display with 8 wires, we have two wires for power, three for spi, and three for the data/command, backlight, and reset. Spi uses one pin for chip select, which tells the device when to listen to the data and clock lines (This allows multiple devices to share the same spi wires). It uses one pin for a clock, which synchronises communication, and two pins for back and forth communication (MOSI/MISO). It seems the adafruit display only uses the MISO pin for reading from the sd card on the board. This means none of the ST7789 read commands can be used, but it means we have one less wire to worry about. The data/command wire is used in conjunction with spi to tell the display if the data being send is a command (low) or the data (high) associated with it. There is a reset pin, that completely hardware resets the display. This is optional, as there is also a software reset command. Finally there is the backlight pin, which determines the brightness of the display. The backlight is either on (high) or off (low). Brightness levels can be controlled using pulse width modulation (pwm). This means the backlight is rapidly turned on and off to simulate different brightness levels. This is supported by the pi hardware. Communicating With the Display The display has a list of commands that it accepts, and arguments that can be passed with those commands. Each command is a byte. Some commands take any number of arguments. To communicate with the display the data/command pin is pulled low, a bytes is sent for the command, then the data/command pin is pulled high and the argument data is sent. For example the command to set the column address takes 5 bytes. Where the command has a hex value of 2A, and the start and end address are two bytes each. Before drawing can commence, the display needs to be taken out of sleep mode; display mode must be enabled; and the column and row addresses must be set. Finally a draw command followed by the colour data will make colour appear on the display. I experimented a while trying to get the monitor to show something. After some tinkering, I could address specific sections of the display properly. The way display can be addressed can be modified with commands. How an image is show can be mirrored and flipped and rotated along any direction. The format of the colour data sent to the display can also be modified, such as the data’s endianness and colour order, as well as the colour depth. The display supports 12, 16 and 18 bit colour data. pixel sizer-g-b bits ----------------------- 12 bits4-4-4 16 bits5-6-5 18 bits8-8-8 Where 18 bit only uses the first 6 bits of each byte. Display C Api I bundled up the code for interacting with the monitor into a c api so that I could more easily write programs that used the display and encapsulates it’s state into a nice wrapper with some sanity checks. One thing the library does is to break into chunks the data sent to the display. The spi device has a max buffer of 65536 bytes (default is 4096), so any writes to the buffer greater than that are quietly discarded. The screen is 320x240, so a write the size of the whole screen would exceed the spi buffer size, therefore chunking the sent data is essential. This means the display api will work as expected without the user having to worry about the amount of data being sent. As an example, if you wanted to setup the display with 16 bit colour little endian; using the long side as the horizontal; and blank it with white, you would write. display_hardware_reset(); display_sleep(DISPLAY_DISABLE); display_set_colour_format( COLOUR_FORMAT_16_BIT); display_set_address_options( ADDRESS_FLIP_HORIZONTALADDRESS_HORIZONTAL_ORIENTATIONADDRESS_COLOUR_LITTLE_ENDIAN); // invert on gives 0xFFFF as white display_invert(DISPLAY_ENABLE); const int SIZE = 240*320*2; uint8_t colour_data[SIZE]; memset(colour_data, 0xFF, SIZE); display_set_draw_area_full(); display_draw(colour_data, SIZE, 0); display_on(DISPLAY_ENABLE); display_brightness(MAX_BRIGHTNESS/1.5); As setup is usually the same, this is equivalent to using the combined setup function. display_combined_setup( COLOUR_FORMAT_16_BIT, ADDRESS_FLIP_HORIZONTALADDRESS_HORIZONTAL_ORIENTATIONADDRESS_COLOUR_LITTLE_ENDIAN); display_draw(colour_data, SIZE, 0); display_brightness(MAX_BRIGHTNESS/1.5); Using the Display as a Monitor My goal is to be able to use the display as if it was a normal hdmi monitor. To do this we essentially force the pi to think it is outputting to a monitor with the same resolution as the tft display, then copy the framebuffer data over via spi. This allows us to use the gpu to render programs as normal without extra effort. I set up the memory addresses so that the framebuffer could be copied directly onto the display. I went with 16 bit colour as it the native format used by the framebuffer. It also uses 1.5 times fewer bytes than 18 bit without a big drop in quality. The display address mode was set so the rows and columns of the framebuffer data matched how the display interprets the pixel data. Terminal tty Display Reading from /dev/fb0 one can get the video output for the tty terminal. This is in the same 16-bit format as the display supports, so we can just mmap the buffer, and copy it to the display every frame if it is the correct resolution. To get the right display resolution, some more tweaks need to be made to the pi’s settings. By default the pi will only use the framebuffer when a monitor is plugged in. To get over this we set force hotplug to 1. We also set the resolution to 320x240 to match the tft. Then I made a loop which copies the framebuffer data to an array and sends it to the display. memcpy(screen_data, framebuffer_mmap, BUFF_SIZE); display_draw(screen_data, BUFF_SIZE, 0); It took a while to get the right colour format for the display, but after tweaking it and running it as a system service on startup I got the display to work for tty terminals. X11 Display Next I wanted to be able to use the display with a desktop environment. With X we can’t use the framebuffer directly, we must request an image of the display each frame with xlib, then copy it to the tft. Unfortunately X uses a different default resolution and bit depth when there is no monitor plugged in, so one needs to add a manual config to X11 that forces the correct settings. With everything set up correctly, here is a graphics demo running in X. Cursor X11 does not display the cursor on the image we grab, making a mouse unusable. To fix this I draw a simple pointer graphic on top of the image data where X11 says the mouse is. With that the code for mirroring the X display looks like: XImage *img = XGetImage(display, window, 0, 0, DISPLAY_HORIZONTAL, DISPLAY_VERTICAL, AllPlanes, ZPixmap); int x, y; get_mouse_pos(display, window, &x, &y); draw_mouse((uint8_t *)img->data, x, y); display_draw((uint8_t*)img->data, BUFF_SIZE, 0); XDestroyImage(img); In the real code the mouse is only drawn if it hasn’t been moved for a few seconds. Here’s what the mouse looks like: The Mirroring Program Using the previous code for mirroring the display, I wrote a program that runs as a system service and show the currently active display. It monitors whether the user is in a tty terminal, or in a desktop environment and switches rendering modes accordingly. The program spawns two threads. One thread (the renderer) either draws from the framebuffer or from X depending on which draw mode it is in. The other thread (the manager) is in charge of determining which mode to draw in and sleeps most of the time. If X is not open, it the manager tries to open it. If successful, it stores which tty X is using with the command: ps -e -o tty -o fnamegrep Xorg While X is open the manager thread monitors the active tty. /sys/class/tty/tty0/active If the active tty is the same as X started in, then we use the X11 screen drawing mode. Otherwise we use the framebuffer drawing mode. The manager also checks whether the X display power management system (dpms) has put the display to sleep. If it has, the render thread is in sleeping mode and sleeps until it is active again. While asleep the display is disabled and the backlight is turned off, so it consumes very little power. X errors When X encounters an error, it tends to crash the program. This is a nuisance for the mirroring program, as when X is exited, the program would crash, and the normal terminal would be unable to be seen. Luckily X allows us to register an error handler, unluckily X expects the handler to exit, and if it doesn’t, X will exit the program itself. To get around this, we have to resort to a bit of a hack. We stop the error handler from exiting by using longjmp to return to code that will handle x being closed. jmp_buf x_err_env; static int x_error_handler(Display *dpy) { longjmp(x_err_env, 1); // return 1 } Before we call our X functions for drawing the screen, we use setjmp to store in a global variable the current environment. setjmp returns with a 0 normally, but returns with a non-zero value if a longjmp jumped to it. So we use an if statement. If longjmp was called, we set all our X pointers to NULL and switch the draw mode to framebuffer. if(setjmp(x_err_env)) { active_mode = FRAMEBUFFER; display_ptr = NULL; } Then the manager thread can try to reconnect to X if it is still open. Setup Instructions The following are instructions to follow if you have the nessecary hardware and want to use the display mirroring program. Wiring For a guide of raspberry pi pins check out pinout.xyz I’m using spi0.0, and pwm0, as well as gpio 25 for data/command and gpio 24 for reset. Theses specifics can be changed in pi_wiring_consts.h. pidisplay -------------------------- 3v or 5vV in groundground 19 (spi0 mosi)MOSI 23 (spi0 SCLK)SCK 24 (spi0 ce0)CS 22 (gpio 25)D/C 32 (pwm0)backlight pwm 18 (gpio 24)Reset Here are photos of the default wiring setup. (optional) Increase spi buffer size (default is 4096) by adding the following to your boot/cmdline.txt into the single line of settings spidev.buffsiz=65536 reboot and check that buff size increased, cat /sys/module/spidev/parameters/bufsiz should give 65536. Alternatively change the DISPLAY_TRANSFER_BUFFER_SIZE in pi_wiring_consts.h to 4096 You’ll also need to install WiringPi for a nice wrapper around the pi’s hardware interfaces. Enable Spi Before we begin wiring anything, make sure you can connect to your pi from another computer via ssh. This will mean we can fiddle with the display output without relying on seeing the pi’s display directly. The display is controlled using serial peripheral interface (spi). On the pi spi drivers are not loaded by default, so we will need to change the settings. Spi can be enabled by using the raspi-config terminal tool. We can also change the settings directly in boot/config.txt. The following line must be added to that file: dtparam=spi=on Set Framebuffer Size In the pi config file /boot/config.txt I added the following. # force hdmi active hdmi_force_hotplug=1 # force DMT for hdmi (digital display mode) hdmi_group=2 # use a custom mode hdmi_mode=87 # custom mode # https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=24679 hdmi_cvt=320 240 60 1 0 0 0 Set X Display Size You’ll need to install two libraries: libx11-dev - for interfacing with X11 libxext-dev - for checking dpms to put the display to sleep To make X use the right display settings, add a manual config file at: /etc/X11/10-monitor.conf with the following contents: Section \"Screen\"Identifier \"tft\"Device \"card0\"DefaultDepth 16SubSection \"Display\" Modes \"320x240\"EndSubSection EndSection Install as system service Make sure you have gcc and make. Clone the git repo for the program and in the root directory of the repo run make CFLAGS=\"-O3 -DNDEBUG\" Store the display binary, found in build/, somewhere where it can be pointed to, eg. /home/me/scripts/display Now to add a systemd service, create the file /etc/systemd/system/tft-display.service with contents [Unit] Description=Tft Display [Service] Type=exec Environment=XAUTHORITY=/home/me/.Xauthority ExecStart=/home/me/scripts/display Restart=on-failure RestartSec=4 KillSignal=SIGINT [Install] Then do systemctl enable tft-display And it will run on start up every time the pi turns on.",

It will almost completely prevent cables disconnecting themselves from the pin header. Feel free to modify this as needed, e.g. by having a 6x1 connector on one side splitting into 4x1 and 2x1 on the other if that’s how the cables group. Or use a …x2 connector if the pin header has two rows like here.

Small displays complete with a case, that was also slim and of decent material, seemed incredibly elusive. I suppose the modern workflow is to 3d print one: but perhaps other consumers, like me, buying a $20 SBC and a $20 display have not outlayed for a 3d printer... Or purchase a 3d printed one to spec? Unfortunately I don't yet have the confidence in the quality of materials of a purchased 3d printed item, nor enough familiarity with the materials and process to choose from the many options online. They also did not seem particularly cheap. Most recently, I ended up finding a 2nd hand (refurbished) small tablet, and simply used that as the display for a small system. It pulls the display content over wifi and displays it in a browser, which is incredible overhead for such simple content. But it is slim, has a touch screen, comes complete in a case, and was cheaper than purchasing a similar waveshare or other unnamed-brand display with a matching case (where one could even be found!) reply abdullahkhalids 3 minutes agoparentYour local library might have a 3D printer - many do.

Sure, if I need something prototyped really rapidly then I'll print it at home. But if I want something done with exceptionally high quality, then for me its much easier to design the part, I use OpenSCAD, and then send the STL to one of the many 3D printing service providers to be printed.

There are many options for prebuilt enclosure/cases, so I’m sure you could find one with the right amount of space and size for this project. 3D printing will yield a more custom solution that fits exactly the size you need.

There were generic websites that seemed to be based overseas, but the options (and therefore my guess at quality) were behind a wall of lingo and technologies.

I have made a deal with myself that once I print things regularly enough, I can consider getting a printer of my own, but at the current clip of maybe one print a year, it doesn't make sense. I'd probably print more if I had the printer, but so far I haven't needed anything bad enough to warrant that, and have plenty of other projects in to which I can sink my money.

    "title": "Xpra: Persistent Remote Applications for X11",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra",
    "originBody": "About Installation Usage Documentation Help About Xpra is known as \"screen for X\" : its seamless mode allows you to run X11 programs, usually on a remote host, direct their display to your local machine, and then to disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or another machine(s), without losing any state. Effectively giving you remote access to individual graphical applications. It can also be used to access existing desktop sessions and start remote desktop sessions. Xpra is open-source (GPLv2+) with clients available for many supported platforms and the server includes a built-in HTML5 client. Xpra is usable over a wide variety of network protocols and does its best to adapt to any network conditions. Xpra forwards and synchronizes many extra desktop features which allows remote applications to integrate transparently into the client's desktop environment: audio input and output, printers, clipboard, system trays, notifications, webcams, etc It can also open documents and URLs remotely, display high bit depth content, and it will try honour the display's DPI. Here's what a seamless session with two windows (an xterm and glxspheres) looks like when attached from an MS Windows 11 desktop client: (the windows may look like native windows, but they are running on a remote Linux server) Installation Official stable downloads Microsoft Windows: EXE, ZIP, MSI MacOS x86_64 DMG / PKG, arm64 DMG / PKG Linux: RPM, DEB All the packages are signed. There are also beta builds available. For more information, see xpra downloads Build from source git clone https://github.com/Xpra-org/xpra; cd xpra python3 ./setup.py install For more details, see building from source. To contribute to the project, please try to use pull-requests and follow our code of conduct. Unit test status: Usage Initial requirements xpra must be installed on the client and the host. You can use the html5 client in which case xpra is only required on the host. Seamless Mode Run xterm on a remote host, display and iteract with it locally (from the client machine): xpra start ssh://USER@HOST/ --start=xterm # hint: xterm must be installed on the HOST. For more examples, see usage. Shadow View an existing desktop session running on a remote host: xpra shadow ssh://USER@HOST/ Network Access Xpra servers can support many different types of connections using a single TCP port: SSL, SSH, (secure) http / websockets, RFB, etc.. Connections can be secured using encryption and many authentication modules. Sessions can be automatically announced on LANs using multicast DNS so that clients can connect more easily using a GUI (ie: xpra mdns-gui). Its flexible proxy server can be used as a relay or front end for multiple server sessions. Documentation There is extensive documentation right here for the current development version. This documentation is also included with each release. For more generic version-agnostic information, checkout the wiki. Help Make sure to check the FAQ, your question may already be answered there. You can ask your questions on the github discussions, or on the IRC channel #xpra on libera.chat or using discord. If you have hit a bug (sorry about that!), please see reporting bugs.",

Easiest being winswitch (which is based on xpra). reply BLKNSLVR 7 hours agoprevI tried Xpra for remote applications some four to five years ago when I migrated from Windows to Linux and needed a Remote Desktop (type) alternative. I stuck with it for a while in advance of numerous other options, until I found NoMachine - which doesn't do remote applications but does do full remote desktop and has the closest 'feel' to being local-machine than anything other than Windows Remote Desktop. I (ironically?) dislike Microsoft just that little bit extra for making Remote Desktop so damn good whilst progressively destroying the Windows experience. I would like to try Xpra again, but I've got a growing list of \"I'd like to try that's\" that even the top priorities only get small bites taken out of them per week / month - and my current workflow is pretty good. reply dmd 4 hours agoparentNoMachine absolutely does do remote applications.

Not only does it work better, it has way more features. For example, you can browse the remote system's files and use a terminal without having to stream the graphical environment. It also has some Intel ME integration which I haven't really looked into. RustDesk is easier to get started with though, especially if you're coming from TeamViewer. However I've always been a little wary of RustDesk. The dev is (was? Haven't kept up) anonymous and seems to be some Chinese company.

That should be handled by the X clients and servers. I have used only 4k monitors for more than 10 years in Linux and the only applications with which I frequently had problems were various programs written in Java by morons, which were usually proprietary applications and some times quite expensive, but they lacked such elementary customization features like allowing the user to change the font, or at least its size, while failing to use the configuration settings of the graphic desktop, i.e. the value set for the monitor DPI, like all non-Java programs. reply simcop2387 3 hours agorootparentThe way Xpra works is that it's both a server and client in it's own right. So it needs to be aware for the final client involved to be able to learn about it from the other side of the chain, so it does need to be aware of it in order for applications to know that they need to adjust themselves. What this results in is that the client you're running through Xpra will just assume it's a normal 96 DPI display from yesteryear usually. I think you can do some stuff to tell Xpra that it should be a higher DPI but that'll also make it so that the application will be gigantic on a low dpi display, something that's pretty typical for X11 since it doesn't properly support mixed DPI environments (i.e. a laptop screen that's high dpi and an external monitor that is low dpi). reply ndiddy 2 hours agorootparentX11 supports mixed DPI with the RANDR extension. Applications can use the per-monitor information provided by RANDR to get the DPI information for each output, and use this to calculate font and widget sizes. Everything looks nice as long as you don't have a window spanning multiple screens. The problem is that while Qt has supported this functionality since 5.9, GTK seemingly has no interest in implementing it and most other toolkits or raw Xlib programs don't support it either. reply superkuh 4 hours agoparentprevSimilarly, the waylands still don't support screen readers for the differently abled, a technology invented longer ago. reply Filligree 7 hours agoprev [–] Okay, but X11 is deprecated.

It's split into modules now, but the xorg-server module last had a release in April, I think, with multiple contributors, and at least two people are issuing release announcements. Maybe I'll consider Wayland again in a few years (though, who knows, by then maybe I'll have fallen for the temptation to write my own X server too...), but for now, Xorg works, receiving fixes, and doesn't require me to change anything else in my workflow for no good reason. reply seba_dos1 6 hours agorootparent> It's still seeing regular releases.

Specifically, how -- again, in LINUX-LAND -- a whole bunch of people decided, \"nah, we're going to go ahead and break the HELL OUT OF backwards compatibility this time, even though we pretty much never do this.\" reply asveikau 5 hours agorootparentLinux actually does this a lot. Jwz called it \"Cascade of Attention-Deficit Teenagers\" more than 20 years ago, describing GNOME. Look at audio. PulseAudio is mostly pointless and over-engineered. Breaks a lot. You could say the same about ALSA even. FreeBSD meanwhile is still using the OSS API that Linux was on in the late 90s... reply rwmj 4 hours agorootparentPulseAudio has already been abandoned, the new thing is Pipewire. The specific issue with OSS was that it was never part of Linux and then with OSS 4 they made it proprietary, which killed it off entirely as far as Linux users are concerned. (FreeBSD cloned it instead.) reply asveikau 4 hours agorootparentOh yeah. I should have noticed that because on the Debian machine I set up for my daughter, audio suddenly broke, and it started working again when I removed pipewire. No joke, if you remove the new thing stuff magically starts working again. reply p_l 2 hours agorootparentin my experience, unlike pulseaudio, pipewire is way stabler and usually works fine with less involvement. ... except when you have accidentally ended up with half-pipewire, half-pulseaudio setup due to half-forgotten instructions that were no longer applicable. reply asveikau 41 minutes agorootparentMaybe my dist-upgrade got it into such a state. I'll try to check that out. reply nathanasmith 3 hours agorootparentprevI had to restart Pipewire just this morning when audio randomly stopped working. It's funny as this is the first time it happened then an hour later I'm reading in this thread about Pipewire acting funny on other people's computers. reply jrm4 4 hours agorootparentprevHa, I'm showing my age. You're right, my brain is still at \"Linux around the year 2000.\" That being said, it's still the same problem. And I think that's why I find it odd that I haven't heard the argument more plainly stated like: \"Oh look -- right around when Linux became mainstream, it began to get worse in precisely the same ways proprietary stuff was already bad. Probably a result of more business involvement, but how can we counter it.\" reply vundercind 3 hours agorootparentprevMy best guess is it was designed to make it a bad idea to run anything but Red Hat with Gnome if you need anything resembling stability. If it wasn’t designed for that on purpose, I’m pretty sure it’s at least why Red Hat ran so enthusiastically towards it. reply kmeisthax 53 minutes agorootparentprevThere's a few related answers to your question, so I'm going to meander a bit and hope you can follow along. First off, backwards compatibility wasn't actually broken. X11 apps work fine under Xwayland. All the weird bikeshedding that happens in Wayland isn't as important because we have working compatibility bridges and all the old stuff still works. Second, \"don't break userspace\" is specifically a Linux kernel policy. The only other organization in FOSS that has such a slavish devotion to backwards compatibility is WINE[0]. Desktop environments are perfectly fine with, at the very least, breaking ABIs, because you can just recompile the ocean. I suspect this is the Free Software equivalent of \"firing shots to keep the rent down\" - i.e. making the software neighborhood undesirable for proprietary software vendors who will have to deal with these annoying and arguably pointless transitions every couple of years. The reason why we needed to get off X11 is very simple: X11 is an extremely poor fit for modern hardware. The protocol supports simple drawing commands and image display, that's about it. Modern user interfaces want applications that draw onto GPU layers, composite them, and then present a final image to a compositor to be displayed to the screen. You almost can build that on X11 (modulo some frame tearing), but it's a pain in the ass and requires adopting a lot of extra protocols plus XGL which breaks network transparency[1]. The motto of X11 is \"mechanism, not policy\". The way this is accomplished is by presenting the entire desktop as a tree structure of windows that any client can mutate. Any widget toolkit can then build the experience it wants on top of that tree structure. The problem is that this also makes writing keyloggers and RATs trivial. X11 doesn't sandbox applications, so even if you lock down a process every other way, they can still do horrible things to other X clients and Xorg won't stop them. Wayland fixes this by tightly restricting what clients are allowed to do to the desktop. Applications get to present their own windows, sure, but they can't touch other windows unless a specific extension is provided for their use case and the compositor allows the application to use it. In other words, Wayland is \"policy, not mechanism\". The downside is that now we have to codify all the slightly-different ways each widget toolkit, window manager, and desktop environment has done things under X11. This has resulted in an explosion of extensions, many of which overlap because they were made by different DEs. Wayland can of course create standardized versions of these extensions, but each standardization is an opportunity for bikeshedding. This leads into my favorite way to tell if an application is Wayland or X11: launch Xeyes. If the eyes track your mouse over the application's windows, it's X11. Wayland doesn't have a protocol for mouse tracking, so Xwayland can't report where the mouse cursor is, unless it's on top of a Wayland window that it's already getting events for - namely, the app you're wondering about. Ok, I suppose that is a backwards compatibility break. [0] This also means the most stable UI toolkit on Linux is actually USER.dll. [1] In fact, I suspect this is why Wayland was so willing to casually toss that out. GPUs and network transparency are allergic to one another. reply drdaeman 12 minutes agorootparentI don't think that's the issue with Wayland. X11 has fundamental design flaws, Wayland happened because of it. I believe the question is why Wayland happened so badly. Sure, nVidia shenanigans are contributing to bad fame, but arguably that's not the issue with Wayland. However, Wayland fixes some of X11 design flaws but ignores others - or even introduces new ones. But, for example, HiDPI is a mess in X11 - for (I assume) pretty obvious reasons of not having HiDPI back in the day. Weirdly, Wayland does nothing to make things right - instead it just gives up on the DPI concept altogether as if physical dimensions simply aren't a thing[1]. While this sort of solves some of the issues X11 had (although, scaling works with X11 too), it's just wrong. Then there are a bunch of other controversial design decisions (like client-side decorations - as if consistency wasn't a problem already) that are more nuanced. ___ 1) Or so I believe - I could be wrong. I just wanted to configure DPI for my monitors hoping that it would help me to have things sized correctly, and have read somewhere that it's not a thing in Wayland and all they have is scale factors. reply uecker 9 minutes agorootparentprevThe story that X11 somehow forces programs to use outdated drawing primitives was never really true as a long as I can remember. Compositing on X11 exists. In principle, it is an extensible generic remote buffer management framework. As such, it could be extended indefinitely without every breaking backwards and forwards compatibility and is also a good fit for modern hardware that essentially deals with remote buffers on the GPU.

    "originBody": "Open this photo in gallery: Unit 2 at the Genesee Generating Station west of Edmonton went offline on June 16. It was the last remaining electricity-generation facility in Alberta to rely exclusively on coal.Capital Power Comments Share Bookmark At 10:57 p.m. on Sunday, June 16, Alberta’s last coal plant went offline. An official announcement shortly followed, quietly signalling the end of coal-fired electricity in Alberta. Many organizations contributed to this successful campaign through advocacy and research. The Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, the Lung Association and the Asthma Society of Canada were instrumental in highlighting the health impacts associated with air pollution from coal-fired electricity. The Pembina Institute, an Alberta-based clean-energy think tank, first intervened in a coal plant regulatory process in the late 1990s and, in 2009, published the first major proposal that showed the province could move to an unabated coal-free grid by 2030. Our research was ahead of its time and criticized as idealistic. Coal accounted for 80 per cent of Alberta’s electricity grid in the early 2000s and it still amounted to 60 per cent just 10 years ago. When phasing out coal was just an idea being batted around, many said it couldn’t be done. This is not dissimilar to the rhetoric today around decarbonizing the grid. But Alberta’s experience phasing out coal shows environmental progress of this magnitude is possible. In 2012, then-prime minister Stephen Harper mandated a nationwide phase-out of coal by 2061. A far-off target date that, nonetheless, provided certainty to the provinces and got the ball rolling. In Alberta, the Wildrose Party, then led by now United Conservative Party Premier Danielle Smith, included a coal phase-out commitment in its 2012 election platform. When the New Democratic Party came to power after the 2015 provincial election, they got to work delivering on a plan to accelerate the elimination of coal. This included strengthening Alberta’s industrial carbon pricing system, a commitment to 30-per-cent renewables by 2030 and a target date for phasing out coal by 2030 – a target built through consultation with experts and industry. The current federal government made a similar national commitment in 2016. At the time, there were concerns about the impact this would have on jobs. We learned that workers benefit from new investments in cleaner electricity – if included in strategic planning from the start. Federal and provincial programs to support workers during this transition were made available, while community economic diversification and growth in jobs in other sectors have helped to offset some of this change. Research also shows there are opportunities in clean energy, such as from increased land revenues and municipal taxes. Phasing out coal in Alberta was supported by good policy design driven by carbon pricing and regulations with clear targets that offered necessary certainty to the industry and stakeholders. Rapidly growing, low-cost renewable energy further supported the phase-out, along with companies investing in gas-fired electricity. All these actions accelerated the transition away from coal at a faster rate than anticipated. So, for the first time in 150 years, coal is no longer part of Alberta’s electricity mix. It is important to celebrate and reflect on these milestones, while recognizing there is no time to rest before redoubling our efforts and looking to what’s next. As Pembina Institute’s latest research shows, many countries are striving to be the first to decarbonize their electricity system and a decarbonized electricity system by 2035 is within reach in Canada. It would save households hundreds of dollars on their electricity bills, enhance the competitiveness of our industries, and attract more investments into Canada as industries all look to secure clean power. But, as with coal, powerful incumbents want to maintain the status quo. Neither Albertans nor our climate can afford to be locked in to burning greenhouse gas-emitting natural gas when we have better, lower-cost alternatives. Renewable energy is already the most cost-effective form of new electricity generation, and costs continue to drop. However, we still need to bring more wind and solar energy online, along with storage. Historically a leader in renewable energy, Alberta’s seven-month renewables moratorium, new restrictions unique to renewables, and a market restructuring have chilled project development. Restoring certainty should be a priority for the government. Alberta also already has enough existing and planned gas on its grid to meet its electricity needs. The future is abundant, affordable, zero-emissions electricity. But we also need to invest in updating our infrastructure to meet our modern-day needs. Alberta is behind on demand-side management measures – a tactic that has reduced energy demand by 15 per cent in Ontario. Canada is also behind on building interties between jurisdictions – an approach that supports resilient systems and allows us to benefit from our complementary strengths across the country in hydro and other renewables. We urgently need to continue to reduce emissions and we have the tools to achieve this. As the coal example shows, success takes time – sometimes over the course of decades – and relentless fact-based advocacy. Chris Severson-Baker is the executive director of the Pembina Institute.",

I guess given that those two countries are keeping Russia afloat by buying their oil it shouldn't be a surprise, but its still disappointing to see those countries choosing the path they did. reply matthewdgreen 39 minutes agoparent>India and China have said FU to the world and increased their coal usage. China is building an unbelievable amount of renewables and nuclear, more than the rest of the world combined. Like every other part of the world, they're backstopping these variable power sources with fossil generation -- mainly by building modern coal power plants that can be spun down when renewable generation is high. They've also developed a framework to pay coal plants not to generate. And of course they're leading the world on the deployment and pricing of battery storage, pumped hydro and HVDC grid upgrades. I'm posting this because your conclusion (\"China has said FU\" to the world) is almost the polar opposite of what's actually happening. If we survive the climate crisis, it's going to be because of what China is doing with renewable buildouts and manufacturing. reply NoLinkToMe 1 hour agoparentprevCanada emits more Co2 per capita than China today, by 1.5x. But Co2 doesn't only count in 'last years'. It counts as a cumulative effect. The Co2 damage of Canada per capita is way beyond that of China, cumulatively. In cumulative terms, China has emitted 'only' 7.5 times as much Canada despite having 35x the population. In other words, Canada's per capita cumulative emissions are about 4.5x those of China. And that's a lot. It means Canada has damaged way more, and should have a bigger burden to reduce future damage, or undo damage already done. Generally yes it's always frustrating to see any country keep emitting Co2. But Canada is a worse offender, both in the past, as well as now, and that's a pretty sad record for one of the richest countries in the world which also happens to be the country with probably the biggest per-capita natural renewable resources of all time. (land for wind and solar, as well as insane hydro). reply quacked 49 minutes agorootparentPlease cite the raw numbers you used to make your claims, and their sources. I don't doubt that on a per capita basis Canadians emit more than Chinese do; furthermore, China is the source of many of the goods that western nations consume, and so they're producing emissions \"for\" the western nations in a sort of de facto shell game. However, China has no interest in giving its manufacturing base \"back\" to the west, and does not take emissions reduction seriously. It is a deceptive claim that Canada is \"worse than China\"; China is out-emitting Canada, doesn't take emissions reduction seriously, and plans to continue to out-emit Canada into the future. reply akira2501 46 minutes agorootparent> and so they're producing emissions \"for\" the western nations in a sort of de facto shell game. Then the solution is to ban Chinese imports or tax them to a level that it's no longer economically viable to import them. Problem \"solved,\" right? reply quacked 38 minutes agorootparentI mean, it depends on what problem you're trying to solve. If you want to dramatically skyrocket the prices of consumer goods, reduce every American's individual buying power, tank the stock market, crater everyone's retirement accounts, and destabilize the current world economic order, then that would be a terrible move. I kind of want all that to happen, though, so I think it's a good move. I don't like living in a nation that is able to consume at a functionally unlimited level for very little national sacrifice or engagement in manufacturing and production. If manufacturing is inherently pollution-heavy, then it would be healthy for Americans, Canadians, etc. to actually bear the consequences of pollution in their own countries and then decide as nations whether or not to sustain the current levels of production, or curtail their consumption habits properly. reply threesevenths 37 minutes agorootparentprevI’m not sure you can say China’s total is 7.5x Canada’s total and say Canada has caused more damage. It might well be true that per capita is higher however you seem to be comparing apples to oranges here.

It would be much better if wealthy nations subsidized clean energy technology for developing countries so that they can leapfrog the fossil fuel stage. reply refurb 31 minutes agorootparentprevUnless you're not a big fan of productions - things like food, you can't compare CO2 emissions alone. It all comes down to cost-benefit. The goal is the maximum production per unit of CO2 - for every unit of CO2 you maximize what is produced from it. Yes, the US produces 13.49% of all global CO2, but it also produces 25.22% of all output. China produces 31% of all CO2 emissions, but only 17% of all production. reply jogjayr 1 hour agoparentprevAs an Indian immigrant to Canada, it is frustrating to see people believe it's a choice. I also hear a lot of hate for the carbon tax and rebate program in Canada. I support the program, even though it costs me money. > someone who lives in Canada and has spend so much money Which means Canada has money. India is much poorer on a per-capita basis. They can become wealthy by developing their economy. India can't spend as much per-capita on clean energy as Canada or any other wealthy nation. India has much more to lose from climate change compared to Canada. The heatwaves are already horrific, and many cities have water supply problems so drought due to climate change could spell disaster. The air quality in most Indian cities is terrible. No one is burning coal for fun. Gasoline is CA$1.81/l in Mumbai, in a country with a fraction of the per-capita income of Canada. Cars are much smaller on average and most people take public transport. The electricity grid isn't as reliable as Canada and of course most people don't live in houses. It's mostly apartments, often with no assigned parking. Despite that I saw many electric cars and scooters on my last trip, even in small towns. I don't know how they charge. But I began to question why the US or Canada can't build enough charging for apartment-dwellers. The \"choice\" India and China are making is no choice at all. They can either develop their economies or languish in poverty. Poverty means less food, less medical care, less education. It means lower life expectancy, higher infant and maternal mortality, an overall lower quality of life. Staying poor means when climate change gets worse, they'll have less money to mitigate it. If you want developing countries to decrease their carbon emissions, invest in cheaper clean energy. Support programs and policies that give developing countries subsidies on clean energy technologies. reply bryanlarsen 2 hours agoparentprevNote that China's coal usage was basically flat in 2023 and expected to decline in 2024. China's coal capacity is increasing dramatically, but they're increasingly using their coal plants as peaker plants rather than for base production. reply onlyrealcuzzo 1 hour agorootparentMedium term - China is going to lead the world in emissions reductions. They have the most to reduce and the most to lose if they don't move to renewables rapidly. Short term - nothing much is happening. Rome wasn't built in a day. The US can idly sit around and burn it's own natural gas and oil. The US at least has the option to maintain the status quo for a long time (it won't). But China doesn't even have this option. Additionally, auto manufacturing (ICE cars) accounts for ~5% of US employment. For China ICE auto manufacturing is ~0, and they have the opportunity to produce a huge chunk of the worlds EVs. They're not only incentivized massively to get off oil - they're incentivized to get EVERYONE ELSE off of oil, too. China needs to IMPORT natural gas and oil. They'd much rather lead the world in renewables EXPORT EVs and renewable generation than be reliant on Russia & KSA for energy (the basis of their current economy)... China will likely cut their emissions faster than the US has - which if you're realistic - the US has done an impressive job. The US emits ~30% less carbon per capita than it did in 2000. And we're on pace to be at ~40% less by the end of 2030: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1049662/fossil-us-carbon... In 20 years, China is likely to be around ~75% less than today. The US probably won't get from ~40% to ~75% over that time. The lobbying from our own energy producers will too much to cut that deep that quickly.

They've both had decades now of abysmal smog and pollution that literally (like, statistically trackable) kills people every year, including people otherwise productive in society. China is absolutely dumping the price of solar panels. A fully renewable energy China is one that is harder for Western countries to sanction, has more prestige with bright blue skies, and exports cheap solar panels to everyone else. India will trend the same way. Every geopolitically relevant country will feel more secure with renewable, and therefore utterly independent, energy generation. A reminder that Texas, a uniparty state literally run by Oil Barron families for decades, still gets at least a third of it's power from renewable sources, because it's so goddamned cheap. It doesn't matter how profitable oil is, or how much you pump, it will always be cheaper, and therefore more profitable, to replace it with power that just manifests itself out of the sky or wind for merely the cost of maintenance. Each oil well requires tens of highly skilled, rather well paid tradespeople to manage, drill, run, explode, etc. An entire field of wind turbines requires one or two small teams of somewhat well paid maintenance engineers. reply cm2187 45 minutes agorootparentAs far as I am aware, Texas offsets the volatility of renewable with carbon based energy.

That doesn't mean that there aren't other viable ways to do so. reply bryanlarsen 1 hour agorootparentprevChina & India get almost all of their coal internally, so coal is also fairly sanctions proof.

Before we start pointing fingers, over 50% of China's energy consumption is manufacturing, and a significant chunk of that manufacturing is western countries outsourcing their manufacturing needs, i.e. claiming to be coal-free while really just burning the coal elsewhere and then blaming the landowner. If you want to truly be coal-free, don't just pay for it to be built in Canada for your wooden house that consumes a few kilowatts. Pay for it to be built in China for all your manufacturing outposts that make your computer, TV, phone, kitchen gadgets, kitchen ware, disposable items, containers for food delivery, and everything else, that take an enormous amount of power to create. They are equally a part of your energy footprint. Do you have iPhones in Alberta? It takes about 1 GJ or 278 kWh to make a single phone [1], which is about enough to heat an entire house for a month.

Alberta uses a bid system where everyone who bids under the price that (based on demand) ends up getting set, gets to participate and get paid. Because renewable is tough to store, they almost always bid zero to make sure it gets included. The same thing happens for the renewable portion of integrated providers; they bid low on the renewable to make sure they're included, and high on the variable fossil fuels (i.e. gas can be turned off or brought on line) to drive up the price.

My only point is that Alberta being larger than Germany means its more expensive to deliver power to all its various small towns distributed around the province. That seems pretty tautologically correct to me given that power lines have a cost and must be constantly maintained and built to support new power demands. I'm unsure about what the cross section of aluminum has to do with the size of a province, but i'm willing to learn:) Run a simple thought experiment.

We replaced coal burning with natural gas and gasoline burning power generation. For those who will say, \"but Alberta has wind and solar!\" please know that our current premiere (similar to a governor) is actively attacking all of our renewable energy investments. Her name is Danielle Smith and she's quite literally a former oil and gas lobbyist. The only reason this is being touted is because big oil in Alberta is happy we've switched over to burning their carbon emitter of choice. Take that into account when you read this feel good piece about Alberta being \"coal free\". reply jes5199 2 hours agoparentI'll still count it. Natgas is much cleaner than coal. And economics will eventually force their hand as solar costs continue to fall reply slavik81 1 hour agorootparentAt present, solar is about 6% of Alberta's electric generation capacity. The provincial government suspended planning permission for all renewable energy projects across the province for six months, then outright banned the installation of grid-scale solar in much of the province. This resulted in the cancellation of tens of billions of dollars worth of private investment in renewable energy in Alberta. Solar is also not as cheap as elsewhere in the world, as Canada has import duties on the cheap Chinese solar panels are driving the change elsewhere. The duties roughly triple the price, with a tax of ~160% on the purchase price and per-watt charges on the panel's rated output. I'm sure that in five years things will start to shift. Heck, there's workers installing solar panels on my neighbour's roof right now — but it's not going to change much while Danielle Smith is in charge. reply djaychela 1 hour agorootparentprevIt's not as much cleaner as we often think.

Alberta has more sun and more wind than any place else in Canada so renewables could be quite profitable to them in the future, but what government cares about anything further out than the next election? Alberta also used to be the only place in Canada where you could just build a solar power plant and hook it up to the grid with minimal red tape so had a massive advantage in terms of number of solar jobs. Also Alberta is next door to BC which has vast sources of hydro-electric power so it could easily trade solar & wind power to BC when the sun is shining and/or the wind is blowing in exchange for hydro power when it isn't. reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentI agree. The times they are a-changing, but we have a particularly regressive government at the moment that is actively blocking renewable production. The unfortunate bit about having the most sun is that during winter we still don't get much of it. It seems to me we need as much storage as we do production. reply bryanlarsen 3 hours agorootparentAlberta isn't very cloudy in the wintertime, the reduced insolation is mostly due to lower angles and shorter days. AFAICT, winter sunshine is more than a third of summer sunshine in Alberta. In Europe the number is often 10%. It's cheaper to size production for winter sunshine than to build a lot of storage. AKA it's cheaper to put down 3X as many panels than to build seasonal storage. Alberta doesn't lack for hills, which is what's needed to build pumped storage which is what's cheapest for seasonal storage. reply pfdietz 3 hours agorootparent> It's cheaper to size production for winter sunshine than to build a lot of storage. Which means enormous amounts of surplus power in the summer (even with PV angled to optimize winter production.) So storage doesn't have to go far to be worthwhile, and in particular with nearly free input energy it doesn't have to be very efficient. reply bryanlarsen 3 hours agorootparentIt doesn't have to be very efficient, but it is has to be cheap. Batteries aren't cheap but they discharge every night so their cost is spread out over ~365 days and their cost becomes feasible. Pumped storage is ~10% the cost of batteries, but if used as seasonal storage so they only discharge once per year that makes them ~36X as expensive. Especially in Alberta where they're competing against Natural Gas which is also approximately free (it's often flared off as a waste gas from oil wells rather than captured and sold because the value is less than the cost of capture). reply pfdietz 2 hours agorootparentFor seasonal storage, it would be either an e-fuel (like hydrogen) or bulk storage of thermal energy (basically, artificial geothermal). The latter could produce very hot rock at rather shallow depth, yet still have thermal time constants of many years. reply bryanlarsen 2 hours agorootparentBoth of those are more expensive than pumped storage. reply pfdietz 2 hours agorootparentThis depends on the time scale. For days or weeks? Pumped hydro is better. But for seasonal storage? The size of the reservoir becomes prohibitive. reply bryanlarsen 1 hour agorootparentA water reservoir is a heck of a lot cheaper to make large compared to a hydrogen tank. reply pfdietz 1 hour agorootparentHydrogen on this scale would be stored underground, preferably in solution mined salt caverns. This is a well established technology, although it's more used for storing natural gas. These caverns are very inexpensive to build, which is why they are used. Alberta, as it turns out, is underlaid by kilometers of sedimentary rock that includes salt formations. reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentprevI like this idea, but I disagree with this: > It's cheaper to size production for winter sunshine than to build a lot of storage. This still doesn't work - storage is mandatory. Winter peak loads, which are often the most power that the grid will require all year, are before and after the sun. reply adrianN 3 hours agorootparentThere’s a huge difference between load shifting a couple of hours and seasonal storage reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentThat's why I didn't specify it needed to be seasonal, but it does need to be stored, as a lot of that load isn't shifting. At 7pm on a -35 day there is zero solar generation, but every furnace in the province is on and people are doing their evening cooking and cleaning. reply bryanlarsen 3 hours agorootparentYou're right, you said \"as much storage as production\". That's actually a very tiny amount of storage. Generally a \"24hr\" solar plant for California usage patterns has about 4-6Wh of storage and about 1W of discharge per watt of solar plant. Alberta will likely need ~2X that for daily load shifting during the winter. Seasonal storage would require a couple of orders of magnitude more. reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentAh. To clarify, when I said \"as much storage as production\", I meant focus, not quantity. reply Marsymars 1 hour agorootparentprevI'd note that actual -35 days are pretty rare. Per Environment Canada Climate Normal Data from 1991 to 2020, Edmonton averages only 2.5 days per year with a minimum temperature below -30. reply SketchySeaBeast 1 hour agorootparentWhile you're correct, they do happen and need to be accounted for, and temperatures in the -30s in general aren't rare, but we're also experiencing more extreme weather as of late. Edmonton set a few records for cold the last few years, and those moments, when the grid is at the most strain, is also when the power is needed the most to keep people safe. reply jfim 3 hours agorootparentprev> Alberta doesn't lack for hills, which is what's needed to build pumped storage which is what's cheapest for seasonal storage. From what I understand, BC has a lot of hydro dams. I wonder if there is a way to use them for pumped storage. reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentThey do use them as storage, but more passively - When others sources of production are high BC slows their consumption, allowing them to build up greater reserves in their dams. reply ryandrake 2 hours agorootparentprev> The times they are a-changing, but we have a particularly regressive government at the moment that is actively blocking renewable production. I guess Canadian politics are not unlike US politics in the area of energy production. You'd think that most of the jobs in non-renewable energy could just transition over to jobs in renewable energy and everyone's happy. But sadly, like everything, the energy source itself has been politicized. The left favors renewables regardless of the pros and cons and the right favors non-renewables regardless of the pros and cons, so it looks like yet another ideological battle rather than a battle over concrete things like jobs and the environment. reply SketchySeaBeast 2 hours agorootparentI think there's simply not enough jobs in renewables - once a solar farm is operational maintenance is a fraction of production, unlike the oil sands or rigs which require constant human intervention. reply KennyBlanken 1 hour agorootparentprevWinter is not an issue for solar because solar panel efficiency is better when the panel is cooler. A panel blazing away in Florida is actually losing quite a bit of efficiency because of how hot the panel is; much farther north even with less light, the panels can produce more. reply SketchySeaBeast 52 minutes agorootparentBut it is an issue when Calgary only sees 8 hours of daylight in the deepest depths of winter. reply nightowl_games 3 hours agorootparentprevAs far as I understand it, the whole country is dependent on the tar sands, but the east still hates it. reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentIs really not. I don't think there are any numbers justifying narrative, and numbers presented in this thread prove it. The dependency is really just Albertan advertising. reply speed_spread 2 hours agorootparentprevCanada's economy is built on primary resource extraction and production in general but would have done fine without the tar sands. Most of the oil money leaves the country; the money that stays mainly fuels self-serving private agendas, pressuring other parts of the economy and stuffing politics. This could have been averted had a solution like Norway's state oil fund been adopted but would have been too socialist a measure for the empire to tolerate. reply dagmx 4 hours agoparentprevYep.

They instituted a seven-month renewable's pause to \"evaluate\" them (evaluating renewables in 2023????), which introduced a lot of investor uncertainty[1].

Burning methane releases 1 CO2 molecule per CH4 molecule (CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + 2H2O), or 2.743 it's mass in CO2 [2]. To make up the difference in CO2 you'd have to be losing ~5% of the methane to the atmosphere along the way from extraction to burning.

Methane produces less than half the CO2 per kwh than coal. The important metric is CO2e, not CO2. Critically, CO2e includes measurements of methane emissions.

Alberta is celebrating simply transitioning from one fossil fuel to another, slightly cleaner burning, one. They are certainly still struggling with renewables when they are needed the most, such as -35 at 7PM, long after the sun has gone down and the wind turbine's hydraulics are too cold to function safely and all our furnaces are running and everyone is cooking and doing laundry. This is also when nuclear isn't a great solution, as it's a huge spike in demand. reply mywittyname 2 hours agorootparent> This is also when nuclear isn't a great solution, as it's a huge spike in demand. Overproduce electricity, then burn off the excess to match load to demand. It's counter-intuitive, but the cost structure of producing electricity via nuclear is different from fossil fuels. The unit costs per kW/h of nuclear is negligible compared to the capital costs of building a plant. Making it economically viable to \"waste\" electricity to match load to demand. At some point down the road, people will do the cost benefit on capturing excess production in battery packs vs expanding the existing nuclear facilities to meet demand. reply SketchySeaBeast 2 hours agorootparentThe fun with overproducing nuclear is it requires the ability to successfully forecast growth a decade from now. reply adrianN 3 hours agorootparentprevWhy would you let your hydraulics freeze? reply SketchySeaBeast 3 hours agorootparentSorry, I did some research, it's not just hydraulics, but at below -30 materials experience significant changes in strength and many become brittle and prone to breaking, demanding that they be shut down.

Sure, the last two years could be the start of an explosive increase, but the drop in year-over-year increase as indicated by the charts from your own link suggests it's far more likely to return to the overall trend.

Dropping coal is pretty different from dropping fossil fuels, especially right now when natural gas is dirt cheap. It's also debatable if Alberta currently needs any more solar or wind; what we definitely need is storage for these generative sources. The other components of industrial use and transportation are probably more effective targets for big wins than getting gas out of the electricity grid. reply bryanlarsen 58 minutes agoparent [–] Due to its abundant wind & solar, Alberta could easily get to ~70% renewable generation without any storage. So until Alberta hits that 70% mark, investing in a dollar on wind or solar generation will provide far more fiscal and decarbonization return than investing that dollar in storage. Similar, investing a dollar in wind & solar will pay itself back very quickly. Investing that dollar into transport or industrial decarbonization will have a much longer return. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

In accordance with ICANN's commitment to be open and transparent, this webpage provides current information related to Registry Agreement terminations. For a list of terminated Registry Agreements, please visit the Terminated Registry Agreements page. Termination Process Under the New gTLD Registry Agreement, either party may terminate pursuant to certain requirements in the Registry Agreement, including but not limited to the following: Section 4.3 and its subsections – Termination by ICANN Section 4.4 and its subsections – Termination by Registry Operator Pursuant to the above sections, in the event of termination by either party and after consultation with Registry Operator, ICANN shall determine (\"Preliminary Determination\") whether or not to transition operation of the Registry to a successor registry operator in its sole discretion and in conformance with the Registry Transition Process. For the avoidance of doubt, ICANN's Preliminary Determination shall not prohibit ICANN from delegating the gTLD pursuant to a future application process for the delegation of top-level-domains, subject to any processes and objection procedures instituted by ICANN in connection with such application process intended to protect the rights of third parties. Notifications, ICANN Determinations, and Reports related to Registry Agreement Terminations will be published on this webpage. Interested parties may review and provide input regarding ICANN's Preliminary Determination by emailing comments to ra-termination-comments@icann.org.

They saw .google and .mcdonalds and thought \"we should have our own one of those\"..

Same thing happened in the early-to-mid 90s. The corporate web site money didn’t come from the IT budget, it came from marketing. The money for the Leased Line Internet connection too, for all but the most R&D focussed companies in the UK.

There's value in being your own registry operator, especially when it comes to stuff like intellectual property claims, etc.. By being a registry instead of a registrant you get an extra layer of protection that helps to ensure your domain is untouchable. I think it makes a lot of sense to use for long term infrastructure if, again, the costs aren't prohibitive. reply bastawhiz 22 hours agorootparentprevFor a company like Dodge (well, I guess their parent company) that's like selling 6-7 cars a quarter.

Another \"ghost mining town\" left behind from the wild west that was the first decades of the commercial internet. reply silisili 22 hours agoparentprevThis isn't exactly accurate. Google and McDonalds didn't have some early exclusive launch. There were hundreds that launched at around the same time, when ICANN opened the process, and not in the 00s. I'm too lazy to research them all here, but I recognize a number of them here from their initial applications, which would have all happened at the same time as the two you mentioned. reply sbarre 20 hours agorootparentYeah sorry I had the timeline off... I also wasn't implying any exclusivity but I remember when these were first announced/marketed that those two domains were prevalent? reply DidYaWipe 20 hours agoparentprevThis whole scam was so disappointing, although par for ICANN's course. When we heard that they were opening up TLDs, I thought that finally limited TLDs would be abolished. But nope. ICANN turned the whole thing into another disgraceful money grab... taken to a new level. Now that it has flopped, we can just hope that someday we'll be able to end a domain name with any valid string. reply cut3 20 hours agorootparentIve always wondered why a tld cant just be anything after the last period reply DidYaWipe 20 hours agorootparentAs far as I know, there's no technical reason. I've seen people raise trademarks as an issue, but that's a red herring. There are already trademark-dispute resolution procedures in place. reply userbinator 18 hours agorootparentprevMainly to control the resource usage of the root servers, I believe. DNS is hierarchical, and I don't think devolving into a semi-flat namespace is a good idea at all. reply avidiax 15 hours agorootparentThis isn't anymore \"flat\" that then TLD nameservers like com., net., etc. It's just one level down. ICANN could certainly afford to run servers for a \"flat\" TLD system. The problem for ICANN is that it will sour relations with all the existing TLD registrars, and there are security problems with allowing any TLD. For example, I might be able to redirect traffic for a particular local network host name (e.g. \"router\", \"fileserver\", \"raspberrypi\", \"linksys\", etc.) to an external IP address of my choosing. Or I can make something that is normally a local file (e.g. \"cmd.exe\") and make it also a valid hostname. reply brookst 15 hours agorootparentNot just ICANN, but how many technical systems are optimized for having a few hundred TLDs? Going to millions / billions seems like it’s likely to uncover a lot of implementation shortcuts. Not necessarily a reason not to do it, just a reason to be a little careful in rollout. reply DidYaWipe 14 hours agorootparentprev\"I might be able to redirect traffic for a particular local network host name (e.g. \"router\", \"fileserver\", \"raspberrypi\", \"linksys\", etc.) to an external IP address of my choosing\" Interesting idea. Can you give an example of how that would actually happen? Also the cmd.exe one. So what if it's a valid hostname? reply avidiax 11 hours agorootparentIf the search domain list is empty or contains \".\" or \"\", or the search algorithm is flawed (maybe an IoT device), trying to connect might lead to a bare TLD lookup. CMD.exe is either a program accepts either a filename or URL in the same context (VLC does this), or the user is confused about the URL/file distinction. The .ZIP TLD was concerning for this reason. reply DidYaWipe 40 minutes agorootparentThanks for the reply. Maybe I just don't know enough about all the scenarios. I don't know what \"the domain search list\" is or what user action would involve it. I was looking more for specific dangerous use cases; for example, \"The user types such-and-such in the address bar, and instead of getting this he gets that.\" In other words, how is this a problem in actual practice. reply avidiax 28 minutes agorootparenthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_domain An example: The attacker posts a message to a forum, chatroom, etc. like: Download: 2024YourCompanySalaryData.zip When the user clicks \"2024YourCompanySalaryData.zip\", it is actually a domain name, and loads that website. This website then asks you to enter your corp credentials, or executes a 0-day on the victim's browser, etc. The forum doesn't need to allow file downloads (i.e. a real .zip might not even work), and even if it does, client or server side virus scanning doesn't have a .zip to inspect. The user is less wary of phishing, having never seen the .zip TLD. They assume they are downloading a file. https://blog.talosintelligence.com/zip-tld-information-leak/ reply lifthrasiir 13 hours agorootparentprevTechnically speaking, it is possible to use an approach similar to IDN to provide a flat namespace without actually making the root zone itself flat. Namely, an arbitrary TLD .abcdefgh can be translated to .xx--abc.def.gh--yy internally if .abcdefgh itself results in NXDOMAIN. Each level would then have less than 10^5 labels at worst. reply estebarb 15 hours agoparentprevAfter seeing that list it doesn't surprise me anymore that companies like Avianca filled for bankruptcy.

Who the hell thought \".travelersinsurance\" is a good buy? reply Animats 22 hours agoparentHow many of those are even routed to anywhere? Browsers don't like to route directly to TLDs. In theory, Amazon could have a web site at amazon but browsers interpret that as a search request, not a request for a rooted domain name. Even amazon. which means to treat that as a fully qualified domain name doesn't work in browsers any more. (That's what the trailing \".\" means. Relative domain names were a thing. If you're on a machine within \"bigu.edu\", and you want \"ourteam.bigu.edu\", you can supposedly just use \"ourteam\" as a domain. This rarely works right, because few clients have domain names any more. Is it even still implemented in most DNS lookup clients?) reply jimbobthrowawy 22 hours agorootparentICANN expressly forbid google, and other companies from operating these gTLDs as \"dotless\" domains back when they approved them.

Beyond some specific use cases, they don't seem to scale cognitively. The tangle of connections is a problem. The previous HN link from @andsoltis has a better critique than me. Don't get me wrong. Besides being experientially cynical about these things, I'm also firmly in the camp of \"one more UI breakthrough, bro and we might crack it!\" This one has some deep design that definitely attempts to extend the state of the art but still struggles with that aforementioned problem. TBH though, the coolest feature is that widget that focuses on what you are doing. There is something there with it, I'm just not sure what the \"there\" or \"it\" is, but I do know I like it. reply WillAdams 5 hours agoparentI use such tools when I can, and am fascinated with the concept, since it evokes Herman Hesse's _Glass Bead Game_ (from his novel _Magister Ludi) which was a book I remember fondly from my youth. Advantages are: - discoverability --- it seems pretty easy to arrange all elements in a hierarchy and make them accessible via clicking/revealing - no syntax errors --- if things fit together/connect, then it should be a syntactically valid program The problem is, it relies on a couple of concepts we don't seem to have a good solution for: - What does an algorithm look like? - How to deal with an algorithm which is larger than the current screen/window size? (it's all-too easy to have the same sort of problem of a not-wrapped program with lines longer than the current window size and more lines than will fit in a window, and there doesn't seem to be a 2D graphical equivalent of turning on word-wrapping) - If programs are broken down into discrete modules, then connected together, one is back to the wall-of-text description which presumably one was trying to escape from, just wrapped up in boxes and connectors Two pages with cautionary images are: https://blueprintsfromhell.tumblr.com/ and https://scriptsofanotherdimension.tumblr.com/ I've been trying to use OpenSCAD Graph Editor: https://github.com/derkork/openscad-graph-editor in my own work: https://github.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview and the screen grab from there sums up the difficulties pretty well: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillAdams/gcodepreview/mai... reply Rhapso 4 hours agorootparentLooking at those, I feel like we are approaching the problem entirely wrong. Even in text, you don't try and look at everything at once, zooming out for a \"structure overview\" seems useful, but that is not what is happening here, its just imperative code being shoehorned into a DAG and left wherever a user left it instead of organizing itself, which is the whole benefit to graphical programming.

Often similar elisions and allusions with the latest UI framework de jour. reply WillAdams 2 hours agorootparentFolks have been thinking (and dreaming) about it for a while now: https://www.glass-bead.org/?lang=enview reply vidarh 10 hours agoparentprevI spent a lot of time on this too, many years ago, including working on a language designed specifically for it, and my conclusion was that I couldn't find a way to make it work without making the visual representation \"just a tool\" for working with a textual representation, because we still need to be able to communicate about code in all kinds of context where a largely visual system would mean being forced to share screenshots, as well as being able to handle e.g. diffs and source control. And once you still need to know and understand and work with a textual representation it feels like a lot of the potential evaporates, and that made me gradually lose interest. I'd love it if someone found a solution to that, but it feels like an intractable problem beyond some specific use cases as you say. I really hope I'm wrong. reply dllthomas 1 hour agorootparentI think diffs, snippets, and source control are crucial, but I think they only tie you to a textual representation if you are trying to use existing, text-oriented tools for them. I grant that this makes the project significantly larger if you're going to remove that constraint. reply skybrian 2 hours agorootparentprevThere needs to be some way of sharing diagrams, but hopefully not as screenshots? Maybe more like a higher-level SVG, where there is text and you can look at it, but it’s not the preferred way of viewing it. It would need to be easy to embed these diagrams in other documents, which suggests a standard format and viewers readily available, for browsers and editors at least. Support for embedding such things in another language (Like we do with SQL and regular expressions) would be important, too. That might be a place to start. Can we replace regular expressions with a visual language? What would it take to have “railroad diagrams” widely available in at least one programming language and many editors? reply vidarh 43 minutes agorootparentThe problem is now you're reinventing the entire software stack of everyone you ever need to communicate with about it. Consider how hard it is to even get people to use additional symbols, like the APL's do... reply adastra22 10 hours agorootparentprevThat’s fine though? Ultimately everything you do on the computer is just a representation of bits being shuffled around. That doesn’t diminish its meaning or effective’s of a better user interface. reply vidarh 10 hours agorootparentThe problem becomes if the form you're used to working with the code in is very different from the form you need to communicate about it in. In practice every attempt I've looked at either become hard to communicate about the code in, or the visual aspect tends to end up just becoming a secondary visualisation of code that you still treat as textual first. In the latter case, turning it into a better UI is an unsolved problem, because round tripping reliably between something readable as text and a meaningful visual representation is really hard. As I said, I hope someone solves this, but most attempts aren't even pushing the boundaries into uncharted territory - a lot of attempts have been made over the years. reply worldsayshi 8 hours agorootparentPart of the solution is probably to rethink the whole UX context. One interesting example to think about is ProtoFlux, a part of Resonite: https://youtu.be/70PH5cQQEdQ?si=y4YmhnimzferVpCD Since you develop inside vr you can also talk about and show the code in the same vr environment. It's probably at this level we need to rethink stuff to make visual programming practical. reply vidarh 8 hours agorootparentBut then you want to write about it and explain it to someone else, and you're back to needing a way to represent it that fits on a page or can be explained verbally. reply worldsayshi 8 hours agorootparentProtoFlux is largely explained through tutorial videos I think. And I'm not saying that is superior. But I can imagine a lot of quality of life features around explaining it through voice that could be added to make it potentially superior or at least competitive. You could for example explain every node verbally and visually to an AI bot that can then explain it to the next person, or selectively retrieve parts of your explanations on demand. (OK, I realize that sounds unnecessary complex.) reply vidarh 8 hours agorootparentRequiring me to watch videos to follow along is an absolute non-starter to me. It's way too slow. If it was just learning an environment maybe I could tolerate that, but the showstoppers is communicating about code for projects. An AI bot doesn't solve this - if you can't relay the information textually, there's no reason the AI bot will be able to. reply worldsayshi 15 minutes agorootparentAre you saying visual programming languages can only work if they can be explained with text? adastra22 10 hours agorootparentprevBetter to round-trip to the AST, and have the textual representation be derivative of that (e.g. by a code formatted like Go). This also makes it easier to verify that you have all the same capabilities in both representations, as the ways of manipulating the AST are enumerable. reply vidarh 8 hours agorootparentMany people have tried that. I built a language and UI around that way back, and many others have. I ditched mine because there were way too many unsolved problems I felt made it useless. The problem is that if your primary means of working with the code is visual, the textual representation of your code then tends to be foreign to you when you're trying to use it to communicate aspects of the code, and when you constrain yourself to something that can be represented in a readable manner in a textual form, it turns out to be really hard to get to a point where the visual form is easier to work with. E.g. something as basic as how you comment code in ways that roundtrips nicely is an unsolved problem. If I have code represented as a graph, I'd be inclined to want to label relationships and dataflows that would be hard to place textually in a way that is meaningful in a textual version and that would roundtrip back to labels in the right place in the visual version. I've not seen any attempts at visual code that gets even that right. I've not managed to get it right myself either. If you force users to use an editor built into this tool, and edit a textual representation where some information is hidden, you can do better, but then if people e.g. copy a textual representation of the code into another application and back in, you end up with a mess. Again, I want to be proven wrong about this. Badly. I love the idea. I've just seen enough failed attempts (and made enough failed attempts) to be disillusioned about it. reply adastra22 8 hours agorootparentWhy would you want to work with the text representation, except when debugging or in the backend? I mean I get why you'd want the text representation to exist--we have mountains of infrastructure around text-based representations of code. Git for version control and LLM code models would work out of the box, for example. But that can all be handled on the backend by transpiling the AST to text as needed. Why would the user need to interact with the textual representation? Commenting needs to be solved at the language level, and there are many languages that have solved this exact problem. Python, newLISP, and Smalltalk IIRC all have methods for docstring commenting APIs such that the docstring is available as text to the running program / REPL. Use similar syntax to allow any statement to have comments attached, and use this instead of free-form /* */ comments. reply vidarh 7 hours agorootparent> Why would you want to work with the text representation, except when debugging or in the backend? How would I communicate about the project to others in e-mails, instant messenger, face to face, in blog posts, in articles, in books? How would I review diffs of code changes effectively? That is why. Find me a representation I can talk about and write about efficiently without screenshots or videos or requiring special software of every recipient on every platform, and you'll have advanced the state of the art in this field immensely. > that have solved this exact problem None of the ones you described have solved the problem of mapping between a visual and textual representation of the program seamlessly. Just attaching the comments from a textual version to an AST of the textual version is trivial. That's not the challenge. > Use similar syntax to allow any statement to have comments attached, and use this instead of free-form /* / comments. That doesn't get close to solving the issue. When I have a diagram showing the data flow of a piece of code, and I attach a comment to the edge* between the two nodes, in the textual representation where does that comment go? Does it go in the text version of the source node? In the destination node? What if I write a comment in the textual version right before a method call, and then switch to the visual version, does that stay in the source node? Does it become a label of the edge representing the method call? There are tons of edge cases there. The problem isn't finding a way to attach the comments in the right place, but finding a way that roundtrips perfectly without adding noise in either representation. reply Nzen 4 hours agorootparentI think that it is probably worth addressing what sort of textual visualization you have in mind. That way, you could disabuse people with naive notions like myself. I've not used a visual programming language and unit is (currently) hugged to death. But, my experience with graphviz's dot syntax would suggest putting a comment on the (textual) line that represents the edge itself: digraph whatever { running [ shape = \"triangle\" label = \"program running\" ]; # comment on the node itself stopped; running -> stopped; # comment about the edge stopped -> running; } I acknowledge, though, that I'm thinking of this as a dsp-style situation, where a node only connects at its boundaries, rather than in the center (say if a node contains code that would link to another as part of an if expression's body). (Also, I'm disappointed that I need to resist the urge to talk about Bob Nystom's visual pdf diff, because it seems really cool but is not as credible as the edge directive above. https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2021/07/29/640-pages-in-1... , scroll to 3/4 where it says \"Here is what all of the proofreading changes look like:\") reply vidarh 3 hours agorootparent> I acknowledge, though, that I'm thinking of this as a dsp-style situation, where a node only connects at its boundaries, rather than in the center (say if a node contains code that would link to another as part of an if expression's body). I think that might well be one of those restricted situations where visual programming often works well enough that it seems some use. I'm absolutely not saying it can't ever work. My problem with it is more when you try to do more general-purpose things with it, and you e.g. either end up with a node per method/function call (and maybe then even nodes for argument expressions) or large, complex nodes with internal logic. I love dot for graphs, but the challenge to me with that approach is that I've not seen a convincing example where you'd then not end up with a mountain of text for even very simple things (and I've sinned badly there myself - one of my own early attempts serialised to XML...) when you decompose the text enough that you can augment it reliably. E.g. consider a complex expression where that edge is not just a simple state transition, but a method call with arguments, where each argument itself might be a complex expression... Every attempt I made myself ended up with a textual version that was too verbose to feel viable for communication about the code unless I stripped out so much that the visual tooling effectively became a tool to analyse the textual version, rather than allowing editing on equal footing. reply analog31 6 hours agoparentprevI used LabVIEW extensively in the past. It was possible to organize code for readability, but it was physically laborious and I got massive eyestrain headaches and wrist fatigue from all of the fine mouse work needed. To be fair, maybe that's a personal ergonomic issue. I also can't use CAD for the same reason. I can sling text with my eyes closed, and have managed the ergonomics of typing well enough that it hasn't injured me in almost 50 years. On the other hand for applications where dataflow was a good paradigm for the problem being solved, I appreciated its benefits. reply bmitc 7 hours agoparentprev> Beyond some specific use cases, they don't seem to scale cognitively. The tangle of connections is a problem. This just isn't true. I've actually built things in visual languages. It just requires the same organization as text-based languages. One could write an entire text-based program in a single file in a single function, which would be a similar mess. In fact, the benefit or feature of visual languages is that they showcase poor code more readily than text-based code. reply patrick451 6 hours agorootparentI have also actually built things in a visual programming language. They are simply not capable of the same level of organization as a text based language because pictures is a bad way to communicate. There is a reason humans advanced past cave painting and hieroglyphics. reply bmitc 4 hours agorootparentAre you able to elaborate more? What language? I have used LabVIEW, among other visual languages, and built systems with 1,000+ VIs, which are the fundamental building blocks of code organization, and hundreds of classes. LabVIEW has VIs, clusters, classes, libraries, and projects, all of which are useful and required for a well-managed, decoupled code system. With good software principles, there's nothing that says you can't organize and scale visual code well. I one time interviewed at a place that had swore off LabVIEW and were moving to Python. The reasons of switching from LabVIEW were the same tired reasons of organizational issues. When I asked to see their Python code, they showed me a single Python file over 10,000 lines long, and there were function signatures that were over 20 lines long. That was just the function signatures. This example, along with many more, and my experience in both visual languages and text-based languages make me very skeptical about claims about not being able to organize and scale code in visual languages. reply Firadeoclus 5 hours agorootparentprevVisual programming languages are not prevented from using textual symbols, though. And many people use diagrams to communicate ideas more efficiently than they could with text alone. reply leetrout 16 hours agoprevI discovered Unit in the latter half of 2022 and found it very interesting.

Also it was clearly a solution in search of a problem. I was a believer in the idea that graph databases would enable a new paradigm of application development in the way that relational databases did, and wanted to try to pioneer something. That was (so I thought) what college dropouts like myself in my early 20s needed to do to get ahead in tech, as I was only a mere data analyst at the time, with no connections to the tech industry, scraping by while living inside a garage. It was a good exercise though and it somehow out of sheer luck caught the attention of Manning Publications as it likely came up in the search results for OrientDB. My project page included a sort of roadmap to integrate with OrientDB. They signed me on as a co-author of the book OrientDB in Action as the other author(s) IIRC weren’t native English speakers and they needed one. The book was never released but a different author released a similar book without publisher backing which was good enough for OrientDB.

With the express purpose of search/reuse (especially by less skilled computer users) 1) So a user creates a couple of nodes in a graph: a button, his specific hardware, a text node saying he wants to calcuate clicks per day. 2) This graph is then used to find published graphs by people who have used these nodes in a completed/deployed instance. 3) The user can easily browse and pick an exact complete graph to deploy himself. (layers here such as preventing private wifi passwords from getting to the published graphs) 4) If the graph is complete in terms of pointing to his exact hardware, exact code chunks as nodes, exact sdk versions then it transforms this graph into typical source code, and can be compiled and deployed, and after confirming it works, then shared again to the public graph collection to let others know it works. 5) if the graph isn't complete, you might have to write some code chunk nodes, connect things properly, or else use AI (har har) or even mark nodes as \"todo: can someone please implement this code, or pledges/bounties for someone to help implement\" 6) People need to be able to jump into any level they are comfortable with, the code, the graph shape, the public list of TODOs. Then there is translation/generation into the other levels. This makes a tool for higher level collaboration, that should be able to converge on finishing off desired solutions. The whole point being a new level of abstraction that makes code reuse possible if someone has implemented the same thing in the past already. (but even if it was on different hardware/sdk there should be reusable stateless functional-style code that can be stitched together a bit easier) reply bobajeff 17 hours agoprevhttps://web.archive.org/web/20240702210034/https://unit.soft... reply thomastjeffery 15 hours agoparentNot working for me... reply mkl 15 hours agorootparentSame on mobile.

After the full scale invasion started, charities like Nochlezhki (Ночлежка) experienced a severe drop in donations and many of their organizers and supporters were forced out of the country. After the soldiers demobilize, I suspect the situation will get even worse, partly due to poor PTSD treatment, crime rate increase and economic downturn. reply vintagedave 4 hours agoparentThis may be a cultural thing, but as an Aussie when someone says \"Sweet\" positively, it expresses real positivity (about the topic it refers to, not just an event itself, ie, I'd read this as positivity or approval about the events in the article.) It is not the word I would have used ;) But I agree with you it's good this is on the front page. I am so sorry for these people. I did _not_ enjoy reading. They were horrible stories and very depressing (the worst, for me, was Anna, and I'm not going to describe what happened to her in this comment.) reply vasco 8 hours agoprev> “Seriously, your questions are all like, ‘How were you feeling? When was the last time you were at peace?’ If that’s the way I thought about things, I would have killed myself already,” There was something very deep about this. I've had these moments before (from both sides), and while they are rare it's a very deep realisation of how different our internal monologues can be about the same situations. reply leke 10 hours agoprevWow, these stories were incredible sad to read. It seems a lot can be prevented by decent law enforcement and justice. reply PostOnce 8 hours agoparentHow do you get justice when the law enforcement is corrupt? You must first solve the corruption, which is a tough nut to crack. reply jajko 8 hours agoparentprevWell yes, in theory. But we talk about russia. Its population has been largely kept with servitude mindset for... in fact since they abolished serfdom, which in russia I was told by my history teachers was often same/worse as outright slavery elsewhere. So effectively for very, very long time. Dictators don't like when population thinks they have some universal rights, next thing they will start asking for them en masse and who knows what will be outlandish next, like tackling corruption and oligarchs who stand above the law? Common citizens are an afterthought, state is built to primarily cater to needs and whims of its paranoid greedy leaders. Its important for people like me, who passionately hate war russia is waging on Ukraine and its perpetrator, to be reminded that there are tons of good folks behind that wall of arrogance, stupidity and aggressivity. Pity they mostly feel like they can't change anything so they prefer drowning their despair in vodka and trying to look elsewhere. Maybe more digital age will eventually give them some wake up call, there is always hope even in darkest places and darkest moments. reply Applejinx 8 hours agoprevConfirmed. I spent a very short time homeless about 30 years ago. I was in Vermont, USA though, so there were social services being invented and I was in the first round of a thing called Shelter Plus Care: they got you a cheap apartment, got you on disability or whatever you could get, and you did therapy. 30 years later I'm a working software dev making a humble living, very much a 'domestic'. Everything in this article rings true. In particular, I inherently refuse to go to the hospital because I only make a humble living and can't handle a medical-scale financial shock, and I resist anything that feels like I could go back to 30 years ago. I'm seeing a doctor at a more crunchy-granola place though, because it vibes differently though she's still a credentialed doctor and it's no different from seeing one at a hospital: Medicaid's got me. But it's less scary to see a real doctor in the trappings of a hippie haven, so that's how I'm able to do it. It wasn't a very long period of homelessness thirty years ago, but it did leave an indelible mark. The article is worth reading even if it too is scary. You guys can be scared of this and I'll be scared of seeing the doctor, and we'll all manage somehow :) reply metadat 11 hours agoprevCloudflare-free archive link: https://archive.today/FwIfG reply majke 10 hours agoparentDo you get captcha or block page? reply M95D 7 hours agorootparentNo. reply pvaldes 8 hours agoprev [4 more] [flagged] anovikov 8 hours agoparent [–] On the flip side, it means crime rate and overall criminality of Russian population is likely going down just because people with criminal intentions or history, go into the meat grinder and never return? I can see quality of life in the deep province improving simply because most of the people who everyone wanted gone from their lives since long, are now indeed gone. One thing to understand about petrostates is that you cannot bring them to the knees by depriving them of working-age population, or talents who might emigrate. For Putin, population is mostly just mouths to feed. He makes money off oil and gas, not people - population is a liability - having fewer people (to a degree of course) can paradoxically make Russia a stronger, more resilient, richer society. reply actionfromafar 7 hours agorootparentIt works until suddenly it doesn't. The lowest will get recruited, but more entrenched, established criminals are probably more likely to find a way to avoid the draft. Also the constant hollowing out of \"normal\" economy can't end well in the long run. reply pvaldes 3 hours agorootparentprev [–] Is unclear. On one side they send deliberately many jailbirds to a certain death, but also lots of young and naive Russians that weren't criminals. On the other side, every Russian soldier that will survive the war has became a hardened war criminal. Just read today about the treat to the Ukranian soldiers captured by Russia and exchanged later. If a tenth of what the Ukranian soldiers say is true (and their body supports the history), the Russian army is broken beyond repair. The relationship between Putin and Russians (or between the government and the Russian army) is an archetypical abuser/victim relationship. This will normally finishes with the victim killed at the end, as a lot of Russian soldiers had discovered too late. The lesson is: psychos don't care and will never care about you or your feelings. In rare cases the victims kill the abuser, normally after a traumatic shock or external forces breaking the spell. If the killed soldiers would have instead turn around and take the Kremlin, their chances to survive in the end would have boosted. Putin was really in danger when Prighozin realized that their expected role was to die in Bahmut. He tried to get himself out of the frypan but failed. Putin's face on video was of somebody mortally afraid those days. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

    "originBody": "July 2024 Successful people tend to be persistent. New ideas often don't work at first, but they're not deterred. They keep trying and eventually find something that does. Mere obstinacy, on the other hand, is a recipe for failure. Obstinate people are so annoying. They won't listen. They beat their heads against a wall and get nowhere. But is there any real difference between these two cases? Are persistent and obstinate people actually behaving differently? Or are they doing the same thing, and we just label them later as persistent or obstinate depending on whether they turned out to be right or not? If that's the only difference then there's nothing to be learned from the distinction. Telling someone to be persistent rather than obstinate would just be telling them to be right rather than wrong, and they already know that. Whereas if persistence and obstinacy are actually different kinds of behavior, it would be worthwhile to tease them apart. [1] I've talked to a lot of determined people, and it seems to me that they're different kinds of behavior. I've often walked away from a conversation thinking either \"Wow, that guy is determined\" or \"Damn, that guy is stubborn,\" and I don't think I'm just talking about whether they seemed right or not. That's part of it, but not all of it. There's something annoying about the obstinate that's not simply due to being mistaken. They won't listen. And that's not true of all determined people. I can't think of anyone more determined than the Collison brothers, and when you point out a problem to them, they not only listen, but listen with an almost predatory intensity. Is there a hole in the bottom of their boat? Probably not, but if there is, they want to know about it. It's the same with most successful people. They're never more engaged than when you disagree with them. Whereas the obstinate don't want to hear you. When you point out problems, their eyes glaze over, and their replies sound like ideologues talking about matters of doctrine. [2] The reason the persistent and the obstinate seem similar is that they're both hard to stop. But they're hard to stop in different senses. The persistent are like boats whose engines can't be throttled back. The obstinate are like boats whose rudders can't be turned. [3] In the degenerate case they're indistinguishable: when there's only one way to solve a problem, your only choice is whether to give up or not, and persistence and obstinacy both say no. This is presumably why the two are so often conflated in popular culture. It assumes simple problems. But as problems get more complicated, we can see the difference between them. The persistent are much more attached to points high in the decision tree than to minor ones lower down, while the obstinate spray \"don't give up\" indiscriminately over the whole tree. The persistent are attached to the goal. The obstinate are attached to their ideas about how to reach it. Worse still, that means they'll tend to be attached to their first ideas about how to solve a problem, even though these are the least informed by the experience of working on it. So the obstinate aren't merely attached to details, but disproportionately likely to be attached to wrong ones. Why are they like this? Why are the obstinate obstinate? One possibility is that they're overwhelmed. They're not very capable. They take on a hard problem. They're immediately in over their head. So they grab onto ideas the way someone on the deck of a rolling ship might grab onto the nearest handhold. That was my initial theory, but on examination it doesn't hold up. If being obstinate were simply a consequence of being in over one's head, you could make persistent people become obstinate by making them solve harder problems. But that's not what happens. If you handed the Collisons an extremely hard problem to solve, they wouldn't become obstinate. If anything they'd become less obstinate. They'd know they had to be open to anything. Similarly, if obstinacy were caused by the situation, the obstinate would stop being obstinate when solving easier problems. But they don't. And if obstinacy isn't caused by the situation, it must come from within. It must be a feature of one's personality. Obstinacy is a reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas. This is not identical with stupidity, but they're closely related. A reflexive resistance to changing one's ideas becomes a sort of induced stupidity as contrary evidence mounts. And obstinacy is a form of not giving up that's easily practiced by the stupid. You don't have to consider complicated tradeoffs; you just dig in your heels. It even works, up to a point. The fact that obstinacy works for simple problems is an important clue. Persistence and obstinacy aren't opposites. The relationship between them is more like the relationship between the two kinds of respiration we can do: aerobic respiration, and the anaerobic respiration we inherited from our most distant ancestors. Anaerobic respiration is a more primitive process, but it has its uses. When you leap suddenly away from a threat, that's what you're using. The optimal amount of obstinacy is not zero. It can be good if your initial reaction to a setback is an unthinking \"I won't give up,\" because this helps prevent panic. But unthinking only gets you so far. The further someone is toward the obstinate end of the continuum, the less likely they are to succeed in solving hard problems. [4] Obstinacy is a simple thing. Animals have it. But persistence turns out to have a fairly complicated internal structure. One thing that distinguishes the persistent is their energy. At the risk of putting too much weight on words, they persist rather than merely resisting. They keep trying things. Which means the persistent must also be imaginative. To keep trying things, you have to keep thinking of things to try. Energy and imagination make a wonderful combination. Each gets the best out of the other. Energy creates demand for the ideas produced by imagination, which thus produces more, and imagination gives energy somewhere to go. [5] Merely having energy and imagination is quite rare. But to solve hard problems you need three more qualities: resilience, good judgement, and a focus on some kind of goal. Resilience means not having one's morale destroyed by setbacks. Setbacks are inevitable once problems reach a certain size, so if you can't bounce back from them, you can only do good work on a small scale. But resilience is not the same as obstinacy. Resilience means setbacks can't change your morale, not that they can't change your mind. Indeed, persistence often requires that one change one's mind. That's where good judgement comes in. The persistent are quite rational. They focus on expected value. It's this, not recklessness, that lets them work on things that are unlikely to succeed. There is one point at which the persistent are often irrational though: at the very top of the decision tree. When they choose between two problems of roughly equal expected value, the choice usually comes down to personal preference. Indeed, they'll often classify projects into deliberately wide bands of expected value in order to ensure that the one they want to work on still qualifies. Empirically this doesn't seem to be a problem. It's ok to be irrational near the top of the decision tree. One reason is that we humans will work harder on a problem we love. But there's another more subtle factor involved as well: our preferences among problems aren't random. When we love a problem that other people don't, it's often because we've unconsciously noticed that it's more important than they realize. Which leads to our fifth quality: there needs to be some overall goal. If you're like me you began, as a kid, merely with the desire to do something great. In theory that should be the most powerful motivator of all, since it includes everything that could possibly be done. But in practice it's not much use, precisely because it includes too much. It doesn't tell you what to do at this moment. So in practice your energy and imagination and resilience and good judgement have to be directed toward some fairly specific goal. Not too specific, or you might miss a great discovery adjacent to what you're searching for, but not too general, or it won't work to motivate you. [6] When you look at the internal structure of persistence, it doesn't resemble obstinacy at all. It's so much more complex. Five distinct qualities — energy, imagination, resilience, good judgement, and focus on a goal — combine to produce a phenomenon that seems a bit like obstinacy in the sense that it causes you not to give up. But the way you don't give up is completely different. Instead of merely resisting change, you're driven toward a goal by energy and resilience, through paths discovered by imagination and optimized by judgement. You'll give way on any point low down in the decision tree, if its expected value drops sufficiently, but energy and resilience keep pushing you toward whatever you chose higher up. Considering what it's made of, it's not surprising that the right kind of stubbornness is so much rarer than the wrong kind, or that it gets so much better results. Anyone can do obstinacy. Indeed, kids and drunks and fools are best at it. Whereas very few people have enough of all five of the qualities that produce right kind of stubbornness, but when they do the results are magical. Notes [1] I'm going to use \"persistent\" for the good kind of stubborn and \"obstinate\" for the bad kind, but I can't claim I'm simply following current usage. Conventional opinion barely distinguishes between good and bad kinds of stubbornness, and usage is correspondingly promiscuous. I could have invented a new word for the good kind, but it seemed better just to stretch \"persistent.\" [2] There are some domains where one can succeed by being obstinate. Some political leaders have been notorious for it. But it won't work in situations where you have to pass external tests. And indeed the political leaders who are famous for being obstinate are famous for getting power, not for using it well. [3] There will be some resistance to turning the rudder of a persistent person, because there's some cost to changing direction. [4] The obstinate do sometimes succeed in solving hard problems. One way is through luck: like the stopped clock that's right twice a day, they seize onto some arbitrary idea, and it turns out to be right. Another is when their obstinacy cancels out some other form of error. For example, if a leader has overcautious subordinates, their estimates of the probability of success will always be off in the same direction. So if he mindlessly says \"push ahead regardless\" in every borderline case, he'll usually turn out to be right. [5] If you stop there, at just energy and imagination, you get the conventional caricature of an artist or poet. [6] Start by erring on the small side. If you're inexperienced you'll inevitably err on one side or the other, and if you err on the side of making the goal too broad, you won't get anywhere. Whereas if you err on the small side you'll at least be moving forward. Then, once you're moving, you expand the goal.

    "commentBody": "The Right Kind of Stubborn (paulgraham.com)100 points by urs 1 hour agohidepastfavorite53 comments wkcheng 27 minutes agoThis is a great article on the difference between an obstinate person and a persistent person, but I'm not sure the general public perceives them the same way that Paul does. What I've found is that many times, people like the perceived confidence that obstinacy can bring. For example, let's say that someone points out a flaw in a plan. Person A responds by saying \"That's not a real problem. It doesn't matter.\" Person B says \"Ok, that's interesting. Let's dig into it.\" Person A (the obstinate person who doesn't listen) usually comes across as more confident in this encounter, even though Person B (the persistent person who is engaging) may actually end up learning something new and getting a better result. This is especially true in public forums. If you go up on a stage and do a debate, the obstinate person comes across as more confident to more people. This doesn't mean that their plan is any good. But people will vote for them, give them money, etc. For the record, I agree with Paul's assessment that persistence is a great quality and obstinacy is not. However, it's hard to actually get this across to the public. reply ableSprocket11 0 minutes agoprevI like his articles, but the artificial constructs sometimes drive me up the wall.

Persistence and obstinacy often overlap in practice, sharing traits like energy, imagination, resilience, good judgment, focus on a goal, and listening intently. The issue is that \"reason\" can be subjective. For example, Copernicus and Galileo were considered obstinate for his heliocentric theory, but history proved him right. This shows that the line between persistence and obstinacy is often drawn in hindsight. Referencing the Collison brothers highlights a bias towards successful YC alumni. It would be more telling to classify current batch founders as obstinate or persistent and revisit their success in a decade. reply Vegenoid 14 minutes agoparent> Persistence and obstinacy often overlap in practice, sharing traits like energy, imagination, resilience, good judgment, focus on a goal, and listening intently.

This shows that the line between persistence and obstinacy is often drawn in hindsight. History didn't prove them right, science did. The fact that people considered them obstinate does not mean that they were. The only future where they would still be considered the obstinate ones is one run by obstinate people.

Thinking there's a way to distinguish the two in the moment without you yourself being the more competent one is to believe in crystal balls.

On the other hand, the product keeps getting better as I work on it, and I have now sold 500 of them. But sometimes I feel like I can’t keep going like this. Two jobs and a family is just too much. I think I should either quit my job and properly focus on it, relying on savings until the sales can support me.

What beliefs are causing you to make that mistake? Are you scared of those parts, and therefore avoiding them and convincing yourself they're not important? It sounds like you wish to be able to live off this work, yet you're not modeling the gap between where you are and where you want to be correctly (clearly, or you wouldn't be asking for help).

I don't really know how this works for these people and can't experience it myself because I have just one brain. While I am flawed in many ways, I am not flawed in that particular way. I don't really understand how this works. I find that inability to understand qualified language is a decent marker. Note I said \"I suspect that often\", and not \"I know this is always\". Black/white thinkers will reply with something like \"no, that's not true, here's an example where that's not the case: [..]\" Well, okay ... that's what \"often\" means, further weakened by the \"I suspect\". But for black/white thinkers it's Highlander time: there can only be one (explanation). --- Bit of a related aside: For the last year or so I've been using an extension to completely block people from Hacker News. The way this works is that I have two buttons: \"bozo\" to merely mark a post, and a list of marked posts in shown on the profile. And \"block\" to completely block them. Everyone has bad days, myself included, and I don't want to write people off for the occasional bad day. But some people have a lot of bad days. And by \"marking\" people's posts some interesting patterns emerge. I mark a post for extreme black/white views on something like Israel and being pretty obstinate about it, and then 2 months later I see the same person with extreme black/white views on databases and being pretty obstinate about that. Are these two topics related? Not at all. But the same type of thinking is used: extremely simplistic black/white thinking with almost no room for nuance or \"it depends\". Another person posted that thieves should be executed, \"but if that is too extreme the chopping off of hands is also acceptable\" (true story), and also rants about programming languages like they're 13, and rants about \"wokeness\". The same person where a substantial number of their posts are rants about what inferior languages Go and Ruby are, also literally wishes death on politicians they disagree with, and claims \"McCarthy was absolutely right\" (which is a complete bollocks historical revisionism pushed by some people who are unable to understand \"yes, turned out there were real Soviet spies in US gov't during the 50s, but there was zero overlap with the people McCarthy accused and he was just an unhinged nutjob who operated without any evidence against random people\"). etc. etc. What I learned from this is that by and large this kind of obstinance is not a \"strong feelings about issue X\"-problem, but rather a \"brain just works in that way\"-problem, whether that's due to black/white thinking, or something else. There's an old joke: \"A 9/11 truther, anti-vaxxer, sovereign citizen, and homeopath walk in to a bar. He orders a beer.\" Sometimes people are just misinformed on these issues and believe maybe one or two of them, but especially when they're knee-deep in nuttery it's just a thinking error. I am still undecided if these people really are incapable of thinking in another way, or are just unwilling to do so.
