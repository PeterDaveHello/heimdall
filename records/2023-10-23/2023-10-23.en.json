Hint: it isn’t big pharma image: mariano pascual Oct 8th 2023 Share O n october 4th more than 75,000 employees of Kaiser Permanente, a large health-care chain, began a three-day strike. The walkout was the biggest in the history of America’s health sector, and called attention to the staffing shortages plaguing the country’s hospitals and clinics. In the same week ten drugmakers said they would negotiate medicine prices with Medicare, the public health-care system for the elderly, following legislation which all but forced them to. It will be the first time that companies have haggled over prices with the government. These events are symptoms of deeper malaise in America’s dysfunctional health-care system. The country spends about $4.3trn a year on keeping citizens in good nick. That is equivalent to 17% of gdp, twice as much as the average in other rich economies. And yet American adults live shorter lives and American infants die more often than in similarly affluent places. Pharmaceutical firms and hospitals attract much of the public ire for the inflated costs. Much less attention is paid to a small number of middlemen who extract far bigger rents from the system’s complexity. Already have an account?

This is a really low effort article, it doesn&#x27;t even really define what it considers \"healthcare\". In the US healthcare is 1&#x2F;5 or more of the entire economy, so who profits from 1&#x2F;5 of all US economic activity is a silly premise.The US doesn&#x27;t have one healthcare system, it has 50+ (or 51, ...59, is healthcare in Puerto Rico part of the US healthcare system?, how about American Samoa?). Contrary to many peoples opinions the \"healthcare system\" is not operated or overseen primarily at a federal level. The federal government is one of the largest buyers of healthcare as an insurance provider, that is true.Comparisons to other countries that are much much smaller than the US are sort of silly to me. Europe does not have one healthcare system. Subsidized education and price controls in foreign systems also make comparisons excruciating. I think it is usually a canard. OECD data is, in a word, \"garbage\", as it relates to healthcare. Just one example: In the US, eyewear for seeing purposes is healthcare. In almost no other countries do you need a prescription for eyeglasses. Prescription eyewear in the US is a 20-30 billion dollar market, depending on how you want to count it.I think the mechanisms for paying for healthcare in the US are really inefficient and involve too many intermediaries. This is a result of a lot of accidents of history. America is a very physically large country with a lot of people all over it, we expect very high standards of care, we consume a tremendous amount of pharmaceuticals, we have wildy abundant and relatively inexpensive food that seems to be correlated to our being much more overweight than a lot of other peoples, we engage in a lot of dangerous activities at a rate that far exceeds what a lot of other peoples do that seems to correlated with our culture, on and on.Instead of hand wringing about differences between ourselves and other cultures we would be better served looking at boring things like medicares 3 million pages of medical claim guidelines, clearing house operations and conflicts of interest, better incentives for state level responsibility, antitrust litigation, lots of practical things that don&#x27;t make click bait headlines. reply Mordisquitos 13 hours agoparent> Comparisons to other countries that are much much smaller than the US are sort of silly to me. Europe does not have one healthcare system.True, Europe does not have one healthcare system. And yet, thanks to the EHIC (European Health Insurance Card) [0], citizens of the 27 countries in the EU, Switzerland, the UK, and the EEA (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), can use the healthcare systems from any other of the 31&#x2F;28 [1] participant countries if they need healthcare on a temporary visit under the same conditions as the local resident citizens. The expenses incurred are reimbursed to the system providing the healthcare by the healthcare system of the citizen who is receiving it. This is done transparently to the patient, all they need to do is provide their EHIC card.This means that each of these 32 different healthcare systems, with their own particularities (e.g. free at the point of use vs. copay), can be considered one single universal healthcare system.If 32 different countries, with their own legal systems, legislation, languages, and healthcare system design (insurance based or state funded) can cover approximately 500 million citizens, then 50 US states under one single federal government should have no problem doing the same for their 333 million citizens.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;European_Health_Insurance_Card[1] In the case of the UK, the EHIC only reciprocal with EU and Switzerland, not the EEA. reply petre 12 hours agorootparentWe have a friend that had a ski accident in Switzerland (broken arm, open fracture). The EHIC was next to useless. They had to pay a \"few\" grand CHF out of pocket for the surgery. I think the private insurance covered some of that after many phonecalls and a few months. Needless to say, I won&#x27;t be going skiing in Switzerland anytime soon. reply yread 11 hours agorootparentWas it a private hospital&#x2F;ward?

Isn&#x27;t the healthcare system entirely private? reply dguest 4 hours agorootparentprevMeanwhile in France my friend broke her arm skiing and payed with the spare change in her pockets. It wasn&#x27;t enough to cover the cost of ambulance, cast, etc, but the people at the clinic basically said \"whatever\" and sent her home a few hours later. reply rozenmd 9 hours agoparentprev> In almost no other countries do you need a prescription for eyeglassesIn both Australia and France, you need a prescription. This assertion makes me question the accuracy of the rest of your comment. reply jseliger 15 hours agoparentprevwe would be better served looking at boring things like medicares 3 million pages of medical claim guidelines, clearing house operations and conflicts of interest, better incentives for state level responsibility, antitrust litigation, lots of practical things that don&#x27;t make click bait headlines.It would also be nice to reform the FDA and the clinical trial system: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bessstillman.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;please-be-dying-but-not-...\"Antitrust litigation\" covers this, but to spell it out, the increasing monopolization of many local healthcare systems is a huge problem. reply duffpkg 15 hours agorootparentMy opinion about the FDA is that it suffers from two major faults, it is always regulating the \"last war\" and it has the standard federal government incentive structure for policy making which is \"do not do anything that according to civil service regulations can get me fired\".In defense of the FDA, which I promise is not an instituion I have much affection for, they are asked to strike an impossible balance. More or less the same regulatory impulse that allowed Richard Sackler to build an empire on the killing of millions of americans is the same one that allows very sick people to access very, at times dubious, drugs and trials that sometimes save their lives.Most of medicine is very centrally built around the \"first do no harm\" approach, even at the cost of lives by non-intervention sometimes. With the FDA most people want a \"do some harm, some of the time for the greater good\" approach which is a really difficult thing for a federal agency to put into practice. I think they do an especially awful job with it but I appreaciate that it is a really hard balance to strike. reply sneak 14 hours agorootparentTobacco kills 7x as many people each hour, day, and month as opioids in the USA, and it’s available everywhere without a prescription.The Sacklers aren’t the problem here, corruption is. reply manquer 12 hours agorootparentThis is not really a good argument, there are many things that kill a lot of people , The manner and type of lives lost is important also the nature of impact.People aren’t dying very young with tobacco addiction for the most part. There is cancer in youth sure , but tobacco is not the leading cause of that .People who die of tobacco related illnesses are functioning adults and contributing members of society for the vast majority of their lives .The disruption to the lives of drug addicts and their friends and family far exceeds those faced by tobacco addicts.Not everything is a conspiracy or corruption people only react to what they see, the impact of drugs is far more visceral and immediate than tobacco or say obesity which kills even more, so pressure for legislation is higherIf tobacco killed because the of one wrongly cut cigarette you smoked , it would require prescription too reply 221qqwe 11 hours agorootparentDo people die from prescription opioids that often? I assumed that most of the deaths occur when people who are addicted lose access to legal sources and are forced to buy illegally (so risk of overdose and other complications is much higher)? reply manquer 4 hours agorootparentThat is exactly why legal sources which are prescription exists, because it is easy to kill oneself by taking a illegal pill of unknown quality, such risks are not common with tobacco.The regulation is a function of that, not how many people are killed by one item or other, it is merely just how easy is it die of OD with a poorly sourced drug, is why we have FDA and regulations etc is my point. reply trimethylpurine 4 hours agorootparentprevInteresting theory. I would guess that&#x27;s rare and that more often than not, people are overdosing on prescriptions that they lied to obtain and then abused, or purchased on the street from someone who received the prescriptions but didn&#x27;t need them. I&#x27;m speaking from personal experiences, but of course, it&#x27;s anecdotal. reply sneak 11 hours agorootparentprev> there are many things that kill a lot of peopleThe FDA doesn&#x27;t have jurisdiction over \"many things\".I personally think the FDA shouldn&#x27;t exist, or should not have power to regulate (and should be a toothless advisory&#x2F;certification authority). That said, if they are to exist, they should do their job. They&#x27;re not. We&#x27;re paying the bill but not getting the service.Same goes with OSHA. Every casino in Las Vegas demands their employees work in rooms filled with tobacco smoke. Why? Money. It&#x27;s pure corruption.We have the rules, they&#x27;re just not enforced, because if you have enough cash flow, you get a special carve-out so that the rules that apply to everyone else don&#x27;t apply to you.Big Tobacco gets it from the FDA. Big Telecom gets it from the FCC. Boeing gets it from the FAA. It&#x27;s everywhere, and once you see it, you can&#x27;t unsee it. We&#x27;re paying billions and billions for these huge bureaucracies and they&#x27;re only pretending to provide us with the service they exist to provide. reply manquer 3 hours agorootparent> The FDA doesn&#x27;t have jurisdiction over \"many things\".The FDA has jurisdiction over tobacco[2] and various food products contributing to obesity and those are the only two examples highlighted by OP or me in the thread.> We&#x27;re paying the bill but not getting the service.Don&#x27;t think we are, there is very little money for Food part of FDA, in the last 5-6 years the money for food has gone from 1,037M(2018) to 1,145(2022)[1] which in real terms considering inflation means it has gone down and last 30 years it has been similar story.Last Week Tonight had a recent in depth segment on how little resource we have for food enforcement[3] sometimes as little as singe digit inspectors for an entire industry.We don&#x27;t really enforce food regulations, because we don&#x27;t fund the regulatory body for food safety.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crsreports.congress.gov&#x2F;product&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;R&#x2F;R44576, compare that Drugs moved from 1,330 to 2,116M in the same time period.[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fda.gov&#x2F;tobacco-products[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Za45bT41sXg+ reply jkmcf 7 hours agorootparentprevYou are paying for the rules, not the enforcement.

Preventative medicine is cheaper reply throwawaymaths 6 hours agorootparentIt&#x27;s not necessarily. If you live long enough you die of things like Alzheimer&#x27;s or diabetes, chronic lived disease, e.g which are incredibly expensive. reply snapetom 11 hours agoparentprev> The US doesn&#x27;t have one healthcare system, it has 50+This is a fact that people, non-US but also many US Americans ourselves, have a really hard time in understanding. The vast majority of laws are left to the states. It&#x27;s just incredibly hard to get national laws, and as a consequence, we have relatively few national laws. For example, there isn&#x27;t a national standard for murder, there are 50+. Well, there is one if you commit the murder in a post office, but outside the post office, you&#x27;re in the other 50 definitions.It&#x27;s a miracle even the half-baked ACA got passed in this context. reply cogman10 11 hours agorootparent> It&#x27;s a miracle even the half-baked ACA got passed in this context.Federal law trumps state law. And, in fact, we do have 3 national healthcare implementations, Medicare, Medicaid, and Vertaren Affairs healthcare.Socializing healthcare could be done easily under the commerce clause of the constitution, but that doesn&#x27;t happen because it&#x27;s not popular among elected officials (it&#x27;s only popular among the most progressive Democrats, for everyone else it&#x27;s a no).ACA was so half baked and all over the board because there was a lot of carve outs to win over centrist Democrats. A much simpler \"Medicare for all\" could be implemented simply by changing the Medicare statute&#x27;s enrollment age to 0.The reason national laws are so hard is the filibuster in the Senate and the fact that Republicans are pretty much universally opposed to expanding government healthcare. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with there being 50 states. reply cityofdelusion 10 hours agorootparentThis is overly-simplified. I’ve worked in healthcare IT, specifically billing and coding. The reforms needed are much, much more than simply setting Medicare’s enrollment age to 0, especially with the thousands of pages of weird exclusions and conditions enshrined into Medicare over the years.Also this is slightly pedantic, but your examples are NOT national health systems. The closest thing in the U.S. is military medicine, which is (mostly) federally funded with doctors working for and paid by the government. reply cogman10 10 hours agorootparent> This is overly-simplified.Not really.

I wasn&#x27;t arguing that those systems are perfect.> The reforms needed are much, much more than simply setting Medicare’s enrollment age to 0Agree> especially with the thousands of pages of weird exclusions and conditions enshrined into Medicare over the years.I agree to an extent. The thing is, healthcare is messy regardless. I simply could not imagine any healthcare payment system that wasn&#x27;t fairly complex to code out.> Also this is slightly pedantic, but your examples are NOT national health systems. The closest thing in the U.S. is military medicine, which is (mostly) federally funded with doctors working for and paid by the government.Agree, and honestly if I had my way I&#x27;d nationalize healthcare top to bottom. Capitalism is a race to the bottom with healthcare. There&#x27;s no real incentive to produce quality (you have a captured market). That incentive is to raise prices as high as possible and cut staff as lean as possible. reply snapetom 10 hours agorootparent> argued there couldn&#x27;t be a national healthcare system in the US.That is an strange and reactionary misconstruction. My whole comment was talking about the misunderstanding of US Federalism. Healthcare was a flippant comment as an example in the closing sentence. reply snapetom 10 hours agorootparentprev> Federal law trumps state lawWhere do I dispute that?> The reason national laws are so hard is the filibuster in the Senate and the fact that Republicans are pretty much universally opposed to expanding government healthcare. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with there being 50 states.That&#x27;s a very narrow historical view. Look at any landmark laws passed that have significance on an average person&#x27;s life - ACA, 2008 Bank Bailout, Patriot Act, AWB. They are few and far between compared to other Western democracies. reply cogman10 9 hours agorootparent> Where do I dispute that?I probably read too much into your earlier comment, but it seemed like your discussion of state laws meant national ones would be harder to pass.To the rest of your comment.Federal laws have been historically a lot easier to pass, the gridlock of DC is (semi) recent history that started around the 90s.Regan kicked the Republicans down a path of deregulation and privatization of the gov. Bush Srs loss from \"no new taxes\" started the \"never compromise\" attitude of Republicans. Newt Gingrich codified that under Clinton. And with Obama we saw basically the end of any sort of major across the isle legislation.I don&#x27;t know why you are saying this is a narrow view. From roughly Eisenhower to Regan, major federal laws were fairly common. national highways, NLRB, social security, Medicare, EPA, CCC, OSHA, various federal law enforcement, etc. These all have pretty high impacts on day to day life. reply scotty79 14 hours agoparentprev> Europe does not have one healthcare system.And yet pretty much every single one of those is more equitable and efficient than what US can muster. reply Trow83949 13 hours agorootparentOK, in Czechia:- there is a big debate if doctors should serve 24 hours without break (non stop) in hospital.- doctors may be forced to operate after 24 hours of non stop work. I know for fact anesthesiologist who did so. We have VERY strict regulations for truck drivers to only drive 8 hours per day...- there are no basic medications in pharmacy, like penicillin or anti fever sirup for kids- you pay 8% medical income tax (it is called insurance), but there is no chance to find dentist or GP. So you go private an pay it out of pocket- no chance to sue doctor or hospital for mistreatment. I could tell stories about tampons and tools forgotten inside patient...- we have highest numbers of doctors per capita in Europe, yet system is very inefficient- doctors spend about 40% of their time with paperwork- base salary for doctor (without overtimes) is very low, they would not even qualify for mortgage..- once I waited 12 hours at emergency room in public hospital (with life threatening condition), at end I gave up, and went to private clinic. I took second job to pay it... reply alphabettsy 12 hours agorootparentWhen seeing “pretty much” anywhere in the EU, Czechia certainly wouldn’t seem to come to mind and doesn’t seem like an argument in good faith.It may be the EU, but why not use a more comparable country? reply qwytw 11 hours agorootparentWhy? I mean Czechia is below average in most economic indicators but not by that much, it&#x27;s far from being the poorest EU country. reply alphabettsy 10 hours agorootparentThis seems obvious, but choosing a poorer EU country when the commenter already left room for exceptions when the said “pretty much” to compare to the US is not an argument in good faith. reply qwytw 10 hours agorootparentWell it&#x27;s not exactly Massachusetts but it seems to be on par with Florida, Vermont, Michigan, Maine etc. if you look at GDP per capita (relatively). I don&#x27;t think Czechia is somehow exceptionally poor (of course on the whole the EU is much poorer on average). reply alphabettsy 10 hours agorootparentLet’s focus on the argument in good faith part then because it’s not. It seems to squarely fall within the provided exception.This is pointless. Go tell someone who’s been there with a straight face that Czechia is basically like Florida or Michigan. Have a good weekend. reply Trow83949 57 minutes agorootparentThis GDP argument is useless. Before war Russia had GDP comparable to Italy, it should collapse in a few days after sanctions, and we all know how it went! replylocal_crmdgeon 11 hours agorootparentprevCzechia is a more average EU country than Germany, which is the actual outlier reply qwytw 11 hours agorootparent> the actual outlierHow so? GDP per capita:Germany, $52kEU avg, $40kCzechia, $30k reply bugglebeetle 13 hours agorootparentprevYeah, the parent is nothing beside a long-winded appeal to American exceptionalism, which is tantamount to a defense of corrupt, rent-seeking regime that almost every other wealthy democracy has avoided. I struggle to find why anyone thinks it insightful vs. demonstrative of the tedious lengths one has to go to obfuscate and engage in these apologetics. The US is only a special case in that it is remarkably unrestrained in how much it allows the rich to harm the poor relative to other first world countries. reply vinni2 13 hours agorootparentprevAnd all European Union countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland or the United Kingdom offer a European healthcare card when traveling. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ec.europa.eu&#x2F;social&#x2F;main.jsp?catId=559 reply saiya-jin 13 hours agorootparentprevWell the starting premise is very different, so yes the results are also dramatically different.US, for better or worse, is much more individualistic society, without much emotions for plight of other citizens. Sort of buddhistic&#x2F;hinduistic approach - if you suffer now, you must have done terrible things in your past life to deserve it, and why should I interfere.This results in tons of wonderful things in economy but messes up quite a bit too and brings some bad incentives where they shouldn&#x27;t be. You don&#x27;t want to be below average&#x2F;median income (and say have some health issues on top of that), the quality of life is significantly worse than similarly-positioned peers in say Western Europe. But everybody looks at the top 0.1%, which fares, at least financially better.Strange place and setup for me and not in a good way, but maybe our more egalitarian and friendly&#x2F;helpful approach is too naive and harsher society is more robust. We shall see. reply qwytw 11 hours agorootparent> But everybody looks at the top 0.1%, which fares, at least financially better.Let&#x27;s be fair it&#x27;s at the very least 10% (maybe up to 30-40% if not more) that are doing better financially than they would in Europe under similar circumstances (education, career etc. wise). In certain sectors like tech it&#x27;s not even close.e.g. real estate even in SF, NY, San Jose is significantly cheaper than for instance in Munich, Rome, Paris, Milan, London etc. when compared to median income.Also it&#x27;s not that obvious to me that Americans are that much less likely to care about &#x27;the plight&#x27; of others on an individual level. For instances Americans donate many times more to charity on average than Europeans do (which makes sense if you expect the government to take care of everyone, but let&#x27;s not equate that with intervening directly...) reply saiya-jin 2 hours agorootparent> e.g. real estate even in SF, NY, San Jose is significantly cheaper than for instance in Munich, Rome, Paris, Milan, London etc. when compared to median income.You are just hiding in complexities of real life and reducing it into few trivial numbers that are easy to compare. Count in good education for say 2 kids (500k-1 million per head?) which is free here, count in healthcare costs if you live long enough to start accumulating health problems that are basically unsolvable by today&#x27;s medicine. Free here.I don&#x27;t know the actual numbers, and they are very individual so what you say may be actually true for you, but it certainly isn&#x27;t true for me for example. Also, personal freedom is higher in Western Europe (debatable, but for me what I define as personal freedom is severely lacking in US). High criminality. Basically police state. Effectively a caste society based on your wealth&#x2F;income. Your taxes sometimes pay for killing innocent poor people half around the world (true for few european states too, but definitely not mine). And so on. But its nigh impossible to put some simple numbers on those things we generally call quality of life. reply scotty79 14 hours agoparentprev> In the US healthcare is 1&#x2F;5 or more of the entire economy, so who profits from 1&#x2F;5 of all US economic activity is a silly premise.It&#x27;s really not. If you asked the same question about Russia and their oil economy and oligarchs it would be perfectly reasonable despite the size. reply neotrope 15 hours agoparentprevThanks for this.How much are regulations to blame for this mess? ie if we cut regulation, would that lead to lower cost and better outcomes?What is the path to fix this? reply duffpkg 15 hours agorootparentThere is not one silver bullet or even hundred or thousands of bullets that are going to magically re-engineer 1&#x2F;5 of the US economy. Measuring costs is really hard, measuring outcomes is even that much harder -- maybe more or less impossible in the aggregate.The heart of the question comes back to what you actually want to fix. I don&#x27;t know you. A lot of people would just like to pay less for the thing they currently receive which is a nice sentiment but often hard to resolve. A large set of those people are actually upset because they have been led to believe they are paying a lot more than other people for the same thing, which I do not believe to be actually true.One solution that does seem palatable to a lot of people, not me, but a lot, is \"I would like like to appear to pay less for what I receive while the real costs are hidden and subsidized in a way that is much less visible to me\". While popular this view is not popular enough to adopt legislation to that effect.In practical terms detailed policy legislation that makes losers out of a lot of low value transactional middle men would see some very meaningful across the board cost reductions, probably 7-10% (500 billion or more). Top of that list would be intelligent standardization and regulation of transactional medical billing process. This would&#x2F;could look a little bit like how we regulate banking between financial institutions. Very sexy I know. reply s1artibartfast 14 hours agorootparentI think One \"silver bullet\" would be to give the patient more skin in the game when selecting treatments and balancing cost&#x2F;benefit.The current system is a tragedy of the commons. Costs are opaque and distributed. Patients have insurance and may as well buy the most expensive treatment (everybody else is doing it). There is nobody in the entire health system with incentives to trade 1% less benefit for 99% cost reduction.In Europe, this is often handled by government purchasing discretion (not price caps as many simplistically believe). If X treatment is too expensive, it simply isnt covered. If generics medication get 99% of the job done, that is what you get.This might mean replacing employee healthcarecare with employee payments, MORE copays, and more transparent pricing (there has already been some improvement in this area).If a CT cost is 10x at one hospital, and 1x at the other, the patient needs an incentive to seek out the 1X cost. Similar, if one cancer drug is 10k and the other 100k, with a life extension of X days, the patient is the only one that can really make the call. reply AnthonyMouse 13 hours agorootparentThe way this should work is that providers have to publish their prices for each service and then insurers publish how much they pay regardless of where you go, which might be something like 90% of the median price, i.e. the equivalent of a 10% copay.But then the patient can go to whichever provider they want. The one across the street from you charges $3000 more than the one which is a two hour drive away? It&#x27;s your $3000 and it&#x27;s your two hours each way.You might even find a provider that charges less than your insurance pays, and then you could put the balance in your HSA for the next time it isn&#x27;t.We keep trying to pretend that some important price negotiation is happening between bureaucracies that has to be preserved, but a CT scan for example is a standard service. If the prices had to be published and put in a database where patients can see them, you don&#x27;t need anyone to negotiate anything, people would just choose the one with the best price absent some specific reason to do otherwise, which would exert a downward pressure on prices that doesn&#x27;t currently exist. reply polygamous_bat 14 hours agorootparentprev> In Europe, this is often handled by government purchasing discretion (not price caps as many simplistically believe).

The cost issue would still remain in general.> spends less of their income on healthcare, even after taxes are included.This is the legitimate criticism of the US system, but it doesn&#x27;t tell you what to do about it. For example, Medicare in the US still pays more for equivalent care than many other countries do, so just putting everyone on Medicare without changing anything else wouldn&#x27;t resolve the high costs in the US. And might even make Medicare look even worse because Medicare is in many ways currently subsidized by the high cost of private insurance.None of that proves that you can&#x27;t address the high costs without a socialized system -- but making the necessary reforms isn&#x27;t easy for the same reason that bringing about your own proposal in the US isn&#x27;t easy.

It looks like they stood up to some asshole hospital, they’re giving you an amazing deal, and that healthcare would be impossibly expensive without them.Not that everyone else is jacking up their posted prices for the purpose of negotiating with the insurance companies.> Chargemaster rates serve as baselines when negotiating the rates at which these payers will reimburse hospitals, which is why they&#x27;re often much higher than actual costs.

Some services such as CT scans have charge-to-cost ratios of almost 30, while others like routine inpatient procedures are much lower at only 1.8.> Insured patients do not normally pay chargemaster rates, since their payer reimburses at the negotiated rate and passes on any co-pays and below-deductible responsibilities.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;healthcaremba.gwu.edu&#x2F;blog&#x2F;chargemaster-hospital-adm... reply rjtavares 16 hours agoparentprevYou don&#x27;t know why doctors don&#x27;t build their own hospitals, yet feel you are knowledgeable enough to identify \"hospitals\" as the real villains of the whole system? reply haspoken 17 hours agoprevhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;Typim reply infogulch 17 hours agoparentWhen I complete the captcha it responds with a 429 Too Many Requests and fails to load. reply lolinder 15 hours agorootparentYou shouldn&#x27;t see a Cloudflare captcha at all, if you do then you&#x27;re probably using Cloudflare as your DNS.The guy who maintains archive.today and friends has beef with Cloudflare for leaving off certain location information from their DNS requests, so he redirects all traffic coming from their DNS servers right back to Cloudflare. reply ridgeguy 16 hours agorootparentprevAlternate, works for me.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;u3HmK reply MallocVoidstar 17 hours agorootparentprevTry changing the link to one of their other domains, like .today or .vn.

It took a but of convincing the front clerk I knew what I was doing, he couldn&#x27;t add it up in his brain how it was cheeper not to go through insurance.Now imagine managing your health was like running your car. Everytime you went to the gas station you would pay a fixed amount through insurance, but you&#x27;re only allowed to gas up once every two weeks. Need car repair? I agine your mechanic calling your car insurance to try to get the work approved -- you need a brake job, and instead of costing $500 it will cost $5000, but since the mechanic is in-network they have pre-negotiated the rate to $600 and you pay that amount until you hit your annual deductible of $5000 for the year.The system is built for manipulation, anti-competitive practices and fraud. Think about it. Who wins? Everyone except the consumer, who has been convinced its the only way to transact is through insurance, and if it were just bigger and more centralized it would certainly be more efficient so lets get a single-payer system! That will be the final nail in the coffin of our world-class healthcare in the US. There will be no more specialization, as the system will incentivize (if not demand) commoditization of skills and services. reply colinmorelli 13 hours agoparentThis is one of those things that sounds really great - and would be helpful - but not have the significant impact that it might initially seem outside of prescription medication.The reality is that price transparency already is federally mandated and you can get a list of every contracted rate for every procedure any doctor that is credentialed with your health plan will perform. They’re all available on every national payer’s directory in a machine readable format and updated every month. Startups have formed around making this data available to consumers. This has been the case for a while (well, the number of procedures was limited before, but the concept still existed). It made headlines years ago.The problem is three-fold (there are multiple but these tend to be the most problematic):1) It’s almost impossible to know, for any non-trivial visit, the actual procedures that will be performed. This makes price shopping almost impossible to begin with. Not only is it difficult to understand up front, it can (and does, with regularity) change halfway through the procedure - sometimes even after the fact if the procedure was improperly coded. To some extent this is just a result of an overly bloated and complicated billing machine, but it’s a real issue today.2) Healthcare consumers at their most vulnerable (and, typically, most expensive) are not in a mental space to be price shopping for care. Savvy individuals might comparison shop before an orthopedic surgery, but nobody who just suffered cardiac arrest or was diagnosed with cancer will spend weeks finding the affordable doctor.3) Healthcare is an intensely personal and emotional interaction. People don’t want to price shop for care even if they can and are in the headspace for it. You don’t want the budget doctor performing the bypass surgery, you want the good one if that’s an option for you.This can and likely will change in the future.

Hospitals saw a cash cow and bought up a ton of small oncology clinics and brought them in house.

The ACA introduced a 85% medical loss ratio. I thought that required them to spend 85% of premiums on payouts. That limits profits to an obvious maximum of 15%, but there are other expenses (advertising and so on) that also cut into that 15%. In practice, maximum profit will be lower than 15%.That said, I haven’t gone into this in tremendous depth, so I’m kinda hoping someone can confirm or deny my understanding. reply supertrope 16 hours agorootparentprevVertical integration helps reduce the double margin problem. Instead of each middleman needing their own profit margin, a vertically integrated company can earn e.g. 5% on the entire operation.

Those people have jobs which allow them to participate in consumption, which makes US industry look good because they have revenue they can report as earnings.It&#x27;s real money because of the sovereign fiat nature of the US dollar, but it&#x27;s not necessarily value.

Americans demand cutting edge maximum intervention perfectly safe treatment with no formal government rationing, or HMO rationing.Health care is a for profit sector. Fees are paid by third parties (so patients are not directly exposed to routine costs). There is heavy quality regulation. Providers are incentivized to treat more through fee for service so the sicker you get and the more procedures they perform the more revenue they earn (perverse incentive). There is no counterweight to negotiate prices down. The end result is 7% medical inflation per year. reply killjoywashere 12 hours agorootparentHospitals make the lions share of the profits. Non-corporate hospital owners are famously poor managers and tend to spend the money not wisely until they go bankrupt, then a corporate system buys the hospital, restructures, and takes all the profit. See HCA, Tenet, Partners, Mayo, Stanford, Anthem, etc. Fun fact, HCA was cofounded by Bill Frist&#x27;s father. Bill Frist became a cardiac surgeon, then a US senator for Tennessee. At one point he built another healtchare system and sold it to Anthem.You&#x27;d think the medical schools might remain independent under their universities, but that often turns out to not be the case as well. Turns out asking for handouts from the endowment looks a lot like bankruptcy, and the rest of the university takes a dim view of it, especially considering how home addresses of their physician colleagues (hint: very large houses in the best neighborhoods). See Tulane, Georgetown, etc. The state school systems, like the UCs, tend to do better, or are at least shielded by the state budget.If you point to Mayo, Stanford, and Partners as exceptions, I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re the exceptions that prove the rule.

They are the intermediaries—insurers, chemists, drug distributors and pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs)—sitting between patients and their treatments. In 2022 the combined revenue of the nine biggest middlemen—call them big health—equated to nearly 45% of America’s health-care bill, up from 25% in 2013.Their answer to the question \"who profits most?\" is this category of company.

    "originBody": "WHO WE ARE OUR VISION OUR TEAM PARTNERS PRESS CONTACT OUR WORK MISSIONS INITIATIVES TECHNOLOGIES Nanofiche Small storage, for forever. SUPPORT THIS TECH → NANOFICHE: SPACE-AGE ARCHIVAL STORAGE The Arch Mission Foundation chose a new technology — nickel based films of Nanofiche™ — for the Arch Lunar Library.™ We chose Nanofiche because it is ideally suited to preserving large amounts of analog format information in the harsh environment of space and the surface of the Moon. When it comes to preserving data in extreme environments, such as outer space, the surfaces and atmospheres of planets, or underground or underwater, there really is no alternative to Nanofiche today. There is no other archival technology that we know of that is space-grade, lightweight, highly durable and efficient, and ready for prime-time today. Nanofiche is the only viable solution for these scenarios. WHAT IS NANOFICHE? Nanofiche is a new analog archival preservation media that overcomes the limitations of existing technologies. Unlike other alternatives, nickel-based Nanofiche never degrades and never has to be replaced. Nickel does not oxidize, has no half-life, and can withstand electromagnetic radiation, high heat, extreme cold, and exposure to the elements, microbes, and many types of chemicals, for thousands of years or longer on Earth. Nanofiche can also store up to 2,000 analog pages of text at 150 dpi, per square centimeter. For example a 20 x 20 mm nickel Nanofiche sheet can hold up to 8,000 pages of text rendered at 150 dpi. At this resolution, a letter size page of Nanofiche would hold up to 1.2 million analog images and pages of text! If the content to be preserved contains photos, then the output must be rendered at double the resolution (300 dpi) to reduce pixelation and increase image quality. Because photos are rendered to Nanofiche in grayscale diffusion dithers, it effectively reduces the capacity to from 1.2 million images, to 300,000 analog images, per letter size sheet of Nanofiche. For greater image quality, at 600 dpi, Nanofiche can still hold an impressive 150,000 analog images of pages and photos, per single 8.5”*11” sheet. It also worth noting that Nanofiche primarily stores data in analog format, but can also be used to encode digital data for archival preservation as well — either as analog images of digital bitmaps, or in native digital formats (such as DVD format). HOW LONG DOES NANOFICHE LAST? The Pyramids and the hieroglyphics they contain are still readable, thousands of years after being built and abandoned. But, ironically, for all our advances, our civilization’s records are far more delicate than those of ancient civilizations that used stone and metal to capture their knowledge. If there was a national or global catastrophe, the majority of our knowledge and data would be immediately inaccessible, and then gone without a trace in 50 years or less. Within a few decades to a few hundred years after such an event, all our paper records would decay as well, leaving only dust. THE EPHEMERALITY OF THE DIGITAL AGE The digital data that our present-day civilization depends on is stored in, and accessed with, plastic and other unstable materials. These materials oxidize and decay in only a few decades or less, or even faster if exposed to water, chemicals, or extreme temperatures. The computer equipment and electronic devices that power the world - from phones to the server farms that drive the Internet and all major corporations and governments, are also highly vulnerable to electromagnetic radiation. In the event of a major solar storm, or an EMP attack, nuclear blast, or high energy cosmic energy burst, anything not protected by military-grade shielding would be lost. And then there are all the ordinary risks, like loss of power, power surges, fires, floods, and other natural disasters that can destroy or prevent use of our information technologies and storage media. In short, our digitally-dependent civilization’s technologies make it increasingly vulnerable to a variety of risks. MICROFICHE: 1960’S ARCHIVAL The only sure-fire way to guarantee that important information can be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event, is to back it up with specialized archival media that are designed to survive and be recoverable, even without access to computers and electronics. The preferred technology for critical long-term backups is analog archival storage. However, today nearly all such storage uses an decades-old film-based media called microfiche. Microfiche is a fragile, film-based media, invented in 1961, that stores data as optical images on film — literally, tiny photographs. Microfiche is created using camera systems and retrieved using mechanical optical microfiche readers that, if you are over 30, you may have encountered in a library when you were in school. The weaknesses of Microfiche While microfiche is certainly more durable than any form of paper or magnetic media, and even most optical media, it is delicate, perishable, costly to maintain, and takes up far more physical space than Nanofiche. Microfiche is sensitive to environmental conditions and must be carefully maintained. It is vulnerable to humidity, heat, and water damage. It requires HVAC to maintain a proper temperature and humidity environment to preserve it. Sustained loss of power that disables HVAC, or damage from natural disasters such as floods, can result in total loss or damage that requires costly replacement or salvage operations. Microfiche has a life expectancy of 400 to 800 years, if maintained continuously under ideal conditions. However most State Archives only certify microfiche for 25 to 50 years, after which point a new copy of the media must be generated to be certain that records are preserved. . Microfiche is also not very space efficient compared to today’s digital media. Microfiche typically stores 0.4 pages per square centimeter. A typical sheet or card of microfiche is 3” x 5” or 9 x 12 cm and contains 40 pages of text, with a reduction equivalent of about 25 times. A letter size format sheet of microfiche would hold only about 250 pages of text, compared to up to 1.2 million pages of text in Nanofiche. While there are some forms of microfiche that can store slightly more pages per sheet, they are not widely used and are still not comparable to Nanofiche’s capacity. Due to the dual necessities of HVAC and replacement, and the physical space requirements of microfiche storage, and the need for old-fashioned microfiche readers, the total cost-of ownership of microfiche grows with time WHO MAKES NANOFICHE? Nanofiche is a new medium, that is only supplied by a single vendor. Nanofiche is a patented, proprietary product of Stamper Technology, under license from NanoIP. The technology underlying Nanofiche is based on the inventions and technology of Arch Mission Foundation Chief Scientist, Bruce Ha, a senior research scientist who invented the technology for PictureCD technology while at Kodak. WHAT ARE THE NICKEL NANOFICHE SPECIFICATIONS? • Deep blue laser technology optically reduced to a 100nm focus point. • Text at 0.003 point size can be printed at 1,000 pages per minute lithographically per printer. • Size of each character of text is 1 micron, or the size of a bacillus bacterium. A page fits within the width of a human hair. • 1.2 million pages of 200 dpi images or text can fit on a single 8.5 inch * 11 inch letter-sized sheet of Nanofiche. • The master is written to glass at 300,000 dpi and then is electro deposited into nickel. • Elemental nickel has melting point of 2,651 F. • Los Alamos environmentally tested writing on nickel at high temperature (570 F) and found no degradation up to the longest test time of 65h as measured by SEM at 20,000X. • Longevity of engraved content expected to last billions of years, if undisturbed, for example, in outer space. On the surface of the Moon, we project 50 million years or longer (depending on how it is protected). On the surface of the Earth, at least 10,000 years (or up to millions of years if below the surface). • Every page is encoded with diffractive security features as a special flag as well. • Covered by US patents 8717650, 8264757, 7961367, 7830573 🚀 Archive your name forever.

If you&#x27;re really trying to preserve basic knowledge to restart civilization, I&#x27;d think you&#x27;d want libraries of full-size readable books spread across the world. Not something that requires you to first build a microscope.While if you&#x27;re trying to store as much historical and technological data as possible, it seems like you&#x27;d want to encode it digitally with error correction codes, not as optically readable text. The encoding&#x2F;decoding instructions can easily fit on a single cover page, optically encoded. reply Clamchop 11 hours agoparentYou&#x27;re focusing on how hard it will be to read but the central thrust is whether it is recoverable at all.Can&#x27;t read what no longer exists, by any means.Paper disintegrates without maintenance. Tape disintegrates. Hard drives lose magnetization. SSDs lose their charge states. Stone erodes. Several of these won&#x27;t survive fire, water, magnetic fields, or radiation.Also, I don&#x27;t see why you couldn&#x27;t store digital data on this, for example as pits and lands, or base 64 text, or some other scheme, with error correction of your choice. (But if it&#x27;s as durable as they say, it&#x27;s not as necessary.) But, that requires additional effort to decode.I enjoy research into highly stable means of storing data. I think Microsoft Research was developing a technique of storing data in a 3D arrangement in glass. Very fascinating. reply bastawhiz 9 hours agorootparent> Paper disintegrates without maintenance. Tape disintegrates. Hard drives lose magnetization. SSDs lose their charge states. Stone erodes. Several of these won&#x27;t survive fire, water, magnetic fields, or radiation.Computers, peripherals, microscopes, and any other devices needed to access some incredibly durable archival format will also degrade. The information needed to produce new ones will need to be archived, and that material will degrade and need archiving.Do you know how much information is necessary to describe all of the details relevant to producing an extremely good microscope from scratch? It&#x27;s not just the parts and materials, it&#x27;s the entirety of the supply chain: the mining, refining, electronics, power production, and everything else. All of that information needs to be accessibly preserved.So it begs the question, is it really easier to make the prerequisite for the information&#x27;s use be a working precision instrument or is it easier to just actively maintain lots of copies of less durable materials like books?If the sky falls tomorrow, how many years is some archive really useful for in any format? Most of a sturdy, well-designed library of books will probably survive for a decade. A good percentage will probably survive a century. On the other hand, a high precision microscope probably won&#x27;t \"just work\" after a decade or two of sitting around disused in unideal conditions. A working power supply would probably last even less time.We must accept that there&#x27;s some ongoing upkeep of an archive regardless of how durable its contents are. And while a book isn&#x27;t as durable as some quartz or other fancy material, you can pretty easily make books to replace old ones even in pretty miserable conditions (we did it for centuries, albeit at great cost). There&#x27;s a remarkably high cost to making sure there&#x27;s a working microscope around, and keeping the information and resources necessary to make new ones and repair existing ones available. reply flir 9 hours agorootparentI think it would be reasonable to store a fixed-focus compound microscope as part of your archive. That&#x27;s basically a tube and a couple of lenses, and it gets you to 500x right off the bat.But if you want to be doubly sure, include instructions for making a hand lens at 1x, and instructions for making a microscope at 5x. reply idiotsecant 9 hours agorootparentprevWe&#x27;ve been able to manage to make very good microscopes for quite a while.

Just add \"analog\" images of unicode tables covering all used symbols, and any used error correction format.But if this is trying to entice libraries with \"replace your microfiche with this easier to maintain format, and do something for history while you are at it\" then you need to store scans of newspapers, magazines, etc. Which probably means storing PNGs or similar. At that point, I&#x27;m not sure the capacity improvement over \"analog\" optically readable images is really worth the much more complex decoding setup.Both for the library use case and for the \"a civilization that might not speak our language wants to decode this\" use case the complexity of the decoding setup is a major factor. reply mlyle 4 hours agorootparentSince this is using halftoning and discrete dots, it&#x27;s technically \"digital\".

Optimistically we&#x27;ll be able to store all our collective knowledge in all accessible formats, digital &#x2F; internet accessible, libraries, etc.But nobody can see the future. Having this as a backup sounds great. Archive all of e.g. Wikipedia, put it in a time capsule along with a microscope and&#x2F;or readable instructions on how to make one, make thousands of them and put them in landmarks, caves, monuments, dumb sattelites that are designed to land on ground in 10.000 years, the moon, around the sun with a homing signal (e.g. reflective surface since electronics won&#x27;t work after 1000 years), etc.A library can catch fire, the earth may get glassed in WW3, but surely some of these would then survive for future generations or alien archeologists in the millennia to come. reply simpaticoder 10 hours agoparentprevStrictly speaking you only need books enough to teach the reader to build up to an optical 100x microscope and then use that to access the rest. Eventually you teach them how to build blue lasers and rockets to scan the silica bricks you engraved and stashed in a moon cave for \"everything else\". reply bastawhiz 9 hours agorootparentHow useful are books about building an optical 100x+ microscope from scratch to people who have survived a global catastrophic event? Relearning how to make blue lasers is probably extremely low on the list of priorities compared to, say, farming or desalinization. You&#x27;d be relying on a fairly niche group of apocalypse survivors to actively preserve the knowledge of microscope production so that someday in the not-very-near future someone might want to learn about quarks or sixteenth century music.It makes a lot of sense to make the most useful information for apocalypse survivors the most accessible information. Just make books about that information and keep them maintained. Then there&#x27;s at least incentive to keep the books protected and maintained.Edit: it sounds like you&#x27;d probably need a 1000x to 10000x microscope to really read the nanofiche described in this article. So a potter&#x27;s wheel is probably not sufficient. Plus, you&#x27;d need the materials and tools for working with glass, which might not even be feasible in an apocalypse. reply vorpalhex 9 hours agorootparentAn apocalypse is not a weird time reset. You still have giant glass furnaces and propane and even industrial control systems.The tech that survives is probably an odd amalgamation, but chemistry is basically the thing you really want for society - antibiotics, explosives, and fuel. reply bastawhiz 9 hours agorootparentHow can you keep propane production, giant glass furnaces, and industrial control systems working but you can&#x27;t maintain a few hundred warehouses of \"normal\" archival material? Or just continuing to print books? reply krisoft 2 hours agorootparentThe trick is that you would need to keep the archival material “continously” while the microscope tech can be lost, forgotten, rediscovered, and then used to read the material.That is if you have a thousand year gap in your archival material warehouse maintenance the data is lost. If you have a thousand year gap in your ability to make microscopes the data will wait around patiently. replyjazzyjackson 10 hours agoparentprevI think its fine, microscopes are not that hard to make. If you have a potters&#x27; wheel and some abrasive you could work up to it. Small price for access to the old worlds&#x27; knowledge, certainly easier than building a record player like the voyager probe suggests xD reply extraduder_ire 9 hours agorootparentIf you know what you&#x27;re making, sure. Europeans kind of lucked out historically, since there was a lot of glass technology in the lead up to optics and then microscopes. Historical China got kind of fucked in that regard, since they did have mirrors, but porcelain was so good they never had to get into the glass part of the tech tree. reply Robotbeat 6 hours agorootparentOh… that’s interesting. I’ve never thought of that aspect of why maybe the industrial Revolution took off in Europe but not China. Lenses allowed the development of the telescope, reading glasses (extending working years of scientists and engineers, etc, enabling finer work on clockwork mechanisms), the sextant, the barometer (and thus the study of vacuum that led to steam engines), and the microscope. All that predated the industrial Revolution, laying the scientific groundwork for all that followed.(Obviously things like that are multi-causal, but I had never heard that idea before, that the amazing porcelain of China kind of held back the development of glass and all its many, many applications.) reply Thorrez 7 hours agoparentprevThey&#x27;re storing it on the moon.

But using lorem ipsum, and Verdana, and only uppercase characters, spaces, and periods, I found that you can fit about 49,500 characters in a letter format page at \"150 dpi\" [0]This is 396 million characters in a 2 x 2 cm sheet. The Latin ASCII alphabet has 26 letters, but in my experiment, there were commas and periods. Though at the resolution I used, commas and periods would be difficult do differentiate if there was almost any degradation or printing error. So let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a 27 character set. Maybe we can stick a few more numbers or symbols in there to get to 32, although some numbers like 1, 0, and 5 look like letters, so not all would be usable at this resolution.If each character can represent 32 states, that is equivalent to 5 bits per character. 5 x 396 million is 1.98 short billion bits. That is 247.5 million bytes. Or 247.5 megabytes. This is in 4 square centimeters, so the data density is about 61.9 megabytes per square centimeter.If we give up human readability and the text would be regular language (according to Zipf&#x27;s Law), we could expect up to 0.2 compression ratios. Or 310 megabytes per square centimeter. On the other hand, we could then use quite dense data storage methods like barcodes. But these calculations are a bit pointless because this is meant to be read without a computer.A DVD has a readable surface area of about 89.2 square centimeters on each side (some DVDs are multi-sided) and 4.7 to 8.5 gigabytes of storage in that space. So it stores between 54 and 97.6 megabytes per square centimeter.For storing plain text, it might be on the same order of magnitude in terms of space efficiency as a DVD, but it is human-readable. If the data is not human readable, then it could be at least 5 times more efficient than a DVD. Which is closer to a Blu-ray disk.Back-of-the-napkin, might contain errors, many assumptions made. The goal is to understand the order of magnitude with some errors. In short - it looks like it&#x27;s not 100x more or less efficient than writing a plain text file to a DVD.P.S. I chose Verdana as it was a quite legible sans-serif font. I then created a texture of random black and white pixels, and applied it at 25% opacity to simulate a significant degree of printing error at the supposed resolution they can print at. The font at the chosen size remained just about legible with that kind of interference [1]. The exception is periods and commas, which are difficult to tell apart. That is why I considered them one character before. Making the font even 10% smaller would make it really difficult to read. This is all not grounded in any technique or proper estimation method, I just wanted to show why it seems like going smaller might be difficult.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;Pi8acSk.png [1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;stFkXQy.png reply 10g1k 10 hours agoprevStar Trek magic crystal data storage: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.allaboutcircuits.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;5d-data-storage-how-do... reply calo_star 11 hours agoprevBook-films! reply strken 12 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s really weird to me that this can be patented.

We treat them like criminals, while people who jail and murder intellectuals we call leaders and presidents. We live in an anti-intellectual era right now.Not that it is not important to try. but there are some problems we cant solve by tech alone.

It’s obviously marketing and mission branding, which is only natural in an age where we as employees flock to noble missions. I work in an investment bank as an example, but our investments go into building&#x2F;running&#x2F;improving green energy plants, so while our main mission is to make investors richer we do it by building a better world.I’m not sure I would’ve marketed it exactly this way. But this is because I spent almost a decade in the Danish public sector and I know how revolutionary long term storage will be for public recording. Right now we spent a very high amount of resources on the maintenance of data records that are rarely accessed but are important to public history, accountability and many social sciences. If you could sell those recording organisations a medium that didn’t need near constant maintaining it would free up a lot of resources. Still, maybe it’s a good choice for a company mission considering my earlier points as this tech will essentially sell itself. If it works as well as it’s sold in this article.In the content of hacker news, however, why wouldn’t you expect this to be meant to make its investors money? reply seanhunter 3 minutes agorootparentI don&#x27;t expect it to make its investors money because most VC-style startups don&#x27;t make money and also because it seems to me to be kind of a dumb idea for a few reasons.1)Maybe I&#x27;m wrong but I don&#x27;t think their IP has any kind of protectable moat. I really can&#x27;t see that patent surviving any sort of challenge. So if tehy figure out a business model that works it will get cloned cheaper.2)It&#x27;s an actuarial fact that people overpay for insurance relative to expectation but here they are essentially selling a partial mitigation for a very high severity very low probability event. So the expectation is very low and is highly subject to model calibration error. Potential customers are not going to value this well and I don&#x27;t see people paying them enough to stay in business.I could easily be wrong about both of those things.I know about selling the mission \"Making the world a better place with extensible mobile, social, local middleware APIs\" etc as I think the TV show \"Silicon Valley\" parodied it. Just in this case I dont&#x27; really see either the mission or the commercial reality making much sense.It&#x27;s interesting that the board of advisors has Ben \"I&#x27;m gonna bring the mammoth back to life\" Lamm and David \"Make the statue of Liberty disappear\" Copperfield on it.

But it&#x27;s not -that- exotic.A cheap compound optical microscope might do .4 micron, resulting in letters being 8 times and 4 times the spatial resolution.

On their website they even say the archive is \"believed to be on the surface of the moon\". So maybe they have saved human knowledge and maybe they haven&#x27;t and somehow post apocalypse people just have to figure out how to get to the moon and maybe it will be there waiting for them.Doesn&#x27;t seem tremendously reassuring. reply GuidelinesFAQListsAPISecurityLegalApply to YCContact Search:",

The following document aims to outline the basic requirements for well rounded embedded systems laboratory. In this list, I will focus on devices that I and a few others regularly use for hardware pen testing and research. I will list a range of devices covering various budgets. It should be noted that the following recommendations are my opinion, and none of the links below are affiliate links or anything of the sort. My goal is to help people build out their first lab, not to make money. This guide will also be maintained at the GitHub repository located here - please submit pull requests with your suggestions and favorite tools! Contributors Throughout the development of this guide, I was lucky enough to have some really sharp people offer to help me proofread and provide recommendations for some of the gear listed in this write up, I’ve included their names/handles below: Jeremy Hong Arsenio Menendez Stu Kennedy Ian Hanschen Dreg Workbench First and foremost, you will require a place to perform your work. Depending on your needs this might be a small section on your desk, or you may want an entirely separate workbench. When it comes to choosing a workbench, you’ll quickly find that you can spend a lot of money on a high end standing desk, especially if you’re looking for a larger one. One place you might consider looking is Home Depot / Lowes, I am a big fan of their Husky standing workbench and am currently using two of them in my office. If you’re looking for something more traditional, I have also built a handful of workbench setups using IKEA tabletops and legs, this is a very popular option for workstations. Item Price Link Husky Adjustable Height 46in-72in Workbench $268.00-$398.00 Link Ikea LAGKAPTEN Tabletop $49.99 Link Ikea ADILS Leg $7.50 Link Ikea Drawer Unit (ALEX) $109.99 Link Note: The IKEA drawer units have mounting holes on top of them for attaching to IKEA tabletops which makes assembly extremely simple, and you get the added benefit of extra storage. ESD Protections The last thing that you want to happen is for you to accidentally destroy a device with static electricity, In order to avoid this, it is always a good idea to get an ESD wrist strap or an ESD protective mat. Note: Not all silicone mats that you will find on Amazon are actually anti-static, please make sure that you read the description of the mat that you are going to purchase if ESD protection is a high priority for your workspace (which it should be!)

Soldering Whether you are tearing down a new router or looking for a new target to perform fault injection, you will need to solder at some point during your hardware hacking journey. Soldering is the process of joining metal surfaces with “solder”; creating a conductive connection between the two soldered points. Soldering is useful when populating unused debug pin headers or connecting wires to points on your target circuit board that you wish to interact with. Soldering Irons When looking for a new iron, it is essential to keep your goals in mind: Are you mainly focusing on smaller surface mount device (SMD) rework projects? Will you be working with larger/older components that may need a lot of heat to remove? Ideally, you want an iron with adjustable temperature and removable tips. These can be purchased relatively cheaply from Amazon and other online vendors. I recommend one with an emergency timeout in case you forget to turn off your iron after some late-night soldering. Low Cost Below is a very solid starter kit from Amazon, which makes for a good beginner iron. Before buying a more expensive iron, use this iron to learn proper care and maintenance. KSGER T12 Soldering Station Two other solid options for a beginner iron (at a slightly higher price point) are the Hakko FX888D and Weller WE1010NA. The WE1010NA is the successor to the venerable Weller WES51, which has since been discontinued. For a portable option, the TS-100 or TS-101 is an excellent choice. These are great for travel, have interchangeable tips and are relatively low cost. High Cost For high-end soldering or jobs that require you to solder to smaller components, such as 0402 components, a JBC CDS station with intelligent heat management and sleep/hibernation modes can’t be beaten. This is the station that I have used for quite a while now, and it has been highly reliable and easy to maintain. With this station, you can also get tweezer tips for SMD components, making these jobs much more manageable. It also can be connected to other JBC accessories, such as a fume extractor and other JBC handles. JBC CDS Soldering Station Additional Tips / Cartridges If you have the funds to spare, the JBC DDPE 2-Tool station is great because it lets you have multiple tools active simultaneously. This station comes with micro tweezers and a T210 precision handle, which is compatible with a wide variety of cartridges. JBC DDPE 2-Tool Station Hot Air Stations / Hot Plates Hot air stations and hot plates can both be used when doing SMD rework. Hot plates work as you might expect, they require surface to surface contact in order to heat the target device, allowing for either solder paste or a traditional iron to be used to bond the solder to the contact pads. These of course have some disadvantages, if you are working with a system that has plastic connectors, housings or is a two sided PCB with components on each side you will not be able to effectively use a hotplate without risking damaging the target. Hot plates can be used in conjunction with a hot air gun in order to “preheat” your target, making component removal easier. Low Cost Introductory hot plates are relatively low cost, the Soiiw Microcomputer Soldering Preheating station is a great place to start as it has built-in temperature control and display (helpful for letting others in the lab know that the plate is on!). If you are going for a lower-cost hot air rework station, there are plenty on Amazon. I have used the YIHUA 959D and have had no issues with it. Others have recommended the QUICK 957D Rework Station, which also has excellent reviews! High Cost You will need a hot air station for BGA rework or other package removal. Like a standard soldering station, these can vary in price/quality. A higher-end hot air rework station will allow for precise temperature and airflow control; they will also have a wider variety of hose attachments, allowing for the removal/replacement of smaller components. When working with standard embedded systems, the JBC TESE is an excellent rework station that has multiple suction tips and hose sizes included: JBC TESE Of course, if you are looking to do a lot of SMD rework and reflow on PCBs, you may want to consider the SRS System SMD Rework station. This kit includes an arm, allowing for hands-free operation, as well as a preheater. A preheater is a device used to (as you might have guessed) pre-heat the PCB from below, allowing things to be soldered more easily. The full table of all of the recommended kits can be seen below: Item Price Link Description TS-100 $54.99 Link Low cost, portable soldering iron Soiiw Microcomputer Soldering Preheating station $67.99 Link Low cost pre-heating set up for BGA rework KSGER T12 Soldering Station $69.99 Link Introductory soldering iron with interchangeable tips Sparkfun 8508D Hot-Air Rework Station $99.95 Link Low-cost hot air rework station QUICK 957D Rework Station $125.00 Link Low-cost hot air rework station JBC CDS Soldering Station $595 Link Mid range JBC soldering station JBC DDPE 2-Tool Station $1700 Link JBC station that allows for multiple tools active and includes micro-tweezers and a T210 precision handle JBC TESE $2,690 Link High end hot air rework station with multiple suction adapters SRS System SMD Rework Station $5,750 Link Full SMD rework station, including an manueverable arm and preheater Soldering: Practice Kits These kits are a great way to get comfortable soldering smaller devices and components.

Soldering Crash Course: Basic Techniques SMD Soldering Tutorial BGA Reflowing for Absolute Beginners Hackaday has a great article here about SMD rework and reballing. Multimeters Regardless of the types of components and targets that you’re working on, you will need a multimeter. This is what you will use for your initial survey of your device for things such as measuring voltage, resistance, current and checking for continuity. When choosing a multimeter, make sure that you review the available voltage and current ranges and that they match the ranges of your expected targets. Some multimeters will also have an “auto-range” feature, which will attempt to automatically select the appropriate range for measuring voltage/current/resistance, etc. This feature can be helpful when measuring unknown voltages; it will save you a few button presses when measuring points on a target. The two multimeters listed below are the ones that I keep in my toolbox. I have also included different probes sets, allowing smaller pads/pins to be measured. Item Price Link Micsoa Multimeter Test Leads Kit $20.99 Link Crenova MS8233D $29.99 Link Fluke High Precision Probes $94.99 Link Fluke 115 $220 Link If you’ve never used a multimeter before, Sparkfun has a great tutorial here that can help get you up to speed and measuring in no time! Microscopes/Magnification When tearing down a target for the first time, you first want to locate and document all of the part numbers. Part numbers and PCB markings can sometimes be challenging to see with the naked eye, so having a cheap benchtop microscope or hand held loupe is never a bad idea. These will also come in handy when removing or modifying small components. Hand held loupes are great for quick identification of components. Item Price Link Description Handheld Jewellers Loupes $15.00 Link Small handheld jewellers loupes, various magnification, useful for part identification Plugable USB Microscope $37.74 Link Small USB compatible microscope, useful for some soldering and part identification, compatible with most desktop operating systems (in my experience) AMScope USB Microscope $78.99 Link Small USB compatible microscope, useful for some soldering and part identification MisVision Trinocular Microscope $78.99 Link Benchtop microscope 7-45x zoom, check out the review here Aven Desktop Microscope $697.91 Link 8-25x microscope with a built-in screen, helpful for soldering to small packages and doing BGA rework MANTIS Serices MCH-001 Microscope $1,310.00 Link High-powered microscope with interchangeable lenses, mounting arm, and lenses are sold separately Oscilloscopes While multimeters help us measure various signals on our target device, an oscilloscope can help us capture and visualize these measurements. When selecting a scope, you need to consider what the use case will be. Will you be doing differential power analysis or power trace captures? Or are you more interested in capturing other types of analog waveforms over a longer period? The main variables to look at when selecting an oscilloscope are: Channel Count - How many channels can you capture on Memory Depth - This is how long you can capture for Sample Rate - How fast the analog signal is sampled Bandwidth -Maximum frequency of an input signal that can be passed through the analog front end (probe) Without enough bandwidth, you will capture what appears to be a distorted signal, and with too slow of a sample rate, you risk data loss. Remember: According to the Nyquist sampling theorem sampling rate should be at least 2x the frequency of your target signal at a minimum! An excellent introductory scope can be purchased for ~$500; all big manufacturers offer something in this range. For example, the SIGLENT SDS1104 is an excellent starting scope with a bandwidth of 100MHz and a sample rate of 1GSa/s. I’ve listed a few options below, ranging in price from lowest to highest, and included a few tables from some of the manufacturer’s websites as well: Item Price Link Description Signlent SDS1104X $399.00 Link Great starter scope, easy to use, SCPI compatible Rigol MSO5354 $1,999 Link High-bandwidth and sample rate, less memory than the SDS2000X series, 16 digital channels for internal logic analyzer SDS2000X $2,999 Link High bandwidth, 2GSa/s sampling rate, large memory depth, HDMI out, SCPI compatible SDS6204A $60,000 + Link Extremely high capture rate and bandwidth, decoders and other features can bring the price to $100k easily Note: Many modern oscilloscopes can be upgraded via software. For example, many will have built-in logic analyzers and signal decoders. These will come at an extra cost; decoders are typically $100-$400, depending on the protocol, and other software upgrades can be purchased to unlock things like faster sample rates and increased bandwidth, etc. It’s easy for a 2k-4k oscilloscope purchase to turn into a 10k purchase once all the upgrades and add-ons have been included. Example Specifications: Rigol Below are some specifications from the RIGOL MSO5000 line: The MSO5354 is an excellent deal for this line, especially considering the 350MHz bandwidth and the 8GSa/s sampling rate. I have this in my lab and use it regularly. Example Specifications: Siglent Here is a similar specification table from the SIGLENT SDS2000 line: The Siglent and the Rigol have great options for the prices listed above. Make sure that you pick an appropriate scope per the types of targets you anticipate analyzing. Logic Analyzers Let’s say you identified a fluctuating voltage sequence with your multimeter and decided to look at the signal with your oscilloscope. After viewing the signal with the oscilloscope, you saw sequences of high and low pulses that look something like this: We will need a Logic Analyzer to make more sense of this signal capture. Logic analyzers are used when analyzing digital signals; they can take sequences of high and low voltages and translate them into a stream of logical 1s and 0s. This stream of 1s and 0s can then be analyzed and decoded via software to display packet structures and more user-friendly data to the user. When choosing a logic analyzer, we need to consider the following: Channel Count - How many channels can be analyzed at once? Sampling Rate - How quickly can we sample data? Hardware Sampling Depth / Memory Depth - How long can we sample? Threshold Voltages - What voltage ranges are compatible with this device? When analyzing standard COTS devices that utilize SPI, eMMC, etc., the Kingst and DSLogic series logic analyzers will work 90% of the time. The Saleae has a well-polished software interface, including APIs for writing decoders and instrumenting captures. The analog capture features of the Saleae are also beneficial when debugging lower-level issues. Despite being the most expensive analyzers listed here, they are worth purchasing if your budget allows it. Item Price Link Description LA 1010 $69.99 Link The Kingst LA series are suitable introductory logic analyzers, they are pulseview compatible and can also use the Kingst proprietary software DSLogic $149.00 Link DSLogic is a series of USB-based logic analyzer, with max sample rate up to 1GHz, and max sample depth up to 16G.

Logic Analyzers Another common question that often comes up as we review the tools in class is What is an oscilloscope used for, and what is a logic analyzer used for? Don’t they both measure signals? While the short answer is yes, they both measure electronic signals and visualize them for human consumption; there are a few key differences. Oscilloscopes are useful for analyzing analog waveforms, that is, data that is steadily changing over time Logic analyzers are used to analyze digital signals and convert high/low voltage pulses into a sequence of 0s and 1s that we can attempt to interpret. So, how do we choose what tool to use? For example, let’s say we are measuring a voltage source on a particular target we are trying to glitch. If we want to monitor the fluctuations of the voltage line, we should use an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope will let us observe the voltage over time, allowing us to see the small period where the voltage drops to a low value and then returns to normal. See the image below, where the purple line represents the voltage line being glitched: We can also use oscilloscopes to characterize and capture power traces. For example, see the following power trace that was captured from the Trezor (purple line): In the previous two examples, we measured a signal oscillating between a range of values and not just HIGH or LOW. There are fluctuations, rising and falling sequences, and other interesting patterns that we could not catch with our logic analyzer as the logic analyzer looks for either a high or low voltage and reports the results back to the user as a digital signal. For an example of when we might use a logic analyzer, let’s revisit the oscilloscope capture from before: Notice that there are not nearly as many strange shapes or fluctuations in this signal; the line either appears at a high or low voltage at any given time. While some oscilloscopes can decode digital signals like this, they often are limited by how much memory they can use for a capture. So that means that if you’re trying to capture UART traffic on a Linux system that takes 60 seconds to boot, you would need a large amount of memory / a costly scope. Also, if you wanted to extract the data from the stream or try to decode it using custom plugins, getting access to the digital signal is a headache (Note It is possible, but logic analyzers greatly simplify this process for us). This is a perfect use case for our logic analyzer if we want to extract the data being encoded in this digital signal. The Logic analyzer can sample for much longer because it samples a signal, reports whether the sample is high or low, and does not report back the exact values in between. Note that what defines high or low can often be configured within your logic analyzer software, but the analyzer will still report back either a 0 or 1. Because the logic analyzer is not concerned with all the values in between, it requires significantly less memory to capture over long periods. To illustrate this, let’s revisit the older blog post we published last year. The following video shows that the voltage levels fluctuate around 3.3V and eventually return to idle at 3.3V. If we were to capture this signal with an oscilloscope, it would look very similar to the screenshot we referenced earlier. However, there is one problem - this system takes about 90 seconds to boot, and ideally, we want to capture all of the traffic in a way that allows us to analyze it. This is where our logic analyzer will come in handy. After connecting our logic analyzer to the signals referenced in the blog post, our logic analyzer software (Pulseview) captures the following: With this traffic captured, we can set up a decoder to get human-readable values out of this signal, as shown below: Now, we can export this data to a text or binary file for further analysis. So, in summary - when we want to capture digital signal traffic such as SPI, UART, I2C, JTAG, etc, we use a logic analyzer. If we want to analyze the shape of the waveform or we are investigating an analog signal such as a power source or audio signal, we use an oscilloscope. Clips / Jumpers / Probes Sometimes, we have to connect to specific pads or pins to analyze the signal on our target device, but that does not always require soldering and removing components. Probing test pads and reading flash chips in-circuit can significantly reduce the debugging/analysis time when performing firmware patches or testing PoCs. Below are some helpful items that I use when soldering/connecting to new targets. The PCBite kit is handy as the fine-tip probes will often save you from needing to solder to test pads when performing initial analysis.

Be sure to review the voltage and current limitations and choose an appropriate supply based on the targets you will analyze. Some power supplies have options like Over-Current Protection (OCP), which is a feature that prevents a power supply from providing more current than it can handle. Some power supplies will also include a Remote Sense feature that is used to regulate the output voltage at the target load. This compensates for the voltage drop across the cables connecting the power supply to the target load.

If you’re trying to get hardware-level debugging working on a target, it is always a good idea to see what OEM tools are available. I’ve compiled a list below of some of the more generic tools I keep in my toolbox. Most of these are ARM-focused, as many other JTAG tooling for different architectures will often involve purchasing specific hardware/software or utilizing OpenOCD. Item Price Link Usage FT2232H Breakout Board $14.95 Link Generic interface board, capable of SPI, I2C, UART, etc STLink $22.16 Link Easy to work with, largely focused on STM32, but can be used as a generic SWD adapter with OpenOCD Tigard $49.00 Link Open source FT2232H-based, multi-protocol, multi-voltage tool for hardware hacking.

Whether you are accessing a JTAG tap or an SWD peripheral, there are two hurdles that you need to overcome: Can your hardware communicate with the TAP/DAP? Logic Levels, appropriate speeds, timings, etc Can your software properly enumerate and interact with the TAP/DAP? OpenOCD, UrJTAG, OEM Tools, etc The right tools for the job is critical when looking at a new hardware-level debug peripheral. Make sure that you search for OEM software/hardware and always check the latest OpenOCD commits for similar targets. Flash Readers So, you have done your initial teardown and identified a non-volatile storage device from which you want to extract some data. Perhaps there is a SPI flash chip or a TSOP 48 parallel flash that you want to extract data from. Many flash readers are available; below is a list of what I have in my lab. The Xeltek is somewhat expensive (it is currently on sale for $995.00), and the individual sockets for different chip packages range from $400-$700, so the cost adds up quickly. However, with that cost comes support from Xeltek and fairly reliable tooling, assuming you are comfortable with BGA rework and re-balling ICs, this may be the right choice for you and your team. Item Price Link Usage Transcend SD Card Reader $10.99 Link Good for in-circuit eMMC reads, device supports low speeds and 1-bit eMMC modes CH341A USB Programmer $13.99 Link Generic SPI flash programmer, compatible with flashrom FT2232H Breakout Board $26.99 Link Generic breakout board, can be used with flashrom, openocd, etc. FlashCAT USB Programmer $99.00 Link Parallel flash extraction, TSOP48/56 XGecu T56 $199.00 Link All-purpose flash extraction, SPI, eMMC, NAND, etc Easy JTAG $399.00 Link All-purpose flash extraction, one of the few readers on the market to support UFS extraction Xeltek Superpro $995.00 Link Enterprise flash programmer, high quality, sockets for different chips can be pretty expensive Dataman 48Pro2 Super Fast Universal ISP Programmer $1,195.00 Link Industrial programming tool, expensive, but does consistently work on the supported ICs In my experience, no flash readout tool works on everything. Some tools are better at certain flash types than others. Having a few options in your hardware hacking toolbox is always a good idea if your preferred tool does not support your target device. If I had to pick two devices from the list above, I would choose the FlashCAT and the XGecu T56; you will have a wide range of target chip coverage between those two. SBCs / Interface Tools Having a few generic embedded interface tools in your toolkit is always a good idea. I am a big fan of using embedded Linux SBCs due to their flexibility and the fact that you have an entire OS at your disposal, which can open up opportunities to use your favorite programming language to interact with the standard peripherals. One of the most common Linux-based SBCs, the Raspberry Pi, has been difficult to acquire over the last few years. Luckily, the Armbian project supports other boards, such as the Orange Pi Zero 2 and the Orange Pi 4 LTS. You may not always require a fully featured OS, and you just need a tool that can talk to peripherals. In this case, having FT2232H-based boards, such as the generic breakouts and things like the Tigard, will also come in handy. While the FT2232H is a well known, classic interface IC, the RP2040 is quickly gaining popularity due to its ease of use and availability. The Buspirate, a classic embedded Swiss army knife, recently released a new version that the RP2040 powers (Note that the Link below is for just the PCB and not for the entire product) Item Price Link Usage FT2232H Breakout Board $14.95 Link Generic interface board, capable of SPI, I2C, UART, etc Arduino Nano $24.90 Link Generic board for learning embedded programming and protocols BusPirate $27.85 (PCB Only) Link Universal Open Source Hacking Tool Orange Pi Zero 2 $35.99 Link Low power general purpose Linux SBC, supported by Armbian Tigard $49.00 Link Open source FT2232H-based, multi-protocol, multi-voltage tool for hardware hacking. Orange Pi 4 LTS $77.90 Link Linux based SBC, supported by Armbian Fault Injection Fault injection (FI) involves introducing an error/modification minor enough to cause undefined behavior on a target but not enough to stop the target from operating entirely. This typically involves injecting a high-voltage pulse or temporarily draining the voltage from a targeted power source or “rail” on the target system. By causing momentary voltage modulations (either above or below the expected voltage), we can force our target system to enter a realm of undefined behavior. An adequately targeted fault can bypass various security checks or other features that may impede an attacker or reverse engineer. When it comes to FI, I think that Furrtek explained it best here: Regarding FI, anything capable of pulling a voltage line low or injecting a clock pulse can work. However, depending on your target and attack, you might need advanced timing or protocol triggering, where tools such as the ChipWhisperer become very handy. When learning the fundamentals of fault injection, you cannot go wrong with an introductory ChipWhisperer kit. Their materials and example targets explain the principles behind fault injection and provide a tested, repeatable learning environment. I can’t recommend their materials highly enough. If the ChipWhisperer tools are too expensive for your budget, however, there are other tools that folks have used in the past. I have included the tools in the table below and provided some example blog posts that utilize them to help get you started. We have also published a blog post here as an introduction to FI.

High-cost options provide powerful capabilities for in-depth analysis of various RF signals, allowing security professionals to identify vulnerabilities, intercept and decode wireless transmissions, and assess the robustness of communication protocols.

They can be incredibly cheap (a couple cents if you have enough volume), so even if you could do it with analog circuits they can be a reasonable solution. And of course this soldering iron comes with buttons and a display, so of course you use a microcontroller.But I guess what you are getting at is that normally you don&#x27;t brag about the architecture of your microcontroller. As you correctly suspect, that&#x27;s done just for coolness points. Chances are an 8 bit AVR or an 16 bit PIC could have done the same thing, but on a soldering iron you don&#x27;t care about the power draw of the microcontroller, and a 32bit RISC-V fits Pine64&#x27;s brand better.

In contrast to USB microscopes, those will have no image delay, which can make hand-eye coordination difficult, allow for depth perception and have way superior image quality.When buying a trinocular it should be a simul-focal one where the stereo microscope and the camera are focused and available all at the same time (no switching of the light path to the camera).

Fluke isn&#x27;t the only player in town with quality meters.Also don&#x27;t skimp on the meter, buy something decent. There is a lot to be said about the real life and noticeable differences in cheap and quality meters when testing or repairing electronics but in the realm of embedded device hacking I particularly found the following features handy:- A high speed voltage bar at the bottom of the instrument which tells you if a voltage is indeed stable. You can detect the TX pin of serial lines with that. Cheap meters may have that bar but the update speed is way too slow to be useful- A high speed and loud continuity tester. Many cheap meters (and some expensive as well) have a large delay between shorting out the leads and the buzzer going off. That&#x27;s rather annoying when you can&#x27;t make good contact long enough (also see below for test leads).After working with a cheap meter for a while (Uni-T) I went for a Brymen BM869s and never looked back.Also get yourself some high quality pointy, hard gold coated test leads. I personally can wholeheartedly recommend the Probemaster 8000 series. reply syntaxing 15 hours agoparentprevI’ve fried my 3D printer board once because of using a cheap meter.

If you&#x27;re looking to get into the space it&#x27;s not a bad place to start. reply ChuckMcM 15 hours agoprevIts a good list, the only thing I would change is that I like a deeper workbench (30\" is good 32\" deep is even better) because I&#x27;ll put a shelf in the back so that the test equipment can be vertical from the surface (and yet the probes can still reach the surface easily). For RF work, I&#x27;ve got a spectrum analyzer, vector signal generator, and an oscilloscope that are pretty much always there, and a network analyzer that I bring out when I&#x27;m trying to get debug RF networks.And while modern (expensive) equipment is light and not so deep, if you&#x27;re buying stuff used or surplus you&#x27;ll end up with older gear that can be 18 or 19\" deep and on a 24\" deep bench that gets a bit crowded. reply cushychicken 11 hours agoparentI finally shelled out for the Proline 32 inch deep benches and man do I love them.

Also, once an IC is soldered onto a circuit board, it&#x27;s not invincible, but less prone to damage because the capacitance on the board limits the voltage spike.The only time I ever damaged IC&#x27;s was when I had my office chair on one of those plastic mats that lets you roll your chair around on a carpeted floor. That was a static electricity generator.If you&#x27;re regularly getting static zaps during dry winter weather, on things like doorknobs, it&#x27;s a sign that you need to be more careful with your electronics. reply GravitasFailure 8 hours agoparentprev>Am I doing it wrong?If you&#x27;re not killing anything, then probably not.

If you do use lead solder please treat the area as contaminated, don&#x27;t touch your face, and wash your hands afterwards. Lead poisoning is a quiet and long term thing. A little bit of care upfront will prevent a sad end for your loved ones in decades. reply meatmanek 4 hours agoparentLead solder didn&#x27;t bother me at first (I had read all the arguments about vapor pressure, solubility of lead, people&#x27;s lived experiences, etc. Plus, my initial experiences with lead-free were terrible). What convinced me was when I realized how much fine solder dust I was making every time I cleaned my soldering iron tip. More than once I&#x27;ve had the dust from the brass sponge spill out onto my desk and leave a big grey mark.I&#x27;ve been using some low-temp lead-free solder from ChipQuik in both paste and wire form, and it works perfectly fine for prototyping. It doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as other solder types, but the low melting point (even lower than leaded solder) means I don&#x27;t have to stress the chips as much with temperature swings (great for rework), and I can keep my iron cooler, which reduces tip oxidation. reply m-ee 14 hours agoparentprevNever verified but I was always told the fumes from lead free are more noxious than the leaded counterparts, maybe because of the higher temp requirements. Should be using a fume extractor regardless but I’ve always been more conscious of it when working with lead free. reply willis936 13 hours agorootparentI agree with the conclusion: always use a fume extractor with flux regardless of the type.

View All >> How To Make A CPU - A Simple Picture Based Explanation 2021-11-09 - By Robert Elder The purpose of this article is to explain how to make a CPU out of rocks and sand as fast as possible without using too many words. As the world of proprietary hardware and software crushes in around us, we risk losing the ability to make things for ourselves as individuals. It is for this reason that I felt compelled to learn how one could hypothetically make their own integrated circuits by themself. Skip to the end of this article for a few more words on this subject and a disclaimer. 1) Get a rock. 2) Smash the rock. 3) Now you have 98% concentrated silicon dioxide. Purify it to 99.9% pure silicon dioxide. 4) Purify it further to 99.9999999% polysilicon metal. 5) Put the polysilicon ingots into a crucible. 6) Heat the silicon ingots to 1698 °K. WARNING: do not attempt melting silicon at 1698 °K in your kitchen home oven. 7) Take a small seed monocrystal and dip it into the vat of molten silicon. WARNING: do not place your hands in molten silicon. 8) Slowly pull the crystal out as it cools. Further reading: Boule, Czochralski Method. 9) Now, you've got a monocrystal of pure silicon. Cut it into thin slices. 10) Now, you've got pristine freshly-cut silicon wafers. Optionally, dope them with Boron, Phosphorus or another dopant. I was not brave enough to buy elemental phosphorus, so you'll have to use your imagination with the matches. 11) Put photoresist on the wafer. 12) Take a chromium-etched photo-lithographic quartz mask with your desired circuit pattern and shine a laser beam through it to project the circuit pattern onto the wafer. 13) The locations of the shadows produced by the photo-mask will control where the photo-resist is chemically changed on the surface of the silicon wafer (depending on whether you used positive or negative photoresist). 14) Now, develop the photoresist. 15) Acid etch the exposed parts of the wafer. 16) Perform countless iterations and repetitions of homo-epitaxy, hetero-epitaxy, pseudo-epitaxy, diffusion doping, copper interconnect layers, chemical mechanical polishing, photoresist applications, acid etching, and photomask exposing to build up the desired features on the wafer. 17) Now you've got a finished silicon wafer. Cut it into pieces. 18) Now you've got un-packaged silicon dies. Locate the pads on the silicon chip, and attach bond wires, or use the flip-chip method as is done now for most modern processors. 19) Use the bond wires or solder balls to provide an electrical connection between the pins on the chip package, and the pads on the silicon die. And that's how you make a CPU. Also, see CPUs Are Smaller Than You Think for a look inside a real Intel CPU. A Few More Words Obviously, the process of making a modern CPU is more complicated and less well-defined that depicted by this article. Every new generation of chips usually makes changes to the way features are built up on the wafer (not just in terms of feature size). Many common techniques are not even mentioned in this article, and many important steps have been left out. Important details (such as precise chemical compositions/concentrations) are extremely proprietary and you won't see anyone describing them on HackerNews or Reddit. Many steps in the process (such as sourcing and purification of the silicon) have more than one commonly used method. If you want to learn more about these topics, the right search phrases are \"Advanced Optics For Photolithography\" and \"Chemical Deposition Nanofabrication\" or \"Lithographic Metrology\". Although this article isn't perfect, the hope is that an interested reader will benefit from using many of the topics discussed herein as search terms for further research on their own. While cutting-edge nanometer scale features are not likely to be accessible for a hobbyist, micron-scale amateur chip fabrication does appear to be quite feasible. I have not tried this myself, but Sam Zeloof has, and you should definitely check out his YouTube channel. I think you could probably even build some basic chips with far less equipment than he has if you get the optics right. You could probably make it a hobby business selling cusom chips to other tech people! A Word Of Caution: In case it wasn't already clear, I don't advise that anyone actually attempt making integrated circuits in their apartment in the manner shown in this video. The 'photoresist' and 'developer solution' in this video is just a colored prop. The real chemicals are usually hazardous and you should only work with them with proper safety gear in a well ventilated area or in a fume hood.

Not all rocks are made of silicon dioxide. reply aivisol 28 minutes agoprevI have some doubts about step 15: I used to work in a post-Soviet lab which produced chips in early 90s and as far as i remember etching happened in a high temperature (was it 1200C ?) environment where you would pass some chlorine type gas over the wafers. The temperature was achieved by induction heating with 8kHz AC passing through water cooled copper coils. The generators were mechanic, big water cooled machines placed in the basement of the building due to the noise they generated. Another reason for placing them in a basement was that water leaks were common. I was responsible for maintaining the heating setup and transitioning to electronic, thyristor based generators. The job was kind of electronic-engineer-plumber type of duty. reply lifeisstillgood 12 hours agoprevOk so now I have a dream.

A comprehensive guide on how to make anything from scratch would be amazing.I guess to get started, it would be a process of reverse engineeringing to work out steps of a build, and then build a dependency tree from that.E.g the linked guide to making a CPU depends on using some chemicals, there would need to be an explanation of how those chemicals are obtained, and then subsequently on how the equipment to facilitate that is made.

Instead men concentrated on minute differences of cut, and the quality of the plain cloth.[1] Coined by the Anglo-German psychologist John Flügel in 1930, it is considered a major turning point in the history of clothing in which the men relinquished their claim to adornment and beauty.[2] Flugel asserted that men \"abandoned their claim to be considered beautiful\" and \"henceforth aimed at being only useful\".[3] The Great Renunciation encouraged the establishment of the suit's monopoly on male dress codes at the beginning of the 19th century. History[edit] The Great Male Renunciation began in the mid-18th century, inspired by the ideals of the Enlightenment; clothing that signaled aristocratic status fell out of style in favor of functional, utilitarian garments. The newfound practicality of men's clothing also coincided with the articulation of the idea that men were rational and that women were frivolous and emotional.[2] During the French Revolution, wearing dress associated with the royalist Ancien Régime made the wearer a target for the Jacobins. Working-class men of the era, many of whom were Revolutionaries, came to be known as sans-culottes because they could not afford silk breeches and wore less expensive pantaloons instead.[4] The term was first used as an insult by French officer Jean-Bernard Gauthier de Murnan but was reclaimed by these men around the time of the Demonstration of 20 June 1792. In the United States, the movement was associated with American republicanism, with Benjamin Franklin giving up his wig during the Revolution, and later the Gold Spoon Oration of 1840 denouncing Martin Van Buren.[5] The post-Renunciation standards for men's dress went largely unchallenged in the Western world before the rise of the counterculture and increased informality in the 1960s.[6] Characteristics[edit] Dark-colored or black clothing became the standard for men's apparel during the Renunciation.[7] High heels, adopted in Europe at the beginning of the 17th century based on Persian riding shoes, fell out of fashion for men by the 1740s.[2] The tight-fitting breeches that suggested better tailoring and accentuated the strength of the male figure, particularly the legs, were replaced by pantaloons.[8] Stockings and expensive wigs and fabrics were also abandoned.[4] See also[edit]Fashion portal Beau Brummell Men's Dress Reform Party Midnight blue, a color popularized by the Duke of Windsor as an alternative to black clothing[9] Black tie References[edit] ^ Joanna Bourke, \"The Great Male Renunciation: The Men's Dress Reform Party in Interwar Britain\", Journal of Design History, 9.1, 1996, 23–33.

Are we comparing ourselves to what the 1% or 0.1% wore? reply crazygringo 12 hours agoparentI don&#x27;t think it matters quite so much how many; the question is more about what everyone wanted to be. What their aspirations were.The point would be that a mainstream man in 1750 wanted to be wearing colorful frilly things with high heels, even if he couldn&#x27;t afford any of it because he was just a servant. Whereas starting in the 1800&#x27;s, that stopped being an aspiration, whether you had money or not.Also, while this clothing wasn&#x27;t accessible to servants and laborers, some of it would have been to the growing middle class that consisted of merchants, professors, lawyers, and so forth. Just look at paintings depicting coffeeshop culture in the 1700&#x27;s:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sylviaprincebooks.com&#x2F;blog-list&#x2F;2021&#x2F;coffee-hous...And coffeehouses were not reserved for the 0.1%, not at all. reply rsynnott 33 minutes agorootparent> The point would be that a mainstream man in 1750 wanted to be wearing colorful frilly things with high heels, even if he couldn&#x27;t afford any of it because he was just a servant.Though, if he was a _senior_ servant, he probably would be wearing some variant of it. There was a tendency for a while for high-ranking domestic servants in large houses to wear what was in effect a _previous version_ of what the upper class wore; AIUI this did indeed lead to a period where the upper class were wearing prototype modern suits while the butler was still wearing colours and frills. reply konfusinomicon 8 hours agorootparentprevthe transition from powdered wigs being the norm and now those damn kids going out without a wig on took over must have been an interesting time. this means at some point there was like 1 guy that held on to the fashion at the very end. not yielding to the new norm for the sake of morals and civility! his wig buried with him. and then no more wigs reply rsynnott 23 minutes agorootparentI mean, we&#x27;ve had a similar transition recently, with similar holdouts. See hats; they were basically essential wear in the west for men, from working class up, at the start of the 20th century; by the end, hats as male formal-wear were largely seen as pretty eccentric.In the case of wigs, there were holdouts; barristers and judges in the former British empire have in many cases only really started abandoning them over the last two decades. reply crazygringo 7 hours agorootparentprevHa, you&#x27;re right.

Notables include the mercantile bourgeoisie, the administration, the mercenaries, the guard, the local bourgeoisie (guild leaders, lawyers), and the &#x27;small bourgeoisie&#x27; in the sense people who owned either specific, important equipment, or important skills outside cities, so not in a guild (horse breeders, miller etc). Nobility is like .5% to 2% depending on your country, the rest, depending on when and where you&#x27;re talking about post-renaissance can easely get to 10%, maybe even 15% in the lowlands. People think the industrial revolution started with coal an trains, but check Europeans canals and waterworks, as well as how precise steel parts were made. The major productivity increases are from before the US revolution.In fact, I&#x27;m certain that one of the French revolution trigger was notables who saw those productivity increase improve their life, then being taken away to found wars or whatever. reply Jensson 9 hours agorootparentUniforms doesn&#x27;t count, you don&#x27;t choose your uniform.

Industrial revolution changed that, now bright colors are associated with cheap toys instead because they are used to cover deficiencies in the production process.So it makes sense that people who care about quality moved away from colorful things. reply ulizzle 12 hours agoparentNo, It’s not about that. This was a cultural reaction to the excesses and cruelty of the French ruling classes.And both men and women changed their styles, Im not sure why they don’t mention that. No one wanted to be mistaken by a jacobin and have a bomb thrown at your lap. Women stopped imitating Marie Antoinette way before she was beheaded in the pangs of birth of the reign of terrorThe obvious historical parallels are obvious because what generally happens is that chaos can only build up so much until the people rebel and kill everyone in power. That’s why the Egyptians mentioned “maat” (order) all the time, but there are some very good movies on this time period even on netflix reply Jensson 12 hours agorootparentThen this would be isolated to France and you would expect things to normalize as people forgot about the revolution. But things never \"normalized\", men still prefer to not wear bright colored clothes.> And both men and women changed their stylesMaybe in France right after the revolution, but if I look at dresses today I see all that gaudiness in female dresses but not in male. reply KptMarchewa 11 hours agorootparentNot really, at that time cultural norms and trends amongst western society spread from it&#x27;s cultural center which was France - as it&#x27;s today with USA. Whole world wears jeans. reply ulizzle 7 hours agorootparentprevIt depends on the context. For example, fashion for men and women was all pretty wild in post-war America (imo, specifically during the 80s), but stayed pretty colorful throughout the 2000s, until this decade.Since the ruling classes have been hammering the message that men are useless it&#x27;s a normal cultural reaction for men to become more manly. Women instead have been told that sex sells and it does, so that&#x27;s their cultural reaction to the problems of today.At least for now; but as disorder keeps mounting, inflation rises, and so on, patience for the regimes falls, and more conservative fashions come back, which means the times for the ruling classes are frail and volatile. reply nequo 12 hours agoparentprev> So it makes sense that people who care about quality moved away from colorful things.Women’s clothing is more colorful today. I don’t think it is because women care less about quality than men. reply Jensson 11 hours agorootparentMen wouldn&#x27;t buy pants without good pockets, yet women prefers them so much that it is hard to find pants with good pockets for women. Only reason to have shitty pockets is that it makes the pants look a tiny bit better from the outside, but that tiny improvement in looks was enough to make women buy it instead.So yeah, I&#x27;d argue that women and men do look at significantly different things when they make purchases. reply DFHippie 11 hours agorootparentPlenty of women complain about the lack of pockets in women&#x27;s pants. I think women feel others&#x27; judgment about their clothing choices more sharply than men do. This isn&#x27;t a personality quirk. The condemnation comes down harder on them. Look at what is happening in Iran. Women are being killed for how they choose to dress. So if women make different choices, don&#x27;t ascribe this entirely to differences in their personality. They face different constraints. reply xyzelement 11 hours agorootparentNot sure I follow.Apparently not enough women actually want pockets to make that fashion financially worthwhile at scale?Re Iran - you don’t think a man dressed out of line (eg drag) would be killed? reply emmelaich 10 hours agorootparentActually Iran has a pretty interesting attitude to the androgynous and masculine and feminine roles.

There are plenty of men&#x27;s clothing options at stores like Zara and Uniqlo reply kbelder 4 hours agorootparentSure, but you&#x27;re talking about a fraction of woman, and a tiny fraction of men. The effect size is not equivalent. reply makeitdouble 9 hours agorootparentprevTo chime on sister comment, Uniqlo has a sub-brand (\"GU\") for cheaper clothing.Fast fashion isn&#x27;t women exclusive, but the fashion cycle is so much shorter for women that the very notion of fashion being \"fast\" almost only makes sense for them *.I actually wonder what fashion style a woman could get away with wearing for 10 years. It would probably need to be almost monotone, covering, and with little to no affordance. A white long straight skirt with a black or cream T shaped top ?* There will be a non negligeable number of men also caring about fashion and follow a shorter cycle, but that&#x27;s far from the norm. reply KptMarchewa 11 hours agorootparentprevAnd I wouldn&#x27;t call Uniqlo \"notoriously low-quality\". reply nequo 11 hours agorootparentprevThe same brands carry more colorful clothes for women than for men. I don’t suppose that their offerings for men are higher quality than their offerings for women. reply debacle 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat men and women find attractive are wildly different, especially when it comes to first impressions. reply jokethrowaway 10 hours agorootparentprevIt contrasts my experience but ours are just vain generalisations.Men tends to have less clothes but higher quality (and they wear a lot) while women tend to have thousands of clothes they wear once.I can survive with 2-3 suits (in the 300-500 range, decent quality, but nothing crazy) in any major city in Europe and some shirts - which is what I did for years. Now, times are changing security wise and, while I would still wear a suit in London (it seems pretty common), I wouldn&#x27;t in Paris - mainly because I&#x27;ve been attacked twice over 2 days of walking in Paris with a suit and I think wearing some baggy jumper would have meade me less of a target.I have no clue about the states, but I&#x27;m sure there are no go area for suits there as well. reply makeitdouble 9 hours agorootparentOn Paris...suits don&#x27;t have the same cultural meaning, but baggy jumpers might not keep you out of trouble.I think muggers just smell the money and vulnerability.

The denim community still likes indigo because it fades, but that could just be signifier that it&#x27;s authentic.It could also just be that color attracts attention. With birds, it&#x27;s often the male that&#x27;s more colorful. See peafowl. reply MichaelZuo 12 hours agoparentprevLong distance travel also became much more common for wealthy young men during this time period, so the shear impracticality of the style likely prevented a large portion of them from wearing it, even if they preferred the style, for long stretches of time.This was well before the invention of rip-proof or stain-proof fabrics.Also the royal courts of Europe started becoming much less active, as the professional bureaucracy started forming which took care of routine decision making.So the young noble man just back from his travels would have had far less opportunity to show off in formal settings to boot. reply kixiQu 12 hours agoparentprevThis is a kind of theory that would apply equally to social signaling for both men and women.

We see toady most men chooses clothes based on quality and utility. Why do you think men didn&#x27;t do it back then?

Utility ? I don&#x27;t know.

Beau Brummel&#x27;s relative minimalism was taken from standard riding kit at the time, just without the flourish of cavalry. The style lives on today in the form of the shadbelly[0] worn in competition in dressage.Given it was toned down military dress, it was literally the tactical cavalry wear of the time. The analogy or equivalent to Brummel&#x27;s style today would be something closer to a luxury brand with technical cred from their tactical lines like Arc&#x27;teryx, Prada, Beretta&#x27;s clothing line, and perhaps Fjallraven. I have an opinion about this because I looked at a business re-designing men&#x27;s riding clothing, as over a couple decades I found the now-unisex attire discourages men from riding horses in any non-western disciplines. I gave up the idea because I could just buy clothes from some of those makers above and ride in them instead. The silhouette looks a lot more more \"Horse Soldiers,\" than \"Downton Abbey,\" but building a new retail brand for a market I was inventing wasn&#x27;t a startup play.

    "originBody": "About Support Community Forum Donate Global Encryption Day: Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights by pavelOctober 21, 2023 Today, October 21, 2023, is the third Global Encryption Day, organized by the Global Encryption Coalition, of which the Tor Project is a member. Global Encryption Day is an opportunity for businesses, civil society organizations, technologists, and millions of Internet users worldwide to highlight why encryption matters and to advocate for its advancement and protection. Needless to say, fighting for the protection of encryption is a topic for us 365 days a year. But we want to use this day to reflect on some of the efforts we have initiated or supported in 2023 to ensure access to encryption and push back against government efforts that seek to undermine it - from signing letters and supporting ally organizations on a number of advocacy and awareness campaigns to expanding our outreach and training efforts or localizing educational content. Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights Most recently, we co-organized and co-hosted a workshop at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) - an annual meeting established by the United Nations in 2005 as a forum for multi-stakeholder dialogue concerning public policy issues relating to the internet. The panel entitled Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights brought together professionals from the technology, non-profit, policy, human rights and advocacy spaces to discuss balancing the demands of national security with the protection of individual privacy, adherence to international human rights laws and seeking a global approach. The debate underscored the importance of international collaboration and respecting international standards and human rights principles to navigate the complexities of encryption and content moderation, pushing back against the weakening of encryption and the proliferation of surveillance technologies that have been used against human rights activists, journalists, and members of the civil society. The panelists called for education, including training and capacity-building of policymakers, and the normalization of encryption in creating a safer online environment for all users. Tech companies must play a role in protecting user privacy while addressing legitimate concerns related to content moderation, including the ability for safe and responsive reporting channels for users that do not compromise encryption and acknowledging the limitations of AI. By offering end-to-end encryption they can give power back to the users and simultaneously simplify their regulatory burden. Two key takeaways and calls for action from our discussion have already been reflected in the first draft of IGF messaging outcomes \"intended to provide a high-level overview for decision-makers of the most current thinking on key Internet governance and digital policy issues.\" HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS \"Policymakers need to improve their understanding of Internet technologies, the infrastructure underpinning them, their modalities and business models if they are to make informed policy decisions and design appropriate regulatory frameworks. Greater transparency on the part of businesses and other stakeholders can help to achieve this.\" \"Technology is not confined by geographic boundaries. Laws and regulations governing the use of technology in areas such as encryption should be consistent with international standards and norms concerned with privacy, freedom of expression, due process and access to information.\" If you're interested to find out what other measures and recommendations to policymakers were proposed, check out the full session recording here. The Tor Project's mission is to advance Human Rights. For us that means not only by building and deploying technology, but also by advocating for the protection and unrestricted availability of privacy-preserving technologies like encryption. We are connecting with people all around the world and supporting them to use the internet safely and freely to achieve this mission.

And even if they are, the usual schemes do not encrypt the subject line.I wish there was something like Let&#x27;s encrypt but for email. Just make it trivial to sign and encrypt your mail. Also, mail clients should give a huge warning for unencrypted and&#x2F;or unsigned mail, just like browsers do with web sites. Right now, at least on Outlook for macOS, you only get a happy green padlock on signed email, if you ever receive one. reply woodruffw 10 hours agoparentI think Latacora&#x27;s (famous?) post[1] sums the situation up here nicely: email is designed in such a way that precludes an encryption scheme that actually works for ordinary users. Even power users consistently fail to use email encryption correctly.If we care about secure communication, then we should be nudging users towards protocols that enable encryption, rather than fighting against it. For 99% of cases, that probably means Signal.[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latacora.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;02&#x2F;19&#x2F;stop-using-encrypte... reply Metus 10 hours agorootparentI don&#x27;t think that Signal is a proper substitute for anything that email is used for. Maybe it would be better to work on more secure successors or extensions to email. reply woodruffw 9 hours agorootparentLots of people, including my parents, use email as an asynchronous messaging platform. For those people, Signal is an eminently suitable replacement.As the post points out: email cannot be extended into a secure position. Attempts to do so either fail to interoperate or fail outright. reply daurnimator 9 hours agorootparentEmail is also an archive of communications with vendors, shops and government departments.Signal doesn&#x27;t let you migrate chat history to your desktop.Trying to migrate between phones while retaining your Signal history is too hard for most people.Signal is not at all a suitable replacement, and I believe that forward secrecy is an anti-feature for an email-like usecase. reply tptacek 8 hours agorootparentYou know you&#x27;re in trouble when people start talking about forward secrecy being problematic. What you&#x27;re saying about the \"email-like use case\" for cryptography is that it&#x27;s unserious protection, because a lack of forward secrecy practically guarantees full decryption of the entire history of messages, for any ordinary participant in the system. reply 0xDEAFBEAD 34 minutes agorootparent>a lack of forward secrecy practically guarantees full decryption of the entire history of messages, for any ordinary participant in the system.Can you elaborate? reply wolf550e 3 minutes agorootparentEventually a private key will leak, and without forward secrecy, that private key will probably decrypt all past messages to that person (and all future messages to that person, until they give all their correspondents a new key). Like, the simple PGP-like system where sender encrypts message using recipients public RSA key. And of course it&#x27;s not improved by switching from RSA to ECIES. You need to ratchet the key, or double ratchet like Signal protocol. daurnimator 7 hours agorootparentprevA major goal of an email-like system is full decryption of the entire history of messages.Same as it&#x27;s a feature of my filing cabinet that items don&#x27;t incinerate themselves whenever I move house. reply tptacek 7 hours agorootparentSure. Because people overwhelmingly aren&#x27;t relying on the security of their email; it&#x27;s overwhelmingly stuff no adversary would care to read. Then they retrofit the UX requirements they have for those boring mails onto all emails, and suggest that encrypted email should just accept those as constraints, and then we&#x27;ll declare victory. reply paulryanrogers 9 hours agorootparentprevEmail as a concept can evolve. We can break backward compatiblity. Call it email v2 and include some killer features. If enough major players and users get involved then it&#x27;ll happen.My hope is it&#x27;ll be something like Dark Mail, yet with a carve out for enterprise recipients to inject their controls and anti-malware before end-user delivery. (To combat spam and malware.) reply Metus 9 hours agorootparentIn theory the giants that already hold the vast majority of all email communications - like Microsoft and Alphabet - are in a prime position to introduce a successor, hopefully this time with a receipt so the last argument in favour of fax dies off. At the same time, they have no proper motivation to do so. reply woodruffw 9 hours agorootparentprevThat’s the point about interoperability. If we’re going to make “email v2” (not a terrible idea!), then the considerations that will go into securing it will ensure that it’s entirely incompatible with the thing we currently call email.In other words: without sufficient clarity, email v2 just confuses people like my parents. Who would be better served by Signal anyways. reply paulryanrogers 8 hours agorootparentVendors big enough to be known by your parents are sophisticated enough to paper over the differences and make it seamless. (Where possible) reply woodruffw 7 hours agorootparent“Where possible” is doing a lot of work! replyXorNot 9 hours agorootparentprevSignal has no concept of trust delegation: also, the verification API is extremely hidden and sucks (i.e. my brother working at a FAANG had no idea it existed or what it did - it&#x27;s also extremely confusing when you open it).This creates two problems: (1) is that Signal functionally operates as \"trust on first use\", and (2) Signal has no system by which you can communicate to \"conceptual entities\" - i.e. companies. There&#x27;s no way in Signal to talk to say, a bank or a government agency as an entity (IMO: to turn a profit, this is the business Signal actually need to be in).Which makes it a bit of stochastic security measure: encrypt enough communications and probably when something important does come up, the window to intercept it has failed - except of course, that those verification number messages nobody knows what to do with and so they ignore them. reply Metus 9 hours agorootparent> (2) Signal has no system by which you can communicate to \"conceptual entities\" - i.e. companies.This has always kind of bugged me with email as compared to physical mail: While with a physical mailbox I can write a letter \"to whom it may concern\" and throw it in, with email I need to find out if the special, general purpose inbox is info@, contact@, hello@, or whatever other address the company uses, assuming they use the same domain for their email as they do for their website.On the next level, there is no first-class support for stuff like &#x27;send this message to person X, although it is adressed to organisation Y, where X works.&#x27; Basically, acknowledging the legal and organisational reality that while (single) humans might read, process and respond to communication, it is the legal entity that is actually being adressed. reply woodruffw 9 hours agorootparentprevI agree that the verification UI sucks. I have similar stories about otherwise technical people not knowing about it or otherwise not understanding it.At the same time: the relevant comparison here is email. Email isn’t even TOFU between arbitrary identities; it’s trust-on-each-message. Similarly for conceptual identities (like a bank’s catch-all address).(I also agree with your point about this needing to be one of Signal’s businesses. WhatsApp and other chats already do this, I believe.) reply XorNot 9 hours agorootparentEmail these days is however tied to DKIM and domains. We have UI problems, but communicating to a companies email servers at their domain name can be reasonably expected to be communicating with that company.It&#x27;s just the security story on that if you never want the content disclosed isn&#x27;t great, but conversely, conceptual entity communications are always going to be a bit public by nature.There&#x27;s a whole other rant I have about this problem, where we really lack domain specific trust standards - i.e. communicating with a business, what I want to know is \"is this a recognized legal business entity in it&#x27;s jurisdiction, and what&#x27;s it&#x27;s status to mine?\" which is very different to \"I need to make absolutely sure me and John Smith&#x27;s communication is just between us\" - but they&#x27;re in the same space of problem. reply Metus 9 hours agorootparent> There&#x27;s a whole other rant I have about this problem, where we really lack domain specific trust standards - i.e. communicating with a business, what I want to know is \"is this a recognized legal business entity in it&#x27;s jurisdiction, and what&#x27;s it&#x27;s status to mine?\"I have the same pain, but this seems more like a regulatory issue than a technological one. Here in Germany, (basically all) legal entities need to publish a physical adress where they are reachable, it would be easy, in theory, to extend this to a reachable domain or email adress, thereby giving a guarantee, at least in Germany, that you are interacting with the business you are expecting.

Most people nowadays unfortunately use web clients, so the keys are going to have to be stored somewhere else, since backing up a browser&#x27;s local storage is no easy task.

The theory that encryption is going to stop government surveillance is ridiculous. Even a perfect technology is not going to override national politics. Any government oppressive enough to require surveillance of its citizens will not be stopped by encryption. They will just block it or require a backdoor, or find yet more exploits that they won&#x27;t announce in order to take advantage silently (whether it&#x27;s the government directly, or one of the many 0day-for-pay players)Either way they will enforce their will, until the citizens reform their government.

Thus I believe their reasons to oppose the government&#x27;s opposition to encryption are not truly in the interests of the users, but because it gives them the power instead.Encryption is classified as a munition, because that&#x27;s what it fundmentally is; everyone would probably agree that it&#x27;s better to have a gun yourself, instead of one pointed at you.I don&#x27;t know of a simple solution to this problem.

But by exploiting ignorance, the tories managed to beast parliament into an intractable \"just imagine if...\" clause in the Online Safety Bill... a law that provisionally exists if and only if the impossible becomes possible.And then they sit back, fold their arms and call those \"controls\".Controls must be effective, otherwise they&#x27;re just buttons for show, that aren&#x27;t wired to anything.The reason nation states are losing ground to BigTech is because they are using 18th century power politics to fight 21st century logic.I do wish my government would go take some basic CS and cryptography classes. reply schoen 8 hours agorootparent> There are no controls because there is no possibility of controls, as a matter of mathematics.This is kind of true because, for example, the one-time pad is information-theoretically secure, and anyone could choose to use a one-time pad with anyone else given prior arrangements. Or anyone could choose to use RSA for confidentiality with anyone else given a mutual desire to communicate confidentially and an authentic but not confidential channel.However, there&#x27;s nothing mathematically stopping a government from punishing people who are observed to follow a protocol to create a confidential channel. Although Eben Moglen has argued that the right to speak PGP is the right to speak Navajo, a government could conceivably choose to punish people for speaking a foreign language.One might wish (I would certainly wish) that people would be extremely upset by this, but I guess it wouldn&#x27;t contravene mathematics.In fact, there are some historic cases where populations were subject to official military censorship in wartime, which included overt government review of some of their communications, and possibly a prohibition on the use of \"codes\", and sometimes restrictions on the use of foreign languages. One might again wish that this would be both much less acceptable and much less feasible now than in the past, but it&#x27;s not completely impossible. reply XorNot 9 hours agorootparentprevThe better answer though is that it&#x27;s a misdirect: they&#x27;re pointing at encryption as the bad guy, the one thing which takes place solely in the digital space and is activity-agnostic - nothing which happens with encrypted bits, by itself, can do anything in the real world.\"Pedophiles and terrorists\" on the other hand, have to do a lot of things in the physical world in order to actually be pedophiles and terrorists.

Al Bello/Getty Images The economist Melissa Kearney has been both vilified and praised for her new book, The Two-Parent Privilege: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind. In the book, released last month, Kearney points out a rather obvious fact: Children raised by two parents have a much higher chance of success than those raised by one. Yet she goes even further to argue that whether parents are married or not impacts their children's success. Her argument goes against the trend in the U.S.; American children are increasingly being born and raised by single mothers. The U.S. has the world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households, according to a 2019 Pew Research Center study. Almost a quarter, or 23% of U.S. children under age 18, live with one parent and no other adults. Sponsor Message Kearney finds that this arrangement hurts children, widens inequality and ultimately damages society. She is ringing the alarm bells, and she wants people to hear them and start thinking of solutions. Judging by the book's reception, she has managed to achieve at least the first part of that. \"I've done exactly what I wanted, which was to start a conversation,\" Kearney tells NPR. \"But I get frustrated that a lot of the initial reaction is an initial knee jerk reaction.\" Kearney's argument that children who grow up in unmarried households are fighting the odds has progressives miffed and accusing Kearney of stigmatizing single mothers. Conservatives are celebrating her findings as validating their support of marriage. LIFE KIT Want to create a stronger bond with your kids? First relinquish control \"There are a lot of folks who are uncomfortable with the idea of prioritizing one family type over another,\" says Kearney, whose research and work as an economist at the University of Maryland focuses on issues that most would consider progressive: poverty, inequality, family and children. \"I'm not prioritizing one. I'm just recognizing the data and the evidence and the reality.\" The realities about unmarried mothers One fact is undeniable in all this: More women are deciding to have children and also remain single. Almost half of all babies born in the U.S. were born to unmarried women in 2019, a dramatic increase since 1960, when only 5% of births were to unmarried mothers. And it's not because of divorce; today's unpartnered mothers are also more likely to have never been married. Some children who are raised by single mothers go on to achieve great things. But on the aggregate, the data shows that the odds of graduating from high school, getting a college degree and having high earnings in adulthood are substantially lower for children who grow up in single-mother homes. LIFE KIT These strategies can help working parents build support and reclaim some time Kearney notes that families headed by a single mother are five times more likely to live in poverty than families headed by a married couple. It's simple math, she says: Having two adults in the home who can bring in income lessens the chance that a family is poor. As any parent will readily attest, raising children takes a lot of resources: money, time, emotional energy and more. Most single mothers start from behind; they're less likely to have a college education or a high income. Single motherhood is a lot less prevalent in higher-educated women. This college gap exists for white, Black and Latino families. LIFE KIT 5 tips to become a kid's favorite adult Data also shows that many single mothers don't have help from any other adult, like a grandparent or other family member. That means it's mom who both supports the family financially and serves as the primary caregiver. There's nobody to pick up the slack when she's tired or sick or just needs to talk after the kids go to bed. Kearney focuses her research on single mothers because of their outsize number. It's not like there aren't single dads. But they're a fraction (a quarter) of single moms. Kearney is especially worried about boys falling behind and no role models around them. \"We've got millions of boys now growing up without dads in their home,\" she says. Data shows that boys from disadvantaged homes are more likely to get in trouble at school and with the criminal justice system. Altogether, this has a compounding effect of undermining social mobility and perpetuating inequality across generations, she argues. But what's marriage got to do with it? Kearney's endorsement of the institution of marriage seems antiquated and out of touch. Marriage rates have declined, with more people deciding to remain single for longer. Kearney says it's easy to assume that Americans are adopting a European lifestyle of raising children in partnerships, living together, free of labels. \"You get a knee jerk reaction from a lot of people like, 'Oh, well, it doesn't matter if they're married as long as they stay together,'\" says Kearney. \"The problem is, unmarried parents very rarely stay together.\" ECONOMY The IRS is increasing the standard deductions for 2023 as inflation intensifies In the U.S., she says, unmarried adults who decide to live together do it for a much shorter duration than in Europe. Children in many of these households are more likely to experience two or three parental partnerships by age 15. Kearney wants to veer clear from the politics and emotions surrounding the topic of marriage. She says she views her job as a social scientist who bases her work on facts and evidence and is unwilling to examine the complexities of marriage. \"I don't know exactly what it is about marriage, but it is a very practical matter,\" says Kearney, chafing at all the criticism. \"If you just look in the data, marriage is what delivers kids a stable, long-term, two-parent household in this country.\" But marriage is a loaded word that means different things to different people. It can be a religious union for some, a celebration of a romantic union, a legally binding contract for others and even an oppressive patriarchal institution. HISTORY Congress considers codifying same-sex marriage after long battle for gay rights Kearney says she's not advocating that children live in a household filled with marital tension or where parents are unhappy or mistreating each other. As an economist, she sees marriage as a long-term contract between two individuals to pool their resources and share household responsibilities, including raising children. Two is greater than one. The genders of the parents are irrelevant. Where are the dads? One of the biggest issues is that women seem to be giving up on men, particularly those without college degrees. The economics hasn't been kind to this demographic: Since the 1980s, those men have seen their earnings stagnate and employment rates fall. In the same period, more women entered the workforce and their average earnings increased regardless of their education level. This change has stripped many men of their traditional role as breadwinner for the family and, in simple terms, made them less desirable marriage partners. Research shows that in parts of the country where men's earnings have fallen, so too have marriage rates. LIFE KIT How to change your kid's behavior, according to the host of a hit parenting podcast Kearney cites sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas, who interviewed 162 single mothers for Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage. Their book suggests that many women don't marry the father of their child not because they reject the concept of marriage, but because they do not see him as a reliable source of economic security or stability. They appear to have a higher bar for a potential spouse than their partners, or the fathers of their children, have met. Kearney says she wants to grab the attention of both conservatives who say they care about children's well-being and progressives reluctant to talk about family structures, because the link between single parenting, inequality and mobility in America is too strong to deny. family single mothers parenting teenagers Facebook Flipboard Email More Stories From NPR BOOKS A new graphic novel version of 'Watership Down' aims to temper darkness with hope HUMOR & FUN James Patterson talks writing stories and fighting Norman Mailer BOOK REVIEWS 5 mysteries and thrillers new this fall BOOKS This author says Minecraft helps prepare kids for our world BOOK REVIEWS 'Organs of Little Importance' explores the curious ephemera that fill our minds BOOKS Using AI, cartoonist Amy Kurzweil connects with deceased grandfather in 'Artificial' Popular on NPR.org TV REVIEWS The recipe for a better 'Bake-Off'?

[...] \"If you just look in the data, marriage is what delivers kids a stable, long-term, two-parent household in this country.\"In my opinion looking into what&#x27;s driving that difference between couples in the US and Europe would be worth a discussion on its own. reply rayiner 10 hours agoprevWe should do more social studies research into US subcultures that have significantly different marriage norms than the mainstream US. Mormons and Asians both have strong taboos against divorce, and also have strong rates of upward mobility (i.e. much higher odds of kids from low income households ending up as high earning adults).There is some research supporting the link, but not nearly enough: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.brookings.edu&#x2F;articles&#x2F;how-marriage-and-divorce-... (“A child born to a never-married mother in the bottom fifth of family income is 3 times more likely to stay in the bottom fifth than a child born to a continuously married mother with equally low income.”).It’s possible that it’s not marriage per se. Both Mormons and Asians socialize children into “do what you’re obliged to do, not what you want to do.” Marriage is one aspect of that—you get married, and you stay married, and what you “want” doesn’t really matter. But it might be that mentality that also drives upward mobility rather than marriage per se. reply ecshafer 9 hours agoparentThis is one of the reasons that I think Kant&#x27;s ideas on Deontology (also Confucian philosophy around relationships) is the correct one for a functioning society.

Doing what is beneficial for society, and what is expected of society is right, regardless of the Good nature of it. If society expects you to fight in a war, and you kill someone, that is \"Right\" regardless of the fact that killing is \"bad\".But to bring this back to the topic on hand. It is right to study and work hard at school, it is right to be disciplined and not disrupt class, it is right to work a job and do well at the job.

She is saying that a household with a stable long lasting relationship is what’s driving these better outcomes.

I think what she’s stumbled on is yet again proof of Americans hyper individuality rearing its ugly face. The Europeans can stay together longer without the marriage piece of paper because1) Selfishness derived from hyper individuality doesn’t drive people to nope out of relationships at the first sign of minuscule problems or one side not getting their way2) Since over there not everything is an economical benefit proposal people value the relationship with different metrics than our countrymen and women do. reply Retric 19 hours agorootparentAgain, both parents in a stable long lasting relationship are capable of a stable long lasting relationship.

The other part of it is gender equality. For most of human civilization genders were not equal so both sexes evolved traits that are also unequal.The most glaring trait responsible for lack of marriage is female hypergamy. Previously women being of generally unequal&#x2F;lower status then men and overall a smaller pool of candidates (no online dating) would be forced to be more egalitarian in mate selection. It was easy for a woman to find a man who got paid more than them because this was most men.Now that women are doing better and having relatively more equal pay with men hypergamy is rearing it&#x27;s head in a more pronounced fashion. Female selection preferences are much more strict because if women are getting paid equally with men then they must find men that are paid more as well and this is obviously a much smaller pool than when women had no jobs.This along with exposure to the top men via online dating, women can now match with the top men in the entire city rather then the top men in her social circle. And this is exactly what you see in the online dating statistics.The top 20% of men match with the top 80% of women and the bottom 20% of women match with the bottom 80% of men. I mean as progressive as you want to be there&#x27;s no denying what I&#x27;m saying here as this data is just glaring. It spits in the face of people who say otherwise as it&#x27;s measuring current dating behavior. Individualism is part of the story because it does push for more power for women overall. But it is in the end this individualism among women that is changing the game in the US. But not just the US, other countries as well.So what&#x27;s going on is you have a few men who have an abundance of choice. They&#x27;re never going to settle because when men have an abundance of choice they switch their mating strategy from monogamy to harlem style polygamy. And then the rest of the men have a much harder time finding anyone at all.This is actually more beneficial to women from certain theoretical perspectives. In anthropology there&#x27;s a saying that monogamy benefits men while polygamy benefits women and general female behavior shows it. Basically for the best genes and resources, women generally prefer to \"share\" a top alpha man with other women over being in an exclusive monogamous relationship with a beta male.Men on the other hand don&#x27;t accept this strategy because they are providers of resources. If a woman sleeps with another man then the partner may end up raising and spending resources on another mans child. Thus all men have intense instincts to basically end an entire relationship once a woman has a single sexual affair.You can actually see how this behavior plays out in certain countries like Japan where women are totally ok with their husbands fucking prostitutes. As long as that man \"loves\" them and is providing resources for them, fucking a prostitute without love is totally ok for japanese women. Source: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;shorts&#x2F;i9qS5vDXLSIBasically we live in an era of changing social norms and it&#x27;s accelerating natural selection. The majority of men born today will not pass on their genes. Traits of alpha males including height, confidence will be expressed to a greater extent in future generations and it&#x27;s possible for the trend to continue roughly culling the bottom 80% of men out of the evolutionary process.Women are slowly getting the upper hand in terms of natural selection, and for men to get the upper hand usually they have to reintroduce monogamy back into the society as this guarantees a mate for every man. Monogamy is the more beneficial strategy to men overall because very few men can actually benefit from polygamy just by the nature of the way numbers work. Monogamous restrictions are pervasive enough throughout human civilization that some women have even evolved monogamous instincts via sexual selection as men actually actively seek these traits out in women.This is basically what&#x27;s going on from the most scientific point of view. It&#x27;s not politically correct so a lot of people vehemently disagree. Of course everything I say here is speaking to a general truth. There are plenty of exceptions but those exceptions do not negate the existence of the general truth. reply ckrapu 11 hours agorootparentAn assumption here is that attractive men both pair with women at a higher rate and also have more children.

Modern society satifies the resources side of the equation (whether that be overt welfare or covert welfare (getting a student loan + going to college + paper pushing corporate job)), leaving women the freedom to completely maximize the genetics side.

There are many studies on this with various conclusions worth reading, example set [1]. At a high level, US marriages (and potentially non-US long-term partnerships) bring stability, additional economic support, an additional role model (completely missing for boys growing up in a single mother household), additional attention & emotional support at home, and the ability to split parenting tasks as the need arises (ex. dad goes to a school event because mom needs to work late, or vice versa).Also important to note is that parental attention has a large impact on academic outcomes of kids [2], so in single parent households where the parent doesn&#x27;t have the time to provide sufficient attention, the kids suffer at school compared to their two-parent peers.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scholar.google.com&#x2F;scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=two...[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tandfonline.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1080&#x2F;00131911.2013.78... reply xattt 20 hours agoparentprevWhy not both?All people, kids and adults, have a finite level of emotional and mental energy that they have to “dispense” in everyday life. If you are a couple that’s dealing with marital strife, this is emotional overhead that gets diverted to dealing with that instead of your kids.Same goes for kids. A child that’s struggling to comprehend why parents decided to leave each other will be using that emotional energy to process it instead of focusing on personal growth.This is not taking into account the divorce process is costly, with money diverted to lawyers, instead of being pooled and applied to improve family life.Also, persons who divorce early in a relationship may not have taken the time to understand compatibility with each other, may be emotionally immature and impulsive. The lack of insight might be something that perpetuates into other aspects of their life.There are, obviously, relationship patterns where it takes a long time for one partner to realize the other one has gradually become more and more abusive and controlling, either because they have low self-confidence or self-esteem.

The data are very clear: if you grow up with married parents, you will do better. But, should everyone be rushing off to get married, or is marriage selective for people who will do better?

People select marriage partners who are trust worthy, stable, and not constantly looking for excitement.These same people, when they find a suitable spouse, are more likely to tough it out when things get unpleasant in the belief their spouse is fundamentally a good person.In marriage just like at work, you don’t judge someone by one event. People may have a bad day. Or they are sick and not themselves. Instead you should judge their actions over a long period of time. If someone has always been there for you, appreciated you and delivered what they promised, and for some reason hurt you today; you are more likely to give them the benefit of the doubt. reply hfuyf65 20 hours agorootparentprevIts effects may be more visible, because in previous iterations society condemned children out of wedlock so data on it was not as reliable.

There are a lot of factors confounded with marriage, and it doesn’t seem like the author controlled for them (this is an article about a book and not a peer reviewed study). She explicitly mentioned that married couples are more likely to have a better household income and that single moms are less likely to have support from outside family members. So I suspect that outcomes might be better for a single parent with the income and family support the same as a married couple, but that situation is rare. Similarly, if you forced two people to get married and have kids when they didn’t want to, those kids probably aren’t going to get the same benefit of growing up in a married household. reply pixl97 13 hours agorootparentI wonder how much more we can add to this withDivorce being more common now, but addingFamily sizes decreasing over time.Families moving farther away and not able to support each other as readily.Fewer friends with kids reducing the number of potential helpers with ones kids in time crunched&#x2F;emergency situations. reply WillAdams 20 hours agoparentprevI think that&#x27;s it in a nutshell.Divorce is also more common for selfish and self-centered people, and I would argue that those traits do not make for good parents.

The US has a social issue with some women using divorce for personal enrichment and neither US culture nor law penalizes this behavior.In many countries people who get divorced unnecessary are subject to social stigmatization.

The sending the money back in tax credits barely works in a single income house because the otherside in the massive increase of available workers in the US is the massive inflation of assets.

It&#x27;s so ingrained in the middle&#x2F;upper middle class that people can&#x27;t even see it. e.g. this article from Yale[0]:> Despite efforts to promote gender equality in occupations and professions, many women still choose to stay at home or work part-time. In the United States, for example, a 2015 Gallup survey found that more than half of women with children under age 18 would prefer to stay at home over working outside the home. Also, nearly 40 percent of women without children under age 18 indicated that they preferred the homemaker role.Let the phrasing sink in. Despite efforts, women still prefer that role. It&#x27;s quite clear from context that their preference is wrong.As far as economics goes, people wildly overstate how unachievable it is. Having a stay-at-home parent is not something reserved for the 1%, and in fact many poorer people do it for economic reasons. People have been taught not to want it, so they don&#x27;t try to figure out how to make it work.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive-yaleglobal.yale.edu&#x2F;content&#x2F;more-women-stay-... reply pixl97 10 hours agorootparentAnd conversely why is there no counter for men being stay at home rather than women?

There are certainly people pushing to normalize SAHDs in addition to calling for gender parity with paternity leave.That said, women are still almost 2x likely to prefer homemaking[1] even with the social engineering, and I suspect women&#x27;s preferences are stronger than men&#x27;s (e.g. I think it would be nice to be a SAHD, and I&#x27;d prefer it over outside work, but we probably wouldn&#x27;t be together if my wife weren&#x27;t the SAHM).

    "originBody": "SEARCH Subscribe Now SIGN IN Home News Tech Finance Leadership Well Recommends Fortune 500 EUROPE ·COMMODITIES Europe’s largest copper producer is the victim of metal swindle worth $198 million—and insiders may have been involved BYRYAN HOGG September 20, 2023 at 3:53 AM PDT Friedrich Merz, chairman of the CDU party, stands behind a copper scrap package during a tour of the Aurubis AG plant site. MARCUS BRANDT—PICTURE ALLIANCE/GETTY IMAGES Europe’s biggest copper producer says it was the victim of a major theft that saw it robbed of nearly $200 million worth of the base metal, and company insiders may have played a key part. In a Tuesday press release, Hamburg-based Aurubis AG said it had identified a €185 million (around $198 million) metals shortage after carrying out an extraordinary inventory in August. Aurubis said it had paid inflated invoices for scrap metal and other input materials for its copper production, based on samples it claimed had been manipulated. The group, which generated $18 billion in revenue last year, had already revealed “serious indications” of a shortfall in its metal products in August, confirming the company would miss its profit targets as a result. Shares in the copper maker plunged as much as 15% the day following that announcement before recovering slightly. “We are working closely with the investigative authorities and at full speed to get to the bottom of the criminal activities,” Aurubis CEO Roland Harings said in the press release. “We have pulled all of the necessary internal resources together and are using external forensic specialists.” The company said it was able to partially offset losses from the theft through a $30 million insurance payout and by seizing the assets of the criminals involved. The identity of those criminals is currently unclear, and a representative for Aurubis told Fortune the matter remained under scrutiny by Germany’s State Office of Criminal Investigation. However, in June the company revealed it had been the target of “past criminal activities,” with authorities investigating past and present Aurubis employees as well as outside employees working at the group’s site. That investigation by the Public Prosecutor’s Office resulted in €20 million worth of arrest warrants. Aurubis sought to reassure investors the company itself didn’t play a part in any illicit activities. It’s unconfirmed whether the purported theft ring highlighted in June was linked to the near $200 million asset shortfall. However, Aurubis said its June investigation was based on intermediate products, which are similar to the scrap metal shortages identified in August. Investors initially pushed the stock 5.6% higher in the minutes after Tuesday’s reveal, suggesting better than expected losses, before the stock pared back some of those gains. Shares were up 1.5% in early trading Wednesday. String of high-profile thefts Aurubis’s missing metal is the latest in a string of high-profile thefts that has caused huge anxiety among metals traders around the security of shipping infrastructure. Commodities trading is the subject of an unusually high level of bureaucracy and paperwork, leaving it ripe for corruption. The problem is a common one, and most fear is attached to insiders with access to those records. In February, commodities trader Trafigura Group said it was staring down the barrel of more than half a billion dollars in impairment charges after discovering the nickel cargoes it had traded actually contained much less valuable materials, namely bags of rocks. It was revealed in March that the world’s largest bank, JPMorgan, was the unfortunate owner of that shipment. For Aurubis’s part, it said customers had been unaffected by its own shortfall, though it was continuing to investigate the impact of the theft on suppliers. Crises in the commodities market have helped to rock the London Metal Exchange, the embattled trading house that processed more than $15 trillion worth of trades last year. The group was forced to briefly halt trading in nickel following the Trafigura crisis.

    "commentBody": "Europe&#x27;s largest copper producer is the victim of metal swindle worth $198MHacker NewspastloginEurope&#x27;s largest copper producer is the victim of metal swindle worth $198M (fortune.com) 168 points by ck45 19 hours ago| hidepastfavorite70 comments gpvos 18 hours agohttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.ph&#x2F;OwcRL not_your_vase 17 hours agoprevReminds me of my first \"real\" job, many many years ago.I was working at a metal pipe retailer, helping them switching from one ERP&#x2F;CRM to another. While moving the inventory between the systems we decided to also check the real inventory. It turned out that due to incorrectly using the previous system, there was quite a substantial shortage compared to the company&#x27;s turnover. Anyway, it had to be reported somehow to the shareholders... suddenly the management \"remembered\" that the previous team lead from the storage department has just left a few weeks ago, everything is his fault, they put all responsibility on him (without pursuing any further actions).Ahhh, I really don&#x27;t like some thing. reply dv_dt 16 hours agoparentThis makes me think about why new more accountable systems between companies sometimes fail in implementation. Sometimes the existing players are happy with the exploitable gaps in the existing system. reply baetylus 13 hours agorootparentGreat comment. Fun theory -- companies function on personal optics internally.When you sell software, you can get buy in easily if they can say \"this&#x27;ll make me look excellent to my boss\" (and they have decision-making power&#x2F;budget of course). Similarly, a boss will promote subordinates who will make him&#x2F;her look better. reply gottorf 10 hours agorootparentPut another way, the incentives facing any single component of a greater whole does not always align with the incentives of the organization itself. In fact, you could say that a good measure of how well an organization is run is how closely those different incentives align. reply maxbond 3 hours agorootparentIn economics, this is called the principle-agent problem.https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Principal%E2%80%93agent_proble... reply caminante 17 hours agoparentprevSketchy. Metals warehousing is notorious for embezzlement&#x2F;fraud.My hypothesis is that everyone assumes it&#x27;s too obvious to check or hard to steal. reply teraflop 17 hours agorootparentMatt Levine had a pretty entertaining explanation of a different incident earlier this year, involving futures contracts:> JPMorgan, which does not make batteries or cars, bought bags of abstract nickel years ago. It took delivery of that nickel, not in the sense that a truck full of nickel showed up on Park Avenue but in the sense that an entry was made, on the ledger of the warehouse, saying that the bags of nickel in Row X, Shelf Y now belonged to JPMorgan.> JPMorgan then used that nickel for its intended purposes for years. Those purposes were to write financial contracts referencing that nickel. The nickel worked perfectly well for those purposes — JPMorgan’s derivative contracts traded and paid off normally — for years, even though the nickel was not in fact nickel, just bags of rocks.> And then one day a warehouse worker, like, stubbed his toe against JPMorgan’s nickel and was like “hmm that’s not the sound nickel makes when you kick it” and opened the bags and found rocks. And then the [London Metal Exchange] dutifully reported that some nickel was not nickel, and JPMorgan’s nickel warrants were transformed into rocks warrants. But it’s all just a random accident? The purpose of JPMorgan’s nickel was not to be turned into batteries or cars, but to sit in a warehouse. It was doing a great job of that, until someone noticed!https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2023-03-21&#x2F;jpmorg... reply ChuckMcM 15 hours agorootparentAlso one of my favorites, futures derivative contracts are like second derivative meta on reality :-). The invention of money[1] was an example we used with our kids to explain the difference between \"money\" and \"wealth\"[2]. Because once you can internalize that distinction, you can ask yourself \"is this expensive or is it valuable?\" and get a reasoned answer to that.[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rai_stones[2] While many people associate \"wealth\" with \"being rich\" it actually has a economic definition unrelated to whether or not one possesses more or less of it than their neighbors for friends. From Investopedia, \"Wealth measures the value of all the assets of worth owned by a person.\" which you can give an example of that owning a bicycle is \"wealth\" that is an asset, and you can use that asset to get to and from a job that is further than you can walk, so that asset (wealth) enhances your ability to generate capitol (money) to fund your daily needs and to acquire more assets (wealth). reply carbotaniuman 11 hours agorootparentWhat would the first derivative be here? reply ChuckMcM 11 hours agorootparentThe future itself is the first derivative, it&#x27;s a bet on the rate of change in terms of availability and&#x2F;or consumption of a resource (hence the slope of the production curve), the second derivative is rate of change in the interest in the rate of change of the availability :-). reply hef19898 10 hours agorootparentprevIn a previous job, I did some stock taking. Quarterly, without trained people nor procedures instead of a proper cycle coint, done double blind, by a dedictaed team of people (I didn&#x27;t stay long at that job). Some of the inventory we had to account for, and funny enough most of it was almost correct accounting &#x2F; revenue shennenigans nothwothstanding, was stored in a huge warehouse that held aerospace grade aluminium and titanium ingots. Thousands of tons of those. All being traded on some exchanges, hardly ever leaving said warehouse.Propably nobody would ever nice what it was until, if ever, the ingots were to be used to produce bars and other raw materials for production. And even if it wasn&#x27;t aluminium or titanium by then, propably enough money was earned to just replace it with the real stuff and not worry. reply KennyBlanken 9 hours agorootparentI&#x27;ve read this four times and it feels like I&#x27;m having a stroke trying to understand it.Edit: I think they&#x27;re saying that they audited a metals warehouse and that nobody actually checked that the ingots were what they claimed to be.That&#x27;s probably because the ingots came from trusted sources and&#x2F;or were checked via things like mass and x-ray spectrography machines before being admitted into the system. reply I_Am_Nous 6 hours agorootparentMy main takeaway is that ownership of those metals isn&#x27;t translated into them being used for manufacturing, and since they generally aren&#x27;t used for manufacturing and they aren&#x27;t being moved when ownership transfers, there is very little reason to audit them.So if they eventually DO end up being purchased for manufacturing but upon inspection are found to be short stocked or it&#x27;s the wrong material entirely, the commenter was speculating that replacing the fake material with the real thing would be covered somehow either by the warehouse collecting storage fees or insurance. reply hef19898 3 hours agorootparentIt was avfun experience, we audited other stuff stored at the same warehouse (the reasons for that are good case study on how not to run logistics and warehouses). And I did raw material procurement, bars, plates and such, for aerospace before, so seeing the ingots sitting in a warehouse being bought and sold without being moved at all was interesting see. And we litterally thousands and thousands of ton of that stuff in a warehouse in one of the most expensive warehouse locations you can think of. reply gpm 15 hours agorootparentprevImportant footnotes> [2] To be clear, I’m making this up, I have no idea how the fraud was discovered and never want to find out, unless the real story is funnier than this one.> [3] I don’t know if they were? Is JPMorgan entitled to take out the rocks? Is it required to take out the rocks? “Hey JPMorgan you have 10 days to come pick up your rocks; if you don’t we’re gonna throw them through Jamie Dimon’s window”? If someone cracks open one of the rocks and there’s a diamond inside, does JPMorgan get the diamond? reply oatmeal1 15 hours agorootparentprevI wonder what fraction of nickel or other precious metals is effectively never used. With oil or grain, those will expire, so physical delivery is taken often. reply neilv 15 hours agorootparentprevI heard a bunch of conspiracy theories about Comex warehouses and gold repositories not actually holding the precious metals that they claim.But AFAICT, the theories were coming from political extremist influencers. (Buy these silver rounds at large premiums, so that, when the dollar collapses, and people find the warehouses are empty, and Canadian tanks roll into Washington, you&#x27;ll be the alpha male.)Would be funny if someday we learned that the demagogues were accidentally correct about the warehouse shenanigans. reply shrubble 10 hours agorootparentConsider that the stated gold reserves in Fort Knox haven&#x27;t been audited since the 1950s. Then-Treasury Secretary Mnuchin during the Trump administration, supposedly visited and in lieu of an actual audit, reported that &#x27;yup it&#x27;s there&#x27; ... Very reassuring! reply iSnow 14 hours agorootparentprevGermany&#x27;s central bank in 2013 was forced by those rumors to re-patriate a lot of gold formerly held in Paris and by the Federal Reserve in New York. So called conservatives seeded stories that the Fed had emptied the vaults and only paper remained.

And the enemy of my enemy is my friend?The world is complicated reply csomar 15 hours agorootparentIt’s bad because it can’t be settled. If Chase is to assume the clawback from a default settlement, then they are essentially non secured contracts and could have been traded so without the extra cost of the rocks.But in general you want the people responsible of delivery to be responsible and actually deliver even if 99% of the time the underlying is just exchanged electronically. reply rz2k 15 hours agorootparentprevFor the net impact to the economy it depends on few things.What did suppliers do in response? If suppliers believed there was a nickel reserve that could potentially enter the market, they would be less likely to choose strategies such as constraining supply in order to increase prices which helps consumers of nickel. However, they also would be less motivated to store up surplus nickel of their own that would help alleviate natural shortages.The other thing to consider is that we think the nickel did exist at some point in time, so in this case crime did pay. Therefore the thieves&#x27; ill-gotten gains will have increased their capacity to carry out future scams. reply pixl97 7 hours agorootparentprevA war starts tomorrow and you need need X to produce the stuff to protect your country. Not a problem right, you have plenty of X. Ooops, not really, it&#x27;s lies and corruption all the way down. reply Salgat 14 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s similar to if you provided insurance to someone and happily accepted payments knowing you could never actually pay out their insurance claim. The person making payments is a victim even if he never realizes it. reply pc86 12 hours agorootparentAre you though? You never had a claim that couldn&#x27;t be paid out. If you needed that insurance in order to do or buy something, you were able to do or buy that thing. You have no damages. You absolutely could have, but you didn&#x27;t. reply galaxyLogic 6 hours agorootparentYou would be a victim of fraud, assuming the insurer knew they didn&#x27;t have the assets. They were selling you security which didn&#x27;t exist. reply bequanna 16 hours agorootparentprevWell, this scheme temporarily added more “supply” to the tradable market which theoretically could have lowered overall prices some amount. reply mandmandam 16 hours agorootparentprevThe same JPMorgan that financed Epstein, failed to keep mandatory records, \"lost\" 47 million emails and were fined nearly a billion dollars for spoofing metals markets?

They had recently moved to a newer computer system that greatly expanded the capabilities one had in data charting and comparison. He had the idea \"Hey, if I identify where our floor losses due to damages are and minimize those it will probably lead to a nice bonus\", but when he began running the numbers something was very very wrong. Losses in some classes of very expensive products were orders of magnitude higher than other assumed random damages. Start coupling this with other data like the regular reoccurrence of damages to these same categories of products and things get suspicious. Then adding in the data the damages always happened on particular shifts and suddenly whispers of the word fraud show up.Turns out a number of employees, middle managers, and a vendor where all involved in a kickback scheme that had been going on for years. reply nullc 8 hours agorootparentSo did he get the nice bonus? reply pixl97 7 hours agorootparentA nice gold watch and no bonus even. Then the next year they internally announced to management they were going to downsize a good portion of the staff, but they couldn&#x27;t tell anyone.So he left the meeting. Told everyone he managed, and never went back. reply ajsnigrutin 10 hours agorootparentprevI was born in yugoslavia, so could be a local peculiarity.Wherever there was a large (communism, so government owned) company, if you needed something that company either had (raw materials) or produced, you just needed to find someone who worked there, and they would sell you whatever you needed. Friend works in iron works&#x2F;steel company? Need steel sheets, just call him. Need some end products? Just call him. Need cement? Or cement blocks? Just call someone who works at a cement factory, he&#x27;ll take a few blocks home every day, and after a week or two, you go to his house, pay and pick them up. It was never stealing trucks full of stuff, but with 1000+ workers, having 200, 300 workers that steal a bit every now and then (like pens and post it notes in the \"west\"), after a few years, you get whole neighbourhoods built using stolen bricks and cement, and all the fences were built out of iron rods, that were destined to become something else. reply Waterluvian 11 hours agoparentprevLast job I left I did say semi-sarcastically, “and now you can blame any bad thing on me for a while!”And they did from the numerous reports I got.

Someone signed off on the scrap metal samples and didn&#x27;t bother to have any testing of future deliveries? Or perhaps had someone sign off on future deliveries without checking their base metal content? Either way, insiders exploiting weak internal controls to personally profit is certainly one of the more common \"thefts\" mode, whether its employees taking things home from the store or accounts writing checks to their cousins against fake invoices.I often wonder if there is a correlation between companies with higher pay inequity and this sort of theft.

Efficient: multiplex many simultaneous streams over a single Link. Encryption: identify, authenticate, and encrypt each Link between peers. Flexible: use multiple transports, protocols, simultaneously. Meshing: supports multi-hop routing to a desired target peer w/ circuits. PubSub: publish/subscribe channels with pluggable implementations. Robust: uses Quic for reliable connections over lossy transports. Bifrost uses ControllerBus controllers and directives to manage links between peers, transports, routing, and other higher-level processes with extensive and flexible configuration. Overview Bifrost is designed around the following core concepts: Peer: a routable process or device with a keypair. Transport: a protocol which can create Links with other peers. Link: a connection between two peers over a Transport. Stream: channel of data between two Peer with a protocol type. RPC: request/reply and bidirectional streaming remote calls. PubSub: at-least-once delivery of messages to named topics. Integrates with networking, pubsub, and RPC libraries like libp2p, noise, drpc, starpc and nats. The network simulator, testbed, and in-proc transport can be used to write end-to-end tests as Go unit tests. The mock transports use identical code to the real transports, and appear the same to the application code. The http packages provide a http server and a mechanism for attaching http handlers to the controller bus and using them to serve requests. There is also an implementation of attaching and looking up http clients on the bus. EntityGraph exposes the internal state representation of Bifrost to visualizers and instrumentation via a graph-based inter-connected entity model. Configuring each component as an independent controller makes it easy to adapt application code to different operating environments and protocols. Examples Bifrost can be used as either a Go library or a command-line / daemon. The examples directory contains yaml files to configure the daemon, as well as \"toys\" which are self-contained Go program examples. To install the CLI and daemon: # Clone the repo and install. git clone https://github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost cd ./bifrost/cmd/bifrost go install -v # Alternatively: # Note: this currently fails on go >= 1.16 due to replace directives. # See: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44840 GO111MODULE=on go install -v github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost/cmd/bifrost@master Access help by adding the \"-h\" tag or running \"bifrost help.\" As a basic example, launch the daemon: bifrost daemon \\ --write-config \\ --hold-open-links \\ --pubsub nats \\ --api-listen :5110 \\ --udp-listen :5112 YAML Configuration An example of a ConfigSet in YAML format for the daemon: bifrost_daemon.yaml: # Start a UDP listener on port 5112. my-udp: id: bifrost/udp config: listenAddr: :5112 # Use the floodsub driver for PubSub. pubsub: id: bifrost/floodsub config: {} Daemon CLI The Bifrost daemon is configured with a YAML ConfigSet and/or via the API. NAME: bifrost daemon - run a bifrost daemon OPTIONS: --hold-open-links if set, hold open links without an inactivity timeout [$BIFROST_HOLD_OPEN_LINKS] --websocket-listen value if set, will listen on address for websocket connections, ex :5111 [$BIFROST_WS_LISTEN] --udp-listen value if set, will listen on address for udp connections, ex :5112 [$BIFROST_UDP_LISTEN] --xbee-device-path value xbee device path to open, if set [$BIFROST_XBEE_PATH] --xbee-device-baud value xbee device baudrate to use, defaults to 115200 (default: 115200) [$BIFROST_XBEE_BAUD] --establish-peers value if set, request establish links to list of peer ids [$BIFROST_ESTABLISH_PEERS] --xbee-peers value list of peer-id@address known XBee peers [$BIFROST_XBEE_PEERS] --udp-peers value list of peer-id@address known UDP peers [$BIFROST_UDP_PEERS] --websocket-peers value list of peer-id@address known WebSocket peers [$BIFROST_WS_PEERS] --pubsub value if set, will configure pubsub from options: [floodsub, nats] [$BIFROST_PUBSUB] --config value, -c value path to configuration yaml file (default: \"bifrost_daemon.yaml\") [$BIFROST_CONFIG] --write-config write the daemon config file on startup [$BIFROST_WRITE_CONFIG] --node-priv value path to node private key, will be generated if doesn't exist (default: \"bifrost_daemon.pem\") [$BIFROST_NODE_PRIV] --api-listen value if set, will listen on address for API connections, ex :5110 (default: \":5110\") [$BIFROST_API_LISTEN] --prof-listen value if set, debug profiler will be hosted on the port, ex :8080 [$BIFROST_PROF_LISTEN] These CLI flags are provided for convenience to quickly configure a daemon, and the resulting config can be written to a file with --write-config for further adjustments to be made. Note, however, that additional controllers are available which are not yet exposed via these flags. Client CLI Most Bifrost functionality is exposed on the client CLI and RPC API: Mount a peer by loading a private key into the daemon. Forward incoming streams with a protocol ID to a multiaddress Proxy incoming connections to a listener to a remote peer Open a stream with a remote peer and a given protocol ID Accept a stream for a local peer with a given protocol ID The client CLI has the following help output: bifrost client command [command options] [arguments...] COMMANDS: local-peers returns local peer info identify Private key will be loaded with a peer controller subscribe Subscribe to a pubsub channel with a private key or mounted peer and publish base64 w/ newline delim from stdin. forward Protocol ID will be forwarded to the target multiaddress accept Single incoming stream with Protocol ID will be accepted dial Single outgoing stream with Protocol ID will be dialed listen Listen on the multiaddress and forward the connection to a remote stream. controller-bus, cbus ControllerBus system sub-commands. With the above operations, all stream handling and interaction with the network is exposed to the API and command line. Some examples: # Note: you can edit bifrost_daemon.yaml to change settings. # Once the daemon configuration exists, you can now just run: bifrost daemon # While the command is executing, the private key will be attached. bifrost client identify --peer-priv priv-key.pem # While the command is executing, a forwarding controller will be running. # Protocol ID will be forwarded to the target multiaddress # Handles HandleMountedStream directives by contacting the target. # HTTP can be easily proxied through an encrypted stream this way. bifrost client forward \\ --peer-id\\ --protocol-id /x/myproto \\ --target /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8000 # While the command is executing, a proxying controller will be running. # Protocol ID will be proxied from the listen multiaddress to the target peer. # Calls OpenStream to build a stream fromto . # HTTP can be easily proxied through an encrypted stream this way. bifrost client listen \\ --peer-id\\ --from-peer-id\\ --protocol-id /x/myproto \\ --listen /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8001 # Wait for a stream to be opened to the mounted peer with the protocol ID /x/myproto # Standard output is the incoming data stream, standard input is the outgoing data stream. # Standard error is used for logging. bifrost client accept \\ --local-peer-id\\ --protocol-id /x/myproto # Establish a stream. # Standard output is the incoming data stream, standard input is the outgoing data stream. # Standard error is used for logging. bifrost client dial \\ --peer-id\\ --local-peer-id\\ --protocol-id /x/myproto Example: forward HTTP traffic between peers The following is a basic example of using the CLI to forward encrypted traffic between a local port and a remote peer port, similar to SSH port forwarding: # note the peer id in the logs ./bifrost daemon \\ --write-config \\ --udp-listen :5000 \\ --node-priv daemon_node_priv_2.pem \\ --websocket-listen \":5111\" \\ --prof-listen \":6201\" # forward incoming connections to port 8000 # example: \"python3 -m http.server 8080\" ./bifrost client forward \\ --protocol-id \"test/protocol\" \\ --target /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8000 # replace PEER-ID-HERE with the peer ID from the first daemon. # start a second daemon (in a new shell). ./bifrost daemon \\ --udp-listen :5001 \\ --udp-peers \"PEER-ID-HERE@127.0.0.1:5000\" \\ --api-listen \":5112\" # tell it to listen on port 8082 and forward to the other peer. # try browsing to http://localhost:8082 ./bifrost client --dial-addr 127.0.0.1:5112 listen \\ --peer-id \"PEER-ID-HERE\" \\ --protocol-id test/protocol \\ --listen /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8002 This example shows how to run two daemons with information on how to contact each other, and then \"tell\" the second daemon to listen on port 8002 and forward any incoming connections to the remote peer with the given peer ID. When someone connects to port 8002 the EstablishLinkWithPeer directive is added and the UDP transport opens the connection with the peer (on-demand.) The stream is then negotiated. The remote daemon uses HandleMountedStream which is handled by the \"forwarding\" controller, which forwards the stream to localhost at 8000. Transports and Links A Link is a packet stream between two Peer. Links are created by Transports, which are associated with a local private keypair. Transports are responsible for handshaking their identity and providing stream multiplexing, encryption, and ordering. The Bifrost codebase contains common implementations for packet-based and stream-based transports, based primarily on the quic-go implementation of the Quic UDP protocol. The HandleMountedStream directive contains incoming protocol and peer info. The appropriate controller for the protocol responds to the directive and handles the incoming stream. This decouples the transport layers from the protocols. PubSub A PubSub is a controller that supports topic-based at-least-once delivery. Nats and floodsub are currently supported as PubSub protocols. Support Please open a GitHub issue with any questions / issues. ... or feel free to reach out on Matrix Chat or Discord.

What is this for? reply aperturecjs 15 hours agoparentHi, author here. Thanks for checking out Bifrost. The short pitch is: any protocol over any transport with seamless cross-platform (browsernative) communication.Building internet applications often involves writing code that is tightly integrated with the choice of communications transport, for example, one has to make the design decision to use either WebSockets or WebRTC, and then all other design decisions are driven by that.Bifrost aims to allow developing applications without knowing or caring which protocols are used under the hood. The app can just say \"Open a stream with peer X\" and whatever configured transport(s) make that happen.I&#x27;m still working to improve the docs and new user experience, if you have any suggestions on how I can make it easier to understand, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it! reply eatbitseveryday 12 hours agorootparentI see, thanks. I think it would be useful in the docs to describe both some less technical as well as some technical examples of useful applications of your work.Do you have some examples of _concrete problems_ that would be easily solved with this? If so, mention them.Telling folks about technical aspects doesn’t help advertise your work unless you can help a new reader relate it with their own experiences or problems. reply BiteCode_dev 14 hours agorootparentprevCan it work over bluetooh, or with custom \"mic to headphone sound-driver protocols\"?Does it include discovering peers on a local network or around you?Do it handle signaling? reply aperturecjs 14 hours agorootparentBluetooth could work! Just need to implement the Transport interface.Peer discovery is not implemented at the moment but could easily be added (and will be soon). Here&#x27;s how: any controller can resolve EstablishLinkWithPeer. A peer discovery controller could compare the list of discovered peers with the list of desired connections and initiate connections via UDP when there&#x27;s a match.Signaling is managed by the Link implementation. For UDP we use quic-go. reply BiteCode_dev 14 hours agorootparentThis stack could be the basis of a software to share things no matter your connectivity situation.You fire it up, it scans things around. Local network? It uses that. Not local but internet, it uses that. Nothing but BT, you can still detect people around, chat and exchange files.People could be identified by public keys and that&#x27;s it, not need for an account, signaling done by zeroconf&#x2F;bt-scanning&#x2F;bittorent.Basically a solution to the current chat nightmare.But the amount of work is overwhelming, even with this. reply MadnessASAP 13 hours agorootparentprevWhile we have your attention, does Bifrost support peer multipathing or weights? reply aperturecjs 10 hours agorootparentThere is a design for routing in the repo (and tor-like circuits). However it is not implemented yet.

Seems to run on different platforms (browsers, mobile, desktop, server). Basically the library helps two different computers to talk with each other, without any servers setup in the middle.At a glance, it looks pretty much like libp2p (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;libp2p.io&#x2F;) but seems to integrate with libp2p as well (meaning you should be able to use Bifrost on one end, and libp2p on the other), so I&#x27;m guessing there is at least some fundamental difference, but I cannot spot it.

None of this is intuitive or easy to grasp for me. Even the inclusion of the demo and example directories weren&#x27;t easy for me to find because they aren&#x27;t standardized. The fsf also thinks that free documentation is important. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;free-doc.html . I view software like this as pretty exclusionary. We will have to agree to disagree, but I would say that the amount of people with requisite experience to understand software is lower than the amount of people who are (or in my particular case, were) interested in learning about it by looking through the source. This interaction is a prime example of why the free software movement stalls. Software written by insiders, for insiders is exclusionary from my point of view. reply diggan 14 hours agorootparent> Software written by insiders, for insiders is exclusionary from my point of view.Where do you draw the line? At one point, you have to accept that some projects require deep and context-specific knowledge. I can&#x27;t be expected to be handheld if I dive deep into some math libraries without knowing the prerequisites. And if I do anyway, it&#x27;s up to me to figure out at least the basics on my own.The README has the examples and explanations you&#x27;re looking for, they&#x27;re just using the language common in the peer-to-peer ecosystem, as it&#x27;s a peer-to-peer library&#x2F;cli&#x2F;daemon. reply themoonisachees 2 hours agorootparent...which is kind of what is being complained about by GP.

    "originBody": "The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat Chip Morningstar and F. Randall Farmer Electric Communities This paper was presented at The First Annual International Conference on Cyberspace in 1990. It was published in Cyberspace: First Steps, Michael Benedikt (ed.), 1990, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. Introduction Lucasfilm's Habitat was created by Lucasfilm Games, a division of LucasArts Entertainment Company, in association with Quantum Computer Services, Inc. It was arguably one of the first attempts to create a very large scale commercial multi-user virtual environment. A far cry from many laboratory research efforts based on sophisticated interface hardware and tens of thousands of dollars per user of dedicated compute power, Habitat is built on top of an ordinary commercial online service and uses an inexpensive -- some would say \"toy\" -- home computer to support user interaction. In spite of these somewhat plebeian underpinnings, Habitat is ambitious in its scope. The system we developed can support a population of thousands of users in a single shared cyberspace. Habitat presents its users with a real-time animated view into an online simulated world in which users can communicate, play games, go on adventures, fall in love, get married, get divorced, start businesses, found religions, wage wars, protest against them, and experiment with self-government. The Habitat project proved to be a rich source of insights into the nitty-gritty reality of actually implementing a serious, commercially viable cyberspace environment. Our experiences developing the Habitat system, and managing the virtual world that resulted, offer a number of interesting and important lessons for prospective cyberspace architects. The purpose of this paper is to discuss some of these lessons. We hope that the next generation of builders of virtual worlds can benefit from our experiences and (especially) from our mistakes. Due to space limitations, we won't be able to go into as much technical detail as we might like; this will have to be left to a future publication. Similarly, we will only be able to touch briefly upon some of the history of the project as a business venture, which is a fascinating subject of its own. Although we will conclude with a brief discussion of some of the future directions for this technology, a more detailed exposition on this topic will also have to wait for a future article. The essential lesson that we have abstracted from our experiences with Habitat is that a cyberspace is defined more by the interactions among the actors within it than by the technology with which it is implemented. While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface technologies -- DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering engines, and so on -- both exciting and promising, the almost mystical euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced. We can't help having a nagging sense that it's all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing issues. At the core of our vision is the idea that cyberspace is necessarily a multiple-participant environment. It seems to us that the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can affect one another. Beyond a foundation set of communications capabilities, the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while sexy and interesting, is a peripheral concern. What is Habitat? Habitat is a \"multi-player online virtual environment\" (its purpose is to be an entertainment medium; consequently, the users are called \"players\"). Each player uses his or her home computer as a frontend, communicating over a commercial packet-switching data network to a centralized backend system. The frontend provides the user interface, generating a real-time animated display of what is going on and translating input from the player into requests to the backend. The backend maintains the world model, enforcing the rules and keeping each player's frontend informed about the constantly changing state of the universe. The backend enables the players to interact not only with the world but with each other. Habitat was inspired by a long tradition of \"computer hacker science fiction\", notably Vernor Vinge's novel, True Names [1], as well as many fond childhood memories of games of make-believe, more recent memories of role-playing games and the like, and numerous other influences too thoroughly blended to pinpoint. To this we add a dash of silliness, a touch of cyberpunk [2,3], and a predilection for object-oriented programming [4]. The initial incarnation of Habitat uses a Commodore 64 for the frontend. One of the questions we are asked most frequently is, \"Why the Commodore 64?\" Many people somehow get the impression that this was a technical decision, but the real explanation has to do with business, not technology. Habitat was initially developed by Lucasfilm as commercial product for QuantumLink, an online service (then) exclusively for owners of the Commodore 64. At the time we started (1985), the Commodore 64 was the mainstay of the recreational computing market. Since then it has declined dramatically in both its commercial and technical significance. However, when we began the project, we didn't get a choice of platforms. The nature of the deal was such that both the Commodore 64 for the frontend and the existing QuantumLink host system (a brace of Stratus fault-tolerant minicomputers) for the backend were givens. The largest part of the screen is devoted to the graphics display. This is an animated view of the player's current location in the Habitat world. The scene consists of various objects arrayed on the screen, such as the houses and tree you see here. The players are represent by animated figures that we call \"Avatars\". Avatars are usually, though not exclusively, humanoid in appearance. In this scene you can see two of them, carrying on a conversation. Avatars can move around, pick up, put down and manipulate objects, talk to each other, and gesture, each under the control of an individual player. Control is through the joystick, which enables the player to point at things and issue commands. Talking is accomplished by typing on the keyboard. The text that a player types is displayed over his or her Avatar's head in a cartoon-style \"word balloon\". A typical Habitat scene (© 1986 LucasArts Entertainment Company). The Habitat world is made up of a large number of discrete locations that we call \"regions\". In its prime, the prototype Habitat world consisted of around 20,000 of them. Each region can adjoin up to four other regions, which can be reached simply by walking your Avatar to one or another edge of the screen. Doorways and other passages can connect to additional regions. Each region contains a set of objects which define the things that an Avatar can do there and the scene that the player sees on the computer screen. Some of the objects are structural, such as the ground or the sky. Many are just scenic, such as the tree or the mailbox. Most objects, however, have some function that they perform. For example, doors transport Avatars from one region to another and may be opened, closed, locked and unlocked. ATMs (Automatic Token Machines) enable access to an Avatar's bank account. Vending machines dispense useful goods in exchange for Habitat money. Habitat contained its own fully-fledged economy, with money, banks, and so on. Habitat's unit of currency is the Token, owing to the fact that it is a token economy and to acknowledge the long and honorable association between tokens and video games. Many objects are portable and may be carried around in an Avatar's hands or pockets. These include various kinds of containers, money, weapons, tools, and exotic magical implements. Listed here are some of the most important types of objects and their functions. The complete list of object types numbers in the hundreds.

The frontend consists of a system kernel and a collection of objects. The kernel handles memory management, display generation, disk I/O, telecommunications, and other \"operating system\" functions. The objects implement the semantics of the world itself. Each type of Habitat object has a definition consisting of a set of resources, including animation cels to drive the display, audio data, and executable code. An object's executable code implements a series of standard behaviors, each of which is invoked by a different player command or system event. The model is similar to that found in an object-oriented programming system such as Smalltalk [5], with its classes, methods and messages. These resources consume significant amounts of scarce frontend memory, so we can't keep them all in core at the same time. Fortunately, their definitions are invariant, so we simply swap them in from disk as we need them, discarding less recently used resources to make room. When an object is instantiated, we allocate a block of memory to contain the object's state. The first several bytes of an object's state information take the same form in all objects, and include such things as the object's screen location and display attributes. This standard information is interpreted by the system kernel as it generates the display and manages the run-time environment. The remainder of the state information varies with the object type and is accessed only by the object's behavior code. Object behaviors are invoked by the kernel in response to player input. Each object responds to a set of standard verbs that map directly onto the commands available to the player. Each behavior is simply a subroutine that executes the indicated action; to do this it may invoke the behaviors of other objects or send request messages to the backend. Besides the standard verb behaviors, objects may have additional behaviors which are invoked by messages that arrive asynchronously from the backend. The backend also maintains an object-oriented representation of the world. As in the frontend, objects on the backend possess executable behaviors and in-memory state information. In addition, since the backend maintains a persistent global state for the entire Habitat world, the objects are also represented by database records that may be stored on disk when not \"in use\". Backend object behaviors are invoked by messages from the frontend. Each of these backend behaviors works in roughly the same way: a message is received from a player's frontend requesting some action; the action is taken and some state changes to the world result; the backend behavior sends a response message back to the frontend informing it of the results of its request and notification messages to the frontends of any other players who are in the same region, informing them of what has taken place. The Lessons In order to say as much as we can in the limited space available, we will describe what think we learned via a series of principles or assertions surrounded by supporting reasoning and illustrative anecdotes. A more formal and thorough exposition will have to come later in some other forum where we might have the space to present a more comprehensive and detailed model. We mentioned our primary principle above: A multi-user environment is central to the idea of cyberspace. It is our deep conviction that a definitive characteristic of a cyberspace system is that it represents a multi-user environment. This stems from the fact that what (in our opinion) people seek in such a system is richness, complexity and depth. Nobody knows how to produce an automaton that even approaches the complexity of a real human being, let alone a society. Our approach, then, is not even to attempt this, but instead to use the computational medium to augment the communications channels between real people. If what we are constructing is a multi-user environment, it naturally follows that some sort of communications capability must be fundamental to our system. However, we must take into account an observation that is the second of our principles: Communications bandwidth is a scarce resource. This point was rammed home to us by one of Habitat's nastier externally imposed design constraints, namely that it provide a satisfactory experience to the player over a 300 baud serial telephone connection (one, moreover, routed through commercial packet-switching networks that impose an additional, uncontrollable latency of 100 to 5000 milliseconds on each packet transmitted). Even in a more technically advanced network, however, bandwidth remains scarce in the sense that economists use the term: available carrying capacity is not unlimited. The law of supply and demand suggests that no matter how much capacity is available, you always want more. When communications technology advances to the point were we all have multi-gigabaud fiber optic connections into our homes, computational technology will have advanced to match. Our processors' expanding appetite for data will mean that the search for ever more sophisticated data compression techniques will still be a hot research area (though what we are compressing may at that point be high-resolution volumetric time-series or something even more esoteric)[6]. Computer scientists tend to be reductionists who like to organize systems in terms of primitive elements that can be easily manipulated within the context of a simple formal model. Typically, you adopt a small variety of very simple primitives which are then used in large numbers. For a graphics-oriented cyberspace system, the temptation is to build upon bit-mapped images or polygons or some other graphic primitive. These sorts of representations, however, are invitations to disaster. They arise from an inappropriate fixation on display technology, rather than on the underlying purpose of the system. However, the most significant part of what we wish to be communicating are human behaviors. These, fortunately, can be represented quite compactly, provided we adopt a relatively abstract, high-level description that deals with behavioral concepts directly. This leads to our third principle: An object-oriented data representation is essential. Taken at its face value, this assertion is unlikely to be controversial, as object-oriented programming is currently the methodology of choice among the software engineering cognoscenti. However, what we mean here is not only that you should adopt an object-oriented approach, but that the basic objects from which you build the system should correspond more-or-less to the objects in the user's conceptual model of the virtual world, that is, people, places, and artifacts. You could, of course, use object-oriented programming techniques to build a system based on, say, polygons, but that would not help to cope with the fundamental problem. The goal is to enable the communications between machines take place primarily at the behavioral level (what people and things are doing) rather than at the presentation level (how the scene is changing). The description of a place in the virtual would should be in terms of what is there rather than what it looks like. Interactions between objects should be described by functional models rather than by physical ones. The computation necessary to translate between these higher-level representations and the lower-level representations required for direct user interaction is an essentially local function. At the local processor, display-rendering techniques may be arbitrarily elaborate and physical models arbitrarily sophisticated. The data channel capacities required for such computations, however, need not and should not be squeezed into the limited bandwidth available between the local processor and remote ones. Attempting to do so just leads to disasters such as NAPLPS [7,8]. Once we begin working at the conceptual rather than the presentation level, we are struck by the following observation: The implementation platform is relatively unimportant. The presentation level and the conceptual level cannot (and should not) be totally isolated from each other. However, defining a virtual environment in terms of the configuration and behavior of objects, rather than their presentation, enables us to span a vast range of computational and display capabilities among the participants in a system. This range extends both upward and downward. As an extreme example, a typical scenic object, such as a tree, can be represented by a handful of parameter values. At the lowest conceivable end of things might be an ancient Altair 8800 with a 300 baud ASCII dumb terminal, where the interface is reduced to fragments of text and the user sees the humble string so familiar to the players of text adventure games, \"There is a tree here.\" At the high end, you might have a powerful processor that generates the image of the tree by growing a fractal model and rendering it three dimensions at high resolution, the finest details ray-traced in real time, complete with branches waving in the breeze and the sound of wind in the leaves coming through your headphones in high-fidelity digital stereo. And these two users might be looking at the same tree in same the place in the same world and talking to each other as they do so. Both of these scenarios are implausible at the moment, the first because nobody would suffer with such a crude interface when better ones are so readily available, the second because the computational hardware does not yet exist. The point, however, is that this approach covers the ground between systems already obsolete and ones that are as yet gleams in their designers' eyes. Two consequences of this are significant. The first is that we can build effective cyberspace systems today. Habitat exists as ample proof of this principle. The second is that it is conceivable that with a modicum of cleverness and foresight you could start building a system with today's technology that could evolve smoothly as the tomorrow's technology develops. The availability of pathways for growth is important in the real world, especially if cyberspace is to become a significant communications medium (as we obviously think it should). Given that we see cyberspace as fundamentally a communications medium rather than simply a user interface model, and given the style of object-oriented approach that we advocate, another point becomes clear: Data communications standards are vital. However, our concerns about cyberspace data communications standards center less upon data transport protocols than upon the definition of the data being transported. The mechanisms required for reliably getting bits from point A to point B are not terribly interesting to us. This is not because these mechanisms are not essential (they obviously are) nor because they do not pose significant research and engineering challenges (they clearly do). It is because we are focused on the unique communications needs of an object-based cyberspace. We are concerned with the protocols for sending messages between objects, that is, for communicating behavior rather than presentation, and for communicating object definitions from one system to another. Communicating object definitions seems to us to be an especially important problem, and one that we really didn't have an opportunity to address in Habitat. It will be necessary to address this problem if we are to have a dynamic system. The ability to add new classes of objects over time is crucial if the system is to be able to evolve. While we are on the subject of communications standards, we would like to make some remarks about the ISO Reference Model of Open System Interconnection [9]. This multi-layered model has become a centerpiece of most discussions about data communications standards these days. Unfortunately, while the bottom 4 or 5 layers of this model provide a more or less sound framework for considering data transport issues, we feel that the model's Presentation and Application layers are not so helpful when considering cyberspace data communications. We have two main quarrels with the ISO model: first, it partitions the general data communications problem in a way that is a poor match for the needs of a cyberspace system; second, and more importantly, we think it is an active source of confusion because it focuses the attention of system designers on the wrong set of issues and thus leads them to spend their time solving the wrong set of problems. We know because this happened to us. \"Presentation\" and \"Application\" are simply the wrong abstractions for the higher levels of a cyberspace communications protocol. A \"Presentation\" protocol presumes characteristics of the display are embedded in the protocol. The discussions above should give some indication why we feel such a presumption is both unnecessary and unwise. An \"Application\" protocol presumes a degree of foreknowledge of the message environment that is incompatible with the sort of dynamically evolving object system we envision. A better model would be to substitute a different pair of top layers: a Message layer, which defines the means by which objects can address one another and standard methods of encapsulating structured data and encoding low-level data types (e.g., numbers); and a Definition layer built on top of the Message layer, which defines a standard representation for object definitions so that object classes can migrate from machine to machine. One might argue that these are simply Presentation and Application with different labels, but we don't think the differences are so easily reconciled. In particular, we think the ISO model has, however unintentionally, systematically deflected workers in the field from considering many of the issues that concern us. World Building There were two sorts of implementation challenges that Habitat posed. The first was the problem of creating a working piece of technology -- developing the animation engine, the object-oriented virtual memory, the message-passing pseudo operating system, and squeezing them all into the ludicrous Commodore 64 (the backend system also posed interesting technical problems, but its constraints were not as vicious). The second challenge was the creation and management of the Habitat world itself. It is the experiences from the latter exercise that we think will be most relevant to future cyberspace designers. We were initially our own worst enemies in this undertaking, victims of a way of thinking to which we engineers are dangerously susceptible. This way of thinking is characterized by the conceit that all things may be planned in advance and then directly implemented according to the plan's detailed specification. For persons schooled in the design and construction of systems based on simple, well-defined and well-understood foundation principles, this is a natural attitude to have. Moreover, it is entirely appropriate when undertaking most engineering projects. It is a frame of mind that is an essential part of a good engineer's conceptual tool kit. Alas, in keeping with Maslow's assertion that, \"to the person who has only a hammer, all the world looks like a nail\", it is a tool that is easy to carry beyond its range of applicability. This happens when a system exceeds the threshold of complexity above which the human mind loses its ability to maintain a complete and coherent model. One generally hears about systems crossing the complexity threshold when they become very large. For example, the Space Shuttle and the B-2 bomber are both systems above this threshold, necessitating extraordinarily involved, cumbersome and time-consuming procedures to keep the design under control -- procedures that are at once vastly expensive and only partially successful. To a degree, the complexity problem can be solved by throwing money at it. However, such capital intensive management techniques are a luxury not available to most projects. Furthermore, although these dubious \"solutions\" to the complexity problem are out of reach of most projects, alas the complexity threshold itself is not. Smaller systems can suffer from the same sorts of problems. It is possible to push much smaller and less elaborate systems over the complexity threshold simply by introducing chaotic elements that are outside the designers' sphere of control or understanding. The most significant such chaotic elements are autonomous computational agents (e.g., other computers). This is why, for example, debugging even very simple communications protocols often proves surprisingly difficult. Furthermore, a special circle of living Hell awaits the implementors of systems involving that most important category of autonomous computational agents of all, groups of interacting human beings. This leads directly to our next (and possibly most controversial) assertion: Detailed central planning is impossible; don't even try. The constructivist prejudice that leads engineers into the kinds of problems just mentioned has received more study from economists and sociologists [10-15] than from researchers in the software engineering community. Game and simulation designers are experienced in creating virtual worlds for individuals and small groups. However, they have had no reason to learn to deal with large populations of simultaneous users. Since each user or group is unrelated to the others, the same world can be used over and over again. If you are playing an adventure game, the fact that thousands of other people elsewhere in the (real) world are playing the same game has no effect on your experience. It is reasonable for the creator of such a world to spend tens or even hundreds of hours crafting the environment for each hour that a user will spend interacting with it, since that user's hour of experience will be duplicated tens of thousands of times by tens of thousands of other individual users. Builders of online services and communications networks are experienced in dealing with large user populations, but they do not, in general, create elaborate environments. Furthermore, in a system designed to deliver information or communications services, large numbers of users are simply a load problem rather than a complexity problem. All the users get the same information or services; the comments in the previous paragraph regarding duplication of experience apply here as well. It is not necessary to match the size and complexity of the information space to the size of the user population. While it may turn out that the quantity of information available on a service is a function of the size of the user population, this information can generally be organized into a systematic structure that can still be maintained by a few people. The bulk, wherein the complexity lies, is the product of the users themselves, rather than the system designers -- the operators of the system do not have to create all this material. (This observation is the first clue to the solution to our problem.) Our original specification for Habitat called for us to create a world capable of supporting a population of 20,000 Avatars, with expansion plans for up to 50,000. By any reckoning this is a large undertaking and complexity problems would certainly be expected. However, in practice we exceeded the complexity threshold very early in development. By the time the population of our online community had reached around 50 we were in over our heads (and these 50 were \"insiders\" who were prepared to be tolerant of holes and rough edges). Moreover, a virtual world such as Habitat needs to scale with its population. For 20,000 Avatars we needed 20,000 \"houses\", organized into towns and cities with associated traffic arteries and shopping and recreational areas. We needed wilderness areas between the towns so that everyone would not be jammed together into the same place. Most of all, we needed things for 20,000 people to do. They needed interesting places to visit -- and since they can't all be in the same place at the same time, they needed a lot of interesting places to visit -- and things to do in those places. Each of those houses, towns, roads, shops, forests, theaters, arenas, and other places is a distinct entity that someone needs to design and create. We, attempting to play the role of omniscient central planners, were swamped. Automated tools may be created to aid the generation of areas that naturally possess a high degree of regularity and structure, such as apartment buildings and road networks. We created a number of such tools, whose spiritual descendents will no doubt be found in the standard bag of tricks of future cyberspace architects. However, the very properties which make some parts of the world amenable to such techniques also make those same parts of the world among the least important. It is really not a problem if every apartment building looks pretty much like every other. It is a big problem if every enchanted forest is the same. Places whose value lies in their uniqueness, or at least in their differentiation from the places around them, need to be crafted by hand. This is an incredibly labor intensive and time consuming process. Furthermore, even very imaginative people are limited in the range of variation that they can produce, especially if they are working in a virgin environment uninfluenced by the works and reactions of other designers. Running The World The world design problem might still be tractable, however, if all players had the same goals, interests, motivations and types of behavior. Real people, however, are all different. For the designer of an ordinary game or simulation, human diversity is not a major problem, since he or she gets to establish the goals and motivations on the participants' behalf, and to specify the activities available to them in order to channel events in the preferred direction. Habitat, however, was deliberately open ended and pluralistic. The idea behind our world was precisely that it did not come with a fixed set of objectives for its inhabitants, but rather provided a broad palette of possible activities from which the players could choose, driven by their own internal inclinations. It was our intent to provide a variety of possible experiences, ranging from events with established rules and goals (a treasure hunt, for example) to activities propelled by the players' personal motivations (starting a business, running the newspaper) to completely free-form, purely existential activities (hanging out with friends and conversing). Most activities, however, involved some degree of pre-planning and setup on our part -- we were to be like the cruise director on a ocean voyage, but we were still thinking like game designers. The first goal-directed event planned for Habitat was a rather involved treasure hunt called the \"D'nalsi Island Adventure\". It took us hours to design, weeks to build (including a 100-region island), and days to coordinate the actors involved. It was designed much like the puzzles in an adventure game. We thought it would occupy our players for days. In fact, the puzzle was solved in about 8 hours by a person who had figured out the critical clue in the first 15 minutes. Many of the players hadn't even had a chance to get into the game. The result was that one person had had a wonderful experience, dozens of others were left bewildered, and a huge investment in design and setup time had been consumed in an eyeblink. We expected that there would be a wide range of \"adventuring\" skills in the Habitat audience. What wasn't so obvious until afterward was that this meant that most people didn't have a very good time, if for no other reason than that they never really got to participate. It would clearly be foolish and impractical for us to do things like this on a regular basis. Again and again we found that activities based on often unconscious assumptions about player behavior had completely unexpected outcomes (when they were not simply outright failures). It was clear that we were not in control. The more people we involved in something, the less in control we were. We could influence things, we could set up interesting situations, we could provide opportunities for things to happen, but we could not dictate the outcome. Social engineering is, at best, an inexact science (or, as some wag once said, \"in the most carefully constructed experiment under the most carefully controlled conditions, the organism will do whatever it damn well pleases\"). Propelled by these experiences, we shifted into a style of operations in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design. This proved far more effective. Instead of trying to push the community in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise rather like herding mice, we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it. We became facilitators as much as we were designers and implementors. This often meant adding new features and new regions to the system at a frantic pace, but almost all of what we added was used and appreciated, since it was well matched to people's needs and desires. We, as the experts on how the system worked, could often suggest new activities for people to try or ways of doing things that people might not have thought of. In this way we were able to have considerable influence on the system's development in spite of the fact that we didn't really hold the steering wheel -- more influence, in fact, than we had had when we were operating under the illusion that we controlled everything. Indeed, the challenges posed by large systems are prompting some researchers to question the centralized, planning dominated attitude that we have criticized here, and to propose alternative approaches based on evolutionary and market principles [16-18]. These principles appear applicable to complex systems of all types, not merely those involving interacting human beings. The Great Debate Among the objects we made available to Avatars in Habitat were guns and various other sorts of weapons. We included these because we felt that players should be able to materially effect each other in ways that went beyond simply talking, ways that required real moral choices to be made by the participants. We recognized the age old story-teller's dictum that conflict is the essence of drama. Death in Habitat was, of course, not like death in the real world! When an Avatar is killed, he or she is teleported back home, head in hands (literally), pockets empty, and any object in hand at the time dropped on the ground at the scene of the crime. Any possessions carried at the time are lost. It was more like a setback in a game of \"Chutes and Ladders\" than real mortality. Nevertheless, the death metaphor had a profound effect on people's perceptions. This potential for murder, assault and other mayhem in Habitat was, to put it mildly, controversial. The controversy was further fueled by the potential for lesser crimes. For instance, one Avatar could steal something from another Avatar simply by snatching the object out its owner's hands and running off with it. We had imposed very few rules on the world at the start. There was much debate among the players as to the form that Habitat society should take. At the core of much of the debate was an unresolved philosophical question: is an Avatar an extension of a human being (thus entitled to be treated as you would treat a real person) or a Pac-Man-like critter destined to die a thousand deaths or something else entirely? Is Habitat murder a crime? Should all weapons be banned? Or is it all \"just a game\"? To make a point, one of the players took to randomly shooting people as they roamed around. The debate was sufficiently vigorous that we took a systematic poll of the players. The result was ambiguous: 50% said that Habitat murder was a crime and shouldn't be a part of the world, while the other 50% said it was an important part of the fun. We compromised by changing the system to allow thievery and gunplay only outside the city limits. The wilderness would be wild and dangerous while civilization would be orderly and safe. This did not resolve the debate, however. One of the outstanding proponents of the anti-violence point of view was motivated to open the first Habitat church, the Order of the Holy Walnut (in real life he was a Greek Orthodox priest). His canons forbid his disciples to carry weapons, steal, or participate in violence of any kind. His church became quite popular and he became a very highly respected member of the Habitat community. Furthermore, while we had made direct theft impossible, one could still engage in indirect theft by stealing things set on the ground momentarily or otherwise left unattended. And the violence still possible in the outlands continued to bother some players. Many people thought that such crimes ought to be prevented or at least punished somehow, but they had no idea how to do so. They were used to a world in which law and justice were always things provided by somebody else. Somebody eventually made the suggestion that there ought to be a Sheriff. We quickly figured out how to create a voting mechanism and rounded up some volunteers to hold an election. A public debate in the town meeting hall was heavily attended, with the three Avatars who had chosen to run making statements and fielding questions. The election was held, and the town of Populopolis acquired a Sheriff. For weeks the Sheriff was nothing but a figurehead, though he was a respected figure and commanded a certain amount of moral authority. We were stumped about what powers to give him. Should he have the right to shoot anyone anywhere? Give him a more powerful gun? A magic wand to zap people off to jail? What about courts? Laws? Lawyers? Again we surveyed the players, eventually settling on a set of questions that could be answered via a referendum. Unfortunately, we were unable to act on the results before the pilot operations ended and the system was shut down. It was clear, however, that there are two basic camps: anarchy and government. This is an issue that will need to be addressed by future cyberspace architects. However, our view is that a virtual world need not be set up with a \"default\" government, but can instead evolve one as needed. A Warning Given the above exhortation that control should be released to the users, we need to inject a note of caution and present our next assertion: You can't trust anyone. This may seem like a contradiction of much of the preceding, but it really is not. Designers and operators of a cyberspace system must inhabit two levels of virtual world at once. The first we call the \"infrastructure level\", which is the implementation, where the laws that govern \"reality\" have their genesis. The second we call the \"percipient level\", which is what the users see and experience. It is important that there not be \"leakage\" between these two levels. The first level defines the physics of the world. If its integrity is breached, the consequences can range from aesthetic unpleasantness (the audience catches a glimpse of the scaffolding behind the false front) to psychological disruption (somebody does something \"impossible\", thereby violating users' expectations and damaging their fantasy) to catastrophic failure (somebody crashes the system). When we exhort you to give control to the users, we mean control at the percipient level. When we say that you can't trust anyone, we mean that you can't trust them with access to the infrastructure level. Some stories from Habitat will illustrate this. When designing piece of software, you generally assume that it is the sole intermediary between the user and the underlying data being manipulated (possibly multiple applications will work with the same data, but the principle remains the same). In general, the user need not be aware of how data are encoded and structured inside the application. Indeed, the very purpose of a good application is to shield the user from the ugly technical details. It is conceivable that a technically astute person who is willing to invest the time and effort could decipher the internal structure of things, but this would be an unusual thing to do as there is rarely much advantage to be gained. The purpose of the application itself is, after all, to make access to and manipulation of the data easier than digging around at the level of bits and bytes. There are exceptions to this, however. For example, most game programs deliberately impose obstacles on their players in order for play to be challenging. By tinkering around with the insides of such a program -- dumping the data files and studying them, disassembling the program itself and possibly modifying it -- it may be possible to \"cheat\". However, this sort of cheating has the flavor of cheating at solitaire: the consequences adhere to the cheater alone. There is a difference, in that disassembling a game program is a puzzle-solving exercise in its own right, whereas cheating at solitaire is pointless, but the satisfactions to be gained from it, if any, are entirely personal. If, however, a computer game involves multiple players, delving into the program's internals can enable one to truly cheat, in the sense that one gains an unfair advantage over the other players of which they may be unaware. Habitat is such a multi-player game. When we were designing the software, our \"prime directive\" was, \"The backend shall not assume the validity of anything a player computer tells it.\" This is because we needed to protect ourselves against the possibility that a clever user had hacked around with his copy of the frontend program to add \"custom features\". For example, we could not implement any of the sort of \"skill and action\" elements found in traditional video games wherein dexterity with the joystick determines the outcome of, say, armed combat, because you couldn't guard against someone modifying their copy of the program to tell the backend that they had \"hit\", whether they actually had or not. Indeed, our partners at QuantumLink warned us of this very eventuality before we even started -- they already had users who did this sort of thing with their regular system. Would anyone actually go to the trouble of disassembling and studying 100K or so of incredibly tight and bizarrely threaded 6502 machine code just to tinker? As it turns out, the answer is yes. People have. We were not 100% rigorous in following our own rule. It turned out that there were a few features whose implementation was greatly eased by breaking the rule in situations where, in our judgment, the consequences would not be material if people \"cheated\" by hacking their own systems. Darned if people didn't hack their systems to cheat in exactly these ways. Care must be taken in the design of the world as well. One incident that occurred during our pilot test involved a small group of players exploiting a bug in our world database which they interpreted as a feature. First, some background. Avatars are hatched with 2000 Tokens in their bank account, and each day that they login the receive another 100T. Avatars may acquire additional funds by engaging in business, winning contests, finding buried treasure, and so on. They can spend their Tokens on, among other things, various items that are for sale in vending machines called Vendroids. There are also Pawn Machines, which will buy objects back (at a discount, of course). In order to make this automated economy a little more interesting, each Vendroid had its own prices for the items in it. This was so that we could have local price variation (i.e., a widget would cost a little less if you bought it at Jack's Place instead of The Emporium). It turned out that in two Vendroids across town from each other were two items for sale whose prices we had inadvertently set lower than what a Pawn Machine would buy them back for: Dolls (for sale at 75T, hock for 100T) and Crystal Balls (for sale at 18,000T, hock at 30,000T!). Naturally, a couple of people discovered this. One night they took all their money, walked to the Doll Vendroid, bought as many Dolls as they could, then took them across town and pawned them. By shuttling back and forth between the Doll Vendroid and the Pawn Shop for hours, they amassed sufficient funds to buy a Crystal Ball , whereupon they continued the process with Crystal Balls and a couple orders of magnitude higher cash flow. The final result was at least three Avatars with hundreds of thousands of Tokens each. We only discovered this the next morning when our daily database status report said that the money supply had quintupled overnight. We assumed that the precipitous increase in \"T1\" was due to some sort of bug in the software. We were puzzled that no bug report had been submitted. By poking around a bit we discovered that a few people had suddenly acquired enormous bank balances. We sent Habitat mail to the two richest, inquiring as to where they had gotten all that money overnight. Their reply was, \"We got it fair and square! And we're not going to tell you how!\" After much abject pleading on our part they eventually did tell us, and we fixed the erroneous pricing. Fortunately, the whole scam turned out well, as the nouveau riche Avatars used their bulging bankrolls to underwrite a series of treasure hunt games which they conducted on their own initiative, much to the enjoyment of many other players on the system. Keeping \"Reality\" Consistent The urge to breach the boundary between the infrastructure level and the percipient level is not confined to the players. The system operators are also subject to this temptation, though their motivation is expediency in accomplishing their legitimate purposes rather than the gaining of illegitimate advantage. However, to the degree to which it is possible, we vigorously endorse the following principle: Work within the system. Wherever possible, things that can be done within the framework of the percipient level should be. The result will be smoother operation and greater harmony among the user community. This admonition applies to both the technical and the sociological aspects of the system. For example, with the players in control, the Habitat world would have grown much larger and more diverse than it did had we ourselves not been a technical bottleneck. All new region generation and feature implementation had to go through us, since there was no means for players to create new parts of the world on their own. Region creation was an esoteric technical specialty, requiring a plethora of obscure tools and a good working knowledge of the treacherous minefield of limitations imposed by the Commodore 64. It also required a lot of behind-the-scenes activity that would probably spoil the illusion for many. One of the goals of a next generation Habitat-like system ought to be to permit far greater creative involvement by the participants without requiring them to ascend to full-fledged guru-hood to do so. A further example of working within the system, this time in a social sense, is illustrated by the following experience. One of the more popular events in Habitat took place late in the test, the brainchild of one of the more active players who had recently become a QuantumLink employee. It was called the \"Dungeon of Death\". For weeks, ads appeared in Habitat's newspaper, The Rant, announcing that that Duo of Dread, DEATH and THE SHADOW, were challenging all comers to enter their lair. Soon, on the outskirts of town, the entrance to a dungeon appeared. Out front was a sign reading, \"Danger! Enter at your own risk!\" Two system operators were logged in as DEATH and THE SHADOW, armed with specially concocted guns that could kill in one shot, rather than the usual 12. These two characters roamed the dungeon blasting away at anyone they encountered. They were also equipped with special magic wands that cured any damage done to them by other Avatars, so that they wouldn't themselves be killed. To make things worse, the place was littered with dead ends, pathological connections between regions, and various other nasty and usually fatal features. It was clear that any explorer had better be prepared to \"die\" several times before mastering the dungeon. The rewards were pretty good: 1000 Tokens minimum and access to a special Vendroid that sold magic teleportation wands. Furthermore, given clear notice, players took the precaution of emptying their pockets before entering, so that the actual cost of getting \"killed\" was minimal. One evening, one of us was given the chance to play the role of DEATH. When we logged in, we found him in one of the dead ends with four other Avatars who were trapped there. We started shooting, as did they. However, the last operator to run DEATH had not bothered to use his special wand to heal any accumulated damage, so the character of DEATH was suddenly and unexpectedly \"killed\" in the encounter. As we mentioned earlier, when an Avatar is killed, any object in his hands is dropped on the ground. In this case, said object was the special kill-in-one-shot gun, which was immediately picked up by one of the regular players who then made off with it. This gun was not something that regular players were supposed to have. What should we do? It turned out that this was not the first time this had happened. During the previous night's mayhem the special gun was similarly absconded with. In this case, the person playing DEATH was one of the regular system operators, who, used to operating the regular Q-Link service, simply ordered the player to give the gun back. The player considered that he had obtained the weapon as part of the normal course of the game and balked at this, whereupon the operator threatened to cancel the player's account and kick him off the system if he did not comply. The player gave the gun back, but was quite upset about the whole affair, as were many of his friends and associates on the system. Their world model had been painfully violated. When it happened to us, we played the whole incident within the role of DEATH. We sent a message to the Avatar who had the gun, threatening to come and kill her if she didn't give it back. She replied that all she had to do was stay in town and DEATH couldn't touch her (which was true, if we stayed within the system). OK, we figured, she's smart. We negotiated a deal whereby DEATH would ransom the gun for 10,000 Tokens. An elaborate arrangement was made to meet in the center of town to make the exchange, with a neutral third Avatar acting as an intermediary to ensure that neither party cheated. Of course, word got around and by the time of the exchange there were numerous spectators. We played the role of DEATH to the hilt, with lots of hokey melodramatic shtick. The event was a sensation. It was written up in the newspaper the next morning and was the talk of the town for days. The Avatar involved was left with a wonderful story about having cheated DEATH, we got the gun back, and everybody went away happy. These two very different responses to an ordinary operational problem illustrate our point. Operating within the participants' world model produced a very satisfactory result. On the other hand, what seemed like the expedient course, which involved violating this model, provoked upset and dismay. Working within the system was clearly the preferred course in this case. Current Status As of this writing, the North American incarnation of Lucasfilm's Habitat, QuantumLink's \"Club Caribe\", has been operating for almost two years. It uses our original Commodore 64 frontend and a somewhat stripped-down version of our original Stratus backend software. Club Caribe now sustains a population of some 15,000 participants. A technically more advanced version, called Fujitsu Habitat, has recently started pilot operations in Japan, available on NIFtyServe. The initial frontend for this version is the new Fujitsu FM Towns personal computer, though ports to several other popular Japanese machines are anticipated. This version of the system benefits from the additional computational power and graphics capabilities of a newer platform, as well as the Towns' built-in CD-ROM for object imagery and sounds. However, the virtuality of the system is essentially unchanged and Fujitsu has not made significant alterations to the user interface or to any of the underlying concepts. Future Directions There are several directions in which this work can be extended. Most obvious is to implement the system on more advanced hardware, enabling a more sophisticated display. A number of extensions to the user interface also suggest themselves. However, the line of development most interesting to us is to expand on the idea of making the development and expansion of the world itself part of the users' sphere of control. There are two major research areas in this. Unfortunately, we can only touch on them briefly here. The first area to investigate involves the elimination of the centralized backend. The backend is a communications and processing bottleneck that will not withstand growth above too large a size. While we can support tens of thousands of users with this model, it is not really feasible to support millions. Making the system fully distributed, however, requires solving a number of difficult problems. The most significant of these is the prevention of cheating. Obviously, the owner of the network node that implements some part of the world has an incentive to tilt things in his favor there. We think that this problem can be addressed by secure operating system technologies based on public-key cryptographic techniques [19, 20]. The second fertile area of investigation involves user configuration of the world itself. This requires finding ways to represent the design and creation of regions and objects as part of the underlying fantasy. Doing this will require changes to our conception of the world. In particular, we don't think it will be possible to conceal all of the underpinnings to those who work with them. However, all we really need to do is find abstractions for those underpinnings that fit into the fantasy itself. Though challenging, this is, in our opinion, eminently feasible. Conclusions We feel that the defining characteristic of cyberspace is the shared virtual environment, not the display technology used to transport users into that environment. Such a cyberspace is feasible today, if you can live without head-mounted displays and other expensive graphics hardware. Habitat serves as an existence proof of this contention. It seems clear to us that an object-oriented world model is a key ingredient in any cyberspace implementation. We feel we have gained some insight into the data representation and communications needs of such a system. While we think that it may be premature to start establishing detailed technical standards for these things, it is time to begin the discussions that will lead to such standards in the future. Finally, we have come to believe that the most significant challenge for cyberspace developers is to come to grips with the problems of world creation and management. While we have only made the first inroads onto these problems, a few things have become clear. The most important of these is that managing a cyberspace world is not like managing the world inside a single-user application or even a conventional online service. Instead, it is more like governing an actual nation. Cyberspace architects will benefit from study of the principles of sociology and economics as much as from the principles of computer science. We advocate an agoric, evolutionary approach to world building rather than a centralized, socialistic one. We would like to conclude with a final admonition, one that we hope will not be seen as overly contentious: Get real. In a discussion of cyberspace on Usenet, one worker in the field dismissed Club Caribe (Habitat's current incarnation) as uninteresting, with a comment to the effect that most of the activity consisted of inane and trivial conversation. Indeed, the observation was largely correct. However, we hope some of the anecdotes recounted above will give some indication that more is going on than those inane and trivial conversations might indicate. Further, to dismiss the system on this basis is to dismiss the users themselves. They are paying money for this service. They don't view what they do as inane and trivial, or they wouldn't do it. To insist this presumes that one knows better than they what they should be doing. Such presumption is another manifestation of the omniscient central planner who dictates all that happens, a role that this entire article is trying to deflect you from seeking. In a real system that is going to be used by real people, it is a mistake to assume that the users will all undertake the sorts of noble and sublime activities which you created the system to enable. Most of them will not. Cyberspace may indeed change humanity, but only if it begins with humanity as it really is.

The writers basically kept changing his fundamental character traits every episode. Lee&#x27;s a great actor and did the best anyone realistically could with the material, but it was a complete mess in terms of the writers introducing constant character whiplash. And then the way Cameron (Mackenzie Davis) was written as a romantic arc with him, I&#x27;m not sure anybody could have cared less if they wound up together or not, or never talked again the rest of their lives.I&#x27;ve heard the fourth season is spectacular, and I&#x27;d like to get back to it someday, but the first season really wasn&#x27;t strong enough to keep a lot of viewers, including myself. reply hnlmorg 11 hours agorootparentprev> You felt let down by what is generally considered one of the best written shows of the 2010s?By “generally” I’m guessing you just mean yourself?I thought the writing was pretty weak. They kept falling back on silly tropes to force some drama into the show rather than letting the subject matter itself be the drama. It very much felt like they “jumped the shark” right from the very first episode.Very few of those characters were believable, let alone likeable.I do agree season 4 is better, but and the reason why is because the dialled it back on the writing and focused a lot more on the characters. Which is what they should have done from the start.The writing for me felt a lot more like they didn’t have confidence that the subject matter is interesting enough on its own. Which is a sign of bad writing, not good writing.That all said, there were some good moments. But on the whole it just wasn’t great. However there isn’t many shows based around this subject so I guess some geeks try to convince themselves that the show was better than it actually was.

I hated Silicon Valley, too; I think it&#x27;s a lack of distance from the topic which makes me overthink the thing rather than just having fun with the story.But with HACF I didn&#x27;t just dislike the topic, I thought the acting was corny and stiff and I thought that the characters were unmotivated throughout the thing, with motivation being replaced with pseudo-historical anecdote. I thought the actors were poorly cast, and I feel like they did a bad job &#x27;convincing&#x27; me of anything.\"Of course they&#x27;re doing the thing, that&#x27;s who Z is!\" isn&#x27;t compelling enough for me to enjoy it and suspend my real personality from interjecting criticism during the watch.But who cares what I think : i&#x27;ve been out of lock-step with the crowd for a few years w.r.t. media consumption.

Real-time action multiplayer.And they should NEVER have cutscenes.They also can&#x27;t have music (except live) because 3D sound is paramount.And they should be open-source or source-available so we can improve and modify them.Habitat said all that and I think the article didn&#x27;t but... you know... down votes without comment incoming! reply epolanski 11 hours agoparent [–] That&#x27;s your personal take.I too believe gaming should be more about humans interacting, but there&#x27;s millions of people out there that disagree and value the story of games. reply bullen 11 hours agorootparent [–] People expect comments to not be a personal take?Linear things destroy your mind, because you become a passive consumer.Producing is the only meaningful purpose in existence, but not for someone else, for yourself.Now it&#x27;s too late, people are used to sitting on their ass and be entertained and pay for that by \"working\" for an \"owner\".

These services are developed, deployed, and operated by hundreds of individual teams working independently across the globe. The services vary in size, shape, and functionality; some are small and used for internal operations, and some are large and used for massive, real-time computation. While all these services are different, they share common characteristics, and there are many aspects that could be consolidated for simplicity. The aspects we focused on were deployments, capacity management, compliance, and day-to-day operations. This article will cover how we consolidated and streamlined our underlying configuration and rollout mechanisms, including some of the interesting challenges we solved along the way, and the efficiencies we achieved by doing so. History of Stateless Services at Uber In 2014, Uber was a monolithic application that was written in Python® and stored data in a single PostgreSQL® database. As the system grew, and the company started to hire more engineers, eventually Uber transitioned to a microservice architecture. Still there was a lot of variance in how people deploy code, from random bash scripts to a set of dedicated Jenkins jobs. As the number of services started to grow into the hundreds, Uber built µDeploy to centrally deploy code at scale. With µDeploy, we containerized all stateless services and abstracted away host management and placement so the infrastructure group could manage the host fleet independently of the business level microservices. Service management and placement was, however, still highly manual. Regions and Zones Uber’s infrastructure follows a model where a group of zones form a region. Latencies between zones in a region are low enough that synchronous communication is efficient between the services within the same region. Zones may either be clusters of machines owned by Uber or it may be capacity from a public cloud provider but a specific zone would always only be backed by a single provider. Generally, any microservice should be able to call any other service without latency issues as long as they are located within the same region. With µDeploy, engineers were still required to manage physical placement at the level of availability zones, meaning that the geographical placement of workloads was not centralized in the system. This meant that service engineers would still have to decide not only whether to run their services in an on-prem zone, but also in which specific zone it would run. Decision to Move to Cloud Operating our on-prem data centers, we experienced long lead times due to chip shortages and supply chain issues. On February 13, 2023 Uber partnered with Oracle and Google, aiming to diversify and decrease the company’s exposure to supply chain issues. Executing on this strategy would be impossible without having a system in place to abstract away the underlying infrastructure from thousands of Uber engineers working on hundreds of various services powering the business. Making Uber Ready for Cloud Migration It was clear from the beginning that migrating 4,500 stateless services to the cloud while keeping the business running would require an enormous amount of coordination and effort, and that the work would be both highly error prone and nearly impossible to manage through manual, orchestrated efforts. To make maintenance and management of stateless microservices work at scale, we needed to transform our services to make them automatically manageable by our centralized deployment system without human involvement. Beyond Stateless: Portability Building on our model for zones and regions, we came up with the concept of portability. A portable service is one that can run in any zone within a region and can be moved to a new zone automatically by the infrastructure platform without any human involvement. This includes movement across public cloud providers, as well as in or out of our in-prem zones. Our services did not generally have this property, as some of them depended on zone-specific configuration as well as affinity of zone-specific resources. It became clear that we needed this property to hold for all services in order to do an automated migration to the cloud. Making Uber Portable Over the course of 2021 and 2022, we ran a program across all of engineering to ensure that all services were portable. In many cases, violation of portability was possible to detect through code inspection, simply by looking at the use of string consts and file names in the code. For these simple cases, we built linter rules to highlight code that appeared hardcoded to run in specific physical locations. To really test that the services were indeed portable, we had to actually move them around between zones without human involvement. We built a suite of test tools that would let the owner of the service initiate the first movement of the service. This tooling was based on the existing tooling for safe and incremental code rollout, meaning that the owner of the service could always revert placement back to the original zone to address any problems that were detected. Once a movement had been done successfully, the service was marked for automatic movement going forward. Over the following couple of years, we went through this process for every single service at Uber and eventually reached full completion of all services. With this work done, we could start making changes to the zone topology without any involvement from service engineers. To ensure that services remain portable over time, we regularly exercise their ability to move by continuously migrating all services between zones every few weeks. This makes it easy to discover regressions in services, and over time engineers have gotten used to not assuming any specific zone placement for their service. Up: Multi-Cloud Multi-Tenant Federation Control Plane Based on what we had determined as the most time consuming and error prone service operations, we set the following initial goals for the system: Present a single point of entry for engineers to interact with infrastructure systems Manage and enforce best practices for services deployed directly in the system to give a high degree of safety during code rollout Automate placement of services into availability zones; this included changing placement to new zones as new availability zones became available so that the placement is centrally coordinated to support high availability for Uber in general Automate cumbersome infrastructure level migrations so service engineers don’t have to get involved in them High-Level Architecture Up is structured into three architectural layers that each have their own responsibilities. The Experience Layer at the top implements the various ways that our engineers interact with the system. This includes both a UI for direct control, a Continuous Delivery experience for automating day-to-day deployments, as well as robots that keep the system in a good state. This also includes the Balancer that continuously causes workloads to be moved to clusters and zones that are less utilized as well as our Auto Scaler that continuously optimizes capacity allocation for each workload. The Platform Layer implements the abstractions that are used by the experience layer to interact with the services. This includes the service and service environment abstractions that form the conceptual model for operating services as well as the service level API itself. At the Platform layer, services constraints are represented as high level goalstates that describe the desired properties of the actual service placement. This could be constraints for the capabilities of the machines to run on as well as overall compute capacity for the service per region. The Federation Layer implements the integration to the compute clusters. This layer organizes all clusters according to their capabilities and physical placement to implement the region and zone abstractions used by the upper layers. This layer takes the high level service goalstate from the Platform and translates it into zone and cluster placement. This translation is based both on the constraints from the goalstate as well as the actual state of the clusters, including where capacity is currently available and in which clusters and auxiliary constraints can be met. This result of the translation may change over time and a different zone and cluster placement may be more desirable later. Any call from the Balancer as well as any other operation initiated by the experience layer may lead to this placement being recomputed and changed. To ensure that the system remains safe and that services remain in good condition, the Change Management component implements a rollout flow that changes the global state gradually, in small increments with integrations to all systems that monitor service health. This rollout process includes going through canarying and monitoring health signals from across the whole system. Any observed issue results in the system quickly reverting the service to the configuration and placement that it had prior to starting the change. Finally, the Regions contain the actual cluster instances, including Peloton and Kubernetes® clusters. These are external to Up itself, but are the targets of the actual capacity placement and manage placement of containers on physical hosts. Impact We started working on Up in 2018, delivered a working prototype in early 2019, and made the platform generally available in mid-2020. Since then we’ve migrated more than 4,000 services across all of Uber’s lines of business from the old deployment platform to Up. A large bulk of this migration was automated, freeing the team to focus on the most advanced use cases, and helping other teams with the migration. The stability of the platform during this period was the utmost priority making sure we keep the business running under a substantial load with millions of people using Uber systems every day. The full migration took us a good two years, moving about 2,000,000 compute cores to the new platform, and was successfully accomplished in 2022. With this migration we accomplished substantial monetary savings with autoscaling and efficiency efforts, returning tens of millions of dollars of extra capacity to the business, and tens of thousands of engineering hours previously spent on manual service updates, setting and filling up new zones, and learning to navigate Uber’s complex Infrastructure landscape. What’s Next After finishing the migration from µDeploy to Up, the team can now focus on building out solutions that could be applied to the entire fleet of services in a centralized and automated manner, and a user experience around those features. Cloud Migration Uber is moving a substantial proportion of its fleet to the cloud. With large scale automation, and an abstraction layer provided by Up, the service teams are largely distanced from the infrastructure detail of this transition. Automated Continuous Delivery We aim to fully automate code delivery all the way to production using automated pipelines, running various checks and tests before code hits production. A particular aspect the team plans to focus on in 2023 is to keep the services “fresh”, ensuring that all code running in production is up to date with the latest security and library updates. Deployment Safety Existing data shows that quite a substantial number of incidents we observe are related to code and configuration changes. We aim to substantially decrease the rate of defects that actually make it all the way to production by automating previously manual aspects of the service lifecycle, such as running pre-production tests or setting up incremental rollout policies. Platform Organizing all of Uber’s stateless service fleet under one umbrella platform allows us to more explicitly model dependencies and interactions between Infrastructure Platform offerings. This helps to provide both a uniform model in the code, and also a fully-integrated user experience for the rest of our Engineering organization. Being able to observe and operate all of your infrastructure in one place is the next big goal for the team. Conclusion The effort to build the Up platform represented a substantial cultural shift when all stateless services were now being incrementally deployed using the same set of best practices and automation. Making changes to rollout policies or building out more automation for large-scale library rollouts is now possible in a centralized way, which previously required months of work. We’re looking forward to continued collaboration with Up’s stakeholders and the service owners to ensure we achieve our vision: letting Uber engineers focus on code, instead of worrying about infrastructure.

Firstly, they allowed services to be moved back to the original zone to resolve any portability issues, but once resolved, services would be moved periodically to validate portability and prevent regressions.This is something that most companies don’t do when they say they want to do $x to “prevent lock in”.Uber actually is testing for portability along the way. reply dehrmann 12 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s probably more cost effective to negotiate a long-term max price with your cloud provider with a force majeure clause. reply scarface_74 11 hours agorootparentUnless you’re crazy enough to work with GCP, the “my cloud provider is going to lock me in and then raise prices” doesn’t happen. AWS has only raised prices in a few very obscure cases ever.One of which is putting a price on HEAD requests in S3 (?).AWS already gives long term price discounts&#x2F;guaranteed prices for reserve pricing and Big customers already have negotiated contracts. reply Narkov 11 hours agorootparentPrice increases are just one way you can get screwed. You can also lose out when your provider doesn&#x27;t drop prices or pick up operating efficiencies that other providers have. reply scarface_74 10 hours agorootparentAnd when has that happened with respect to either GCP, AWS or Azure at a level that it’s worth migrating?Even if you have done everything in a “cloud agnostic” way, “infrastructure has weight”. Any large migration isn’t just technical , it involves project management, organization training, regression testing, compliance testing, security testing, architecture review boards, vendor negotiations, firewall changes, coordination with third parties who may only allow list certain IP addresses, data migration, etc.Heck they often have multiple physical network connections to the cloud provider (Direct Connect)Anyone who thinks they can run everything on K8s and they have “cloud agnosticism” has never done a very large scale migration.You would be amazed how long it takes to do a bog standard lift and shift of a hundreds of plain jane VMs and VM hosted databases. You can’t get anymore cloud agnostic than that.source: I’ve done a few over the years in both the “real world” and working in the cloud consulting department at AWS (Professional Services). I no longer work at AWS and have no specific loyalty to AWS. reply dehrmann 10 hours agorootparentThe other thing I&#x27;d add is cloud agnosticism doesn&#x27;t scale. If everyone were prepared for it, there wouldn&#x27;t be enough elastic capacity with other cloud providers. You&#x27;d need enough reserved capacity in another cloud to pull it off, but I guarantee you finance will say \"no.\" What makes the most sense is multi-region work since it&#x27;s more cost effective, and it&#x27;s the more likely failure scenario. reply scarface_74 9 hours agorootparentThere usually isn’t enough elasticism if a region fails. You really even then need to have reserved capacity and maybe even a hot standby or active-active. reply charcircuit 9 hours agorootparentprev>And when has that happened with respect to either GCP, AWS or Azure at a level that it’s worth migrating?Egress price makes it worth migrating away from those three. reply scarface_74 9 hours agorootparentYou’ve never been the one neck to choke when things go wrong have you? If Billy Bob’s cloud provider goes down, you are going to constantly be blamed for making a poor decision. If anything goes wrong they are going to question your decision.If you choose AWS (or Azure) and a region goes down - everyone else is down too. “No one ever got fired for choosing IBM”.Choosing the most popular vendor - AWS, Salesforce, ServiceNow, or whatever vendor is in the upper right Gartner magic square quadrant never gets questioned by the powers that be. reply charcircuit 8 hours agorootparentEven if the alternate cloud provider goes offline for an entire day it still would be worth it financially compared to AWS because egress is so expensive there. reply scarface_74 8 hours agorootparentAnd you ignored the entire reply didn’t you? It’s naive to think at the “one neck to choke level” that all decisions are made for purely technical reasons.And for you to just say “it’s okay to be down an entire day” because of egress cost tells me that you have never done infrastructure requirements analysis at scale.First you have to assess the cost of being down for a period of time, then you have to access RTO, RPO requirements and not all workloads have high egress costs - especially things like data lakes that may have a lot of ingress and processing costs, but relatively low egress costs.I’ve done a lot of different cloud projects over the years from lift and shifts, to data lakes, to cloud call centers, to serverless, to ETL jobs, you can’t just blindly repeat “egress costs” in a vacuum without understanding use cases. reply charcircuit 7 hours agorootparentI never claimed that it is always worth it to switch because of egress costs, but that egress costs are a reason to switch. If I ran my sites on AWS it would 100x the cost of running it. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentThese were your words> Egress price makes it worth migrating away from those three.> Even if the alternate cloud provider goes offline for an entire day it still would be worth it financially compared to AWS because egress is so expensive there.You never qualified either with “in my particular use case”. If you had, I would have had no argument. I haven’t been flown into your company along with SAs, sales, project managers, etc for a week to do a proper “as-is” assessment and to see what your requirements are.I haven’t accessed the competencies of your staff or determined what is your competitive advantage and what is the “undifferentiated heavy lifting” in your company.I would never make any blanket statements without knowing your specific use case and automatically assume “cloud” is always the right or wrong answer reply charcircuit 7 hours agorootparent>And when has that happened with respect to either GCP, AWS or Azure at a level that it’s worth migrating?This suggests you are looking for a single example where the pricing of the big 3 is compratively high compared to the competition at a point where it worth it to switch. I gave the example that the price of egress is one cost which is not competitive. If I had instead said that SQS was not competitive obviously that wouldn&#x27;t matter to businesses that don&#x27;t use it enough to make a difference. reply scarface_74 6 hours agorootparentI’m looking at it from more than just “cost of infrastructure”. You also have to consider reliability, managed vs unmanaged, the competencies and expertise of your team, organizational constraints whether you have a more or less static or dynamic workload…Microsoft and AWS have versions of the “Cloud Adoption Framework”https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learn.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;azure&#x2F;cloud-adoption-frame...https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aws.amazon.com&#x2F;cloud-adoption-framework&#x2F;And the TOGAF framework has something similarhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubs.opengroup.org&#x2F;architecture&#x2F;togaf9-doc&#x2F;arch&#x2F;chap...I am saying when considering any “large” implementation there are a lot of considerations outside of infrastructure bills.I’m not saying that every company should go cloud. But the “lenses” you have to look through are multifaceted replyleesalminen 6 hours agorootparentprevI’ve been in places where total AWS spend was a rounding error compared to revenue. Egress fees weren’t a top 10 cost and wasn’t worth optimizing for.The bosses would’ve blamed me for choosing a tier 2&#x2F;3 noname provider the first time a day of downtime happens. And they would’ve been right. reply insanitybit 6 hours agorootparentprevEgress prices make migrating away hard. But a lot of products don&#x27;t need to push much data out of AWS, especially with VPC peering based products. reply scarface_74 5 hours agorootparentAnd for things like transferring data to and from S3 within AWS you use an S3 gateway endpoint so data stays within AWS’s network reply intelVISA 9 hours agorootparentprevWhilst there are some nice toys e.g. Spanner, there&#x27;s generally little other reason to tolerate the abusive pricing of &#x27;the cloud&#x27; ime reply dehrmann 10 hours agorootparentprevThat&#x27;s a long-term concern, though.

What were the requirements to each team? What was the timeline? How did they know it was completed? How was it prioritized along other business priorities of the teams?

Are they splitting data across clouds, and constantly \"porting\" that data from cloud to cloud as part of their portability?Orchestrating the application layer across clouds is interesting, but how does their data layer work? reply fbnbr 6 hours agoprevThe title is misleading. I don’t see Mesos mentioned ones in the article.I got so excited about reading for Mesos helping in the multi cloud world, potentially as the hypervisor for running k8s reply jbotdev 19 hours agoprevIt seems like they’ve gotten to the “holy grail” of deployment where developers don’t have to worry about infrastructure at all in theory.I’ve seen many teams go for simple&#x2F;leaky abstractions on top Kubernetes to provide a similar solution, which is tempting because it’s easy and flexible. The problem is then all your devs need to be trained in all the complexities of Kubernetes deployments anyway. Hopefully Uber abstracted away Kubernetes and Mesos enough to be worthwhile, and they have a great infra team to support the devs. reply zeroCalories 19 hours agoparentIt&#x27;s not clear to me that being completely unaware of your infrastructure is a good thing. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much trouble to ask an engineer to understand k8s and think about where their service will live, even if it&#x27;s a ci system that actually deploys. Furthermore, many layers of abstraction, especially in-house abstraction, just mean you have more code to maintain, another system for people to learn, and existing knowledge that you can&#x27;t leverage anymore. reply opportune 10 hours agorootparentThere is a wide spectrum of infrastructure (and platforms, frameworks, etc) from “allows applications to do just about anything, though it may be very complex” to “severely constrains applications but greatly simplifies doing things within those constraints.” To be clear by “just about anything” I am not talking about whether some business logic is expressable, but whether you can eg use EBPF and cgroups, use some esoteric network protocol, run a stateful service that pulls from a queue, issue any network call to anything on the Internet, etc.If you are developing applications software like Uber 99.99% of the time you really do not need to be doing anything “fancy” or “exotic” in your service. Your service receives data, does some stuff with it (connects to a db or issues calls to other services), returns data. If you let those 0.01% of the things dictate where your internal platform falls on that spectrum, you will make things much more complicated and difficult for 99.99% of the other stuff. Those are where leaky abstractions and bugs come from, both from the platform trying to be more general than it needs to be and from pushing poorly understand boilerplate tasks (like configuring auth, certifications, TLS manually for each service) to infrastructure users.Being unaware (of course not completely unaware, but essentially not needing to actively consider it while doing things) of infrastructure is actually the ideal state, provided that lack of awareness is because “it just works so well it doesn’t need to be considered”. It means that it lets people get shit done without pushing configuration and leaky abstractions onto them.I’ll give you one example of something that does an excellent job of this: Linux. Application memory in linux requires some very complex work under the hood, but it has decent default configurations with only a couple commonly changed parameters that most applications don’t need much, and it had a very simple API for applications to interface with. Similar with send&#x2F;receive syscalls and the use of files for I&#x2F;O ranging from remote networking to IPC to local disk. These are wonderful APIs and abstractions that simplify very hard problems. The problem with in-house abstraction isn’t that they are trying to do abstractions but that sometimes they just don’t do a good job or churn through them faster than it takes them to stabilize. reply intelVISA 9 hours agorootparentWell put, 99% of companies don&#x27;t need to introduce such complexity for their relatively trivial use cases (though well-intentioned albeit bad engineers will try to invent it anyway). reply jbotdev 19 hours agorootparentprevPart of my point is the goal with such a system is usually to require less infra work&#x2F;knowledge from your devs, but it backfires if you don’t invest enough in your abstraction.The implicit goal of these abstractions is really to central knowledge and best practices around the underlying tech.

With a simple abstraction where teams only define the things they are interested in configuring (eg helm values), that simplifies this task a lot. reply oceanplexian 16 hours agorootparentprevAll it takes is for one microservice to start hanging on a GRPC request, server hardware stops doing some fundamental thing correctly, or some weird network quirk that 10x’s latency to half the switch ports in a rack, and you end up with insane, sophisticated cascade failures.Because engineers don’t have to understand infra, it often spans geographies and failure domains in unanticipated, undetectable ways. In my opinion the only antidote is a thorough understanding of your stack down to the metal it’s running on. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentA single engineer can’t understand everything at scale.Even in a 100 person startup that I worked for where I designed the infrastructure and the best practices and wrote the initial proof of concept code and best practices for about 15 microservices it got to the point where I couldn’t understand everything and had to hire people to separate out the responsibilities.We sold access to micro services to large health care organizations for their websites and mobile app&#x27;s.

And the complexity is nothing compared to having to manage your own cloud resources using Terraform etc which used to be the case.And these days every developer needs to be on board with DevOps and so there are no real old-school infra teams supporting anyone. reply Nextgrid 19 hours agoparentprevThe other \"leak\" in these abstractions that arises from physical limits is performance, especially when it comes to IO.This is a major problem for databases and ultimately makes database \"portability\"&#x2F;fault tolerance tricky since they work best with direct-attach storage that&#x27;s inherently bound to a single physical machine. reply pm90 18 hours agorootparentNot to mention there is all sorts of other limits that you can hit at scale just on the compute layer itself (eg max pids, file descriptors etc).I don’t know if we can truly abstract away the underlying system. The best we can do is give a best effort approximation that works in most cases, but explicitly call out the limits when they are reached.I suspect that this is just the bubbling up of the underlying physics limitation of having limited resources where compute is run. reply x86x87 20 hours agoprevDoes Uber really need 4000 microservices? reply jpalomaki 13 hours agoparentThere&#x27;s an an interesting HN comment[1] from 2020 by former Uber engineer, which discusses the complexity a bit.

And related to this: how do you ever get to upgrade services crosscutting concerns that ideally are not invented in every service? reply oooyay 17 hours agorootparent> how does performance measurement and optimization work in that environment?SRE here. Generally speaking, each API or each service will have a contract that it must adhere to depending on upstream and downstream relationships and their fail safes. Each service (or API) will then load test in isolation.After that, if you want to be really sure about regressions (which would include fail safes) you load test the whole thing put together.> Is the key some sort of meta tooling that understands relationships between microservices?This is quite hard to do when you have a lot of transactions. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s commodity software that does this because you&#x27;d need to configure that software to map on keys, then map those keys to services. Generally, the easiest way is to get engineering teams to declare upstreams and downstreams.> Q2: How do you ensure the stubbed deps behave like the real thing?Generally, generation. Something like protobuf or Open API generation will do.> Q3: how do you handle logging and metrics in an unified way across the stack?You issue high level standards like, \"We&#x27;ll use JSON logging with UTC time formatting\". At the end of the day logging is very contextual and in a service ownership model the service owners are usually the ones reading and alerting on their logs.> And related to this: how do you ever get to upgrade services crosscutting concerns that ideally are not invented in every service?Shared dependencies. I&#x27;m not actually sure what&#x27;s a cross cutting concern; generally services that are this small should be designed to operate mostly independently. They&#x27;re small, but \"microservices\" tend to have a lot of fail safes built in. If you&#x27;re referring to how do we not write 4000 config loaders then there&#x27;s usually a team that builds a very generic config loader and everyone or a majority use it. reply thakoppno 5 hours agorootparent> JSON logging with UTC time formattingperhaps simplest, biggest impact in my log life has been adhering these principles. reply gen220 9 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve worked at a place that architected 100s of microservices pretty well, in a similar way that Uber apparently does.Q1: (perf) these tools exist, the buzzword phrase is \"distributed tracing\". The relationships are actually not explicitly defined for the tooling to work, but rather inferred. Visualize a network call as a call-stack, where each service is a level in the stack. Jaeger (a CNCF project addressing distributed tracing) was coincidentally started by Uber.Q2 (stubs): In my experience, mocked responses get you a long, long way. Typically the API response type that you&#x27;re mocking is generated from a protobuf (or thrift, OpenAPI, etc.) file. If your dependency changes that type in a way that breaks your test, the CI platform will let them know.If it&#x27;s a more subtle change (like, it used to deterministically return 18 and now it deterministically returns 20), it&#x27;s really on the service owners to communicate changes and grep the code base before making the change.Q3 (logging&#x2F;metrics): Typically by using shared \"logging\" and \"metrics\" lib for each language. Every service will typically be a gRPC service and accordingly a standardized + generated-from-protobufs set of metrics to Prometheus, by default.Q4 (how to upgrade common libraries): this is definitely a tricky one. The answer is, basically, really carefully. Typically, you&#x27;ll want your infrastructure to be compatible with vX and vX+1, and give teams a deadline to cut over from logging X to X+1. The couple of weeks before that deadline usually involves a lot of cat-herding and handwringing. reply joshmanders 19 hours agorootparentprevNot OP, but I worked on a large microservices based system at a leading financial institute and when we needed to work on a single service, we had docker compose files that pulled the images needed for the dependency services of that service for us to develop what we needed. They all just ran in our local docker. If we wanted we could have a massive compose file with all services in it, but typically we only needed the iam service and a few other small ones depending on what services we were working on. reply eddtries 18 hours agorootparentprevQ2 - techniques like contract testing help here, beyond simple stubs.

If the services are written using the right paradigms to handle such a situation, they will also be much more resilient to platform disruptions.I like to view k8s a lot like erlang&#x27;s OTP, if something isn&#x27;t right with the state of a service, I advocate calling &#x27;exit()&#x27; and letting the restart with exponential backoff handle the transient. reply cma 19 hours agorootparentprevNobody needs to if they can&#x27;t possibly. reply jameshart 18 hours agorootparentprevIn general in a micro service environment, you try to build things so that 1) you don&#x27;t need to run other things locally, and 2) if you did need to, the services are just containers so it&#x27;s pretty easy to run one.But you tend to try to write your service so that it treats everything else it depends on like a vendor-provided API. Like, if you were building a Slack bot, you wouldn&#x27;t ask Slack to let you pull down and run a local copy of Slack&#x27;s API to test against. You&#x27;d maybe set up a test account in Slack&#x27;s production system, and run your local bot against that to test it before you deploy it with credentials to run against your real slack account.In a microservice architecture, you integrate with other internal systems in the same way. reply magicalhippo 17 hours agorootparentWe&#x27;re not big on microservices, but we do integrate with a lot of other systems.I find the opaqueness of other services to reduce development speed quite drastically. With local code I can view both sides of the fence and easily see if I&#x27;m using it wrong or if it&#x27;s a bug in my colleagues code.Seems that if you&#x27;re constantly developing against opaque services you&#x27;d end up in the same quagmire quite quickly? reply gen220 9 hours agorootparentThis is exactly why the \"microservices\" pattern is usually adopted along with the \"monorepo\" pattern. IMO, it&#x27;s a strong anti-pattern to have the former without the latter. reply scarface_74 12 hours agorootparentprevYou shouldn’t care about anything outside of published contracts for dependencies.

Turned out something in their service crashed when handed national characters, despite accepting JSON and hence UTF-8 input and nothing in the documentation about English letters only. Rather than returning 400 or 500, the service returned 200 with an empty list, leading us to assume we did something wrong. reply scarface_74 11 hours agorootparent> But when things don&#x27;t work as I expect, it&#x27;s far more efficient to be able to view the code on both sides, rather than only on my own side and try to guess what the other side is doing.Are you able to view the source code of your platform vendor? Everyone is at some level dependent on Black box APIs.If you can document where with certain input you don’t get the expected output, you reach out to the team that is responsible for it whether internally or externally and they either explain it or they fix it.This is the API service I’ve been working with over the past five+ years - three actually working at AWS (Professional Services).https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boto3.amazonaws.com&#x2F;v1&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;api&#x2F;latest&#x2F;inde...I found a bug in one relatively new API that a service team released, I reached out to the team with a documented scenario and they fixed it.Other times they explained what I was doing wrong.

If doing the latter, you can create special user accounts and events that change how the networking routing happens. Events from those fake users pass through regular production apps up until the service you’re testing, then they are instead routed to your local version, and you can continue the calls to other prod services.Uber employees’ apps are special and allow us to log in as these fake users and create fake rides or deliveries, and then we can look at the traces and logs to debug and stuff. reply aeyes 15 hours agorootparentprevLooks like they are shifting away from local development: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.uber.com&#x2F;en-CL&#x2F;blog&#x2F;devpod-improving-developer-p... reply fizx 17 hours agorootparentprevSomething like https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tilt.dev&#x2F; where you spin up a subset of the service graph in a cloud environment that hot-reloads based on local edits. reply mitjam 13 hours agorootparentprevMicroservices allow development orgs to scale horizontally which enables businesses to expand to adjacent markets, faster. reply dehrmann 12 hours agorootparentprevStatic function calls are also API contracts. reply threeseed 20 hours agoparentprevUber is a global company (70+ countries) operating Uber and Uber Eats.So almost certainly they are duplicating their entire stack per-country if only to get around the vastly different regulatory environments. reply Isthatablackgsd 17 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m guessing it have to do with payment processors.

Netflix seems to be the poster child for overengineered architecture - for something that is almost entirely commoditised nowadays (one-way over the internet video streaming).Uber&#x27;s problem space is significantly more complex than Netflix, so I&#x27;m unsure it&#x27;s a fair comparison. But they do seem to have quite a lot of overengineering going on. At least that&#x27;s how I feel each time I read an Uber tech article.About the only companies which seem to justify their complex architectures are Google&#x2F;Meta&#x2F;Amazon imo. reply dilyevsky 12 hours agorootparent> Uber&#x27;s problem space is significantly more complex than NetflixWhat makes you say this? Netflix serves probably several orders of magnitude more bytes and online video is hard. At its core Uber is basically a Passenger Service System and we had systems like these implemented in software since 1950s reply isbvhodnvemrwvn 3 hours agorootparentThere are a lot more use cases in taxi and food delivery space than in video streaming. At least by an order of magnitude. Consider various user personas for one, legal considerations and so on.

At least when I need to interface with 12 different things I can have 12 different people to roast for not properly documenting their API. And tbh literally the only positive I can come up with for microservices is the ability to neatly fire one into the sun and rewrite it from scratch. reply scarface_74 7 hours agorootparentIsn’t that basically what happens when you split an API out to the different methods and write a Lambda for each one? reply barbazoo 20 hours agoparentprevMaybe they meant instances. reply 0xDEF 19 hours agoparentprevYes, there are specific business rules for each nation, region&#x2F;state, and city. reply nine_zeros 20 hours agoparentprevHow else would engineers demonstrate \"impact\" for promotions?&#x2F;s reply mooreds 19 hours agorootparentI worked at a SV startup (series A) for a while and an EM once mentioned struggling to keep the number of microservices under the number of engineers. reply aitchnyu 5 hours agorootparentIs there a compelling article about the ideal microservice to engineer ratio (ie less than 1.0)? reply zrail 20 hours agorootparentprevYou jest but also you&#x27;re not wrong. reply nine_zeros 20 hours agorootparentMy own company has 800+ microservices.

Is this ratio normal? reply nine_zeros 18 hours agorootparentAny more than 1 microservice per engineer (as in, 7 microservices for a 7 engineer team) is too much for engineers to handle during on-call incidents.If management values business SLAs that is. reply wiseowise 13 hours agorootparentprevDysfunctional organizations lead to absurd solutions to absurd problems. reply deathanatos 13 hours agoparentprevThere&#x27;s no way that number isn&#x27;t fiction; Occam&#x27;s razor say&#x27;s its out of the range of believable. That&#x27;s ~2 per eng according to Google. That&#x27;s absurd. (That eng headcount is also a bit … high.)This sounds like a figure from someone who sees a signle microservice running across 100 pods&#x2F;instances, and counted that as 100 \"microservices\". reply Game_Ender 12 hours agorootparentUber invested heavily in tooling that makes creating and deploying a new service take about 30 minutes. This was before they invested in making it as easy to share code. If you combine that with fast hiring and a big pressure to ship, it makes sense to solve every problem with a new service that calls a few others. reply scarface_74 12 hours agorootparentprevS3 alone is built on top of 300 micro services. I don’t find it unbelievable that Uber needs a lot of them. reply zo1 12 hours agorootparentI find it highly disturbing that so far I&#x27;ve seen Zero Uber devs on this thread adding any sort of context&#x2F;info or just confirmation.

This may eliminate or simplify some engineering processes but IME massive migrations like this simply replace them with a different set of processes; because they’re different and theoretically addressable they’re not counted against the hours saved as they can be bucketed into bugs&#x2F;to be addressed by the roadmap&#x2F;legacy behavior migrated from the old system (which is now dangerously-fragile-legacy and not ol-reliable-legac). Eventually someone will come along and decide this too is an inherently flawed platform that needs to be entirely replaced at great expense, and the circle of life continues.This is still a massive undertaking not just from an engineering perspective but from an organizational&#x2F;process one though. Whoever pulled this off essentially had to coordinate (or figure out how to simplify&#x2F;explain things well enough to skip coordination) with almost every engineer and likely almost every production service in a company with thousands of engineers. Those in startups may balk about this kind of thing taking two years, but having done my own two year projects (at a smaller but comparable scale) in a big company I can say two years is what I’d consider a highly optimistic and unlikely outcome for a project of this magnitude. reply jvans 8 hours agoparent> This may eliminate or simplify some engineering processes but IME massive migrations like this simply replace them with a different set of processesYes> because they’re differentNow I have to learn an entire new set of tools&#x2F;processes etc that are more useful to someone else but not helpful for me.

Udeploy, xterra, tchannel, schemaless, etc etc.My peak “wtf” moment was when we had a SEV because two services that should communicate actually used different versions of thrift, both hard forked by Uber, with different implementations for sets.

In particular, on purpose. It is a smoke and mirror dialogue that is not intended to make progress, but only to spend the other side&#x27;s time.In contrast, being wrong and or not fully grasping difficulties is normal. And sometimes, you get lucky and unexpectedly make progress reply uoaei 14 hours agorootparentThis is my core contention: negligence of bringing one&#x27;s efforts to suitably address the problem is not necessarily intentional a la mens rea, but rather demonstrates that a person is not appropriately engaging their mental and cognitive faculties and in essence disrespects the entire process to which they&#x27;ve assigned themselves. These processes are bigger than individuals and it behooves one to engage in ways that make sense. This lack of attention constitutes bad faith in that it is the opposite of good faith engagement.Also, they are assuming their participation is a net positive, which is a position that requires some amount of intention to take, so I disagree that intention as you&#x27;ve cast it is really a relevant perspective here. Bad faith is more than just a rhetorical debate tactic, it&#x27;s a modus operandi with regard to how someone actually engages with the topic at hand. reply taeric 14 hours agorootparentI can see the similarities. That said, there is an advantage to allowing a bit of hubris in young teams. It is a gambit that can uncover absurd progress.There is also a bit of the established problems obfuscating themselves.

Things which are compiled and not interpreted will have a cost benefit then. Rust&#x2F;C# (with AOT)&#x2F;Go etc. Half these bloated piles of shit with expensive build toolchains will die too.Energy reduction -> linked with above, energy usage reduction is going to be a big one. That means reducing workforce, simplification and efficiency are going to be key drivers. This may kill some ML approaches off that consume a lot of energy. So ARM etc.Privacy -> Confidence in surveillance states and the cloud is declining so privacy first oriented services are going to have a huge uptick.

The Rebelle Rally, the longest off-road map-and-compass rally in the United States, wrapped up Friday evening with a new EV milestone under its belt. This was the first time that a team driving an all-electric vehicle (that would be the Rivian R1T) came in first place. The Rebelle Rally, in which all-women teams competed along a 2,120-kilometer course using only paper maps, compasses, and plotters, is in its eighth year. The 2023 Rivian R1T, with Lilly Macaruso behind the wheel and Alex Anderson behind the compass and map, took first place in the 4×4 class. (An EV has yet to make the podium in the X Cross class.) Macaruso and Anderson, who are both Rivian employees, came in fourth place in the 2022 Rebelle Rally. This year, in another first, Rivian customer, Many Brezina, took her personally owned R1T in the competition. Brezina, and navigator Alex Gilman, finished 11th. Image Credits: Tim Sutton / Rebelle Rally The Rivian R1T, which Anderson and Macaruso playfully nicknamed ‘Timmy,’ is actually considered a bone stock, meaning nothing aside from tires were changed on the vehicle that would affect its performance. However, Macaruso and Anderson, both of whom work Rivian, made a number of modifications to the interior to keep them organized during the event. Anderson, a senior mechanical engineer at Rivian, designed a number of items that her co-workers helped bring to life, including inserts for secure storage of a five-gallon water jug, encasing the interior of the A piller with velcro and fabricating mounts for a shovel and fire extinguisher. Anderson also 3D printed an upper cup holder that hooked onto the center console and a lower tray that sat just below it. “All of these little changes added up for us,” Anderson said after the Rebelle Rally concluded. Proving ground The Rebelle has also become a proving ground of sorts for Rivian. Rivian first came on the Rebelle scene in 2020 when Emme Hall, who is also an automotive journalist and contributor at TechCrunch, drove a pre-production version of the R1T. Rivian has sponsored a team every year since. The EV startup turned publicly traded company has used its experience at Rebelle Rally to workshop ideas and fine tune technology and features that eventually make their way into vehicles that consumers own. While Rivian engineers told me that “sand mode” was always the plan, feedback from Hall as well as Rivian employees who have competed in Rebelle helped the company perfect the drive mode. Rivian’s 2022 Rebelle teams were instrumental in final validation of the software build, according to the company. The latest example can be found in Rivian’s new 2023.38.0 software. In that OTA software update Rivian added a gauge view, which adapts each drive mode and gives real-time information about the vehicle’s battery and motor temperature, torque, steering angle, pitch and roll and tire pressure. Charging up in the wilderness Image Credits: Nicole Dreon / Rebelle Rally The Rebelle Rally brings competitors far from established charging stations or gas stations, for that matter. Rebelle has partnered with companies like Pennzoil for gas and Renewable Innovations for green hydrogen. What does green hydrogen have to do with charging an EV? Renewable Innovations has been providing DC fast chargers for the race since 2020. But until this year, the company used diesel generators to power up the chargers. The intention, Rebelle Rally founder Emily Miller told TechCrunch, was always to use hydrogen. “The biggest challenge was the EV infrastructure,” Miller told TechCrunch at the finish line of Rebelle Rally 2023. It took years to find the right partner, build out the infrastructure and secure the 800 kilograms of green hydrogen required for the 10-day event, she added. Today, there are four charge points available to competitors. These chargers are trailered out to spots along the course for teams driving EVs.

It’s something like $40k to replace. Normally a $2k-$3k job on any other pick up truck.These car companies suck when it becomes to repairability.Edit: I’m not going to argue with naysayers below, this dude was quoted $41k but was able to PDR(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;41000-rivian-fender-bender-act...).

My family owned a body shop and I painted cars for few years.I will stick with main stream brands like Toyota. reply Retric 9 hours agoparentProbably closer to 8-14k if you’re not willing to leave the dent. The famed 42k bill was for a rear end collision that caused more damage than it looked like. Cars are much safer today but crumple zones mean minor fender benders result in huge repair bills. However, they are also a major part of the 90+% reduction in vehicle fatalities per mile over the last 100 years.“They took the R1T to a certified Rivian body shop who said the entire rear quarter panel, as well as some tailgate internals, needed replacing. The total cost of replacing an entire body panel and some tailgate bits was reportedly just over $14,000.” https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thedrive.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;rivian-r1t-fender-bender-turns... reply Moto7451 8 hours agorootparentI was rear ended about 8 years ago. I was in a lane that is parking most of the day (like when I stopped) and no stopping&#x2F;anti-congestion during rush hour. My Camaro was hit by a person traveling at least at the 45MPH speed limit. They were on their phone and thankfully were so angry they unintentionally confessed it all to the police office taking the report. I ended up not paying a cent to fix the car, but I did get a copy of the bill.All in all the cost to repair it was in excess of $18,000 from a third party shop that didn’t do a great job on the finish. That was only $5k less than the Kelly Bluebook value for my car at that point in time.In short, it costs a lot to repair crash damage. That’s something people probably don’t think about too deeply if they have comprehensive coverage and pay just their deductible. reply codeTired 8 hours agorootparentA dent is much different than a 45mph crash. At that speed you have to replace half of the car. We have done those at our shop on an occasion.

Where before the contact zone might be on the knees, many a modern truck will hit a pedestrian in the chest. Add to that how America sets up situations very unsafe street crossings, often 8 lanes wide without a median, and increased pedestrian deaths are unsurprising.Note that this is a matter of most security freatures: Good crumple zones don&#x27;t lead to tall trucks with large hoods. The only one that adds risk is the curtain airbags that have lead to wider A pillars, and with that somewhat lower visibility. But we could make cars safe and also safer for pedestrians: Just not by driving heavier, taller vehicles that look like 18 wheelers and have frontal dead zones that could hide multiple Miatas. reply rwiggins 3 hours agorootparentWalkability in the US is indeed dire, but:> Add to that how America sets up situations very unsafe street crossings, often 8 lanes wide without a medianI don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever crossed an 8 line highway on foot (US native).

Looking at how 4m cars have more complex bodies than older Porsches and pack lights at each corner of the bumpers. reply jsight 8 hours agoparentprevDespite claims to the contrary, I haven&#x27;t really seen evidence of this with Tesla. The giga casts have pretty conventional crush structures ahead and behind them. It seems like the kind of crashes that&#x27;d cause massive costs are big enough to be massively costly either way.The Rivian case is a bit of a head scratcher. They made some truly odd choices that are making fairly simple repairs much harder than necessary. It is obvious they are new to this. reply skullone 8 hours agorootparentFirst to market, but with beginner mistakes. I&#x27;ll wait for a more mature EV truck myself. I want a simple box frame, with a body on frame, nothing fancy. Just pure utilitarian EV truck like a base F150 but with a battery. reply xeromal 6 hours agorootparentI&#x27;m in the same boat with you. I want a truck or SUV to replace my 2003 LX470 (Land Cruiser) but aside from the body on frame construction, I really need a 500 mile battery. The 320 mile EPA extended range lightning loses about 64 miles of range from the recommended battery boundaries (don&#x27;t charge above 90% or below 10%) and probably at least another 10%-20% loss from the high torque required offroading and the fact you&#x27;d probably never use regenerative braking since there&#x27;s a lot more technique involved leaves you with about 200 miles of actual range. Throw on a roof top tent and some camping gear in the back and you probably have less and you have to account for the lack of jerry cans that can help you in a pinch if your planned mileage is increased from a bridge that&#x27;s out or closed trail. I really want an electric SUV or truck to replace my main rig but some of the locations I go to are just too dangerous to run out of juice with. I think in about 5 years a dream rig of mine will be on the horizon reply seanmcdirmid 7 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;ve heard that EV trucks are mostly unibodies given the structure they need to protect and support the battery underneath. But I think the F-150 lightning is simple body on frame (as you said, although I think you are confused that this doesn&#x27;t exist yet?), and the new Silverado EV will be neither unibody nor body on frame, whatever that means. reply jsight 6 hours agorootparentprevI think F-150 Lightning is the closest to what you are looking for. But it has its own type of beginner&#x27;s mistakes with the batteries.

Locking diffs simply provide torque to the wheels with grip, which is exactly what one motor per wheel can do too.

Put huge batteries and make it too heavy? It&#x27;ll struggle in the mud and will likely blow tires.

Why You May Want to Run More Than One OpenTelemetry Collector Inside Your Architecture This article will discuss both multi-collector architecture and how Apache Kafka can be useful here. Doesn't collector tiering make more sense, generally, than using a queue? (Big thank you to Martin for always being there with a helpful answer.) What the Collector Does To review, the OpenTelemetry Collector is an optional but strongly recommended part of an OpenTelemetry observability deployment. The collector can gather, compress, manage, and filter data sent by OpenTelemetry instrumentation before data gets sent to your observability backend. If sending data to the SigNoz backend, the system will look something like this: Calls from OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation, API calls, and other code instrumented with the OpenTelemetry SDK all go to the collector running on a host. In more advanced cases, however, this may not be sufficient. Imagine an edge service that handles high-frequency requests, sending regular requests to a fairly distant collector on the same network. The result will be errors raised on the app when it fails to reach the collector for every single request. Again, the whole benefit of the collector is that it should be able to cache, batch, and compress data for sending, no matter how high-frequency its data ingest. Multi-Collector Architecture A collector, B, running close to the service being instrumented could collect data reliably and batch it before sending to a second, central collector, C. The C collector could gather data from multiple other 'front-line' collectors before sending to a data backend. This has a number of advantages: Scalability: In large-scale distributed systems, a single OpenTelemetry collector might not be sufficient to handle the volume of telemetry data generated by all the services and applications. Reduced Network Traffic: For every additional step of filtering that happens within your network, you reduce the total amount of network bandwidth used for observability. Filtering and Sampling: With a multi-tiered approach, you can perform data filtering, transformation, or sampling at the intermediate collector before forwarding the data to the central collector. This can be done by teams who know the microservices under instrumentation and what data is important to highlight. Alternatively, if you have an issue like PII showing up from multiple services, you can set filtering on the central collector to make sure the rules are followed everywhere. Using a Kafka Queue for OTLP Data In the Slack thread above, the proposed solution was to use something like a Kafka queue. This would have the advantage of ingesting events reliably and almost never raising errors. Both an internal queue and a collector-to-collector architecture are ways to improve the reliability of your observability data. The two scenarios where a Kafka Queue makes the most sense for your data are: Ensuring data collection during database outages - even reliable databases fail, and Kafka can ingest and store data during the outage. When the DB is up again, the consumer can start taking in data again. Handling traffic bursts - observability data can spike during a usage spike, and if you're doing deep tracing, the spike can be even larger in scale than the increase in traffic. If you scale your database to handle this spike without any queuing, the DB will be over-provisioned for normal traffic. A queue will buffer the data spike so that the database can handle it when it's ready. In this new version, a Kafka queue receives data from collectors near the edge. Services could also publish directly to Kafka. Collector C reads the data from the queue, using the OTel Kafka Receiver. To learn more about the options for receiving data from Kafka, see the Kafka receiver in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository. YAML Configuration for Intermediate Collectors The process for implementing multiple collectors should be straightforward. If doing this from scratch, it would require the following config for Service A, Intermediate Collector B, and Central Collector C: Service YAML Configuration apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: intermediate-collector labels: app: intermediate-collector spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: intermediate-collector template: metadata: labels: app: intermediate-collector spec: containers: - name: intermediate-collector image: your-intermediate-collector-image:latest ports: - containerPort: 55678 # Replace with the appropriate port number Intermediate Collector YAML Configuration apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: intermediate-collector labels: app: intermediate-collector spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: intermediate-collector template: metadata: labels: app: intermediate-collector spec: containers: - name: intermediate-collector image: your-intermediate-collector-image:latest ports: - containerPort: 55678 # Replace with the appropriate port number Central Collector YAML Configuration apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: central-collector labels: app: central-collector spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: central-collector template: metadata: labels: app: central-col lector spec: containers: - name: central-collector image: your-central-collector-image:latest ports: - containerPort: 55678 # Replace with the appropriate port number The intermediate collector will send telemetry data to the central collector using OTLP. Conclusions: Kafka and the OpenTelemetry Collector Work Better Together The choice between OpenTelemetry Collector and Apache Kafka isn't a zero-sum game. Each has its unique strengths and can even complement each other in certain architectures. The OpenTelemetry Collector excels in data gathering, compression, and filtering, making it a strong candidate for reducing in-system latency and improving data quality before it reaches your backend. Apache Kafka shines in scenarios where high reliability and data buffering are critical, such as during database outages or traffic spikes. Kafka's robust queuing mechanism can act as a valuable intermediary, ensuring that no data is lost and that databases are not over-provisioned. The multi-collector architecture discussed offers a scalable and efficient way to handle large volumes of telemetry data. By positioning collectors closer to the services being monitored, you can reduce network traffic and enable more effective data filtering. This architecture can be further enhanced by integrating a Kafka queue, which adds another layer of reliability and scalability.

I couldn&#x27;t correlate the Grafana articles shared reply francoismassot 12 hours agoprevI heard several times that Kafka was put in front of elasticsearch clusters for handling traffic burst. You can also use Redpanda, Pulsar, NATS and other distributed queues.One thing that is also very interesting with Kafka is that you can achieve exactly-once semantic without too much efforts: by keeping track of the positions of partitions in your own database and carefully acknowledging them when you are sure data is safely stored in your db. That&#x27;s what we did with our engine Quickwit, so far it&#x27;s the most efficient way to index data in it.One obvious drawback with Kafka is that it&#x27;s one more piece to maintain... and it&#x27;s not a small one. reply viraptor 5 hours agoparent> exactly-once semantic without too much efforts: by keeping track of the positions of partitions in your own database and carefully acknowledging them when you are sure data is safely stored in your dbThat&#x27;s not really \"exactly once\". What happens when your system dies after it made sure the data is safely stored in the db and before ack-ing? reply Svenskunganka 4 hours agorootparentDepending on how you use the database it is. If you write the data as well as the offset to the DB in the same transaction, you can then seek to the offset stored in the DB after application restart and continue from there. reply mirekrusin 4 hours agorootparentYou should drop \"(...) and carefully acknowledging them when you are sure data is safely stored in your db (...)\" part then, because it means it&#x27;s not necessary, you don&#x27;t rely on it.One-or-more semantics + local deduplication gives one-and-only semantics.In this case you&#x27;re optimising local deduplication with strictly monotonic index.One downside is that you leak internals of other system (partitions).The other is that it implies serialised processing - you can&#x27;t process anything in parallel as you have single index threshold that defines what has been and what has yet not been processed. reply fulmicoton 1 hour agorootparent> The other is that it implies serialised processing - you can&#x27;t process anything > in parallel as you have single index threshold that defines what has been and > what has yet not been processed.Fortunately Kafka is partitioned. You cannot work in parallel along partitions.Also, you can streamline your process. If you are running your data through operation (A, B, C). (C on batch N) can run at the same time as (B on batch N+1), and (A on batch N+2)We do both at quickwit. reply Svenskunganka 4 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m not the one who wrote the original comment, so I can&#x27;t modify it. But one should still commit offsets because it is the happy-path; DB transaction successful? Commit offset. If the latter fails due to e.g application crash and you seek at startup to the partition offset stored in the DB + 1, you get exactly-once semantics. There&#x27;s some more details, e.g you&#x27;d have to do the same during consumer group rebalance, and topic configuration also plays a role, for example if the topic is a compacted topic or not, and if you write tombstones, what its retention policy is.edit: You added some more to your comment after I posted this one, so I&#x27;ll try to cover them as well:> One downside is that you leak internals of other system (partitions).Yeah, sure.> The other is that it implies serialised processing - you can&#x27;t process anything in parallel as you have single index threshold that defines what has been and what has yet not been processed.It doesn&#x27;t imply serialised processing. It depends on the use-case, if each record in a topic has to be processed serially, you can&#x27;t parallelize full-stop; number of partitions equals 1. But if each record can be individually processed you get parallelism equal to the number of partitions the topic has configured. You also achieve parallelism in the same way if only some records in a topic needs to be processed serially, at which point you can use the same key for the records needing to be serially processed and they will end up in the same partition, for example recording the coordinates of a plane - each plane can be processed in parallel, but an individual plane&#x27;s coordinates need to be processed serially - just use the planes unique identifier as key and the coordinates for the same plane will be appended to the log of the same partition. reply mirekrusin 3 hours agorootparentYes, it&#x27;s good option but it requires serialised processing in partition scope, which may or may not be desirable.If one-and-only-one semantics are needed and processing should be parallel, other methods have to be used. reply robertlagrant 1 hour agorootparentPresumably every exactly once processing scenario needs you to squeeze things through a serial pipe at some point, or you could have 2 messages with the same ID come in and be processed in parallel? reply mirekrusin 50 minutes agorootparentYes but scope&#x2F;blocking&#x2F;serialisation can be narrow or wide - ie. it can be per message id (highly parallel) or one for all messages of certain type&#x2F;partition (not parallel). reply francoismassot 3 hours agorootparentprevGood point: first you&#x27;re right, we do the ack on Kafka but it&#x27;s not necessary. Second, this is not what I wanted to stress... and I should have not used the verb \"acknowledge\". What we do is upload the data on S3, then we commit partitions + positions in what we call the metastore. I can&#x27;t edit my comment unfortunately.> One downside is that you leak internals of other system (partitions).True, but we generalized the concept of partitions for other datasources, pretty convenient to use it for distributing indexing tasks. reply viraptor 4 hours agorootparentprev> after application restart and continue from there.What if the application doesn&#x27;t restart before the queue decides the message was lost and resends? reply hashhar 4 hours agorootparentIn Kafka the \"queue\" is dumb, it doesn&#x27;t lose messages (it&#x27;s an append only durable log) nor does it resend anything unless the consumer requests it. reply richieartoul 5 hours agoparentprevYou have to do a bit more than that if you want exactly once end-to-end (I.E if Kafka itself can contain duplicates).

If you need to buffer why not just dump to s3 or similar data store as a temporary storage array. reply lmm 11 hours agoparent> If you need to buffer why not just dump to s3 or similar data store as a temporary storage array.At that point it&#x27;s very easy to sleepwalk into implementing your own database on top of s3, which is very hard to get good semantics out of - e.g. it offers essentially no ordering guarantees, and forget atomicity. For telemetry you might well be ok with fuzzy data, but if you want exact traces every time then Kafka could make sense. reply dikei 8 hours agorootparentYeah, and to use S3 efficiently you also need to batch your messages into large blobs of at least 10s of MB, which further complicates the matter, especially if you don&#x27;t want to lose those messages buffers. reply bushbaba 6 hours agorootparentif your otel collector is being overwhelmed.

    "originBody": "The blog at the bottom of the sea Programming, Graphics, Gamedev, Exotic Computation, Audio Synthesis Menu Skip to content Table of Contents License Contact How To Make Your Own Spooky Magic Eye Pictures (Autostereograms) October 22, 2023 4 The simple standalone C++ code that goes with this post and makes autostereograms, can be found at https://github.com/Atrix256/Autostereogram. The 1990s! They felt like a wasteland of culture at the time, but looking back, there was hyper color t-shirts, the beginning of mainstream computing and the internet, the height of alternative rock, and of course magic eye pictures. Unfocus your eyes such that the two dots overlap. A 3D image should emerge! Quick PSA if you can’t see it! To make an autostereogram, you need two things: 1. Color Image: A tileable repeating pattern. This can also just be “white noise”. 2. Depth Image: A grey scale depth map, or a black and white mask. This defines the 3D shape. Brighter pixel values are closer in depth. For the above, I snagged these two from pintrest. The image you are making is going to be the width and height of the depth image, but is going to have as many color channels as the color image. You build the output image row by row, from left to right. To start out, we can just tile the output image with the color image. The Output Image pixel at (x,y) is the Color Image pixel at (x % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight). That makes a tiled image, which does not have any 3d effect whatsoever: To get a 3D effect we need to modify our algorithm. We need to read the Depth Image at pixel (x,y) to get a value from 0 to 255. We divide that by 255 to get a fractional value between 0 and 1. We then multiply that value by the “maximum offset amount”, which is a tuneable parameter (i set it to 20), to get an offset amount. This offset is how much we should move ahead in the pattern. So, instead of Output Image pixel (x,y) using the Color Image pixel (x % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight), we are calculating an offset from the Depth Image and using the Color Image pixel ((x + offset) % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight). Doing that, we aren’t quite there. Some 3D effects are starting to pop out, but it doesn’t look quite right. In fact, if you use the simpler depth map of the rectangles shown below, you can see the rectangles just fine, but there seems to be holes to the right of them. What we need to do is not just look into the Color Image at an offset location, but that we need to look at the Output Image we are building, at an offset location. Specifically, we need to look at it in the previous color tile repetition. We use the Output Image pixel at ((x + offset – ColorWidth), y). A problem with that though, is that when x is less than ColorWidth, we’ll be looking at a pixel x value that is less than 0 aka out of bounds. When x < ColorWidth, we should use the Color Image pixel instead, using the same formula we had before ((x + offset) % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight). That fixes our problem with the simpler squares depth map. The holes to the right are gone. And it also mostly fixes our “grave” image: There is one problem remaining with the grave image though. How these images work is that your left eye needs to lined up with an unmodified tile on the left, and your right eye needs to be lined up with a modified tile on the right. The grave image has depth information very close to the left side, which makes that not be possible. To fix this, you can add an extra “empty color tile” on the left. That makes our image a little bit wider but it makes it work. This also has the added benefit of centering the depth map, where it previously was shifted to the left a bit. There we are, we are done! Other Details I found it useful to normalize the greyscale depth map. Some of them don’t use the full 0 to 1 range, which means they aren’t making the most use of the depth available. Remapping them to 0 to 1 helps that. Some masks were meant to be binary black or white, but the images i downloaded form the internet had some grey in them (they were .jpg which is part of the problem – lossy compression). Having an option to binarize these masks was useful, forcing each pixel value or 0 or 1, whichever was closer. The binary masks i downloaded had the part i was interested in being black, with a white background. I made the code able to invert this, so the interest part would pop out instead of receeding in. The distance between the helper dots on the images are the width of the Color Image. A wider color image means a person has to work harder to get those dots to overlap, and it may not even be possible for some people (I’m unsure of details there hehe). I used tile sizes of 128. It’s hard to make out fine detail from the depth maps. It seems like larger, coarse features are the way to go, instead of fine details. More Pictures Here is the grave, with a different color texture. I find this one harder to see. And another, using RGB white noise (random numbers). I can see this one pretty easily, but it isn’t as fun themed as the pumpkin image And here is greyscale white noise (random numbers) used for the color image. I can see this just fine too. I also tried using blue noise as a Color Image but I can’t see the 3d at all, and it isn’t a mystery what the 3d image is. You can see the repetition of the depth map object from the feedback. I think it’s interesting that the repetition is needed to make it look right. I have no understanding of why that is, but if you do, please leave a comment! Here are some images that are not the grave. I find the pumpkin color texture works pretty nicely Links This video kicked off this nerd snipe: https://youtu.be/-okxLz1UauA?si=y_QK8-Bv4EzZSGBv This was also helfpul: https://flothesof.github.io/making-stereograms-Python.html Here is the code I wrote that makes these autostereograms again: https://github.com/Atrix256/Autostereogram Lastly, I think it would be really neat to make a game that used this technique to render 3d. It could be something simple like a brick breaking game, or as complex as a first person shooter. A challenge with this is that you need to process the image from left to right, due to the feedback loop needed. That won’t be the fastest operation on the GPU, forcing it to serialize pixel processing unless anyone has any clever ideas to help that. Still, it would be pretty neat as a tech demo!

Post navigation ← When There Are Too Many Experiments (Tests) To Do! Part 2: Orthogonal Arrays 4 COMMENTS IanOctober 22, 2023 at 12:21 pm Very fun! Although, for me, I needed to invert all the depths (easy enough in code) to perceive that which should be near as near. Once I did this, the 3D shapes became much more obvious. I believe this is corroborated by the math used in the revision of the source as of posting this: Nearer things should have a larger separation. The depth offset scales linearly with depth map values that represent near pixels as 255 (normalized to 1), and then that depth offset is added to the position of the previous tile for sampling the line’s row so far… but that means nearer depth values cause sampling from closer to the current pixel being written rather than further from the current pixel being written, and hence near values adopt the perception of being far away since there is less separation instead of more. I’m not sure how depth is quantized in the image — assuming it’s linear, then the separation for non-binarized cases could be improved by introducing a reciprocal? Something I unfortunately only have time to idly wonder about is if there’s a way to minimize the permanent offsetting of the row. That might make the blue noise case better, although the blue noise is so hard to visually align at an arbitrary distance due to no easy nonuniform visual cues that it may not be sufficient even if the repeating pattern lines from the stereo separation from earlier in the row were eliminated. A simple example of this kind of minimization might be choosing a global offset for each row such that the squared distance of the effective sampling offsets (after accounting for the recursive sampling nature) is minimized. More interesting would be if you can ‘fudge it’ a bit and let offsets drift enough to help globally reduce bleeding offsets on the right hand side of rows — I wonder if human perception even allows for this. Does anyone know if any autostereogram methods account for this kind of global optimization already?

Have a look at the stepped 3d depth of the cross or the mount of soil underneath it, for example. Perhaps the algorithm is only performing whole (not fractional) pixel shifts and this depth quantisation is a result? Not sure.

They were amazed when I used to glance at the image and rattle off the one obscure difference they missed.My trick was based on \"magic eye\" images I used to enjoy. When I saw the side-by-side drawings used by the puzzle, I wondered what would happen if I \"fuzzed\" my eyes as if I was looking at a magic eye photo. To my surprise, all of the items that were different between the two images \"vibrated\" or \"shimmered\", while the rest of image stayed steady. I repeatedly fuzzed and focused to spot all the differences in a matter of seconds. reply satvikpendem 6 hours agoparentYep, I do this too.

Very easy DIY Magic Eye. reply jrapdx3 9 hours agoprev3D images have captivated me since I was a kid. A frequent source of amusement was the \"Victorian wallpaper effect\" and even without a viewer I could easily see classic stereo photo pairs in 3D. Not at all difficult to see the \"hidden\" objects in the article&#x27;s quite nice illustrations.While popularity of SIS imagery isn&#x27;t what it was a few decades ago, programmer interest in the subject has remained quite strong.As an artist I enjoy incorporating SIS images in my work. In the past I&#x27;ve used a number of open-source SIS generators. Mostly these programs weren&#x27;t completely satisfactory. A common defect was producing SIS artifacts marring output image appearance.Subsequently I wrote a SIS program (with GUI for usability) [0] that almost entirely eliminated artifacts in the finished images. Developed with artists&#x27; interests in mind, its SIS output looks different vs. examples in the article. (Using depthmap and texture&#x2F;pattern image inputs, the latter determines the \"surface\" appearance of the SIS.) However both SIS styles have the same 3D effect capability.[0] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thinairarts.com&#x2F;stereogram.html reply andai 6 hours agoparentThis looks great.

The 3D effect is interesting to experience, but the pattern is so busy and distracting that it&#x27;s often hard to tell what the object is supposed to be anyway.As a kid I had a book which had tried to address this problem. The shape was still hidden but certain elements of the repeating pattern coincided with and emphasized parts of the hidden image - but in a way that wasn&#x27;t obvious until you had revealed the 3D effect. It was partially successful. reply adventurer 11 hours agoprevI can never see it for some reason.

They usually aren&#x27;t all that satisfying really. reply ksaj 14 hours agoprevThis was interesting.Stereo wideners (a switch made to cause music to sound wider in audio 3D space) work very similar to the Dolby3D, except with equalization instead of colour filtering.Dolby3d takes chunks of red, green and blue, and filters them so the left and right eye are seeing slightly different reds, greens and blues in a way that isn&#x27;t easily detected by the person viewing them. Both eyes see apparently normal views, but together they see a stereo image.Stereo audio wideners take a set of audio frequencies, lowering their EQ on one side while raising them an equivalent amount on the other, so that the left and right ears are hearing different equalization that still sound reasonably normal.It makes sense that Dolby is the primary name associated to both technologies. They are pretty much the same left-right reversed comb filters, except light frequencies versus sound frequencies. reply netruk44 12 hours agoprevThe fact that all you need is a depth map of what you&#x27;d like to create makes me wonder if anyone&#x27;s ever linked something like this up to a video game engine to make possibly the least visually pleasing and least accessible game out there. reply ClassyJacket 12 hours agoparentYep, ZeroGravitas mentioned Magic Eye in another comment, also this:https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rockpapershotgun.com&#x2F;cross-your-magic-eyes-to-pl... reply Tao3300 8 hours agoparentprevCall it Polybius. reply stiray 5 hours agoprevfor those who can master it, here is Tetris to play: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deviantart.com&#x2F;3dimka&#x2F;art&#x2F;3D-Stereogram-Tetris-3...I was never able to see stereograms, the most I was able to pull out was to see it inverted (x seeing with eyes, while the opposite is required). reply Dwedit 2 hours agoprevFractint was an excellent program for making Stereograms, and I believe it can still be used for that task. reply g-b-r 3 hours agoprevI&#x27;m not an expert but I don&#x27;t think you need to go to a doctor if you can&#x27;t see them easily, I think it&#x27;s common for it to take a lot of effort initiallyIt actually might well be that people with sight problems will have a harder, or a lot harder, time at first, but, yeah, with enough time most will probably manage to.I think it took me weeks to start to see them easily, and probably at least days to see one for the first time.By the way, from then on though, I became able to e.g. watch stereo videos stereographically in a split second, from any position (so long as I kept exercising every once in a while); so it&#x27;s probably just a matter to learn how it works and maybe exercise the eyes a little, for most people. reply PaulHoule 15 hours agoprevNice, but I still like making red-cyan anaglyphshttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Anaglyph_3Dthough I think the premium way to enjoy stereograms in 2023 will be with a VR headset (no fan of Facebook but I just got a Quest 3 and wow!) reply cubefox 13 hours agoparentUnfortunately they are hardly making stereoscopic movies anymore.

In a country the size of the U.S., scenes like this, of police investigating a homicide in Ontario, CA., are daily occurrences. Overall, however, homicides have declined nationwide after a spike in 2020 and 2021. (Robert Gauthier/Los Angeles Times) BY DAVID LAUTERSENIOR EDITOR OCT. 20, 2023 3:30 AM PT Facebook Twitter Show more sharing options WASHINGTON — Homicides in the U.S. dropped significantly in 2022 and have plummeted even faster this year, putting the country on track for one of the biggest declines in killing ever recorded, crime statistics show. If that comes as a surprise, you’re not alone. Crime did rise nationwide in 2020 and 2021. The disruption caused by a deadly pandemic, a record increase in the availability of guns, a pullback of policing in some cities and perhaps other factors combined to create a surge in homicides and other crimes. That national tide has started to recede, but public perception has not kept pace. Newsletter Get our Essential Politics newsletter The latest news, analysis and insights from our politics team. Enter email address SIGN ME UP You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. That continues to color the nation’s political debates even as reality increasingly diverges from the rhetoric. A historic decline Let’s start with the numbers. The FBI’s annual report on the nation’s crime statistics showed a 6% decline in homicides in 2022. The drop exceeded what most crime experts expected, said Jeff Asher, a crime data analyst and consultant whose AH Datalytics’ site is a widely cited source of information. The FBI data, which the bureau compiled from reports filed by 18,888 local police departments, lags nearly a year behind reality. Asher, who puts together data from departments that cover a large majority of the nation’s population, says that so far this year, homicides nationwide have declined 11% to 12%. ADVERTISEMENT Cities tend to report first and have larger drops than more-rural areas, Asher noted, so he’s projecting the final, nationwide 2023 numbers will show a smaller drop — somewhere between 7% and 10%. “A 10% decline would be the largest ever recorded,” he said. The decline goes beyond homicides: Violent crime overall ticked down in 2022 across the country, the FBI numbers showed, returning the U.S. pretty much to the level of 2019, before the COVID-19-era increase. That’s consistent with the pattern of the last dozen years. Despite some fluctuations, violent crime nationwide has stayed largely at the same level since 2011, when it hit a plateau after 20 years of steady declines. That doesn’t mean all categories of crime have declined. Auto thefts, for example, have soared in many parts of the country, in part because of a wave of social media videos publicizing easy ways to steal Kia and Hyundai cars. But “the concept of a violent crime wave — it just really doesn’t exist,” Asher said. California declines similar to U.S. The numbers in California are similar to the national ones: In 2022, the state saw a 6.1% drop in homicides although it had a 5.7% increase in violent crime overall compared with the preceding year, according to data from the Public Policy Institute of California. In Los Angeles, violent crime has declined nearly 7% so far this year compared with last year, according to Los Angeles Police Department statistics. The city has experienced 1,650 fewer incidents reported as of Sept. 30, the numbers show. ADVERTISEMENT The public perception is very different. Gallup, for example, has surveyed Americans every fall for years about crime. Last year’s survey found that by 56%-28%, Americans said crime had increased in their area. That’s almost always true. More Americans said crime increased than decreased in all but four of the last 24 years, Gallup found — the exceptions being 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2018. That was true despite the huge decline in crime nationwide that began in 1991, when crime peaked, and continued through 2011 for violent crime and through 2020 for property crimes. Anecdotes shape perception Why the gap between perception and reality? The power of anecdote explains much of it: In a country of nearly 340 million people, some crime takes place every hour, every day. Those incidents stick in people’s minds, especially when the details are grisly. Vivid stories have far more power than dry numbers to shape how people view their world. And in the social media era, crimes anywhere can be just a click away. “Every time there’s a smash-and-grab, it just amplifies in people’s minds that crime’s out of control,” said pollster David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University polling center, which has surveyed residents of many of the country’s major cities. Anecdotes have even greater impact when they’re fresh and crime statistics aren’t. Unlike economic statistics, which arrive monthly in real time, the U.S. system for reporting crime data, first set up in the 1930s, remains antiquated and slow. By the time the government reports the data, it’s often too old to inform national debates. The localized nature of most crime plays a role too. In any year, whatever the national trend, some city probably will have an uptick in crime — often without a clear cause. This year, for example, Washington, D.C., has suffered a sharp increase in killings, in marked contrast to the nationwide decline. San Francisco has experienced a heavily publicized rash of retail burglaries. News tends to focus on the unusual, not the routine, so those outliers get disproportionate attention. Politics amplifies fears And, of course, “part of what causes the gap between perception and reality is politics,” said Democratic pollster and strategist Anna Greenberg, whose firm has conducted several studies on public attitudes toward crime. Even when crime is declining nationwide, some people live in unsafe neighborhoods and have very real fears about being victimized. Black women, for example, many of whom live in urban neighborhoods with high crime rates, are among the groups who rank crime highest on their list of priorities. They’re not, however, the voters who most often back policies traditionally seen as tough on crime — longer sentences, for example, or expanded police powers. Those voters — generally older, conservative and white — often live in relatively low-crime areas. When polled, they frequently rate their own neighborhoods as safe but say crime is rampant elsewhere. There’s an obvious racial subtext for many of those voters’ concerns about crime. But race isn’t the only factor. For many voters, worries about crime reflect a concern about “a sense of disorder and chaos” in the world, Greenberg said. “That doesn’t come out of nowhere. We’ve been in a very unsettling period in our country,” she added. There’s evidence, however, that even if public perceptions of crime remain at odds with reality, voters are less prone to support “lock them up” as a solution. Research that Greenberg’s firm has done for Vera Action, a liberal research and advocacy organization, suggests that Democrats often can counter Republican messages on crime by stressing their support for measures like expanded mental health treatment and getting guns off the street. “A more comprehensive, prevention focus is more popular than just punishing your way out of the problem,” Greenberg said. Electoral experience backs up that claim. After the killing of George Floyd in 2020, when some Democrats on the left embraced calls to “defund the police,” Republicans stepped up efforts to tag Democrats as soft on crime. Despite widespread worry among Democratic elected officials, however, that effort fell far short of its goal in both 2020 and 2022, including in the Los Angeles mayoral election, in which Rick Caruso leaned heavily on concerns about crime and homelessness in his unsuccessful campaign. If that’s true when voters think crime is on the upswing, just imagine what might happen if the country begins noticing that it’s on the way down. Enjoying this newsletter?

Will she win in the public arena? Arriving in California in 2009, Laphonza Butler moved up through the ranks of the state’s powerful labor unions. She wielded her clout quietly, forging connections with politicians and mentors whom she impressed, including now-Vice President Kamala Harris and Gov. Gavin Newsom. An unexpected call from the governor’s office on Sept. 30 suddenly changed Butler’s role. No longer a behind-the-scenes operative, she’s now a front-facing principal, serving the final 15 months of the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s term. Noah Bierman, Taryn Luna, Matt Hamilton and Seema Mehta provide this in-depth look at the state’s new senator. Sen. Laphonza Butler, caretaker of the late Dianne Feinstein’s seat, won’t run in 2024 election Butler announced Thursday that she would not run for a full Senate term in 2024, Benjamin Oreskes, Mehta and Luna reported. In a whirlwind first week, newly appointed Sen. Laphonza Butler acts like a candidate Butler certainly looked like a candidate in her first full week in office, which coincided with a Senate recess. The former EMILY’s List president capitalized on the opportunity, crisscrossing California, attending events — public and private, big and small — in Orange, Los Angeles and San Francisco counties, among other locales, Oreskes, Mehta and Hamilton reported. Adam Schiff outpaces Barbara Lee, Katie Porter in fundraising for California Senate race Rep. Adam B. Schiff continues to hold a strong lead over his rivals in fundraising in the Senate race, bringing in nearly $6 million in campaign contributions in the last three months, according to federal reports released Sunday. Rep. Katie Porter, an Irvine Democrat, raised more than $3.3 million in July, August and September and has brought in about $11 million since joining the race. Rep. Barbara Lee, a Democrat from Oakland, raised about $1 million in the third quarter and has brought in about $3.2 million overall, Laura Nelson reported. Los Angeles newscaster Christina Pascucci announces Senate bid Los Angeles newscaster Christina Pascucci announced Wednesday morning that she is joining the Senate race. The 38-year-old Democrat and San Fernando Valley native argues that she offers a centrist option for voters tired of polarization in the nation’s politics, Mehta reported. The latest from court Attorney Sidney Powell pleads guilty in Georgia ahead of trial in Trump 2020 election interference case Attorney Sidney Powell has taken a plea deal in Fulton County, Ga., one day before jury selection was set to begin for her election interference case alongside lawyer Ken Chesebro.

The latest from Washington Jim Jordan backs empowering Patrick McHenry, a McCarthy ally, as temporary speaker Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said Thursday he will back empowering North Carolina Rep. Patrick T. McHenry, the House’s temporary speaker, to advance legislation while the GOP continues to squabble over who will lead the House, Erin Logan, Faith Pinho and I reported. Jim Jordan loses second vote for House speaker but vows to try again On Wednesday the House for the second time declined to elect Jordan as speaker, leaving the chamber in chaos, Logan and Pinho reported. Doug Emhoff, America’s Jewish second gentleman, on how he navigated tragedy in Israel and Gaza In his first public remarks since the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, an emotional Doug Emhoff spoke of his “deep, visceral connection to Israel and its people,” Courtney Subramanian reported. The latest from California Despite diplomatic tension, Newsom is going to China to promote cooperation on climate change As rising fossil fuel emissions continue to push global temperatures to record highs, Newsom will head to China next week to meet with officials on such environmental imperatives as offshore wind power, air pollution reduction and the transition to fully electric vehicles, according to the governor’s staff, Hayley Smith, Tony Briscoe and Laurel Rosenhall reported.

Then an article comes out saying things are actually OK and we get comments like these. I suspect there&#x27;s really no winning here. reply arcticbull 2 hours agorootparentThe thing that bothers me for instance, living in SF, is that SF has always been kinda nuts. However. In the last 8 years SF traffic tickets issued have fallen by 97%. [1] Now I know that in the last 8 years people didn&#x27;t suddenly become 97% better at driving. That kind of thing really skews my perception of the statistics.When I hear mass shootings happen in Bernal and near 24th, and my street gets looted several times -- but crime is actually down and I&#x27;m safer than ever according to the stats -- something just doesn&#x27;t add up to me.I don&#x27;t think there were more murders in SF, that kind of thing gets picked up and reported - but I don&#x27;t think that the number of traffic incidents per murder has dropped 97%. Therefore, I also don&#x27;t think the number of property crimes per murder has dropped, or car jackings, etc. I have no basis to work from, nothing to anchor my personal perceptions of safety.I mean ffs SF boarded up downtown for the elections in 2020. That&#x27;s some failed state shit. I&#x27;ve got my plywood all set for 2024.The number of killings has never been high in my recollection. Dropping by some percent, large or small, doesn&#x27;t impact my personal perception of safety.

There is a vast movement across most media outlets to push the narrative that &#x27;the people&#x27; cannot be trusted and need oversight and control. It&#x27;s probably the most significant anti-democratic wave in several generations, and ironically the perpetrators are mostly those who constantly accuse others of anti-democratic tendencies. reply _3u10 6 hours agorootparentThe crap north americans put up with is amazing.

Covid is a very abnormal event, and seeing the numbers go back to pre-Covid quickly after Covid is more or less expected. It&#x27;s a good thing (if it&#x27;s true), but not that newsworthy. reply ncallaway 6 hours agorootparent> but not that newsworthy.It may be expected, but I disagree that it&#x27;s not newsworthy. If a sharp-rise is newsworthy, then it&#x27;s also important to inform people of the sharp-drop. Even if it makes sense to expect a sharp-drop after an anomalous sharp-rise, if you only report the sharp-rise then you leave people misinformed about the current situation.I think it&#x27;s fine to complain about the framing of the article, but I think the fact itself is newsworthy. reply lostmsu 4 hours agorootparentTechnically right, but using \"historic\" instead of \"pre-COVID\" is a form of propaganda targeted to people who don&#x27;t pay attention, and is rightly flagged. reply aeternum 7 hours agorootparentprevIt&#x27;s easy to have a historic rate of decline if you just had a historic rate of increase. reply zo1 6 hours agorootparentprevI&#x27;m a really capable and well-read English speaker and I missed that subtle detail. No wonder people distrust the legacy media. reply karaterobot 7 hours agoparentprevHere&#x27;s the part that addresses your point:> The decline goes beyond homicides: Violent crime overall ticked down in 2022 across the country, the FBI numbers showed, returning the U.S. pretty much to the level of 2019, before the COVID-19-era increase.It looks like the original survey was asking about whether there is anywhere near the respondent&#x27;s home where they&#x27;d be afraid walk at night. That sounds to me like it&#x27;s very much a question about perception rather than statistics. Of course, people rarely base that kind of belief on hard evidence: a single incident that happened to a friend of a friend might be enough to make you say \"I&#x27;m never walking in that neighborhood at night\". reply Kamq 6 hours agorootparent> That sounds to me like it&#x27;s very much a question about perception rather than statistics. Of course, people rarely base that kind of belief on hard evidence: a single incident that happened to a friend of a friend might be enough to make you say \"I&#x27;m never walking in that neighborhood at night\".Wouldn&#x27;t the perception track the statistics in the scenario you&#x27;ve lined out? More people being stabbed, for example, results in more friends and friends of friends being unwilling to take a walk in that area.I mean, you can have an outlier, a very popular person who triggers more friends&#x2F;friends of friends, but on average, it seems like perception wouldn&#x27;t be the worst way to measure this under the scenario you&#x27;ve laid out. reply lazyasciiart 6 hours agorootparentNo. Perception tracks publicity of incidents - I know some people still warning others off a neighborhood they were mugged in 20 years ago, but they don’t mention how long ago it was when they say it’s dangerous. So for instance when a group of well off people move into a depressed neighborhood, there might be the same number of muggings, but 10 times as much talk about it because these people go to the police and write to the paper about it. reply bhk 6 hours agoparentprevHomicide is not back to 2019 levels.

It&#x27;s possible that the trend of &#x27;lighter policing&#x27; leads to less reported crimes but not actually fewer crimes has been going on since the 2000s. reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentThere’s many ways to validate crime statistics. For example insurance claims are linked to the number of property crimes independent of what police report.More broadly violent crime has been falling for literally thousands of years. There’s various short term bumps in the rate, but the general trend is down across all societies. The past was simply vastly more dangerous than we are used to. reply explaininjs 7 hours agorootparentOnly if you make insurance claims. I’ve had many things stolen and I’ve never made any claims. Or filed any reports. reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentThat’s always been the case for minor crimes, but people will make a claim if their house burns down or a car is stolen. reply explaininjs 7 hours agorootparentHow happy should we be if people in-mass give up on the police and light property crime increases by 1000%, reports of such are eliminated, but car theft stays constant and the overall numbers decrease? That is the direction we are headed. reply Retric 6 hours agorootparentCar theft, arson, etc are down dramatically not just flat. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;191216&#x2F;reported-motor-ve... Motor vehicle theft per 100k people 1990: 657 vs 2021: 268. That’s a 60% drop, even with the recent spike. Which is why you always hear crime rates compared across short periods, they wouldn’t seem bad by historic standards.Your proposal around light property crime is simply wrong. You don’t need to trust police statistics for validation pickpockets used to be endemic in NYC to the point where people chained their wallets to their pants. Things have fallen so far we see cultural norms changing.That isn’t to say every city or every year sees an improvement but the long term trends are really clear. Granted the existence of cellphones means they get stolen, but that’s more than offset by car radio theft practically disappearing. reply somenameforme 4 hours agorootparentBeware of cherry picked data. It&#x27;s not statista doing it, but whoever they sourced their data from choosing to start at 1990. Here [1] are the same data (from the FBI) from 1960, instead of 1990. 1990 was not a historical rate, but the result of an exceptionally sharp spike in crime that began in 1960. In 1960 motor vehicle theft rates were 183. The statista table (which goes until 2021 instead of 2019 from my source) shows today they&#x27;re at 268 and trending upwards.I really wish I could find data prior to 1960, but I guess you probably end up with a poor signal:noise ratio at some point. Those data are all from the same source, so have meaningful comparability. In any case, the long term trends are anything but clear. Crime rates currently look something like an eccentric sine wave.People in 200 years sure will have it easier, data wise.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.disastercenter.com&#x2F;crime&#x2F;uscrime.htm reply gavinray 6 hours agorootparentprevThis is wholly irrelevant and I don&#x27;t want to \"uhm, ackshually\" here but just fyi it&#x27;s \"en masse\" though everyone knows what you mean reply ncallaway 6 hours agorootparentprevIf you asked me if I would prefer a decrease in violent crime and major property theft if it came with an increase in non-violent light property crime, then I&#x27;d say \"yes, sounds great\". reply oooyay 6 hours agorootparentprevI think that depends. If someone breaks a car window or spray paints a fence it&#x27;s likely cheaper to repair it yourself if your deductible is 500-1000. People are also cognizant that if you ever report anything to insurance that your insurance sky rockets so they&#x27;re less likely to report.Paying $500-$1000 would not be \"minor\" to me, but is minor in a crime sense. reply aikinai 5 hours agorootparentprevHow many people actually have theft on their insurance? My car was stolen so of course I called insurance right after the police (who didn’t show up for six hours). But the insurance company just said, “You don’t have theft on your policy, but okay we noted it’s no longer in your possession.” Maybe that would show up in stats? Not sure. reply vore 7 hours agorootparentprevSure, but what matters is if they track the actual crime rate right? If you’ve never made any claims then you’ve never been a significant data point to begin with. reply explaininjs 7 hours agorootparentI fear you’re Goodharting this into oblivion. The only endgame of “people who don’t make claims aren’t significant” is police becoming so inept as to never secure property or arrest thrives (already there), and insurance companies having such massive premium hikes on-incident as to make filing claims net-negative in all but the most egregious cases (approaching there). reply Retric 7 hours agorootparentThe most egregious cases are where you get the best data from insurance. But different metrics work for less violent crimes. You can validate the decline of pickpockets in the rates people replace their driver’s licenses etc. reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentprev> \"More broadly violent crime has been falling for literally thousands of years.\"El Salvador is such an extremely interesting study in violent crime. Until recently El Salvador had one of the highest homicide rates in the world. In recent times it has plummeted precipitously (>90% over the past decade) and in 2023, they may very well end up with a lower overall homicide rate than even the US.What happened was a complete crackdown on gangs. [1] After declaring an emergency scenario, their government &#x27;temporarily&#x27; suspended certain rights, and greatly empowered law enforcement. Anybody who even looked like a gang member was rounded up and thrown into prison. And instead of placing gang members together where they often manage to conspire even within prison, they eliminated all mobile service in the prisons and locked down the cells with members of different gangs placed in cells together. Happy times ensued, undoubtedly.In short it&#x27;s been the effective end of civil and human rights, yet it&#x27;s been extremely effective at lowering crime. This system is far from ideal, because there&#x27;s zero doubt that some, more or less, innocent individuals have suffered severe consequences at the hands of the government. Yet the overwhelming majority of criminals are also being eliminated, saving their innocent would-have-been victims. And, in the past, this sort of treatment of antisocial elements would have been perfectly normal.When you look at studies of violent crime in the past, the evidence is hazy at best. You can find studies to say whatever you want, and then other studies to point out the flaws in those studies. Ultimately I think the vivid imagery we have, of the past as being especially violent, is because it&#x27;s a set piece of practically all &#x27;historic&#x27; media we consume. But the factual and logical support for it seems far less clear.[1] - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Salvadoran_gang_crackdown reply hx8 7 hours agorootparentprevDon&#x27;t you need a police report to file an insurance claim for stolen property? reply lazyasciiart 6 hours agorootparentThey never make insurance claims because … they’ve given up on the police? reply hx8 5 hours agorootparent> insurance claims are linked to the number of property crimes independent of what police report.I&#x27;m stating that these two variables (insurance claims) and (police reported crimes) aren&#x27;t independent variables but actually closely linked. reply spamizbad 7 hours agorootparentprevI actually don&#x27;t understand the logic of lighter policing resulting in fewer reported crimes. I can see it possibly resulting in police discovering or interrupting fewer crimes, and I can see it resulting in fewer arrests, but the idea that you&#x27;re not going to report a burglary because your local politician is seen as soft on crime doesn&#x27;t make sense to me - for starters, you&#x27;ll need that police report to make an insurance claim.What I can see causing a drop in reported crime is a lack of trust between police and a community - people may choose not to get the police involved out of fear they will make the situation worse, overreact, or may deem the punishment too harsh. reply sologoub 6 hours agorootparentIf you don’t expect the police to do anything about it, why file a formal report?It’s possible to even go to the station, speak with the on duty officer, find out that they’ll basically do nothing and decide to not waste any more time on that. Such a conversation will not show up in any statistics, ditto an equivalent phone call.For substantial losses, insurance claims make more sense. If it’s something that’s close in cost to the deductible and you expect your insurance premiums to go up after a claim, most people would not even submit that - there is not much pay off and higher premiums to worry about. So a lot of these costs are basically absorbed by the victims and statistics end up looking better than they should.In my general area, 20-30 years ago, I’d sometimes forget to close the front door when I left (as in wide open, visible from the street). Nothing ever happened. A year ago, I forgot to lock the car at night - interior got ransacked and turned upside down. There wasn’t anything of value in there, but it sure left me feeling a lot less safe… reply ncallaway 6 hours agorootparent> If you don’t expect the police to do anything about it, why file a formal report?Because your insurance demands a formal report (because if you lie to the police it&#x27;s a marginally more serious crime than if you lie to your insurance agent). reply drawnwren 7 hours agorootparentprevI was robbed 3 times in SF.

But I have seen it too: there’s a set within America which insist it’s getting more dangerous regardless of which way the trend line points. reply Spooky23 6 hours agorootparentprevAs many places adopted compstat like programs in that timeframe, you should be wary of statistics that aren’t tied to verifiable or insured events.I’d trust auto theft and homicide and ignore the rest.Understanding context around police reporting is key. reply ern 7 hours agoparentprevIn addition to politicians and media who always tend to benefit from a perception of increased crime, social media feeds perceptions of increasing crime rates. reply yomly 4 hours agoparentprevI got shutdown on twitter on this subject once - but I maintain can crime stats go down while crime goes up? As crime rates go up (and police get flooded) do people stop reporting all but the most serious of crimes?I live on a street that sees almost daily crime (smash and grabs from car windows, bike theft, delivery theft). The police usually don&#x27;t even bother coming to check things out because they&#x27;re so routine and the police are so busy. So it does feel a bit useless reporting them to the police, and eventually you become a bit numb to it all as crime becomes normalized.Can that then explain why crime perception can be high while crime reports come down? reply onionisafruit 7 hours agoparentprevIndeed almost all crimes aren’t homicide. reply etempleton 7 hours agorootparentNo, but homicides are an important benchmark because there is consistency in what constitutes a homicide and murder is hard to brush under the rug or categorize as a lesser crime. If homicides decrease it is a good indicator of overall safety of a city.With that said, theft seems to be getting worse in many places and that is probably a direct result of lighter sentencing for petty theft. reply uoaei 6 hours agorootparentThe vast majority of homicides happen between people who already know each other, so actually homicide rates say nothing about crime within geographic boundaries so much as crime within existing social groups.Then it stands to reason that reporting on crimes in this or that city is mostly nonsense reporting, it doesn&#x27;t convey any information that&#x27;s useful to anyone. reply onetimeusename 6 hours agoparentprevcrime was increasing in some places like Chicago[1][2].

Usually these things are discussed in the context of large cities in the western US controlled by democrats. This leads to many who are farther on the left claiming rising crime is an illusion and if it exists at all it is caused by police not doing their jobs as payback for calls for reform. This also leads many on the right to clutch pearls and declare that liberal enclaves are dying and failed social experiments in liberalism and weak criminal justice.I&#x27;ll say that, in the case of Seattle, I don&#x27;t believe overall stats show the region is less safe than, say, the 90s. The 90s were sort of peak crack cocaine and street gangs. Having lived through that time and remembering the crimewave, I think the issue now is that crime back then was mostly in bad areas and didn&#x27;t affect most middle or upper class folks. Now, especially after the gentrification and return to downtowns, middle and upper class folks are more exposed to crime. The meth and fentanyl epidemics are also helping to push crime into more suburban areas.With all that said, and hopefully not to ruin my other points, I&#x27;ll say I am leaning more conservative these days after seeing what has become of western cities(from San Diego to Seattle, I&#x27;ve visited them all fairly regularly over the past few decades). I don&#x27;t think every problem is fixable via public policy, but damn, we&#x27;re doing something wrong here. reply lazyasciiart 6 hours agorootparentPretty much everywhere in Seattle is middle and upper class today, so yea - crime is a lot more real to many people when it’s near them.Along the same vein, “What has become of western cities” is “rich and expensive”. And if by conservative you mean “want less government regulation against building homes” then I think you’re right. reply jandrewrogers 5 hours agorootparentI have lived in the Seattle core since 2010, not out in the suburbs. Over that time, the crime visibly improved over many years. Then it became visibly much worse, starting around COVID, than at any prior time since I have lived there.The lived reality is that the city stopped making even the pretense of enforcing the law. Theft and assaults regularly happen in broad daylight and law enforcement mostly doesn’t bother. The prosecutors won’t prosecute much short of attempted murder these days; no point in arresting people if they are going to be immediately released. People stop reporting crime because at best their insurance premiums will increase and at worst they will be loudly accused of oppressing the downtrodden or some such twaddle. There is no ROI. Many women who have lived in these communities a long time no longer feel safe.Anecdotally, this is driving a lot of people to move into the high rises with real security from high-density neighborhoods like Capitol Hill where having your building invaded by miscreants happens surprisingly often. People put a lot of value on being able to live in a place where they feel secure, and so anyone that can afford it is retreating behind secured walls. reply _3u10 6 hours agorootparentprevExactly, you see this to a more extreme degree in South America.Particularly Rio, Buenos Aires, and Asuncion.Rio is don’t take your phone out if you don’t want it to get stolen.BA is you might get mugged at night.Asuncion is you can forget your phone at a cafe and someone will run after you to give it to you but don’t go to the bad areas or you’ll get killed.Oddly Asuncion is the poorest city of them all, but also by far the most conservative.

But there are many differences between these regions. Canada and European countries all have much stronger social safety nets and typically a more close society in general (not trying to make a race homogeneity argument but one of walkability). I wish more conversation would revolve around this, but I&#x27;m afraid of the complexity in this (because you have to solve a lot of problems) makes this unattractive. But if the problems were simple to solve they probably would have been solved. Everything is highly multifactored these days.There has actually been a large trend of decreasing crime since the 90&#x27;s, when politicians talked about \"super predators.\" A lot of research has been done on this and there&#x27;s been been discussions if it is things like the decrease of lead in the air, abortions, or other things, but generally it doesn&#x27;t seem that \"tough on crime\" was the dominating factor.Another interesting statistic is that most Americans believe crime is increasing year over year despite the reverse happening.

King County has well over 2 million people. reply MattGaiser 7 hours agorootparentprevMy city of Calgary has about a quarter of that at one million people. We have about 25 a year. reply ggm 8 hours agoprevIsn&#x27;t this Steven Pinker&#x27;s core thesis? He got howled down for the soft-pop-sci take on the stats, but although I find him a reprehensible egotist, I had some sympathy for the underlying factoids: It felt like although NEWS of crimes of violence continues to be high, actual RATES of crimes of violence set against population overall, aren&#x27;t rising. reply treis 7 hours agoparentNo, this is a (relatively) small decline after a massive increase:2018 - 17k2022 - 21k reply britzkopf 7 hours agoparentprevIf Steven Pinker is reprehensible, what kind of adjectives do you bust out for actual villains? reply ggm 6 hours agorootparentAdjectives are bad.

The disruption caused by a deadly pandemic, a record increase in the availability of guns, a pullback of policing in some cities and perhaps other factors combined to create a surge in homicides and other crimes.\"Why not look at those one by one?Guns last basically forever, so I don&#x27;t see how a spike in purchases followed by a drop in purchases would explain a spike and then a drop in crime. The guns are presumably still around.Next, a pull-back in policing in 2020 may have reversed somewhat by now. A bad DA in SF was recalled. It&#x27;s plausible that this explains at least a part of the spike followed by the drop.I&#x27;d be interested in hearing other explanations. Maybe the criminals are busy with other things (jobs, etc.)? Maybe the free flowing pandemic cash drying up means less money to fight over? Maybe criminal-enablers (drug users, etc.) are busy with other stuff? reply giantg2 7 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s all about perspective. There was a decrease after an increase. I&#x27;d venture a guess that most people never experienced the initial increase and so they won&#x27;t notice any decrease. Either rate is rather low and there are a variety of factors that are more influential in making your likelihood higher or lower. reply TriangleEdge 7 hours agoprevI suggest y&#x27;all look at the data chart if you fell for this clickbait headline. reply alekseiprokopev 7 hours agoprevThank you all for killing less people this year. reply Mountain_Skies 7 hours agoprevIn addition to what others have mentioned, advances in trauma care could be responsible for the longer term decline that&#x27;s been going on before the pandemic. reply ropable 6 hours agoprevI heard a podcast episode recently (the name escapes me) which suggested that US emergency trauma centres are getting so good at preventing people from dying of gunshot wounds that they are skewing the stats relating to homicide. The thesis being that, although the incidence of gun violence was increasing, the absolute number of people dying of gunshot wounds was decreasing. reply inemesitaffia 6 hours agoprevWhat about the attempts?

Meanwhile in Seattle surpassed 2022’s record setting homicide count with 3 months to spare.Seattle has roughly 2x the pre-pandemic homicide count. And roughly triple the count from 10 years ago.Is the rate declining nationally? Maybe! Is that going to impact news coverages in areas where it is not decreasing? Absolutely not. Should it?

As far as I can tell, it’s quite common among New Yorkers to think crime is rising too, even though it really is falling in NYC, unlike Seattle and DC. But I have not seen a quantitative study correlating these. Are people who live in areas where crime actually is rising more likely to think it is? reply forrestthewoods 5 hours agorootparentHonestly? It’s impossible to say due to lack of data.Homicides are well tracked. They’re either up or down. It varies by locale.Petty theft and similar isn’t tracked. Everyone in a city knows the police can not and will not do anything about it. Small crimes simply are not reported. It’s a waste of time. The only data we have is anecdata.If someone uses stats to claim non-violent crime is down they’re full of shit. They don’t know. If someone says it’s up they’re relying on anecdotes. So maybe true, maybe false.Lies, damned lies, and statistics. :( reply andrewstuart 6 hours agoprevIt&#x27;s because everyone is looking at their phones. reply Khelavaster 2 hours agoprevReported crimes are falling while actual crimes are rising.
