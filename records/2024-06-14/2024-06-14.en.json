    "commentBody": "Land value tax in online games and virtual worlds (2022) (progressandpoverty.substack.com)327 points by larsiusprime 18 hours agohidepastfavorite320 comments at_compile_time 14 hours agoOne limitation I have not seen discussed is LVT's self-defeating nature, and it's an important one to figure out if land value taxes are to succeed in practice. An upside and downside of LVT, depending on your perspective, is that the imposition of a LVT would seriously lower land values. The inverse is also true: removing an established LVT carries a significant upside for the affected landowners. Property that had been acquired for cheap under a LVT would be freed of its shackles and allowed to appreciate again. Some of this would be immediate, as thousands of dollars in taxes shift away from land and back onto labour, enterprise, and commerce, and some of it would be gradual as people resume buying land because land value always goes up (which causes land values to go up). This creates a powerful incentive to undo any progress that a LVT campaign might accomplish. I doubt that anything short of a revolution would be able to overpower the wealthy landowning class who like their unearned rents and inflated asset values very much thank you, but you don't just need to beat them once, you need to be able to hold their political, economic, and intellectual influence at bay permanently or we end up right back where we started in a matter of years. reply adverbly 7 hours agoparentThis comment is a bit surprising to me. Your point seems to be that strong policies which impose significant good will face significant resistance and so there's no point doing them. I don't think that makes any sense. Workers rights, regulations around dumping waste, capital gains taxes... There are a lot of things that we already have which some people with power have a strong incentive to remove. We had to fight to implement and to keep these, but goddamnit is it worth it! I don't see why we shouldn't be optimistic here because historically speaking things have gotten much much better! To me, a gradual and consistent ramping up lvt would be probably the most progressive policy a country could pass at this point :D reply mwigdahl 6 hours agorootparentThe problem (and for the record I favor LVT myself) is that many of the other things you mention -- the 8 hour workday, environmental regs, etc. -- have clear positive effects that an average person doesn't have to take action to benefit from. If you tried to take them away, people would notice and object. For a typical homeowner, the effect of LVT would be pretty neutral, by design. Proposals I've seen advocate changing the _distribution_ of single-family home taxes between land and improvements, but not the _total_. Yes, LVT would discourage speculators from buying land as an investment without improving it, which is a societal good. But it's not direct and short term like many of your other examples. I think GP's point stands that rolling back LVT would be highly desired by big landowners (who could then return to do-nothing land appreciation and rents for their profits rather than be required to actually _do something_ with the land to earn over its taxed value), while the average Jane couldn't care less, because it wouldn't really impact her tax bill. That sort of situation is not stable long term. To make it more stable, you'd need to set it up so that LVT lowered the average voter's tax bill. I'm not sure how feasible that is. reply adverbly 5 hours agorootparent> you'd need to set it up so that LVT lowered the average voter's tax bill. I'm not sure how feasible that is. Highly feasible! https://www.commonwealth.ca/which is a societal good. But it's not direct and short term like many of your other examples. Excellent point! Reminds me of a certain climate-related topic ;) Again though - I think there is reason to be optimistic. Public awareness is gradually increasing[1], housing/zoning policy discussion is a hot topic these days, and young kids are volunteering/attending rallies at a higher rate than any previous generation[2] [1] https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=land%20v... [2] https://www.statista.com/statistics/1448606/us-political-act... reply candiddevmike 5 hours agorootparentprevDepending on who you ask, LVT would ideally replace all taxes, including income, so the property tax bill would be the only tax you paid. In this scenario, getting rid of LVT would be a significant undertaking, and very noticeable. reply TimPC 4 hours agorootparentThis is no longer actually possible. LVT at 100% generates less revenue than all other methods of taxation combined across all levels of government. This was the original idea but government is now too large for it. reply nwah1 3 hours agorootparentJoseph Stiglitz proved what he called the Henry George Theorem which shows basically that useful government expenses will always show up as increased land value that matches or exceeds the cost. Unfortunately, it is true that a fair amount of government expenses are not useful. (i.e. do not constitute a public good in the economic sense) reply candiddevmike 4 hours agorootparentprevWhy do you think it's no longer possible?

I think the average person actually cares an incredible amount about property taxes, especially when it comes to local politics. Local news stations talk all the time about \"property tax relief\", and there's a general sentiment from just about everyone involved in local politics that property taxes are a useless drain. Which in some cases they are - property taxes really only \"work\" when they roughly approximate LVT, but it leaves suburbanites feeling overtaxed (because they are, compared to the value of their land) and they have massive political power. I think that if LVT was simply touted as a \"Property Tax Relief Plan\", you could make it have massive, massive support. It wouldn't be perfect, but you could give eveyr single person a massive tax credit based on what LVT revenues would bring in, and make up for that tax credit with the LVT. For example - if you lived in a city of 100,000, and total LVTs bring in $200,000,000, you could give every single person a $2000 \"Tax Relief Credit\" deductible from all city taxes. You change nothing about how much money is raised, only the distribution, and in a way where 95% of people visibly see their tax bill go down.

That is because they are not marginal, and they are not land value taxes. You basically get rewarded for leaving a large piece of land undeveloped in the middle of an urban area. You do no work, and reap all the gains of appreciation while society around you does the work of making the place desirable to live, hence making the land desirable to buy. You also get armed protection via military, police, and courts, and all of their salaries are disproportionately paid by everyone else doing work. Earned income instead of property tax is the biggest and most perverse subsidy from working people (especially young) to non working asset owners (and older people) and hence collect rent. On top of that, we give lower tax rates to capital gains, and on top of that, we let land owners indefinitely defer taxes via 1031 exchanges.

These two are both linked. In the US, military enrollment age was 20-45 (The Enrollment Act). Around the two world wars it was lowered to 18, primarily because they didn't have enough troops and most kids graduated high school at 18. The 26th amendment set the voting age to 18 because that's what the draft age was already set to. Neither had anything directly to do with developmental differences by age. The first followed social norms for schooling age and the second just followed along. > You cannot purchase nicotine, alcohol, or other drugs.

I don't know if those data were known before age limits were set, but there is a good reason to keep it today that has nothing to do with teenagers' ability to make decisions.

If a child wants to learn a craft or pick up specific skills, that should not be done in a work environment that can put them in danger. Again, that's another failure of the system.

There are no statistics that support this claim. False assertions are no way to debate about policy, provided we want good policy that is actually effective at keeping people safe.

We've seen evidence it can decrease their safety since some are killed/injured, even if you dismissed it as not statistically relevant.

It's really an argument for tax simplification. As far as I can tell the way tax policy works is that rich people hire lawyers and PR firms to cast the forms of taxation they would actually have to pay as regressive (e.g. consumption taxes, because you can't register the Rolls Royce without paying the tax and you can't sell into the jurisdiction without collecting VAT) and the forms they can avoid through shell games and accounting tricks as The One True Way To Tax The Rich (e.g. \"profit\" taxes, because profit is fuzzy around the edges and has high inter-region liquidity), which the rich then weasel out of and leave only the middle class paying the tax. reply roenxi 10 hours agorootparentI looked for some reliable numbers on Apple's tax payment and didn't find any, so I won't comment on that, but I do want to say some things about... > capital gains tax exists but is deferred until you sell the shares and then rich people don't do that This gets pretty quickly into the philosophical what-are-we-doing-here-exactly of taxes, but: 1) Shares don't do very much on their own, so there isn't really a problem with that. I mean, dude owns a billion in shares - if they earn income dude will pay tax, if they don't the only true to get to the value is to sell them. I imagine there are some gaping loopholes involving charities and debt, but that isn't anything to do with the deferment of the tax. 2) Because of inflation - and asset inflation is markedly higher than CPI - CGT is effectively a wealth tax because fairly quickly most of the value of an asset is the inflationary component. I've got gold bars where I allegedly am making a 100-and-something% return and that just flies in the face of the inert reality of the metal itself. The tax is markedly unfair, anyone trying to be a responsible saver ends up paying much more of their income in tax than someone who just spends it on the day and it effectively becomes a wealth tax that stops anyone in the middle class moving up over time. Moving wealth between assets is catastrophic to your financial health once CGT is a factor. There are a bunch of quirky distortions in the tax system. CGT might even be one of the contributing factors to why people don't tend to have savings (although the biggest factor is probably psychology). Rationally speaking saving is quite an inefficient use of money if you end up paying CGT. reply cipheredStones 10 hours agorootparent> 1) Shares don't do very much on their own, so there isn't really a problem with that.

In short, you can borrow against the value of appreciated assets to get income during your lifetime, then pass the assets (and the debt) on in inheritance, and your heirs don't have to pay any capital gains tax because of cost-basis step up when they sell the assets to pay the debt. You effectively avoid any taxation on the appreciation. reply robertlagrant 8 hours agorootparentYou don't need shares for this - you can be mortgaged up to the hilt and pass on the house to your heirs when you die, and they sell the house to pay off the mortgage. But all the money you borrowed needs to have been spent, or it's subject to inheritance tax (or paying back the debt it came from), and all that spending needs to be on things that are taxed with VAT, with employees providing services you buy who are paying income tax, and the businesses you're buying from paying corporation tax, etc etc. Tax is never avoided; it's just paid through other means. reply AnthonyMouse 10 hours agorootparentprevBut this is kind of my point. Capital gains tax is a dumb tax, it mostly screws middle class people and creates several perverse incentives, and we'd be better off to use a simple consumption tax instead. The argument against this is supposedly that \"rich people\" are the ones who pay capital gains tax, but in practice \"rich people\" are the ones in the best position to avoid paying it using fancy accountants and cross-border shenanigans. The middle class people actually paying it wouldn't be any worse off with a consumption tax that lacks all of those perverse incentives, and might even end up paying less because then the super rich would pay the same rate as they do instead of a lower one. reply pydry 8 hours agorootparentConsumption tax screws the working and middle classes the absolute most because they consume the most as a % of their income.

So before discussing cutting tax we need to think about what the state should offload (if anything) first. reply robertlagrant 8 hours agorootparentI would love to have that discussion, as I agree instinctively, having worked with local and national government bodes in the UK - it does seem as though the current way is very expensive.

If that isn't the case anymore, we should fix it. The main problem is that nowadays states operate on the basis of the same false trickle-down fable. They don't build stuff, they pay corporations to do it for them and expect that money to somehow flow down to the people. We can clearly see that doesn't happen as inequality keeps growing. reply robertlagrant 8 hours agorootparentWe aren't the state, though. The state is the governing body and its surrounding entities, funded through taxes, that controls the justice system and the military. I don't think it's a good idea to conflate \"the state\" and \"the country\" or \"society\". The state is the most powerful entity in the country, but it's not the only one. And I've probably said this elsewhere, but inequality is not important. We keep hearing about it every day, so it sounds important, but it's not. Unless it's being done deliberately to keep people down, e.g. in a feudal or 20th century socialism country, but even then the fundamental problem is authoritarianism, not inequality. Inequality is a symptom, and not always of something bad. I don't care that Tesla owners in the early 2010s had Roadsters and I didn't. Roadsters paved the way for Model Ss, which paved the way for Model 3s, which - if the Cybertruck hadn't got in the way - paved the way for Model 2s. I don't care that at some point in history only rich people had (terrible) glasses. Basically everyone (outside of impoverished countries whose government officials absorb the cash from overseas to help) now has access to high quality lenses - far better than those the rich people of the past could access. Temporary inequality leads to - over time - an uplift of the fundamental things for everyone. That's the only thing that matters - the baseline now vs what it used to be. Not the difference between baseline and the rich.

That's also the reason why there will never be any simple taxation system, such as land value tax or whatnot. In order to keep everybody using the government currency, the taxes demanded in that currency has to be applied to every and any economic activity imaginable, otherwise people will flock to other currencies after having paid their dues, and the government currency value collapses. This is also the reason why the public sector workforce is of an enormous size, even in supposedly capitalist countries. Public sector workers cannot choose another currency for their paycheck.

Good luck doing that without violating the \"fundamental right\" of the existing property owners.

You have to be licensed, you have to pay taxes, you have to register your vehicle, etc. If you don't follow the rules you may lose that privledge. Many of the US founding fathers wrote extensively about the importance of property rights [2]. They also viewed slaves as property and took land from loyalists after the revolutionary war was over, so by no means am I saying they were perfect. The history of the right to property ownership literally goes back to the creation of our country though. The right to own property doesn't mean that everyone must own some though, I'm not sure where you're getting that.

Though rare, you will occasionally find stories of individuals who's land was taken by the government ad the person is effectively thrown out on their ass. I don't think that should ever be possible, I don't care what the government would like to use the land for. I actually saw this happen just a few years ago. The cities of Orange Beach and Gulf Shores, aong with the Alabama stage government, were all fighting over where a new bridge to the barrier island should go and who would get to tax it. A plan was drawn up putting the bridge on part of the canal where homes already existed on both sides. The owners were forced out and given under market rate for the houses. This was in 2017 or so if I remember right, property value there has gone crazy in recent years meaning they also lost all that potential growth in value. Anyway, the legal fight over the bridge ultimately swung a different way and the homes were taken only to sit vacant and abandoned as the bridge is now going elsewhere. This should never happen in my opinion, plain and simple.

People have always understood the value of land and have worked hard to be able to purchase it and vote + participate in local government to help protect the value of that land. Especially in the US, that mostly worked quite well. We still have huge amounts of extremely cheap land that could be made desirable with enough hard work. You can still buy a crazy amount of land in parts of the country for like $50k. Done right, an LVT can actually increase land value. Suppose you are a developer that owns a plot of land in a desirable area but there are some abandoned building nearby that a stingy owner refuses to sell. With a regular property tax, if you make significant improvements like add park space, nice trees, landscaping, etc. to your building you pay much more property tax while the stingy owner pays nothing but benefits from increased property value.

Land value is a measure of supply and demand. But most of the demand isn't for land in particular, it's for indoor space. If you have LVT and don't have density restrictions -- or just don't have density restrictions regardless of LVT -- then people are going to build until the cost of indoor space falls to the construction cost. Then land values will be low because it's being used efficiently, and there is a de facto ceiling on the price -- if you want to add 100 stories of new space and land is dirt cheap then you might build a hundred single-story buildings, but if land gets even slightly more expensive than that you can just build twenty 5-story buildings instead, which is what people would do rather than paying for five times more land unless it's prohibited. LVT increases this incentive even more, because not only would you have to pay for more land, you would have to pay the LVT on more land, so now it makes sense to build ten or twenty story buildings. Meanwhile if you're not going to build a ten or twenty story building (or in a place like NYC, a hundred story building), holding onto an underutilized lot will cost more than it's worth, so the land values become negligible. This ignoring the overall premise of LVT which is that the tax should be equal to the land value, so even if land values were high, the tax would just offset them and zero them out -- until the high tax incentivized even more construction. But there is a different reason the argument doesn't apply to this -- or to any other tax. Governments have budgets. If they currently get money from a tax, and you propose to get rid of the tax, and your proposal is to cut spending, the people currently receiving the money (often politically connected corrupt industries or government unions) will fight you. If you propose to get rid of the tax without cutting spending by instituting or raising some other tax, the people you propose to tax instead will fight you.

Let the established landowners keep a (much smaller) benefit to align incentives. Spitballing... I wonder if it could be balanced to give an LVT discount for holding on to land for 5+ years or some such thing. In this system, we still have reduced land prices because of LVT but there's still a benefit that old money has over the default and can clutch tightly to. Suddenly, long term owners have an incentive to keep such a system else they be set at the same level as new owners. reply at_compile_time 1 hour agorootparentThat would be a disincentive to land ever being sold and I don't think we want that. It's gameable too: you just have one entity own the land, and then rather than buying and selling the land, you just buy and sell the entity. reply Manuel_D 2 hours agoparentprev> An upside and downside of LVT, depending on your perspective, is that the imposition of a LVT would seriously lower land values. I would really like you to elaborate on this point. Sure, I guess if land comes with an extra $X of tax attached to it, the net value of land is lower. But it encourages things like building taller buildings, because a 2 story apartment building can't break even with the land tax but a 20 story building can. Land in the middle of SF's financial district or Manhattan isn't cheap: a strong argument can be made that building taller denser buildings increases land value. reply gen220 4 hours agoparentprevI think you're right that it would require a revolution, but we've had those before and come out OK, so it's not so far-fetched or scary as it sounds. It's definitely not going to be voted into law by any local or state legislature without great civil unrest to motivate it. However, as the landowning class concentrates and we run out of valuable \"frontier\", it becomes an inevitability. As a history lesson, we used to have feudalism in New York from before the revolutionary war up into the 1800s. It was a grandfathered-in political-economic system initiated by the Dutch to encourage high-class immigration and patronize friends of the governor, which the English expanded and the nascent U.S. extended to curry favor with the wealthy families who'd supported the revolution. That system, too, was really valuable for the people who had that privilege. But eventually they were outnumbered and overthrown, in a movement that was pretty revolutionary [1]. By the time it happened, we had innovated new ways to develop wealth that didn't require rent-seeking landlordship and monopolies (this was the era of the industrial revolution), so it'd become significantly less politically-tasteful, even in comparatively bourgeois and aristocratic circles, to depend on these ancient monopolies for access to wealth. But, ultimately, it was a popular (and, at times, violent) revolution that tipped the scales towards reform. I think it'll probably happen at the municipal or state level before it happens at the federal level. Most likely in NY (again!) or CA, if I were a betting person.

Absent some other very convincing information, the price of a plot of land is going to be the best analogue for how much society values that land. Obviously the private land owner (in general) would prefer that the cost of owning land was as near zero as possible so that they could use it how they saw fit, regardless of the opportunity cost to society. And that's how it spirals into the mess we have today. reply RandomLensman 5 hours agorootparentWhy would it be most desirable for society if the only thing done with land was to maximize profit? Society also values museums, parks, etc. - but those are not a profit maximization things. You keep bringing up price, but price and use of the land are not the same. A price (if transacted on) also only really speaks towards the parties involved, not society as a whole.

Tax is someone taking money by force. Supposedly this tax is then used to protect the land / assets from being seized. Over time every country seemingly has increased taxes as stability increased (not the other way around), so in reality — it’s extortion. Give us money or we take your stuff, your “protector” takes more because you don’t have other options. Back to the land value tax, why bother? It’s the same fundamental issue; why are we paying these taxes? And before we get into “but the services”. I moved somewhere that has approximately zero taxes and zero services. It’s great - safer, cheaper, better run. A lot of community stuff is ran by parents or churches, people tend to just “figure it out”. The idea of a land value tax is insane because it robs you of assets faster the more valuable it is. We had this in the past, feudal Europe, it sucked.

The argument is weak because you constructed a straw man. The libertarian notion is not to live without any of the services provided by a state, but to have different providers which are in competition. The issue is that the state / gov has a monopoly but is exempt from antitrust laws. The implementation is tricky though because in reality, when functions of the state are privatized there is often a huge amount of lobbying and corruption involved and these functions are given to a small group of big companies which effectively form a cartel once again. Then they extract all the economic value left in the infrastructure, the privatization is declared failed and undone, effectively another channel of syphoning tax money into the hands of big companies. reply peoplefromibiza 8 hours agorootparent> but to have different providers which are in competition it never worked in practice though. > has a monopoly but is exempt from antitrust laws because it does a mediocre job at many things, making it quite easy to compete against it when and if it's worth it, but provides those things no private entity would, because it's anti-economical. like, for example, the proverbial roads to nowhere. reply jnordwick 6 hours agorootparentprev> nontaxpayer ends up being a freeloader and social parasite And you say the libertarians are childish and simplistic reply goodpoint 6 hours agorootparentYou just replied childish and simplistic comeback. reply lettergram 6 hours agorootparentprev> The whole idea of extortion is premises that people can exist somehow outside of society which is disconnected from reality.

At one point during a sale, some officials had commented that they couldn't find that he had title to this land, but they didn't follow up.

On the contrary, I consider the wages of labour and the return on capital to be the actual earned benefits. Yet these are the things we tax. So the wealthy claim no income, hold their assets, and never realize capital gains, and multinationals play accounting games and pretend that all of their profits happen in the lowest international tax jurisdiction. Sales taxes and personal income taxes end up being the majority of government revenue.

Domains are sort of the digital land for the internet, and the websites hosted on them are the value add. Domains are practically infinite, though like some of the land examples some domains are far more desirable than others. Individually domains can be divided into practically infinite subdomains and/or subpages. The ~1500 TLDs all have their own rules and fees (taxes). They fall under a central governing authority, ICANN pursuant to ToS/EULA/rules/policies, as well as intellectual property laws which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may also fall under one or more international treaties. Nevertheless, speculation proliferated and domaining is an entire industry driving prices up, but in practice I don’t think prohibits “new players.” There is enough difference between land/virtual worlds and domains, I don’t think a LVT or harberger tax would be well suited for domains, but it’s interesting to think about.

LindenLab charged a set price for a parcel (by size) or island (by compute), regardless of what was on it.

If something can't be used any more efficiently (which suggests that it either is already being put to its highest and best use already, or that its potential use is severely restricted, akin to real-world municipal zoning restrictions), then there are several ways to look at that: 1. This is fine, actually; the asset is actually being used for its intended purpose and not simply hoarded 2. The developers could remove restrictions on the use of the thing so that there is a higher and better use for it than currently exists 3.

Just because a system is at equilibrium does not mean that a better equilibrium is impossible. There are significant advantages beyond unused plots. Incentives in general will change. The goal is not simply to repossess unused lots. Although you are correct that as a side effect, it does make for a much more efficient resource allocation. The other massive advantage is that because the supply of land is fixed, a land value tax has a unique property of having zero deadweight loss. This makes it the most efficient tax possible.

So far, the US has been able to scratch that itch because it’s been the same government that has been predictably the same for nearly 250 years. Now it doesn’t mean the world’s reserve currency won’t change over time but if it does, it’s because some other country or group of people have managed to establish themselves as equally boring for decades. And by the time that happens, the world will have already changed significantly already.

It's a weird catch 22, the only way for the $ to remain the reserve currency is for it to continue being issued at a global growth rate, faster than a mature economy like the US can grow. International debts in $ can only be paid back in the same and that's part of the reason for rehypothecation, central bank swaps, and all sorts of other shenanigans. In turn that keeps US long rates artificially low. The old adage holds true though, it's your problem when you owe the bank a little money. It's the banks problem, if you owe a lot of money. The same is true of inward investment into the US (or Russia or China). Who will end up owning that investment, if relations go south? The country where it exists not the investor, but debt is a negative investment. The Treasury can start issuing unsterilized currency (the trillion $ coin) and debase the currency any time there's a big enough issue, or simply not repay certain bonds.

In the past period of energy price inflaction one could observe quite for awhile that the exchange rates favoured the US-dollar over the euro although inflation in the USA was higher than in the EU. The best explanation I came across for this phenomenon was the petrodollar: Importers from the EU needed to exchange a lot of euro into dollars to pay for oil. As a result, the exchange rate shifted increasingly against the euro, which made energy costs within the EU even more expensive, which gave the USA a competitive advantage. Importing countries therefore have a great incentive to conduct oil transactions in their own currency. This will not lead to the dollar losing its supremacy in oil trading overnight. But I expect its share of trading volume to gradually decline.

We will see if that pans out for them. reply elzbardico 19 hours agorootparentprevWell, you could be right and yet, the economic consequences would be the same. Contrary to what you say, the freezing of said assets and their confiscation is on legally murky waters, and even if it was clearly allowed by Charter of the United Nations, of course it would require a voting on the security council or at least on the general assembly not just a gentleman agreement between the NATO countries, bypassing the only real source of international law: the UN. The thing is. Does it matter? Can the US and its partners really enforce it? How do you expect other countries that are not in the western club to react? As I said in other comments, we no longer live in the world where the US is the single biggest commercial partner of every country in the world, we don't live anymore in a world where the US alone is 40% of the global GDP. Those days are over. reply roenxi 19 hours agorootparentprevThat is cool and all; but if the US is going to seize assets after building a watertight legal case then countries can't just by default leave their sovereign assets in places where the US can seize them. A country's bankers are not interested in taking that sort of risk needlessly, there needs to be something in it for them. Of course the international finance system is complicated so maybe there still is enough of a payoff to holding US dollars, we're seeing something of an exploratory process here as China, Russia and probably India start testing the system.

An average brit who wasn't in the import/export business probably didn't notice anything the day of, or the day after Brexit. It's been slow, and one can argue, visible now in the long term \"in the graphs\". Recovery from COVID was slow. There's a creeping cost-of-living crisis, productivity has been stagnant, investment low, etc. Some might attribute this at least in part to Brexit, some may not, but the truth is, wether Brexit played a role or not, this is how it would surface— slowly, and in the charts. reply ben_w 21 hours agorootparentBrexit also had a 10% shift in currency value as soon as the markets could react to the news. I don't know how big a deal this news is on the markets, especially given everyone's already trying to shift to renewables. And it might have been predicted in advance, unlike Brexit where the markets expected Remain. reply aylmao 20 hours agorootparentI think Brexit was also more obvious. The effects and timelines were more clear, there were stronger, and well-publicized opinions, and so it was easier to predict what would happen and hedge accordingly. This time of predictability also creates a self-fulfilling prophecy environment. Having people bet against makes things harder. These news on the other hand seem more abstract.

There is no single candidate widely preferred by either party. The fact that they're both elderly is kind of a coincidence. It is true that older candidates are the ones with the longest track record of accomplishments and the most extensive alliances. But the GOP candidate had little government experience and somewhat dubious business experience. He is nonetheless popular for his style and positions. Both parties are very diverse and it's difficult to find someone tolerable to all. Many actively despise their party's candidate but the alternative to the consensus risks losing entirely.

In my estimation and experience, there has been a severe lack of training the next generation and handing off the reins of power. Be it a middle management position, a leadership position in local government, or leadership positions in political parties. We have had a generation of leaders who took the reins and then either never trained their replacement or they did but held onto the reins for so long that replacement has aged out or left for another opportunity/path. So here we stand, with our leaders entering the high positions of power well after they should have retired.

With an FPP system, the puppy will almost certainly win regardless of people's preference.

Remember, in 1974 the U.S. didn’t trade with China [1], the USSR or the Soviet-aligned world. (We were also a massive energy importer [2].)

The petrodollar is also about making sure the dollar remains the world's reserve currency. The fact that China, Korea or India for example have to buy oil in USD rather than in Saudi Riyal or their local currencies, helps the USD. I also want to point out \"petrodollar\" isn't a fringe topic. It wasn't when it was first coined, and even if it's spoken-of little nowadays, that's not a measure of its importance. Few people spoke about CDOs before the 2008 crisis. They were about to play a central role in what was to unfold, but people just weren't paying attention to them. Again, I'm not saying the USD's dominance is about to end tomorrow. I'm just saying it's an error to dismiss this event as unimportant, in this case on the basis that the USA doesn't import as much energy, or that nobody is talking about the petrodollar. It might not be that important, or it might turn out to be. If we do see effects though, I'd expect them to be in the long-term anyway. Geopolitics are slow.

And the event itself is not that important in isolation. But as part of a larger trend of events it is completely different story. The US can’t finance its debt neither keep their massive trade debts without a healthy global appetite for the dollar. American companies can’t achieve their massive competitive advantages by outsourcing a lot of production to China and paying with green YOUs unless the world keeps trading between themselves using those green YOUs. This won’t happen overnight because the major exporters in the world are sitting on mountains of USD denominated treasury bonds and it is not on their interests to see those mountains of assets turning into dust. But the trend is clear. reply aylmao 20 hours agorootparent+1. I think the term petrodollar makes it seem it's all about the oil. The oil is important, but the most important part of it is the guarantee that the casino chips the USA issues can (and in fact have) to be used to buy things around the world, even when the USA isn't involved in the trade at all (for example, when India buys oil from Saudi Arabia). The overall fate of the USD as the world's reserve currency depends on a lot of factors beyond this event, but I think we also shouldn't mistake this event as unimportant. I might or might not have important consequences, but it's also a data point that's telling on other diplomatic and geopolitical trends going on in the world. reply JumpCrisscross 18 hours agorootparent> the term petrodollar makes it seem it's all about the oil.

The point is that the ability of the US to refinance its debt and support the massive consumption levels of the American people through cheap imports and massive trade deficits rely on a healthy global demand for the USD. The Us is now a massive producer of oil, but it is not a massive net exporter of it, because it consumes a lot. So, when the big net exporters of oil decide to accept other things in payment in lieu of the USD it inevitably has a depressing effect on the global demand for the dollar. reply JumpCrisscross 16 hours agorootparent> it is not a massive net exporter of it, because it consumes a lot Wrong [1].

The US can and does refine light, sweet crude. It wouldn't be a massive effort for more US refineries currently set to handle heavier and more sour crude to switch to it. More and more refineries have been making the switch especially since the time WTI went so low it went negative. Most of the rest of the world has a harder time processing heavier and more sour oils. The US led the world in refining technologies, so we have the knowledge and equipment to refine it. This is partially due to the US being so involved in Venezuela's oil industry growth, the US essentially built the refining technology to make Venezuela's oil filds useful and why they were so crushed when relations with the US went bad. Few other refiners are set up to process Venezuela's oil. So, it makes sense we buy the cheaper stuff we can easily process and sell the easy to process more expensive stuff on the world market. Cheaper refined products for us and we make more profit selling the easier stuff. You're still just wrong stating \"The US is unable to refine the oil it produces\".

Oil has been bought in every currency on the planet for a very long time. The dollar clearing system is a transit route, not necessarily a destination. Buyers buys things with the currency they have, and sellers end up holding the currency they want to hold. Those involved in FX make a turn causing that match to happen. Otherwise the transaction never happens in the first place.

The US dollar used to be backed by gold, then Nixon ended that and then it got tied to oil, so in effect it was still backed by something tangible.

Martin Inspiring Lunatics, Tainting Meats Skip to content Personal Game Design Projects Publications ← Easy Quantum Entanglement: Simplest Description Of A Classically Impossible Result How I Found A 55 Year Old Bug In The First Lunar Lander Game Posted on June 14, 2024 by martincmartin Just months after Neil Armstrong’s historic moonwalk, Jim Storer, a Lexington High School student in Massachusetts, wrote the first Lunar Landing game. By 1973, it had become “by far and away the single most popular computer game.” A simple text game, you pilot a moon lander, aiming for a gentle touch down on the moon. All motion is vertical and you decide every 10 simulated seconds how much fuel to burn. I recently explored the optimal fuel burn schedule to land as gently as possible and with maximum remaining fuel. Surprisingly, the theoretical best strategy didn’t work. The game falsely thinks the lander doesn’t touch down on the surface when in fact it does. Digging in, I was amazed by the sophisticated physics and numerical computing in the game. Eventually I found a bug: a missing “divide by two” that had seemingly gone unnoticed for nearly 55 years. Landing with Maximum Fuel To use the least fuel while landing, you need to land in the shortest time possible. Initially you maximize your speed by keeping your engine off, then at the last possible second you burn full throttle, reducing your speed to zero just as you touch the surface. The Kerbal Space Program community calls this a “suicide burn”, since getting the timing right is hard and it leaves no room for error. With some trial and error and a bit of (manual) binary search, you can find the schedule that just barely has you landing. You burn nothing for 70 seconds, then 164.31426784 lbs/sec for the next 10 seconds, then the max 200 lbs/sec after that: The game considers a perfect landing to be less than 1 MPH, but here we land at over 3.5 MPH and are told we “could be better.” Yet burn even 0.00000001 more lbs/sec, and you miss the surface entirely, ascending at 114 MPH: How did we go from a hard landing to not landing at all, without a soft landing in between? Physics Simulation: One Smart Kid I expected to see the simple Euler integration that’s common in video games even today. That’s where you compute the forces at the start of each time step, then use F=ma to compute the acceleration, then assume the acceleration is constant over a time step of seconds: Because the mass is changing over the timestep, the acceleration will change too, so assuming it’s constant is only approximate. But surprisingly, Jim used the exact solution, the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation, with a Taylor series expansion for the logarithm. He also used some algebra to simplify it and reduce the amount of round off error. Very impressive for a high school senior in 1969. When I asked him about it: “I was skilled at calculus at the time and familiar with concepts like a Taylor series, but also my recollection is that my father, who was a physicist, helped me in the derivation of the equations.” – Jim Storer, personal communication The rocket equation is what gives rise to the suicide burn being optimal, and the five terms he uses of the Taylor series, where the argument is at most 0.1212, makes it accurate to over six decimal places. So that’s not the problem we’re looking for. Assumptions Go Out The Window When We Hit The Ground The rocket equation works well until you hit the ground. In general, collisions between solid objects is a really hard part of dynamics engines, and what separates the great ones from the good ones, as I discovered when contributing to Open Dynamics Engine as a postdoc at MIT. And this is where the Lunar Landing Game faces its biggest challenge. Imagine the lander descending at the start of a 10-second turn but ascending by the end. Simply verifying that it’s above the surface at both points isn’t enough. It might have dipped below the surface somewhere in between. When this happens, the program has to rewind and examine an earlier moment. An obvious place is to look at the lowest point of the trajectory, where the velocity is zero. For the rocket equation, it turns out, there’s no closed form expression for that lowest point that involves only basic mathematical functions.1 So instead, we can use the physicists favourite technique, and take only the first few terms of the Taylor series. If you use only the first two terms of the logarithm, the problem simplifies to a quadratic equation and you can use the good old quadratic formula from high school. And the approximation should be pretty good over the space of a 10 second turn, accurate to within 0.1% or so. But that’s not what Jim did. His formula has a square root in the denominator, not the numerator. It also had an error 30 times bigger. How To Know When You’ve Hit Rock Bottom What could he possibly be doing? I stared at this for a long time, wracking my brain for any other approach to approximate the bottom of the trajectory that would still only use addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root. Taking only the first term of the logarithm would give an approximation worse than the quadratic, but wouldn’t involve a square root. Taking a third term and we need to solve a cubic, which in general would need a lot more code and in our case it doesn’t seem to be of any special form that has a simple solution2. There are many approximations to , but the non-Taylor ones involve advanced functions like that are hard to invert. Until I looked a little more closely at his square root. It’s of the form: Which looks a awful lot like the quadratic formula where we’ve divided by 4 inside the square root. It has to be related. But why is it in the denominator? Did he find a quadratic in ? No, because t can be very close to zero, so his formula would need to be approximated over a wide range of very large values, and a quadratic isn’t good for that. Did he make a quadratic approximation to log, then substitute , solve for T, then substitute back? Playing around with that, I re-discovered an alternate form of the quadratic formula with the square root on the bottom! And indeed, this matches the formula in Jim’s code. I don’t know why 18 year old Jim was using the alternate form. Perhaps he re-derived the quadratic formula rather than looking it up, and ended up deriving that form. Perhaps he was worried about catastrophic cancellation and wanted a form where he’d add positive numbers, rather than subtract them.3 Let’s Double Check The Derivation But if his formula is equivalent, then why is the approximation error 30 times higher? Deriving the formula ourselves, we get: Which is identical to Jim’s code, except … he’s missing the 2 in the denominator inside the square root! It was probably a simple error, either when deriving the formula or typing it into the computer. After all, the computer algebra system MACSYMA had only started a year before, and wouldn’t be available at a high school, so he would have had to do everything using pencil and paper. With this bug, he consistently underestimates the time to the lowest point. He compensates for this two ways: adding 0.05 sec, and then re-estimating from his new, closer location. And this explains why it misses the time of landing: the first estimate is while the lander is above the surface and still descending, then the second one is after reaching the bottom and ascending again, which takes less than 0.05 sec. If we add the missing factor of two and remove the 0.05, what happens? Now the best we can do with a suicide burn is: Our velocity is down to 1.66 MPH, almost three quarters of the way to the perfect landing at 1 MPH. It’s not perfect because w’re still only using the first two terms of the Taylor series. Also, once you’ve decided your lowest point is under the surface, you then need to find the time where you first hit the surface, which involves a similar approximation. Another iteration would help, although with the bug fixed we overestimate the time, so we’d need to go back in time, which might mean we have to pick the other solution to the quadratic. You could simplify that by using only a single term from the Taylor series, and is what’s done in Newton’s method. You could then stop when the magnitude of the velocity is below some threshold, and use the altitude there to decide whether or not you landed. But this is all more work, and the game was fun to play as it is, so why complicate the code? It’s also possible to land gently, you just need to end your 14th turn with a low altitude and velocity, and then use low thrust in your 15th turn, landing somewhere after 150 seconds. It’s just the theoretical full-thrust-on-landing suicide burn, that takes around 148 seconds, that eludes us. CAPCOM We’re Go For Powered Descent Overall, this is very impressive work for an 18 year hold high school student in 1969 on a PDP-8. This was long before Computer Science was taught in high school. The numerical computing aspects, such as iteratively improving the estimate using Newton’s method or worrying about catastrophic cancellation, weren’t well known back then. I didn’t learn them until I was studying for a Ph.D. in robotics. It is also surprising that, as far as I can tell, this bug has been there for almost 55 years and nobody has noticed it before. That’s probably because, even with the bug, it was a fun game, both difficult and possible to land gently. The quest to not just win, but find the optimal strategy, can certainly lead to trying to understand small discrepancies. I suspect everybody else was just happy to play the game and have fun. It needs the Lambert W, the inverse of ↩︎ For example, , where the 2nd and 3rd coefficients have the same magnitude but different sign, can be factored in the form , which has solution ↩︎ This doesn’t seem likely, as this is a rather advanced topic for a High School senior in 1969. Plus the alternate form wasn’t well known, and anyway, the errors from cancellation are much smaller than errors from only taking two terms of the Taylor series. ↩︎ Share this: Twitter Facebook Like Loading...

He later provided the source code, which was awesome. https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html My favorite part is this: “After leaving high school I never thought about the game again,” says Storer. “Until about a couple of months ago when someone e-mailed me about this, I was completely unaware of any Lunar Lander game other than the one I wrote in high school.” reply acyou 2 hours agoparentWow, that is a great article.

In the interview in TFA with the game's author he mentions being skilled at calculus--seems to me that if you were interested in space/rocketry/etc. and had the aptitude it makes sense that you'd try your hand at programming a lunar landing game.

Growing up in the Space Age probably was inspirational, but that doesn't change the fact that computers basically didn't exist to the general public at that time. Unlike now, software development wasn't a widely known career. There wasn't a CS major in the US until 1962. I think that makes it pretty notable he was a high school senior in 1969. reply schiffern 2 hours agorootparentEDIT Personally, for clarification, I do think the code is impressive, but the above back-and-forth doesn't really explain why. --- That explanation still wouldn't mean support the assertion that writing the lander game is the part that's \"impressive for a high school senior in 1967.\" If anything, all this explanation would show is that their having access to a computer is the \"impressive\" part. reply Closi 2 hours agorootparentIt needs access to a computer, creativity, and an impressive amount of capability for a high school senior.

In my mid 20s I read Karl Popper's Conjectures and Refutations and realized I'd reached the falsification pathway to epistemology as a teenager. But was I a genius or was I just lucky to be born in this age where the soup of concepts we're bathed in makes that obvious? I think the latter. Same with Goldbach's Conjecture, I came up with an equivalent conjecture as a pre-teen. Evidence since has shown I'm reasonably intelligent but not the Popper or Goldbach or even the Walter Bright of our times.

In a good size city with a major engineering university and a large high school the main barrier was access to computers. Our school had teletypes connected to a remote mainframe. My friends and I found a few computers at the university we could use at night, but most had card readers and line printers, and none had graphics terminals of any kind. I think the particular combination of skills, interest, and access would have been pretty rare at the time. reply phkahler 5 hours agoparentprevI needed to know what language that is written in.

Wikipedia on FOCAL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language) reply martincmartin 5 hours agorootparentOP here. One interesting thing about FOCAL is that * has higher precedence than /. So in Lunar Lander, M*G/Z*K is what mathematicians and other languages would write M*G/(Z*K). I did a double take when I first saw that. :) As the Wikipedia article says, \"This can cause subtle errors when converting FOCAL source code to other systems.\" Also, the IF syntax is a little limiting and hard to read, although I suppose programmers would get used to it. reply jprete 4 hours agorootparentThat's surprising from today's perspective, but when I imagine the thought process, it seems reasonable, especially for math and science purposes where multiplication and division operators usually get grouped into a series of multiplications above the division bar, and a series of multiplications below it. reply martincmartin 3 hours agorootparentTrue. + also has higher precedence than -, so that a - b + c means a - (b + c). reply MarkusQ 1 hour agorootparentAh, the old My Dear Aunt Sally vs. My Dear Aunt Sally debate. :) reply omoikane 1 hour agorootparentprevAnother curious feature is that the labels appears to be floating point, as in \"G 5.9\" appears to transfer control to line starting at \"05.90\". reply pbhjpbhj 4 hours agorootparentprevYour code got munged, use backslash to escape * (otherwise it starts a span of italicised text), or use four leading blanks for code blocks (in which escaping is usually not needed): M*G/Z*K I think you meant, the above and M*G/(Z*K) respectively. reply martincmartin 4 hours agorootparentThanks.

OP here. I see your point. But think of what's needed to create this game: - From high school physics, you know to start with a free body diagram. There are two forces, gravity and thrust. So far, your average high school student with an A in physics should be able to do that. - Gravity depends on the distance to the center, which of course is changing, that's the whole point of a lander. I mean, you start 120 miles up. You have to realize it doesn't change much, so can be approximated as a constant. But you've been exposed to that in physics class, so maybe you just assume it's a constant. - How the hell does thrust work as a function of burn rate? Is the exhaust velocity higher when you burn more? In other words, considering 100 lbs/sec vs 200 lbs/sec, when you double the flow of fuel into the engine, and then you burn it, it turns into twice as much fuel in the same volume. Wouldn't it be forced out at twice the speed? Or at least a higher speed? Maybe you think of the universal gas law, PV=nRT. The volume is constant (the volume of the engine), n is doubled, R is a universal constant. So that means P or T changes, or both. Why is T, which is a function of the velocity of the molecules, constant why P is doubled? Why don't both change? - So you talk to your Dad, who happens to be a physicist. Most high school students, even those getting an A in physics, don't have a physicist for a father who can look up the properties of rocket engines and find the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation. So a high school senior finding the rocket equation is impressive to me. - To go from velocity to position, you need to integrate. I'm not sure your average A physics senior would think of replace the FLOG() call with a Taylor series and integrating it term by term. - How many terms of the Taylor series do you need? Does it even converge for you? If he thought of these subtleties, that's impressive. But it's possible that young Jim didn't realize these issues and just uses 5 terms because that seemed like a lot of terms. - So now you can simulate it in near the moon. Cool! But how do you detect when it hits the ground? You could try to solve for altitude equals zero, and see if there are zero or more solutions. But even if there are solutions, they might be in the past or the future. So instead you decide to look where the velocity is zero, since you know this happens exactly once during the turn. I think that shows some ingenuity there, although I don't know if that was 18 year old Jim's thought process. - So you try to invert the rocket equation: given a desired delta-V, how much fuel do you need to burn to achieve it? If you try this with pencil and paper and high school math, including Calculus, you keep getting stuck. You don't have the tools to show that it's actually impossible and needs you to introduce a new function, the Lambert W. - So maybe you give up, or maybe your physicist Dad helps you again. Using your Taylor series, you now have to solve a 5th degree polynomial. So you decide to scrap the 3rd, 4th and 5th term to get yourself a quadratic. Why is it ok to scrap these now, when it wasn't ok when computing the regular dynamics? I'm impressed that he realized he can use different levels of approximation in different circumstances, without it generating some inconsistencies or other problems. - You somehow figure out how to use the alternate form of the quadratic equation, which means you didn't just look it up and type it in. Possibly impressive. reply hyperthesis 2 hours agoparentprevThough famous as the first lunar lander game, the impressive part was the specific numerical techniques used. reply martincmartin 1 hour agorootparentOP here. Yes, that's what I meant. Using the rocket equation, truncated Taylor series approximation, truncating even more to make things solvable, then iterating to improve the solution, were all things I wouldn't have expected. reply sema4hacker 3 hours agoprevIn the mid 70's I wrote a 2D vector graphics moon lander game for the Adage graphics terminal. You came in fast horizontally and had to use push buttons for the LEM side thrusters and main engine to slow down and land horizontally, resulting in either a crater if you were too fast, or if you ran out of fuel, otherwise you saw one or more planted American flags depending on the quality of the landing. Years ago I threw out my only copy of the source code, thinking it had no value and would never be re-used, something I regretted later when I realized how early a graphics game it was historically, and how easily it could have beeen resurrected with a simple emulation. reply schiffern 2 hours agoprev>It’s also possible to land gently, you just need to end your 14th turn with a low altitude and velocity, and then use low thrust in your 15th turn, landing somewhere after 150 seconds. It’s just the theoretical full-thrust-on-landing suicide burn, that takes around 148 seconds, that eludes us. I expect the fuel-optimal soft landing strategy (ignored because it doesn't fit the exact form of a \"suicide burn\") would be to play 164.31426784 lbs/second at t=70 seconds, and then replace one of the subsequent 200 lbs/second inputs with 199.99999999 lbs/second. The earlier you \"play\" 199.99999999 the better, so just use exhaustive search and select the earliest play that still achieve a soft landing. reply martincmartin 2 hours agoparentThe nature of the bug is that it has trouble finding when the lander has touched the surface. You need to have an altitude of less than zero for around 0.05 seconds for the game to notice that you've landed. If your thrust during that time is 200 or 199, to have an altitudeBy 1973, it had become “by far and away the single most popular computer game.” On Lunar Lander and bugs: my first programming book had a version of this game in Basic that I never got to run correctly. 25 years later I came back to it and I was surprised at the ridiculous amount of bugs it had and the convoluted logic (\"440 IFGOTO 450\"). I eventually rewrote it as an adult [1] but young me stood no chance. And to this day I wonder what happened inside that forgotten Spanish editorial that turned (almost) working code into whatever made it to the final version. [1] https://7c0h.com/blog/new/moon_landing_in_basic.html reply darknavi 4 hours agoparentProbably copy/paste errors (in editorial) mixed with deadlines mixed with no QA. reply yourapostasy 4 hours agoparentprevOy vey, \"no chance\" is putting it lightly. A lot of this BASIC code had roots in the 1960's-70's. Back then, editors ruled the roost of print magazines where this code often showed up within, and in books of collections of code they especially ruled with an iron fist. There was little notion that source code had to be dropped in verbatim with absolutely zero changes, so editors would make \"judicious\" changes in the source code. They thought they were \"helping\" with \"obvious\" typographical and editorial decisions. This lesson was slowly, painfully learned until material improvements across the industry started to take hold starting in the 1980's and realization that source code shouldn't be touched in print really began to permeate the print industry. Though sometimes I wonder if this dynamic spurred the rise of BBS' and helped loosen the stranglehold print media had upon source code distribution, and what an alternative timeline might have looked like if the ones in power in print media were more open to \"outsiders\" having absolute control over some portion of \"their\" content. I learned all the above decades later after I first started playing around with coding as a child, from talking with a much older friend who rose up from within the print media world and saw what happened. When I was a child, with zero adult guidance, and only a handful of books from the school and community library about programming, it was a wonder I stuck with coding at all with the countless programs I typed in by hand from print media that were similarly riddled with errors, so your reminiscing brought back powerful memories. reply readingnews 35 minutes agoprevI still have a roll of punch tape, I think for a PDP11, that says \"Lunar Lander\" on it, and I have no idea who to give it to. reply zug_zug 5 hours agoprevIt's interesting. The naive way to write this would be not use any special formulas, and just recalculate mass and acceleration each frame (based on the new mass). And to calculate intersection with the ground at each frame boundary. I guess the idea is that the lower your frame-rate, the less accurate this approach is, or maybe the idea is it's fun to use the actual equations. I'm curious how perceptible the difference is between the two at the original framerate. reply moconnor 5 hours agoparentThere wasn't any graphical output or any frame rate to speak of in the sense you are thinking. The output would appear printed, like this: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander/... Only updating the mass/acceleration at ten-second intervals would be wildly incorrect! reply vlovich123 2 hours agorootparentJust because your displaying results in 10s increments doesn’t mean anything about the simulation frame rate. You could still simulation 10k frames at 1ms granularity between the results printed each ms. The challenge is computational for a 1960s machine and a closed form solution is sensible here for that reason. reply zug_zug 5 hours agorootparentprevOh, thanks. There was an arcade game called Lunar Lander and I thought that this was the exact same thing, and I guess I didn't pay much attention to the pictures. reply martincmartin 5 hours agoparentprevOP here (of this blog post, not the original game). The naive way is what I expected too, and described as the Euler method in the post. In terms of physical accuracy, especially when you get near the surface, the mass does change significantly if you have a high rate of fuel burn. But in terms of how challenging/fun it would be, and what strategies you use as a player, I doubt it would make much difference. In fact, there are other lunar lander simulations in the BASIC computer games book, I think one of them does use the naive approach. If 10 seconds is too long, you could still leave that as the turn in the UI, but internally break each turn into a bunch of smaller time steps, e.g. 10 time steps of 1 second each. Actually, the existing game does that in certain places, which is why his physics simulation takes in an arbitrary time S rather than always the full 10 seconds. reply fl7305 49 minutes agoprevI played the ABC-80 version of Lunar Lander way back then. Checking today, it seems to use a simpler Euler integration instead, and a curious value for G (?) reply dn3500 4 hours agoprevI was confused for a minute because I remember playing Spacewar on a PDP-1 in the 1960s and mis-remembered there also being a lander game. But there wasn't, Storer was the first. There is an interesting history here: https://www.acriticalhit.com/moonlander-one-giant-leap-for-g... reply csa 1 hour agoprevOh, fond memories. I learned BASIC programming when I was 11 in 1981 (I think that’s right) at a summer computer camp on an Apple II. I made a simplified version of lunar lander… it was ridiculously fun to make and play. One of my cohort mates who was in the “advanced” Pascal class is still my friend to this day. reply martincmartin 1 hour agoparentOP here. Cool! I was born in 1969, less than a month before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, and was only a few months old when this game was written. I too learned BASIC, then spent hours pouring over the book \"BASIC Computer Games\", before I even had a computer of my own. Fond memories, as you say. reply schiffern 3 hours agoprev>The rocket equation is what gives rise to the suicide burn being optimal Nitpick, but this isn't strictly true. Even if you don't count the vehicle getting lighter as it burns fuel (which is all the rocket equation does here), a suicide burn will still be optimal. The real reason is because a suicide burn minimizes gravity loss. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_loss reply martincmartin 2 hours agoparentOP here. True, I oversimplified. What I meant was, there are two parts to the dynamics, the rocket equation and gravity. They add linearly, so any extra velocity that comes from gravity needs to be eliminated by increasing the delta V from the rocket equation. The gravity delta V is just acceleration of gravity times time, so you want to minimize the time. Surprisingly (to me), in the rocket equation, it doesn't matter how long it takes, or what sequence of burns you use, or whether you burn at a constant rate all the way through vs short strong bursts, etc. So to land with zero velocity using the least fuel, you just need to land in the shortest amount of time. reply methuselah_in 2 hours agoprevThat's why old people manage to create such great things. Writing game damn reply TheRealPomax 2 hours agoparent...what? The game was made by a teenager. The only reason they're now old is because 55 years have passed. reply Kiro 2 hours agoprevSurely the game must have hundreds of bugs like any other game. reply qup 2 hours agoparentGiven the simplistic nature of the game, I'm not convinced. reply TheRealPomax 1 hour agoparentprevWhy? This is from a time when there weren't any \"other games\". Heck, there were no computer games, period: there were only applications that could be described as \"a sort of game on the computer\" but only in the sense that you were asked to perform a task, tell the application what you though the task parameters should be, and then the application told you whether you were right. Applications were also still measured in bytes (the idea of the average program being so large that everything needed to be described in kilobytes was still in its infancy). So you literally didn't have enough space to hide 100 bugs that would linger unnoticed for 55 years: 100 bugs would be your entire source code. In fact, here's the source code for the game in the article: https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander/... - it's 2027 bytes. If it had 100 bugs, or even 5, it either wouldn't run, or it would be obviously wrong. And that source code also illustrates the kind of \"game\" this is: it's just a text prompt to get you to fill in the values that set up the flight, and then it runs a simulation with your parameters and spits out the result. That was enough to constitute a game people would play religiously, back in the day.

    "originBody": "Fungus breaks down ocean plastic Publication date: Monday 03 June 2024 A fungus living in the sea can break down the plastic polyethylene, provided it has first been exposed to UV radiation from sunlight. Researchers from, among others, NIOZ published their results in the scientific journal Science of the Total Environment. They expect that many more plastic degrading fungi are living in deeper parts of the ocean. The fungus Parengyodontium album lives together with other marine microbes in thin layers on plastic litter in the ocean. Marine microbiologists from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (NIOZ) discovered that the fungus is capable of breaking down particles of the plastic polyethylene (PE), the most abundant of all plastics that have ended up in the ocean. The NIOZ researchers cooperated with colleagues from Utrecht University, the Ocean Cleanup Foundation and research institutes in Paris, Copenhagen and St Gallen, Switzerland. The finding allows the fungus to join a very short list of plastic-degrading marine fungi: only four species have been found to date. A larger number of bacteria was already known to be able to degrade plastic. Follow the degradation process accurately The researchers went to find the plastic degrading microbes in the hotspots of plastic pollution in the North Pacific Ocean. From the plastic litter collected, they isolated the marine fungus by growing it in the laboratory, on special plastics that contain labelled carbon. Lead author Annika Vaksmaa of NIOZ: \"These so-called 13C isotopes remain traceable in the food chain. It is like a tag that enables us to follow where the carbon goes. We can then trace it in the degradation products.” Vaksmaa is thrilled about the new finding: “What makes this research scientifically outstanding, is that we can quantify the degradation process.” In the laboratory, Vaksmaa and her team observed that the breakdown of PE by P. album occurs at a rate of about 0.05 per cent per day. \"Our measurements also showed that the fungus doesn’t use much of the carbon coming from the PE when breaking it down. Most of the PE that P. album uses is converted into carbon dioxide, which the fungus excretes again.” AltThough CO2 is a greenhouse gas, this process is not something that might pose a new problem: the amount released by fungi is the same as the low amount humans release while breathing. Only under the influence of UV The presence of sunlight is essential for the fungus to use PE as an energy source, the researchers found. Vaksmaa: “In the lab, P. album only breaks down PE that has been exposed to UV-light at least for a short period of time. That means that in the ocean, the fungus can only degrade plastic that has been floating near the surface initially,” explains Vaksmaa. “It was already known that UV-light breaks down plastic by itself mechanically, but our results show that it also facilitates the biological plastic breakdown by marine fungi.” Other fungi out there As a large amount of different plastics sink into deeper layers before it is exposed to sunlight, P.album will not be able to break them all down. Vaksmaa expects that there are other, yet unknown, fungi out there that are degrading plastic as well, in deeper parts of the ocean. “Marine fungi can break down complex materials made of carbon. There are numerous amounts of marine fungi, so it is likely that in addition to the four species identified so far, other species also contribute to plastic degradation. There are still many questions about the dynamics of how plastic degradation takes place in deeper layers,\" says Vaksmaa. Plastic soup Finding plastic-degrading organisms is urgent. Every year, humans produce more than 400 billion kilograms of plastic, and this is expected to have at least triple by the year 2060. Much of the plastic waste ends up in the sea: from the poles to the tropics, it floats around in surface waters, reaches greater depths at sea and eventually falls down on the seafloor. Vaksmaa: “Large amounts of plastics end up in subtropical gyres, ring-shaped currents in oceans in which seawater is almost stationary. That means once the plastic has been carried there, it gets trapped there. Some 80 million kilograms of floating plastic have already accumulated in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in the Pacific Ocean alone, which is only one of the six large gyres worldwide.” Schimmel breekt oceaanplastic af Een schimmel die in de zee voorkomt, kan de plasticsoort polyethyleen afbreken nadat dit is blootgesteld aan UV-straling uit zonlicht. Dat blijkt uit onderzoek van onderzoekers van onder andere het NIOZ, dat is gepubliceerd in het tijdschrift Science of the Total Environment. De onderzoekers verwachten dat er nog veel meer plastic afbrekende schimmels leven in diepere delen van de oceaan. De schimmel Parengyodontium album leeft samen met andere micro-organismen in dunne laagjes op plastic afval in de oceaan. Mariene microbiologen van het Koninklijk Nederlands Instituut voor Onderzoek der Zee (NIOZ) ontdekten dat de schimmel in staat is om deeltjes van het plastic polyethyleen (PE) af te breken, de meest voorkomende plastic van alle soorten die in de oceaan terecht zijn gekomen. De onderzoekers van het NIOZ werkten samen met collega’s van de Universiteit Utrecht, de stichting Ocean Cleanup en onderzoeksinstituten in Parijs, Kopenhagen en St. Gallen, Zwitserland. Deze soort schaart zich in een erg kort rijtje van plastic-afbrekende zeeschimmels: tot op heden zijn er pas vier soorten met deze eigenschap gevonden. Van een groter aantal bacteriën is al wel bekend dat ze plastic kunnen afbreken. Afbraakproces nauwkeurig volgen De onderzoekers gingen op zoek naar de plastic-afbrekende microben in de gyre in de Noordelijke Stille Oceaan, een ringvormige zeestroming waarbinnen het water bijna stilstaat. Uit het verzamelde plastic afval isoleerden ze de zeeschimmel door die in het laboratorium te kweken op speciaal plastic dat gelabelde koolstof bevat. Hoofdonderzoeker Annika Vaksmaa van het NIOZ legt uit: \"Deze zogenaamde 13C-isotopen blijven traceerbaar in de voedselketen. Het is als een label waarmee we kunnen volgen waar de koolstof naartoe gaat. Vervolgens kunnen we het traceren in de afbraakproducten.\" Vaksmaa is enthousiast over de nieuwe vondst: \"Wat dit onderzoek wetenschappelijk interessant maakt, is dat we het afbraakproces kunnen kwantificeren.” In het laboratorium zagen Vaksmaa en haar collega’s dat P. Album het plastic PE afbrak met een snelheid van 0,05% per dag. “Bij het afbreken van PE komt koolstof vrij, maar onze metingen laten zien dat de schimmel daar zelf maar weinig van gebruikt. Het merendeel wordt door de schimmel omgezet naar CO2 en vervolgens weer uitgestoten.” CO2 is natuurlijk een broeikasgas is, maar de hoeveelheid die de schimmel uitstoot is maar heel klein, vergelijkbaar met wat mensen uitademen. Er wordt dus niet door de afbraak van plastic weer een nieuw probleem gecreëerd. Alleen onder invloed van UV De aanwezigheid van zonlicht is essentieel voor de schimmel om PE als energiebron te gebruiken, ontdekten de onderzoekers. Vaksmaa: \"In het lab breekt P. album alleen PE af dat in elk geval voor een korte tijd is blootgesteld aan UV-licht. Dat betekent dat de schimmel in de oceaan alleen plastic kan afbreken als dat eerst dicht onder het oppervlak drijft. Het was al bekend dat UV-licht plastic zelf mechanisch afbreekt, maar onze resultaten laten zien dat dat op zijn beurt de biologische plasticafbraak door zeeschimmels makkelijker maakt.\" Andere schimmels vinden Omdat een grote hoeveelheid kunststoffen in de zee al naar diepere lagen zinkt voordat het aan zonlicht wordt blootgesteld, zal P.album niet in staat zijn om ze allemaal af te breken. Vaksmaa verwacht dat er andere, nog onbekende, schimmels zijn die plastic afbreken, dieper in de oceaan. \"Zeeschimmels kunnen complexe materialen van koolstof afbreken. Er zijn talloze zeeschimmels, dus het is waarschijnlijk dat naast de vier tot nu toe geïdentificeerde soorten ook andere zeeschimmels plastic afbreken. Er is nog veel wat we niet weten over hoe plastic-afbraak in diepere lagen plaatsvindt\", zegt Vaksmaa. Plasticsoep Het is dringend nodig om organismen te vinden die plastic afbreken. Elk jaar produceert de mens meer dan 400 miljard kilo plastic en de verwachting is dat dit tegen het jaar 2060 minstens verdrievoudigd zal zijn. Veel van het plastic afval komt in zee terecht: van de polen tot de tropen drijft het rond in het oppervlaktewater, bereikt grotere diepten in zee en komt uiteindelijk ook op de zeebodem. Vaksmaa: \"Grote hoeveelheden plastic komen terecht in subtropische gyres. Als het plastic die gyres eenmaal heeft bereikt, komt het vast te zitten. Zo'n 80 miljoen kilo drijvend plastic heeft zich alleen al opgehoopt in de North Pacific Subtropical Gyre in de Stille Oceaan, slechts één van de zes grote gyres wereldwijd.\"",

A whole suite of enzymes and associated compounds are released into the extracellular environment by these fungi, including hydrogen peroxide, some of which is decomposed to highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals.

We have a lot of defenses to make sure large molecules don't make it into the bloodstream so if those polymers start making it through, we'd have much bigger problems. Microplastics are a special case because they're very chemically inert, but they're still filtered out by the kidneys. Any cellulose or lignin would be too. To be honest, after reading some of these microplastics papers I'm starting to suspect most of them are bullshit. Plastics are everywhere in a modern lab and rarely do these papers have proper controls, which I suspect would show that there is a baseline level of microplastic contamination in labs that is unavoidable. Petri dishes, pipettes, microplates, EVERYTHING is plastic, packaged in plastic, and cleaned using plastic tools, all by people wearing tons of synthetic fibers. We went through this same nonsense when genetic sequencers first became available until people got it into their heads that DNA contamination was everywhere and that we had to be really careful with sample collection and statistical methods. > One of the most lethal professions of old was baker, because of all the flour dust inhaled.

The golden age of plastic that we live in allows for food packaging that cannot be penetrated by microorganisms, which in turn increases shelf life of some produce from like half a week to multiple weeks.

And plastic is in essence a multi-step “life process” of crude oil: Instead of incinerating heating oil for our houses, plastic lives a first life as packaging, and then gets incinerated and provides heat over communal heating – ideally.

And that does not take into account all the plastics trash that gets shipped overseas to some piss poor Asian or African country, where it gets sorted, and all the refuse just gets dumped on some landfill where it eventually gets washed into the ocean by rainfall, or it gets incinerated where it creates absurdly toxic combustion products. reply quonn 8 hours agoparentprev> gets incinerated and provides heat over communal heating – ideally.

Well made and managed landfills are also perfectly capable of dealing with human waste, but they are a long term project, and there's a lot of time for a dumb management or politician to decide you don't need to fund it as well and now a hundred years of hard work to protect the environment goes down the drain when your now improperly managed landfill is basically a superfund site.

Just plants use C02 + H20 + sunlight in photosynthesis to convert it into O2 + glucose. If we could break down the molecules ourselves we would have done it already, but it's not easy to do that.

So you wouldn't call it an \"abuse\" in this case. reply tredigi 12 hours agorootparentJust because a fungus eventually breaks it down doesn't imply that it's \"harmless\". It can (and does) still accumulate in organisms and has many undesirable effects, including the human body.

Large companies rarely actually care about the environmental effects when they have a cheaper alternative. I think many underestimate the influence consumers can have on the manufacturers. In some product categories, they have an option to choose a better alternative. If more did that, the manufacturers in other industries would see that there is a first mover advantage where they can grow their market share by reducing plastic usage. More R&D would be spent finding alternatives and the world as a whole would be improved. But it all starts with us choosing alternatives whenever possible.

Right now the tire manufacturers don't have any incentive because there's no financial benefit. Even though consumers don't have a choice when they buy tires today, other products have cleaner alternatives. If I was a manufacturer of tires and saw consumers consistently choosing cleaner products when possible, I would have an incentive to see if I could reduce the pollution, because I would gain market share. The first manufacturer would sell more tires and others would need to follow. Not enough consumers make this choice today to make up the cost of new technologies. reply alt227 8 hours agorootparentTheres no need for R&D.

Better regulation would force the manufacturers to spend R&D on alternatives and push down the prices so that the rest of the world can also afford a cleaner alternative. Even if that takes time, we would at least have a huge reduction until we have the right tech at an affordable price for the developing world. The world is a huge place and many countries will never have good regulations due to corruption/lobbyists and continue to pollute. The only way I see regulations would work is if the first world governments, which are the largest consumers, were willing to impose import restrictions, but that would go against the ideology behind the global market. It would also risk retaliation where the affected country could block exports of rare earth minerals and other critical resources. The US market is one of the largest influencers, and would need to get on board. I'm not an American, but given the political climate in the US right now I doubt they could regulate it effectively. reply throwaway48476 12 hours agorootparentprevMost people fail to understand how useful plastic is because they never lived in a time before plastics. reply littlestymaar 11 hours agorootparent“most people fail to understand how useful leaded gasoline is because they never lived in a time without it” reply _flux 10 hours agorootparentAs I understand it, lead in gasoline was used for motor longetivity, but other approaches have been invented to reduce pollution.

What would that kind of legislation look like? It would be bound be huge, have negative non-intended consequences, and loopholes. Maybe a global plastic tax could function as a guiding force, but even that has the negative consequence increasing the costs of stuff that just doesn't have alternatives. It would funnel money towards developing plastic-free products. But getting everyone onboard with that is difficult—and I presume it's difficult to put a fair plastic tax for imported products. reply throwaway48476 9 hours agorootparentprevThe problem is plastic is not one thing but an entire category of materials. There are plenty of places plastics can be designed out but there's also an awful lot where it's never going to be possible to replace. For example operating rooms have huge trash bins because everything comes plastic wrapped for sterility. reply mattkrause 3 hours agorootparentEven in ORs, there are options for using less plastic use. For example, drapes can be single-use (paper-lined plastic in a plastic pouch) or fabric (wrapped in more fabric and autoclaved).

Tetra-Ethyl lead as a fuel additive, primarily for octane boosting, was invented as a \"cheaper alternative\" to what would normally be used to boost octane: Ethanol. Surely for only coincidental reasons, having a chemical product that they could patent and prevent anyone else from manufacturing made them a whole lot more money than using Ethanol which anyone could make and market and compete. Leaded gas was a fucking profit motivated thing. The point of us putting ethanol in gas is multifaceted, but not even remotely about climate change: The octane booster we used after we removed was MTBE. MTBE had a problem where it would constantly leak out of fuel storage and poison families, cause birth defects, you know, toxic shit. So we FINALLY just said fuck it, put ethanol in gas like we should have been doing since the 20s. Other effects it had: Immediately reduce US gasoline usage by 10%.

The same government that makes incentives that added all that extra driving, transportation, storage, packaging, etc to the \"natural food\" because they think farming and storing livestock within X-feet of a people-zoned area is dangerous and shouldn't be allowed. Next they complain \"oh lets fix these food islands that we created in the first place\" or \"oh please let us regulate these evil companies that use so much bad plastic packaging because we told them not to sell food that \"might\" be off after expiry so they have to use plastic and other such devices to sell you absolutely pristine and non-contaminated food\".

    "originBody": "RETAIL·IKEA Ikea’s boss solved the Swedish retailer’s global ‘unhappy worker’ crisis by raising salaries, introducing flexible working and subsidizing childcare BYMATTHEW BOYLE AND BLOOMBERG Ikea store workers have been striking to demand higher wages. SEBASTIAN GOLLNOW—PICTURE ALLIANCE/GETTY IMAGES Ikea’s workers were quitting in droves in the US. In the UK and Ireland, half of all new hires were leaving before their first anniversary. Globally, each departure cost Ikea $5,000 or more to replace. To stem the bleeding, the Swedish furniture behemoth needed to figure out what was making its store workers so unhappy — and fix it fast. By 2022, more than 62,000 employees were departing a year for various reasons, equating to about a third of its workforce, and the pandemic-era labor shortage made it difficult to replenish its ranks. Workers “suddenly became very scarce,” said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive officer of Inter Ikea Group — the umbrella entity that oversees Ikea’s store franchising, product design and supply chain — in a recent interview in New York. Ikea focused on things that many businesses talk about doing but struggle to actually implement: Boosting pay, increasing flexibility for frontline employees and using emerging technologies to make things easier on workers and their customers. The results were stark: Voluntary turnover in the US dropped to about a quarter of employees by the end of 2023, from a third a year earlier. Globally, across the parent company’s more than 600 stores and warehouses, the quit rate fell to 17.5% in April from 22.4% in August 2022. While voluntary attrition has fallen in many white-collar occupations as hiring has slowed, employment in the retail sector has continued to trend up in recent months, making Ikea’s progress notable. Retail jobs are often marked by low pay, erratic schedules and irate customers, which helps explain why the quit rate for retail workers is more than 70% higher than in other US industries, according to a 2022 report by McKinsey & Co. Half of them are considering leaving their job, McKinsey found, and of those, half want to ditch retail entirely. The situation isn’t better in other parts of the world: UK retailers typically need to replace one out of every two workers each year. “Attracting, developing, and retaining frontline talent must become a top agenda item for retail CEOs,” the McKinsey report said, noting the challenge has only grown amid inflation and an environment where labor unions are increasingly flexing their muscles. Privately held Ikea, whose 473 stores in 63 markets employ nearly 200,000 people, historically lost fewer workers than its industry peers, thanks in part to a Nordic corporate culture that’s known for being warmer and fuzzier than, say, US discount giants Dollar General Corp. or Walmart Inc. But managing a sprawling, global workforce in an era where work-life balance has become mandatory for many people isn’t easy, and signs emerged that it wasn’t all Swedish meatballs and bliss amid Ikea’s endless aisles of Billy bookcases and Stockholm rugs. In 2018, a coalition of unions accused local Ikea managers of quashing organizing efforts at stores in the US, Ireland and Portugal. They filed a joint complaint with a branch of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development alleging that senior leadership “ignored red flags” about claims that workers’ rights were being trampled. “I never thought that Ikea would allow supervisors to intimidate and interrogate us,” Nancy Goetz, a worker in Ikea’s Stoughton, Mass., store, said at the time. “I expected more from Ikea.” A wave of worker protests ensued. In Poland, employees were peeved that a wage hike was pegged below the rate of inflation. In South Korea, unionized workers said they received subpar treatment compared with their peers in other countries. In the US, the company had to apologize for serving fried chicken, collard greens and watermelon at a Juneteenth event for Atlanta employees. (One former Ikea worker went viral by posting videos as “Angry Retail Guy” that mocked clueless managers and shoppers alike.) After several years of talks between the union coalition and Ikea, the company last year agreed in principle to let workers organize and allow store access to union representatives. Notably, though, the parties couldn’t come to terms on allowing labor reps to enter US stores. “IKEA respects the rights of co-workers to join, form or not to join a union of their choice without fear of reprisal, interference, intimidation or harassment,” a spokesperson said. “The company is committed to maintaining an environment of mutual respect and ensuring all co-workers’ rights are protected irrespective of their preference and choice concerning unionization.” While the talks dragged out, unhappy Ikea workers started looking elsewhere. Then, the pandemic hit, and labor shortages made finding and holding onto people even more challenging. “There was a shortage of staff for entry-level jobs,” said Ring. The so-called Great Resignation impacted all industries, but few gave workers more reasons to flee than retail. Stores had to transform into online fulfillment centers overnight, while supply-chain bottlenecks and record inflation made everyday necessities scarce and more expensive, angering shoppers, who often took out their frustrations on employees. So-called “hero” bonuses soothed the pain, but didn’t last. Workers got disgruntled, and started leaving for other gigs. ‘Unhappy Workers’ It was a far cry from when 17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad founded Ikea, using his village’s milk van to deliver bargain-priced pens and picture frames. He began selling furniture made by local carpenters in 1948, and opened his first store in Sweden a decade later. Ikea created a frenzy when it entered the US in 1985, and helped turn Kamprad into the world’s eighth-richest person. For a service-driven company like Ikea, unhappy workers can quickly lead to unhappy customers. “You cannot be a great place to shop if it’s not a great place to work,” said Philip Moscoso, a professor at Europe’s IESE business school who has studied the company. When Ring took the CEO job at Ikea in September 2020, the retailer had an alarming retention problem. In the US, UK and Canada, employee turnover had crept well above 30% and swapping shifts was a cumbersome process. In India, staff quit when they became parents, due to meager child-related benefits. Ingka Group, the Netherlands-based franchisee that operates and staffs Ikea stores in 31 countries that employ more than 165,000 people, embarked on a campaign to lower turnover, targeting the biggest pain points in each market. The approach improved pay and benefits, scheduling, new-hire orientation and in some places included an AI-powered tool that alerts managers when a worker might be in danger of quitting. Even employees’ uniforms were refashioned. “Many times people come into world of retail thinking that this is a role I will take on until I find something better,” said Neena Potenza, who oversees HR in the US for Ingka. “But at Ikea, we want people to grow and develop.” There’s still a ways to go, particularly when it comes to supporting employee mental health and workers with disabilities. In Japan, turnover has actually gone up amid a stubbornly tight labor market. In France, a push to convert temp workers to full-time status has also led to outsized employee departures. And in Puerto Rico, more than 50 Ikea warehouse employees just voted to unionize over complaints about pay and worker treatment. For one US worker, the changes haven’t been enough. The sales associate, who asked not to be identified, quit recently after a dust-up with a colleague quickly escalated into disciplinary action, she said, with managers aligned against her. Rigid scheduling rules also forced her to miss critical medical appointments. In employee surveys, other workers have complained about poor communication and micromanaging. Wage Bumps Compensation is often the biggest reason why workers leave, so across many regions Ikea raised starting wages, sweetened bonuses, or closed gender pay gaps. In London, base pay rose from 11 pounds ($14) an hour to 13.15. The UK also added a new starting pay band for a handful of stores outside London where the cost of living was much higher than in more remote areas. A bigger problem in UK stores, though, was the tendency of new hires to quit within months of joining. The so-called onboarding process was poorly organized, with infrequent feedback from managers and newbies unclear where to turn to for advice. Ikea UK/Ireland strives to hold onto 85% of hires after three months, but that figure had dropped as low as 60%, according to Darren Taylor, people and culture manager for that region, who oversees 9,500 retail workers. “Coming out of Covid, people re-evaluated what was important to them, and work-life balance became more important,” he said. “So it required a big change in terms of how we positioned ourselves to attract people into retail.” Those people included Natasha Williams, 22, who got a job at Ikea selling kitchen fixtures last year. Ikea worked to smooth her transition: Getting from her home in Basingstoke to the Ikea store in Reading was a two-hour slog involving two buses and a train. So instead of six-hour shifts across four days, Taylor gave her three eight-hour shifts, and allowed her to start at 10am rather than 9am. “That changed everything — I was much happier at work,” Williams said. Part-time staff, who make up about two-thirds of Ikea’s UK workforce, often don’t get enough hours to make ends meet, so Ikea is now giving some of them additional hours working remotely, answering customer calls. To retain students, Taylor has introduced shifts on weekends only, or just during school breaks. “Small things,” said Taylor, “make a big difference.” In India, the things that matter to Ikea’s workers are benefits like subsidized daycare, 26 weeks of parental leave for mothers and fathers and a five-day workweek (six days is the norm for many Indian retailers). Those perks are a game changer for Shweta Singh, a 39-year-old mom who was hired two years ago and runs the children’s furniture department in the Hyderabad store. And in the US, where Ingka employs more than 17,000 people, one of the most impactful fixes was moving its shift scheduling tool online. Previously, inflexible schedules didn’t allow for life’s daily hiccups— a sick kid, a flat tire. Unpredictable shifts can then have a ripple effect on workers’ well-being, leading to higher workforce turnover and economic hardship due to income fluctuations, according to studies by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and the Brookings Institution. “There is this notion that workers’ time is not valued,” said Kristen Harknett, a professor of sociology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has researched unstable work schedules. In collaboration with a group called the Shift Project, Ikea US began testing the ability for workers in a few stores to swap shifts online, without a manager’s approval, replacing paper forms that had to be signed by both workers and their respective managers, which made swapping “particularly tedious,” Shift Project researchers found. Workers in the pilot program can also adjust their hours of availability more easily, and request to not be scheduled in certain blocks of time. Also, a retention tool dubbed “Stay” analyzes historical data on departed workers and flags worrisome traits – such as constantly fluctuating hours – to managers. Store managers who have used the tool report turnover rates nearly three percentage points lower than those who don’t. Now, more store workers like Natasha Williams are sticking around longer. She just got a raise after taking a two-week training class, and would eventually like to move from the kitchen department to interior design. She’s not sure if she’ll work at Ikea her whole career, “but for the foreseeable future, definitely.” Latest in Retail 0 minutes ago RETAIL - AUTOS Stellantis boss blames his ‘arrogance’ for failing to spot 3 mistakes that led to a double-digit sales decline in the U.S. BYRYAN HOGG 0 minutes ago LIFESTYLE - THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY How to travel on a budget in Europe this summer?

The full original title is 157 characters, nearly double that. The alternatives generally suggested are to shorten the original title, omitting needless descriptives or words (e.g., counts, emotives, etc.) if possible, or barring that, to substitute alternative text, preferably from a subtitle or passage from the article (both to avoid editorialising): dang comment:Guidelines:(\"In Submissions\", title guidance.) Something's got to give, though, and the submitted title is accurate so far as it goes. If HN's readers can't be trusted to read even the title of an article, well, the whole premise of a an article-based discussion site seems somewhat imperiled. This may well be the case, of course ... reply notpushkin 13 hours agorootparentThis one is 75 characters: > IKEA solved ‘unhappy worker’ crisis by raising salaries, flexible schedules It's not really grammatically correct I think, but otherwise seems like a good compromise: we only leave out childcare subsidies, which is another monetary compensation, and do mention flexible work schedules which is a non-monetary benefit and might be crucial to IKEA's strategy. reply Angostura 10 hours agorootparent74 characters: Ikea improves salaries, flexible working, childcare to solve ‘unhappy worker’ crisis. reply dredmorbius 11 hours agorootparentprevThat's actually pretty good, and I'd suggest you email it to the mods: hn@ycombinator.com Wordsmithing titles is a bit of an art and often a challenge. reply belter 11 hours agorootparentAgree. Only mods can change now. I posted it and English is not my native language. Just Creole. As mentioned above, was trying to fit the title without editorializing.... reply ricc 13 hours agorootparentprevBut then there’s this rule to not editorialise headlines, so… reply dredmorbius 11 hours agorootparentEditing titles is permitted. That is, removing specifically indicated guideline violations, or shortening titles to fit length. Editorialising is NOT the same thing. It is replacing (or adjusting) a title not for length or clarity, but to give a specific slant to a subject or inject the submitter's opinion. Dang: \"Editorializing is editing a title to put one's own spin on it.\"reply notpushkin 13 hours agorootparentprevI'd say just cutting out half of the headline is more editorializing than trying to edit it to fit more of it. reply dredmorbius 11 hours agorootparentI'd give the submitter more credit than that. The title was cut for length, retaining the earlier (and presumably more significant) aspects of the original. As I noted in my other comment, wordsmithing title is a challenge, and most people probably aren't fully aware of HN's nuances and preferences in the practice.

If the others don't notice or don't care that they're getting paid less for the same work that's great for the company. I am in favor of flexible work arrangements, and I have no idea if those have costs to the company, or how much more you'd need to pay the workers to accept the less flexible arrangements. reply CalRobert 11 hours agorootparentIt's weird, in some ways, that we offer benefits. Give people the money and let them use it how they like. When I lived in California I LOVED the parking cash-out law, it meant a few thousand more a year because I rode a bike to work and didn't need a parking spot. Although, one challenge with things like childcare is that if you applied this on a society-wide level you wind up with childless people having more money, thereby being better able to outbid parents for essentials like housing (this is why a housing scarcity is so insidious). Of course, whether that's a bad thing or not depends on perspective. I have two kids myself and despite living in Europe childcare was so expensive we dropped to one income. reply matsemann 10 hours agorootparentYup, I don't have kids myself, but like that my company offers benefits to parents. It keeps the company more diverse and more enjoyable for me as well in a sense. > It's weird, in some ways, that we offer benefits. In some cases it also makes economical sense. It can cost a company $1000 to give you a benefit, but to buy it yourself would cost $2000 (and the difference is even greater if the benefit isn't taxed at the same rate as cash would be). Or the $200 the company spends on beers for me each year, many would perhaps say that they'd rather have the $200 to spend as they please. But in a sense, I get more value than $200 by getting to know my co-workers better and having a better time every day at work. reply CalRobert 3 hours agorootparentInteresting, is this not taxed? In some places this sort of thing is taxed the same as \"benefit in kind\" or similar. reply amtamt 12 hours agorootparentprevConsidered \"valued\" vs considered \"useful\" is probably the analogy that should be used here. Subsidizing childcare signals \"we value you\", while flat increae is signaling \"you are useful to us\", which can make a lot of impact on moral. reply HelloNurse 10 hours agorootparentThe message of subsidized childcare is not generically \"we value you\", but \"we want you to have children while you work for us\", which for most employees is more important than money. Compare to companies that avoid hiring women to avoid dealing with maternity leave. reply itsoktocry 6 hours agorootparentI live in a country with generous maternity leave. I have a family, and we're grateful we could access it. But maternity leave is tricky for businesses. My anecdote: I worked for a company whose long-time CEO retired. After an involved search, the company found a replacement. She was onboarded and started getting in a groove, then 6 months in it was announced she would be leaving for a year of maternity leave. So we had to find another CEO. 10 months later the original hire decided she would not be returning to the role (she's under no obligation to). No problem, except the replacement CEO assumed this was a temporary position, so she already had another job lined up after her term. Once again, we were searching for a new CEO... All of a sudden you're working for a company that's had 5 CEOs in 3 years. That's a hard thing for a company to deal with. People will say, \"that can happen anyway!\". Sure, but the strange thing here is nobody did anything wrong, and yet an incredibly destabilizing environment resulted and the business suffered. reply justsomehnguy 5 hours agorootparent> Sure, but the strange thing here is nobody did anything wrong And if anyone did anything for the business... reply KeplerBoy 11 hours agorootparentprevIs there really a perceived difference on the employees side? If anything subsidized childcare feels like charity and I don't want charity, I want to be paid well for my work, so I can take care of my family. reply amtamt 5 hours agorootparentFor some people there is no percieved differnce, some would think employer is trying to save on taxes, while for some (many?) there is a real percieved difference as being seen a member of family rather than a disposable hired hand. For an analogy, one can be given money instead of being invited to a social gathering. One might feel offended, while other may feel happier. reply malfist 18 hours agorootparentprevLook, I'm a DINK, don't have kids, never plan to have kids, don't even like kids. But child care is important to both the parents and society. Not subsidizing child care often means one parent has to leave the workforce, and that's almost always worse off for everyone than if they were able to afford child care and can contribute reply from-nibly 18 hours agorootparentRight, because raising kids isn't contributing to society. reply defrost 16 hours agorootparentThat's exactly why child care workers who look after packs of 15 to 20 kids at a time should be highly valued and paid a decent wage. It's how villages worked in the past, most adults did non child related work much of the time, some adults and some older children kept an eye on what the pooled group of kids were up to .. watching, sometimes educating, sometimes leading them in \"work\" building things, cooking, hunting, clearing fields etc. in small ways. It's a better use of labour than splitting every pair of adults into one for this type of work, the other always does child care. reply throwaway7ahgb 7 hours agorootparentI always tell my wife, if she wants to have a lot of kids we have only two options. 1) We move close to my or her family. 2) We get a lot more money. I don't see anyway around it, we need family support or money to pay someone else to help. reply Libcat99 7 hours agorootparentprevAll teachers should be well paid and well vetted. Teaching shouldn't be a self sacrifial social justice position, it should be an honored and well rewarded position. reply Viliam1234 3 hours agorootparentWe should probably also redesign schools so that they need fewer teachers. For example, above certain age it is a waste of time if the teacher has to explain the same concepts over and over again to each class -- kids could instead watch a video, and then discuss it with the teacher. Basically, the problem is that the current educational system doesn't scale well. It requires hundreds of thousands of teachers. Then people say \"also, they should all be very smart, very empathic, well paid, etc.\" but good luck finding hundreds of thousands of people like that. People understand why having a personal cook is expensive, so you either cook for yourself or you buy something mass-produced in a supermarket or you do a combination of both. Yet, we insist on everyone having a personal teacher. Not completely personal, but the ratio of teachers to students is something like 1:10, which is still too many teachers. If we go even further, the school system has a dual purpose of cheap babysitting and education, but it is taboo to talk about the former, so we pretend that all teachers do it teach. If instead we admitted the dual purpose, we could have separate professions of babysitters and teachers, both operating at schools, but we would need fewer teachers, and the babysitters would not need to have university diplomas. reply jampekka 11 hours agorootparentprevI'd guess they referred to the non-working parents contributing to the society by raising their children. All contributions don't get paid, and all that get paid don't contribute. reply taskforcegemini 8 hours agorootparentprevraising wages doesn't equal better quality reply malfist 5 hours agorootparentBut low wages certainly doesn't equal better quality. reply 39896880 17 hours agorootparentprevContributing to the household income.

Raising kids is absolutely contributing to society. reply yellow_postit 15 hours agorootparentprevThis is such a regressive view — a household that can only function on 2 incomes is more stressful than one that can operate on 1. Not saying earning potential needs to be the same — but claiming 1 is worse than 2 doesn’t hold water and is a pathological case. In the US it’s a shame we so under/de value child rearing as somehow “less than” reply lucumo 13 hours agorootparentIt is better for everyone, and it does not devalue child-rearing at all. It is better for the family: - it has more resources - it has more income diversification It is better for the father: - he doesn't have to carry the weight of income-gathering alone It is better for the mother: - she doesn't have to carry the weight of child-rearing alone - if things go sour, she can maintain herself and/or the family financially - sha has more choices in life It is better for the child: - they get a wider variety of experiences - they socialize with other kids earlier, which helps in early school-life - they learn to socialize with more adults too - there are professionals who have seen many children, who will notice problems before the parents will It is better for the childcare professional: - they have another job choice, helping them pick a job they enjoy It is good for society: - father, mother and childcare professional can do something that matches their talents, instead of doing something suboptimal for them, thus delivering more value to society It doesn't devalue child-rearing, it values it more, by having a professional help do it. I'm always befuddled by that argument. I'm not devaluing plumbing work by hiring a plumber, nor am I devaluing medical work by hiring a doctor. Why would I be devaluing child-rearing by hiring a professional to help? reply pton_xd 13 hours agorootparentHalf those arguments could be made for child labor. After all, if the child works too then the family has more resources, the father and mother don't have to carry all the weight, the child gets a wider variety of experiences, the father and mother can do something that matches their talents while the child picks up the slack. Right? Who actually cares more about a child's well-being, an employee paid by the hour or their own parents? reply lucumo 11 hours agorootparentI would not say that the child gets a wider variety of experiences in child labor compared to child care. Child care is explicitly designed to have a variety of activities for children. Child labor is the low skill kind with lots of repetitive actions. Child care also takes the child's needs into account, like having nap times and eating times designed around children, instead of around a production process. As for caring about the child's well-being? The parents, which is why they should hire the best people they can afford to do various parts of taking care off them. Hire the best doctor for their medical care, hire the best dentists for their dental care, hire the best teachers for their education, hire the best child-care professionals for daycare. reply cfeduke 13 hours agorootparentprevFor all these \"it is better\" points, it still doesn't even begin to outweigh the \"you get to spend time with your children\" point. This is the most important part of child rearing and once they've moved on you'll be thankful you spent your time with them instead of... whatever all that income/societal optimization stuff is. You get to raise your children once. reply levanten 10 hours agorootparentAs most things it is a balancing act. Children also need to socialize and learn to operate in a social setting independently from their parents. Day cares have an important role in this aspect in our nuclear family based societies. Confining children to be paired to their parents all the time is also not going to be good for their development. reply Skinney 12 hours agorootparentprevWho is 'you' in this context? If one parent is working, the other home with the kids, chances are that the one working can't take as much time off or has a harder time setting a healthy work-life balance (increasing your pay requires working harder). Using myself as an example: the only reason I can pick up my kid early from the kindergarten and spend quality time with him is because I can afford to not work 9-5 every day due to my wife also working. reply refurb 11 hours agorootparentNot sure I’d apply your situation to every parent. reply lucumo 11 hours agorootparentprevI guess you missed the part where I said that it is better for the child. Reducing my argument to \"income/societal optimization stuff\" is arguing in bad faith. reply chongli 7 hours agorootparentprevYou haven’t addressed the elephant in the room: housing. Housing costs have risen to match the switch to double income households. Now instead of 1, it takes 2 incomes just to be able to afford housing. This makes the family more brittle since if either parent loses their job both will lose the house. And with the rise in housing costs people move further afield. Commuting times go way up and people waste more time in the car or on the train. Everybody ends up more stressed than ever before and further behind economically (compared to those whose wealth grows without working). reply refurb 11 hours agorootparentprevEhhh… better for the kid? Kids can get plenty of social interactions and variety with a stay at home parent. Plus they get the benefit of time with parents, parents can focus on doing things they think is valuable for the kid. To somehow claim that childcare comes at no cost for kids is naive. reply lucumo 11 hours agorootparent> Kids can get plenty of social interactions and variety with a stay at home parent. The keyword there is \"can\". They can, it's just less likely. Especially when a parent takes the \"stay at home\" part too literal. > To somehow claim that childcare comes at no cost for kids is naive. Well, my experience with my kids was that their daycare was beneficial for them. They did not always want to go, but they definitely enjoyed all their days there. And especially for the first one, they had a lot of experiences that my wife and I would never have even considered as an option. Comparing them to their classmates when school started, they were way ahead in lots of things. Absolutely in language development, socialization and being able to focus. They were also just way less, for lack of a better term, worried about everything. They knew that the world does not revolve around mommy and daddy, and that they'd be fine in new environments. reply prmoustache 12 hours agorootparentprevWe like it or not 1 person in the household taking care of the kids skew the relationship between 2 adults into dependentship as the one working outside perceived to be the one bringing the income (while both should) and the one taking care of the kids and household end up feeling dependent. Some may try to be objective and tell yourself the other one is contributing as much, that is not the way it works in our guts, we like it or not and leads to inequality. This not optimal for many reasons: - once the kids are going to school, regular \"office hours\" daycare is not needed and it skew the relationship even more by removing one task to one party. If that time is used for personal instead of household chores activities, that person not bringing the income is eventually seen as a partial freeloader by the one bringing the income. - relationship can go sour quickly and if it doesn't work, the \"dependent\" one doesn't feel as free to end that relationship - the person taking care of the kid's social life is usually not as rich The elephant in the room being that in most case it ends up being the woman staying at home in an heterogender relationship in a society with an historically patriarcal model because of income levels which further increase the inequalities and dependentship. reply throwaway7ahgb 7 hours agorootparentThe situation you describe has been happening for most of humanity.

We just don't live in an economy where it is safe for families to put all their eggs in one basket like that. In post-WWII US, it was generally easy for fathers to find stable, lifelong careers with a low risk of layoffs and a low risk of an untimely death, which allowed families to thrive on single incomes. But that was an outlier, not the norm. In most places and in most periods of history, mothers have had to work (sewing, gardening, spinning, knitting, brewing, laundering, midwifery, etc., etc.) because fathers have not had widespread access steady, well-paying, low-risk work. Unless she was independently wealthy, a mother who did not bring in income was playing a very risky game with her children's lives. The biggest difference is that, today, most work must be done outside the home, which is very difficult for mothers. Childcare helps close the gender pay gap and is necessary for a fairer, less sexist society — at least until/unless our economy returns to primarily home-based work. reply ako 13 hours agorootparentIn the past extended family would usually live close by, so they could assist the mother inside the home.

The end goal was to take over companies and be owned by the unions. This had disastrous consequences for Sweden, many companies left, one was IKEA. It created an hostile climate, instead of the previous decades of consensus between buiness and politics it created an antagonistic atmosphere. The Social democrats lost their first election in 40 years. The system was scrapped in the early nineties. Kamprad got paranoid over the realization that politicians and bureaucrats could take over his life work and thus he moves to Switzerland and then created this non-profit to make sure it always remained in his family. reply cess11 11 hours agorootparentprevWhat do you mean by \"own creation\"? Kamprad was a fascist that started IKEA with financing from another fascist, and workers did all the work. What exactly do you imagine he contributed? And why are you misrepresenting the article you linked? The idea to transfer some of the profits from large corporations into union managed funds came from the largest trade union confederation, not \"radical Swedish politicians\". Social democrats aren't radical, they're reformists, and the reactionary response to the proposal was arguably much more radical than trying to herd it through parliament. reply tored 9 hours agorootparentI notice that you try to smear Kamprad in order to set the tone in order to defend union take over of companies by force, a typical tactic of the radicals. IKEA was Kamprad's own creation, not the creation of some union bureaucrat. The Wikipedia article, both the Swedish and the English version, is fuzzy about the details how it worked, they took the company’s own money and use that to buy the company’s shares by forcing them to sell by equity issuance. Goal was to take over private companies and create socialism. Social democrats were reformist but became radicals during the leadership of Olof Palme. This was not the only one radical thing that they did, another was the famous Pomperipossa taxation where some Swedes payed more than 100% in taxes. This led to other Swedes leaving the country, like the famous movie maker and director Ingmar Bergman. As I wrote in another comment, this had disastrous consequences for Sweden, large companies left and we went from a consensus culture around business and politics (Saltsjöbadsandan) to a something much more antagonistic. This radicalized the right wing in Sweden to become neoliberal for many decades to come, which led to other negative consequences. reply cess11 9 hours agorootparentWhy the lying? Kamprad was adjacent to Nysvenska rörelsen, a lifelong friend of it's founder Per Engdahl, who also supplied the initial funding for IKEA. It's insane to claim that Olof Palme caused a shift away from parliamentary reformism. And no, we've never had anyone pay \"more than 100% in taxes\". That's a myth, based on Astrid Lindgrens pretty weird propaganda story about it. The antagonism between labour and capital is inherent, and you either apply force to subdue the exploited party to this conflict, or you negotiate a deal or parliamentary decision. The latter was the core of Saltsjöbadsavtalet, the reformist position represented by the trade union confederation and the Social Democrats. The radical position would be to form militias and engage in militant revolutionary activities, something which the strong reformist movement managed to guard us from. The right and the fascists didn't think that was enough, however. It's absurd to blame the victims of fascism for the rise of fascism instead of those who gain from it. As for the reasoning behind the löntagarfonder, it's quite obviously immoral for people to become rich and powerful by disenfranchising and exploiting other people. Which is how late modern corporations work, you have owners that take the value produced by other people for themselves. The right agrees that this is a correct description, which is why they made sure pensions and wages have been invested in stock markets and investment funds, so every worker is now forced to participate in the casino. You could disagree with the particular construct of löntagarfonder, but you would need to be very religious to claim that nature or some god made it good and right that the rich get to keep generational wealth and persist in disenfranchisement and exploitation of other people. It's close to the idea of divine right of kings. reply tored 8 hours agorootparentI have not lied, another smear from you. It doesn't matter what Kamprad's political opinions was in his youth, using socialism to take over private companies as the Social democrats did is still wrong regardless. Are you going to call the family Rausing (creator of Tetra Pak) for fascist as well because the didn't want union bureaucrats to take over their creation? In what way would union bureaucrats be better stewards than business owners? We had union bureaucrat recently who ran the country, Stefan Löfven, probably the worst prime minister in history. Social democrats during the leadership of Olof Palme were definitely radicals. During this era they expanded the government and increased taxation massively, which led to a high currency devaluation, i.e made the Swedes poorer, typical socialism. As Olof Palme's successor Göran Persson said it, something like ~ Social democrats always puts democracy before socialism, Olof Palme did the opposite ~. Fitting end that Palme got murdered like something you hear about from 3rd World Marxist kleptocracies.

That is why the Government reacted and made a change to the tax legislation within two months, why would they if it wasn't over 100%? Even the most radical couldn't defend this absurdity. Saltsjöbadsavtalet was not about parliamentary decision, it was about consensus between employers and employees, which led to the Golden years. A consensus that the Social democrats broke when they passed LAS in the seventies. (Also Social democrats is again abandoning the Swedish model by accepting that EU can pass minimal wage legislation) Without Kamprad there would be no IKEA, thus nowhere for workers to work. That is the thing to understand, Kamprad was one in a billion, radicals exists in the thousands, useless of course because they don't create anything of value. Why everything is tied up around the stock market is because of neoliberalism, a consequence of the right wing's radicalization as I described earlier, typical for neoliberalism and marxism is that they both believe in printing money out of thin air and then speculate with it. Who benefits? Not the poor of course, it is the receivers of that printed money, for neoliberalism that would be bankers and capitalists and in marxism that would be bureaucrats and politicians, as it was in the Soviet union. reply cess11 3 hours agorootparentObviously you belong to the same political movement as he did. A few years before his death he said in an interview the his friend Per Engdahl was a great man. He was a fascist when he died. It made a solid impression on IKEA as a company. It's why unions have never been able to form there, it's why the company 'culture' has a distinctly parasocial 'family'-character, it's why the trust invests heavily in keeping refugees in desert camps, it's why Kamprad was disgusted by the idea to pay taxes, it's why IKEA does its sourcing in countries like Russia, Romania and so on, and avoids ecological destruction in Sweden. Your link confirms what I wrote earlier. Maybe you know someone who could help you translate it? You're using radical in some highly personal sense, in common parlance it means you're trying to cause social and political change through means like civil disobedience, direct action, mutual aid, militant revolution, rather than parliamentary deliberation and compromise. Palme was likely murdered by the fascist Gladio/Stay Behind network. So yes, it's how the political hegemony you support usually does it. Either buy the mafia and make money from drugs, or hire upper class murderers that are already financed by their exploitation of workers. Kamprad had some luck and Engdahl had some money. He wasn't special, Sweden has been lenient with fascists and oligarchs during all of modernity. reply tored 2 hours agorootparentNo, I'm not part of that movement, another smear, directly from the communist handbook. But you will get nowhere with that here. It is of course fine to question IKEA's business practices, myself is critical of many, personally I'm all in favour of unions as a union member myself, what is not okay is for bolsjeviks to steal companies by using the force of the government and undermine the entire economic model of society in a similar fashion what happened to the kulaks. > Your link confirms what I wrote earlier. No, read again, it confirms that Astrid Lindgren payed 101.06% in taxes. And Astrid Lindgren was not the only one affected by this extreme taxation. Confirmed by this report https://cms.ratio.se/app/uploads/2014/11/den_svenska_modelle... Marginalskatten var runt mitten av 1970-talet mycket hög (se figur 4); den högsta marginalskatten var i mitten av 1970-talet runt 87 procent. Beaktades även förmögenhetsskatten kunde marginalskatten överstiga 100 procent för kapitalinkomster och för rörelsekapital kunde marginalskatten också överstiga 100 procent om hänsyn togs till både inkomstskatt och egenavgifter (Grosskopf & Rabe, 1991). Detta uppmärksammades av Astrid Lindgren och föranledde henne att skriva en saga om Pomperipossa (Pomperipossa i Monismanien, 1976) som levde i ett fantasiland (Monismanien), framställt som en idyll i mångt och mycket men där Pomperipossa tvingades att betala mer i skatt än vad hon tjänade (102 procent). Astrid Lindgren beskrev på ett målande sätt Sverige och sin egen situation vilket ledde till ett skatteuppror i Sverige och att den 100 procentliga marginalskatten ganska snart justerades nedåt (Grosskopf & Rabe, 1991) även om marginalskatten på rörelsekapital fortfarande kunde uppgå till 90 procent. Never trust left wing radicals on history or on anything actually. Lies are part of their ideology in order to turn society upside down. And why are you denying it? This is what your movement wanted and still wants, that we all should be tax slaves under an anonymous bureaucracy. In every answer you keep bringing in irrelevant arguments, but that is typical of left wing radicals, they need to create a myth that they are fighting the good fight against all these fascists, so that they can impose a tyranny on all of us. reply notpushkin 13 hours agoparentprevhttps://archive.ph/68wsn reply trustno2 10 hours agoparentprevLidl is a non-profit too btw, funny how it works reply jamesrom 17 hours agoprevDoing stuff that makes people happy makes people happy.

I just can't grasp why a manager would refuse to provide proper pay and benefits and then get a Surprised Pikachu face when employees don't stick around. reply bhickey 18 hours agoparentThis isn't a lack of understanding. It's the principal-agent problem. Non-founder executives are usually rewarded for short term results. They'll deliver on this even if it means laying off the entire Python language team in the midst of an AI boom.

They simply don't value building a 'better life' and enjoy the power structure as it is. reply makeitdouble 17 hours agoparentprevA parallel take to the sister comments: the concept that employees have information and can easily move away from the job is still newish and the prevailing management theories are from decades to centuries ago. Of course it's not only the employer, a significant number of people still see a job as something they're supposed to stay in despite the competitive market. Employers still keep some assumption that the employee doesn't have a choice or won't execute on it, and there's enough employees working under that model that the assumption doesn't look so wrong at a distance. reply AndrewKemendo 17 hours agoparentprevIt’s not any more complicated than short term rent seeking from investors That’s literally it Investors hire managers that will ensure that investors remain the top priority for the lifecycle of the firm To such an extent that they made up fake rules like the idea that corporate officers have a fiduciary requirement to investors like a mutual fund manager does This is because the goal of financializing a company is to make it a narrowly focused high margin hedge fund You can’t do that if labor has bargaining power for control of the firm reply cscurmudgeon 16 hours agorootparent> rules like the idea that corporate officers have a fiduciary requirement to investors What makes it a fake rule?

That’s a 30% raise on near-poverty salaries - that’s definitely life changing! reply pembrook 6 hours agorootparentYou're basing that off of one of their highest profit quarters ever. 3X the average profit last year. Also, once you remove the profit incentive and kill the dividend (which goes into the world's pension funds via the public market), investors will no longer invest in the company. Being a capital starved business with insanely high COGS is a recipe for collapse the minute you have a downturn. And you'll probably say, \"good! then the mom-and-pop stores will come back!\" But the mom-and-pop stores, while aesthetically more pleasing to the elite, are in fact a far less efficient way to distribute food product so that would actually dramatically raise prices for consumers and decrease salaries & quality of life in many rural areas.

Do you think he would have to stop buying the groceries he usually does, or that he would have to cancel a vacation? It wouldn't change his life at all. Same for the rest of the people in that list. Every one of them could take just a little less and increase pay for the people who actually do the majority of the work necessary for the company to function and be profitable and it would make no impact on the day to day lives of those executives. Absolutely nothing life changing. reply StackRanker3000 32 minutes agorootparentHow much do you think the lives of Walmart’s employees would change if Suresh Kumar would forego those 4.5 million and distribute it among them instead?

Yes, an extra $9,600 annual pay for each employee would make a huge difference to many, but how low of a profit will shareholders tolerate below 3.2%? Maybe a better argument would be to find a larger bucket (much larger than $5B/quarter) where Walmart could perhaps reduce spending and redirect that to rank-and-file employees? reply pembrook 6 hours agorootparentThey made $11.292B total profit for all of 2023.

Don't know about the non profit part, but their management doesn't have to worry about growing the stock price every month at the least. reply pas 7 hours agorootparentPaying CEOs in stock leads to CEOs caring about stock prices. Also, as long as employees are grumbling, but still working, management doesn't care.

To them, the compensation is just, and therefore people are simply unwilling to work. I think there is a degree of tolerance that’s shifted. A job is not a job, anymore. Healthcare is insanely expensive. Housing is insanely expensive. Raising kids is insanely expensive. What used to be a “good honest job” has transformed into maximum-value-extracted job. And everyone is desperate to get as big a piece as they can to ensure their own survival. reply mega-flop 17 hours agorootparentprev [–] I think in psychology this is a concept called locus of control (internal vs external).

    "title": "Nvidia Warp: A Python framework for high performance GPU simulation and graphics",
    "originLink": "https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp",
    "originBody": "NVIDIA Warp Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. Warp takes regular Python functions and JIT compiles them to efficient kernel code that can run on the CPU or GPU. Warp is designed for spatial computing and comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write programs for physics simulation, perception, robotics, and geometry processing. In addition, Warp kernels are differentiable and can be used as part of machine-learning pipelines with frameworks such as PyTorch and JAX. Please refer to the project Documentation for API and language reference and CHANGELOG.md for release history. A selection of physical simulations computed with Warp Installing Python version 3.9 or newer is recommended. Warp can run on x86-64 and ARMv8 CPUs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. GPU support requires a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU and driver (minimum GeForce GTX 9xx). The easiest way to install Warp is from PyPI: pip install warp-lang You can also use pip install warp-lang[extras] to install additional dependencies for running examples and USD-related features. The binaries hosted on PyPI are currently built with the CUDA 11.8 runtime. We provide binaries built with the CUDA 12.5 runtime on the GitHub Releases page. Copy the URL of the appropriate wheel file (warp-lang-{ver}+cu12-py3-none-{platform}.whl) and pass it to the pip install command, e.g. pip install https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/releases/download/v1.2.0/warp_lang-1.2.0+cu12-py3-none-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl The --force-reinstall option may need to be used to overwrite a previous installation. Getting Started An example first program that computes the lengths of random 3D vectors is given below: import warp as wp import numpy as np num_points = 1024 @wp.kernel def length(points: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3), lengths: wp.array(dtype=float)): # thread index tid = wp.tid() # compute distance of each point from origin lengths[tid] = wp.length(points[tid]) # allocate an array of 3d points points = wp.array(np.random.rand(num_points, 3), dtype=wp.vec3) lengths = wp.zeros(num_points, dtype=float) # launch kernel wp.launch(kernel=length, dim=len(points), inputs=[points, lengths]) print(lengths) Running Examples The examples directory contains a number of scripts that show how to implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations (stored in the current working directory). Before running examples, users should ensure that the usd-core, matplotlib, and pyglet packages are installed using: pip install usd-core matplotlib pyglet Examples can be run from the command-line as follows: python -m warp.examples.. To browse the example source code, you can open the directory where the files are located like this: python -m warp.examples.browse Most examples can be run on either the CPU or a CUDA-capable device, but a handful require a CUDA-capable device. These are marked at the top of the example script. USD files can be viewed or rendered inside NVIDIA Omniverse, Pixar's UsdView, and Blender. Note that Preview in macOS is not recommended as it has limited support for time-sampled animations. Built-in unit tests can be run from the command-line as follows: python -m warp.tests examples/core dem fluid graph capture marching cubes mesh nvdb raycast raymarch sph torch waveexamples/fem apic fluid convection diffusion diffusion 3d diffusion mixed elasticity navier stokes stokes transfer stokes examples/optim bounce cloth throw diffray drone inverse kinematics spring cage trajectory walker examples/sim cartpole cloth granular granular collision sdf jacobian ik quadruped rigid chain rigid contact rigid force rigid gyroscopic rigid soft contact soft body Building For developers who want to build the library themselves, the following tools are required: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 upwards (Windows) GCC 9.4 upwards (Linux) CUDA Toolkit 11.5 or higher Git LFS installed After cloning the repository, users should run: python build_lib.py This will generate the warp.dll / warp.so core library respectively. It will search for the CUDA Toolkit in the default install directory. This path can be overridden by setting the CUDA_PATH environment variable. Alternatively, the path to the CUDA Toolkit can be passed to the build command as --cuda_path=\"...\". After building, the Warp package should be installed using: pip install -e . This ensures that subsequent modifications to the library will be reflected in the Python package. Learn More Please see the following resources for additional background on Warp: Product Page GTC 2022 Presentation GTC 2021 Presentation SIGGRAPH Asia 2021 Differentiable Simulation Course GTC 2024 Presentation The underlying technology in Warp has been used in a number of research projects at NVIDIA including the following publications: Accelerated Policy Learning with Parallel Differentiable Simulation - Xu, J., Makoviychuk, V., Narang, Y., Ramos, F., Matusik, W., Garg, A., & Macklin, M.

Support Problems, questions, and feature requests can be opened on GitHub Issues. The Warp team also monitors the #warp channel on the public Omniverse Discord server, come chat to us! Versioning Versions take the format X.Y.Z, similar to Python itself: Increments in X are reserved for major reworks of the project causing disruptive incompatibility (or reaching the 1.0 milestone). Increments in Y are for regular releases with a new set of features. Increments in Z are for bug fixes. In principle there are no new features. Can be omitted if 0 or not relevant. This is similar to Semantic Versioning but less strict around backward compatibility. Like with Python, some breaking changes can be present between minor versions if well documented and gradually introduced. Note that prior to 0.11.0 this schema was not strictly adhered to.

At least back in 1.7.0 there were some bugs in the code that made it very difficult to work with. reply hoosieree 3 hours agorootparentDo you have any more specifics about these limitations? I'm considering trying Taichi for a project because it seems to be GPU vendor agnostic (unlike CuPy). reply sinuhe69 58 minutes agorootparentI only dabbled in Taichi, but I find its magic has limitation. I took a provided example, just increased the length of the loop and bam! it crashed the Windows driver. Obviously it ran out of memory but I have no idea how how to adjust except experiment with different values. If it has information about the GPU and its memory, I thought it could automatically adjust the block size but apparently not. There is a config command to fine tune the for loop parallelizing but the docs says we normally do not need to use them. reply eigenvalue 4 hours agoprevI really like how nvidia started doing more normal open source and not locking stuff behind a login to their website. It makes it so much easier now that you can just pip install all the cuda stuff for torch and other libraries without authenticating and downloading from websites and other nonsense. I guess they realized that it was dramatically reducing the engagement with their work. If it’s open source anyway then you should make it as accessible as possible. reply foresterre 4 hours agoparentI would argue that this isn't \"normal open source\", though it is indeed not locked behind a login on their website.

Question: why would NVIDIA, makers of general intelligence, which seems to compete with everyone, publish code for software nobody can use without breaking NVIDIA rules?

Source code is open for reading. It has nothing to do with Licensing. You can have any type of license on top of that based on your business needs reply TimeBearingDown 8 minutes agorootparentNo. The Open Source Initiative maintains the definition, which is accepted internationally by multiple government agencies. https://opensource.org/osd https://opensource.org/authority reply dagenix 3 hours agorootparentprevThat may be your definition, but that's not everyone's definition. Wikipedia, for example, says: > Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software reply j-r-d 3 hours agorootparentprevNo. That's not how it works.

Taichi lives in a similar space, but has more than an NVIDIA backend. But its development has stalled, so I’m considering switching to warp now. It’s quite frustrating that there’s seemingly no long-lived framework that allows me to write simple numba-like kernels and try them out in NVIDIA GPUs and Apple GPUs. Even with taichi, the Metal backend was definitely B-tier or lower: Not offering 64 bit ints, and randomly crashing/not compiling stuff. Here’s hoping that we’ll solve the GPU programming space in the next couple years, but after ~15 years or so of waiting, I’m no longer holding my breath. https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi reply talldayo 2 hours agoparent> Here’s hoping that we’ll solve the GPU programming space in the next couple years, but after ~15 years or so of waiting, I’m no longer holding my breath. It feels like the ball is entirely in Apple's court. Well-designed and Open Source GPGPU libraries exist, even ones that Apple has supported in the past. Nvidia supports many of them, either through CUDA or as a native driver. reply szvsw 3 hours agoparentprevI’ve been in love with Taichi for about a year now. Where’s the news source on development being stalled?

Sounds like they are dogfooding it at least which is good. And I would agree with the assessment that 1.x is fairly feature complete, at least from my experience using it (scientific computing). And good to hear that they are planning on pushing support patches for eg python 3.12 cuda 12 etc reply contravariant 3 hours agorootparentprevThere's only been 7 commits to master in the last 6 month, half of those purely changes to test or documentation, so it kind of sounds like you're both right. reply panagathon 3 hours agoparentprevThis is the library I've always wanted. Look at that Julia set. Gorgeous. Thanks for this. I'm sorry to hear about the dev issues. I wish I could help. reply paulmd 3 hours agoparentprevthe problem with the GPGPU space is that everything except CUDA is so fractally broken that everything eventually converges to the NVIDIA stuff that actually works. yes, the heterogeneous compute frameworks are largely broken, except for OneAPI, which does work, but only on CUDA. SPIR-V, works best on CUDA. OpenCL: works best on CUDA. Even once you get past the topline \"does it even attempt to support that\", you'll find that AMD's runtimes are broken too. Their OpenCL runtime is buggy and has a bunch of paper features which don't work, and a bunch of AMD-specific behavior and bugs that aren't spec-compliant. So basically you have to have an AMD-specific codepath anyway to handle the bugs. Same for SPIR-V: the biggest thing they have working against them is that AMD's Vulkan Compute support is incomplete and buggy too. https://devtalk.blender.org/t/was-gpu-support-just-outright-... https://render.otoy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=75411 (\"As of right now, the Vulkan drivers on AMD and Intel are not mature enough to compile (much less ship) Octane for Vulkan\") If you are going to all that effort anyway, why are you (a) targeting AMD at all, and (b) why don't you just use CUDA in the first place? So everyone writes more CUDA and nothing gets done. Cue some new whippersnapper who thinks they're gonna cure all AMD's software problems in a month, they bash into the brick wall, write blog post, becomes angry forums commenter, rinse and repeat. And now you have another abandoned cross-platform project that basically only ever supported NVIDIA anyway. Intel, bless their heart, is actually trying and their stuff largely does just work, supposedly, although I'm trying to get their linux runtime up and running on a Serpent Canyon NUC with A770m and am having a hell of a time. But supposedly it does work especially on windows (and I may just have to knuckle under and use windows, or put a pcie card in a server pc). But they just don't have the marketshare to make it stick. AMD is stuck in this perpetual cycle of expecting anyone else but themselves to write the software, and then not even providing enough infrastructure to get people to the starting line, and then surprised-pikachu nothing works, and surprise-pikachu they never get any adoption. Why has nvidia done this!?!? /s The other big exception is Metal, which both works and has an actual userbase. The reason they have Metal support for cycles and octane is because they contribute the code, that's really what needs to happen (and I think what Intel is doing - there's just a lot of work to come from zero). But of course Metal is apple-only, so really ideally you would have a layer that goes over the top... reply owenpalmer 2 hours agoprev> Warp is designed for spatial computing What does this mean? I've mainly heard the term \"spatial computing\" in the context of the Vision Pro release.

In the example script, you use 17 characters to write this just to save 18 characters later on in the script. Just import the warp commands you use, or if you really want \"import warp\", but don't rename imported libraries, please. reply dahfizz 4 hours agoparentStrongly agreed! This convention has even infected internal tooling at my company. Scripts end up with tons of cryptic three letter names. It saves a couple keystrokes but wastes engineering time to maintain reply physicsguy 3 hours agorootparentThe convention is a convention because the libraries are used so commonly. If you give anyone in scientific computing Python world something with “np” or “pd” then they know what that is. Doing something other than what is convention for those libraries wastes more time when people jump into a file because people have to work out now whether “array” is some bespoke type or the NumPy one they’re used to. reply paulluuk 2 hours agorootparentThere is no way that \"warp\" is already such a household name that it's common enough to shorten it to \"wp\". Likewise, the libraries at OP's company are for sure not going to be common to anyone starting out at the company, and might still be confusing to anyone who has worked there for years but just hasn't had to use that specific library. Pandas and Numpy are popular, sure. As is Tensorflow (often shortened to tf). But where do you draw the line, then? should the openai library be imported as oa? should flask be imported as fk? should requests be imported as rq? It seems to happen mostly to libraries that are commonly used by one specific audience: scientists who are forced to use a programming language, and who think that 1-letter variables are good variable names, and who prefer using notebooks over scripts with functions. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that Python gets so much attention from the scientific community, but I feel that small little annoyances like this creep in because of it, too. reply hot_gril 1 hour agorootparentprevIt doesn't really matter reply hoosieree 3 hours agoparentprevThe more Python I write, the more I feel that \"from foo import name1,name2,nameN\" is The Way. Yes it's more verbose. Yes it loses any benefits of namespaces. However it encourages you to focus on your actual problem rather than hypothetical problems you might have someday, and the namespace clashes might have a positive unintended consequence of making you realize you don't actually need that other library after all. reply water-your-self 30 minutes agorootparent> the namespace clashes might have a positive unintended consequence of making you realize you don't actually need that other library after all. reply Y_Y 41 minutes agoparentprevimport warp as np Now you can re-use your old code as-is! reply dr_kiszonka 3 hours agoparentprevInteresting.

    "commentBody": "Start presentations on the second slide (tidyfirst.substack.com)183 points by andyjohnson0 5 hours agohidepastfavorite79 comments danielovichdk 0 minutes agoThe best presentations, just like the best literature, tells a good story. It takes character and personality to tell a good story. You can't lie to the audience. They will know right away if you are lying. And lying in this case is okay as long as the story is good. Presentations should be about getting people to think and reflect, it should not be about what the author believes. Slide one or two. Doesn't matter. Tell a story with a whole heart or don't try. Don't fake it. Give it all. Empty out or don't try. reply jll29 10 minutes agoprevMy recommendation is: start with an image (no text) on the first slide. It is important that the image has seemingly nothing to do with the topic of the talk that was on the (unnumbered) title slide. Now people are curious what explanation you are giving, and are paying attention. After resolving the mystery, you can move on to the second slide, you can give e.g. a problem statement or research question and then follow with the usual structure (outline, method, data, experiments, evaluation results, discussion and limitations, summary, conclusions and future work. Caveat: This works only for oral presentations; there is an important type of slide deck with is the predominant type in large international corporations, and it's a mix between PPT presentation and Word document, where slides are full of text so that the deck is self-explanatory. Those are written not just to be presented but MOSTLY for being passed around by email to be read. They intentionally violate all the rules of good slide decks to accompany good presentations, because they are mainly used to summarize e.g. a new business case for senior management, who may never listen to the presentation, but who may browse the slides. reply simonw 4 hours agoprevI gave a talk at PyCon a few weeks ago where I was really struggling to fit my content into the time slot. I ended up editing out the first couple of minutes of the talk - the bit where I ramped up to the topic, gave a little bit of background about why I was qualified to talk about it, that kind of thing. Instead I launched straight into my first point (which included a good joke)... and it worked. A lesson I learned is that if the topic is interesting enough you can skip the intro and jump straight in to that material, and if you combine that with a joke you can capture the audience's attention just fine. reply gumby 1 hour agoparent> A lesson I learned is that if the topic is interesting enough you can skip the intro and jump straight in to that material, and if you combine that with a joke you can capture the audience's attention just fine. This is important in sales as well. I hate getting a sales pitch where they tell me the history of the company. Big Japanese companies are the worst in this regard for some reason. For each slide, imagine the audience is going to get up and leave unless you give them a reason to read the next slide. You don't need to justify your existence if I don't really know what you have to offer. Plus it's all about me (the listener) not you (the presenter). reply el_benhameen 5 minutes agorootparent> For each slide, imagine the audience is going to get up and leave unless you give them a reason to read the next slide. This is great advice, and I’ve been trying to apply it to my writing in general. Each sentence, and even each word, should give your reader a reason to stick around. Fluff has its place in fiction and long-form writing, but most day-to-day writing should be information-dense. reply wongarsu 4 hours agoparentprevIt's a bit of an audience thing, but for a talk at a technical conference I tend to roll my eyes at introduction slides. I already chose to attend your talk, telling me why it's interesting is preaching to the choir. And typical hacker ethic involves judging people by their skills, not their credentials. You can slip in a \"btw I invented the thing we are talking about\". But don't read me your CV, impress me with your insights. This isn't true in all contexts. Some audiences care a lot about credentials. And if people don't choose to be at your talk specifically you have to give enough context. But even then you are often better off catching their attention first, and once you got it bring it back to the introduction reply foobarian 3 hours agorootparentI think there is a lot of cargo culting in presentations. Title slide? But of course we must have a title slide, that is the way. And an introduction, and motivation... everybody else has one! reply mandevil 2 hours agorootparentSlides have two distinct purposes: as a part of a presentation, and separately as a way to learn or review material outside of the presentation. Unfortunately they are at cross-purposes. For accompanying an oral presentation you don't want lots of data, you want a simple clear image that sync with what you are saying, and to change them rapidly. For learning outside the actual presentation, you want rich, detailed slides with lots of data on them, and leave them up for a while so people can absorb the information. Ideally, we would build two different decks, each optimized for their purpose. But no one has time for that, so people try and do both in one deck, generally going with lots of information except for one or two images keyed to specific jokes. And it makes the whole thing less effective. reply supriyo-biswas 5 minutes agorootparentHandouts and speaker notes are a thing, although people rarely use them both when building presentations and when reviewing them later. reply andrecarini 17 minutes agorootparentprevIdeally you'd have slides purely for presentation, and an accompanying interactive self-contained HTML document for the documentation of the talk. reply ghaff 10 minutes agorootparentAnd nobody wants to do both (or has the incentive to do both). I'll do sorta-both but probably in an informal way--e.g. article that grew out of a talk--or vice versa. reply bee_rider 2 hours agorootparentprevA motivation slide can be useful if you are giving a presentation to people who are more experienced than you (which, for any given audience, there ought to be some). It tells them what built in assumptions you made without being aware of. reply supplied_demand 2 hours agorootparentprevThe presentation may eventually be viewed by people who aren't in the room to hear you speak. In that instance, a title/intro slide makes perfect sense. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentprevKnowing your audience is a big thing in general. If the talk isn't to some large degree about your journey, that probably shouldn't be the focus. But also, face it, your talk isn't going to work for everyone. When I was doing a lot of keynotes, I'd get feedback on the same talk to the effect of \"That was great. It really helped me understand $X\" and \"I was totally lost.\" Even given technical difficulty ratings, no one pays any attention. reply babyshake 48 minutes agoparentprevAn alternative is to do the first couple minutes of your talk at 2x speed and then suddenly slow down to a normal pace when you reach the interesting part. That should get their attention. reply matsemann 4 hours agoparentprevI agree, but one good thing about starting with the soft and boring parts (like your name and credentials), is that it's easy to do when you're nervous in the beginning. Can't really stumble that too much, and then you're warmed up for the real talk. But of course, the shorter you can keep it the better. Instead I often try to memorize my first lines, word by word. Then I know I will nail them when at my most anxious, and then the rest can be talking more freely. reply dylan604 4 hours agorootparentI also assumed that part of the first few minutes was filler while butts are still trying to find seats, still chatting amongst themselves, or haven't quite closed whichever social media app as well as letting the presenter shake off any butterflies reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentThat's a good point. A presentation isn't really a written story or even a film. You don't want the people who missed the first few minutes to be \"dazed and confused.\" :-) You don't want to do too much throat clearing (to use the metaphor a former boss used with respect to writing research pieces). But you probably don't want the first few minutes to be too essential to be jumping into the rest of the talk either. reply larsrc 3 hours agorootparentprevI always have the title and my name and organisation on the first slide, which is just shown while everybody comes in. That lets everyone know if they're in the right place. reply ghaff 2 hours agorootparentAnd I do usually have a bio slide right after as well. But I spend about 15 seconds on it. I also (usually) have basic contact info on my slide masters so people know how to contact me without snapping a shot of the right slide. reply nonfamous 2 hours agorootparentprevI like to put my name, contact info, and reference link on the last slide. This is when they’ll actually need it (if they want to follow up with you), latecomers won’t miss it, and it’s usually on the screen for a long time during q&a so people have time to jot it down or snap a picture. reply CooCooCaCha 3 hours agoparentprevPeople appreciate it. Seriously. A big pet peeve of mine is long intros. 30 seconds is probably fine but minutes is way too long. This goes for talks, youtube videos, etc. I get why people do it, they want to reduce risk by addressing things that could go wrong (is this person qualified? I don’t understand the context. Etc) but man be a little brave and get to the point. reply codazoda 2 hours agorootparentUnfortunately, I think YouTube rewards you for this. At least it feels that way based on how long YouTube video’s take to get to the point reply Kwpolska 1 hour agorootparentThis might be caused by mid-roll ads. Videos need to be 8 minutes long to qualify for those, and you want people to actually reach the ad. reply jedberg 2 hours agoprevA technical presentation still needs a story. This is standard storytelling technique -- you start with the inciting event, the hook that gets you interested. How does The Matrix start? With Trinity about to get caught. Bambi? Mom gets shot. Star Wars? A tiny ship is getting chased by a huge ship with lasers. A good tech presentation follows good storytelling: 1) Inciting event, build to a semi-climax, pull back a little, hit the climax, then conclusion. If you want to be a great technical presenter, read some books on telling good stories. :) reply IshKebab 9 minutes agoparentYes, although I think you have to be careful not to piss audiences off with that technique. E.g. think of those too-long form articles that start \" David lives in a 3 bedroom house in rural blah with his two dogs, boopy and bloppy...\". Instant close. I did an amazing presentation course once run by a comedian. He was very very good, and the main advice that stuck with me was to have your presentation follow the hero's tale. Everyone knows it: all is good, tragedy strikes, problem is overcome, celebrate. You might think that you can't fit technical talks into that format, and I wouldn't say every presentation needs to be like that. But it's applicable way more often than you'd think. Basically anything that solves a problem can be told like this. But too many presentations are like \"I'm going to tell you about the X project. Here's an overview of the slides. Right, what is X?\" instead of \"We have a lot of things that do Y. This all worked great until Z, then disaster! Existing solution A doesn't work at all for this case. So we created X. But it didn't work because ... so we had to do ..., and finally everything worked!\" reply AndrewOMartin 4 hours agoprevI always start a technical presentation with \"spoilers\", for anyone who is busy or is happy to just trust me, they can leave almost immediately with the most important bit of information. Anyone else who wants disagree, or wants proof any claims can get involved. reply floatrock 4 hours agoparentSimilar to BLUF -- Bottom Line Up Front. Hear that one used more for memos or emails, but same concept. Give people a sense of what's at the end so they see where the background is going. Use the story-spine if you want, but show a trailer to convince the audience there's some juicy explosion-ladden scenes at the end of the rainbow. reply ryandrake 3 hours agorootparentDepends on the audience. I've seen presentations to Director-and-VP types that wouldn't progress past the first (fact summary) slide. You'll present a nice summary of your results with the high level conclusions, and someone will open their mouth and say \"Well, what about Detail X that I heard about? How did you account for that?\" and you say \"We'll get to that, it's actually explained on slide 6.\" \"Well, I heard through Dave that...\" now you have to either discuss it immediately without the slide's context, or awkwardly scroll to slide 6 for the guy. Then some other exec pipes in with \"But, my team's component Y was not included here at all!\" and you say, \"That's slide 3. I was planning on that being my first topic, but we got side tracked with Detail X...\" Then the original exec \"Speaking of Detail X, what about SubDetail Z, which I notice you left off [the summary slide]...\" Uggghhhhh kill me now. reply wrs 2 hours agorootparentIn a previous life where I did a lot of presentations to Bill Gates, I had the opposite problem. He insisted on having the presentation printed out for him ahead of time, and he would usually have read and understood them (no idea when he would have time to do that). So you’d be on slide 2 going through your careful introduction, and he would ask an uncomfortable question about something on slide 12! The Amazon method of starting with quiet reading may be the only solution… reply alexthehurst 3 hours agorootparentprevThose execs sound like terrible communicators. It’s hard for me to imagine a colleague acting this way in real life. reply bityard 3 hours agorootparentIf you've never had a co-worker or manager interrupt you mid-sentence to breathlessly ask you a question that is literally answered by the second half of the sentence you were GOING to finish, then my friend you should go buy a lottery ticket because this happens to me daily, in every job I have ever had in the last 20 years in tech. reply michaelt 2 hours agorootparent> If you've never had a co-worker or manager interrupt you mid-sentence I've had plenty of people interrupt me to ask questions while I'm presenting - which I think is generally something to be encouraged. When I've replied with \"That's a very insightful question, we'll get to the answer in a few slides time\" I've never had someone insist on continuing the interruption. reply orf 19 minutes agorootparentExactly, this is how you do it. reply albert_e 1 hour agorootparentprevI have been in some meetings where the \"big boss\" cannot follow any structure and will constantly throw out ideas and enquiries and demand we had ready answers for questions we are hearing for the first time or topic that was not on the agenda and pontificate about how some things should be better etc. Thankfully they only attended our meetings once a quarter and never involved in matters beyond pontification. reply jdlshore 3 hours agorootparentprevOh, it’s real, and goes down exactly as GP describes. reply cess11 3 hours agorootparentprevAs a presenter in that situation you should tell them to shut it or leave, and take notes so they remember the questions they have for after the presentation.

Obviously not stories presented solely for their drama as one might watch a movie, but the fundamental \"conflict -> tension raising -> resolution\" cycle ought to be in your presentation, multiple times as needed just as they nest within a traditional story. It is tempting to the technical mind to present them as we see mathematical proofs, building from the fundamentals up to the final result in a completely-temporally-ordered manner, but the reasons that works in a math text don't apply to presentations. And a lot of people don't find it all that useful in math texts intended for learning either, if you read one of HN's periodic discussions of \"how we learn math best\". This post is basically to use the \"start with a hook\" approach to story telling, which is a good option. There are others, but there's a reason so many good stories-for-the-sake-of-stories use this approach. In general if people are showing up to your presentation voluntarily, you do have a couple of slides you can use to build some tension up before they'll zone out on you, but you do want to get to your first \"conflict\" fairly quickly. This is pretty abstract, so let me give a specific technical example to show what I mean. It's been a while now since pretty much everyone knows git, but for a while I was the de facto git trainer in my company. I had a prepared presentation I used for this, and I had the people in the presentation follow along, running commands in a local repo they create on the spot. I did not immediately start with a hook; I did start with general overview of git and how it works, but on what would be the fourth slide or so, rather than take them through nothing but the happy path, I start getting them into trouble, detaching the head. Everyone detaches head sooner or later without meaning to. This is the conflict & tension, and the resolution is, how do we solve this problem? The rest of the presentation does not just guide through the happy paths, but periodically either gets them into one of the common error states or walks them through a common pitfall by not just warning them about it, but taking them through the process of getting into various common troubles and then getting out of it. Each of these cycles is an implicit story, where the main character gets into trouble, as appropriate the trouble gets worse, then the trouble is resolved. Obviously no one would go to a movie theater to watch someone get stuck in git and then get unstuck; it is not that kind of story. Programming and hacking get dressed up the way they do by Hollywood for a reason; the real thing is unwatchably boring. But it still has the story cycle in it. You can also spice you presentations up by showing some of the wrong paths you encountered or the problems you had to solve instead of just presenting the bare results; in addition to being more compelling in the abstract, such presentations are more valuable anyhow in a lot of other ways. This is far more effective then a standard dead presentation that just shows \"how to do this. how to do that. how to do the other thing. now you know things go forth and do\" while the audience's eyes glaze over. reply aaronbrethorst 3 hours agoprevIn other words, a ‘record scratch’ narrative structure https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/record-scratch-freeze-frame-y... reply agumonkey 3 hours agoparentSome people argue that it's becoming the norm for youtube videos too.

Plus, the cool technical details Apple shared about their language models \"thinking different.\" Nathan Lambert Jun 12, 2024 21 Share this post AI for the rest of us www.interconnects.ai Copy link Facebook Email Note Other Share By being quiet in the race for the biggest and most rad foundation models, many people assumed that Apple didn’t have anything to contribute to the AI race. After their new announcements, many in the heart of the AI labs still will argue this, forecasting that a marginal lead on language model performance has an effectively infinite expected value. Apple is betting that AI follows paths paved by previous technological revolutions: incremental progress to transformational results. With a large swath of new features, many of which are built into a new multi-model AI system called Apple Intelligence, Apple has demonstrated how meaningful AI interactions can be built into every corner of our digital life — connecting apps and making tasks easier. By executing this well, Apple can guarantee that AI is a force multiplier that keeps even people using their devices longer, rather than pushing them to other upstart companies or competitive products. Apple’s presentation rang very different than most AI keynotes we’ve seen in the last few years. While OpenAI and Google are trying to prove that they are the best at AI, Apple leaned into a narrative of what else we can do with AI. Apple’s large suite of new AI features coming this fall across all their devices, enabling automation, information retrieval, and generation in a privacy-conscious way will be the first time that many people meaningfully interact with AI. This is the latest chapter that the story of the internet is unfolding at the junction between Apple and Meta. Two companies, who should really be compliments, consistently try to one-up and out-position each other. A few months ago with the launch of Llama 3, Meta launched Meta AI, which is generally available and rolling out to Meta’s 3 billion users. Meta AI is much more general. It is trying to be a chatbot, entertainment, and an information store. Its competition includes ChatGPT and all the other places people can go for this information. Meta AI should really be integrated next to ChatGPT into operating system features, but this is very unlikely. Apple’s new features will be rolled out on its newest devices (e.g. iPhone 15 Pro and later, M1 Macs and later), which eventually can reach all of their 2 billion users as well. It presents a very different view of what AI is to the general public. Apple is framing what they built as being fundamentally different from ChatGPT, Claude, Meta AI, Gemini results, etc., and it is probably right. While the many features they announced are interesting, and I will be upgrading my phone this cycle to try them out, they have an extremely high variance on how well they’ll land in the final product (e.g. how Microsoft Recall needed substantial updates post announcement due to security issues). Photo generation, decent on-device generation, better Siri, textual Siri, webpage summaries, etc. all will serve different audiences. Today, beyond the focus on how transformative it is for billions of people to have access to AI rather than hundreds of millions, I want to dig into the interesting technical details Apple has shared with us. Interconnects is a reader-supported publication. Consider becoming a subscriber. Subscribe Apple’s technical approach All the evidence in WWDC and related communications, such as a foundation model blog post, showcase that Apple is right where it needs to be with AI on the technical side. Given the amount of AI products that are announced and never delivered, passing the bar on technical capabilities via clear communications with the ML community is important for independent monitoring of the performance of top labs (i.e. what I, and many investors, ML nerds, etc. all try to do). I split this summary into three core categories: 1) Core model performance, 2) adapter and on-device strategy, and 3) alignment strategies. The general approach that Apple is taking is highlighted in this great 6-minute video from the WWDC keynote. In summary, Apple foundation models focus on personalization (alignment strategies), performance (core models), and size (on-device strategies). Only the last one is orthogonal from other developers out there, but it surely added substantial constraints that inspired the other two. Core models: What did Apple build? There are a lot of details in the blog post about their models, covering everything from safety to summarization to email completion. At the end of the day, most of these evaluations are extremely opaque, so I’m leaning on a lot of trust in the company's reputation and general context to make predictions on the actual quality of their models. The most central figure to my analysis is the Apple human evaluation versus other top language models. This evaluation likely favors Apple by at least a few percentage points. The things they’re training these models for are explicitly different than what ChatGPT is — otherwise, why would Apple have the option to send any prompts to other services? These models are about things that iPhone users already could use AI for. Regardless, the scores are still solid enough to make a strong case. We can see that the on-device model, which is about 3 billion parameters, performs very well versus other models out there. Models like Gemma and Phi 3 are more research or marketing artifacts than models central to future business strategy, so Apple really ought to be crushing models here. Apple’s Server Model is where things get a little more interesting. The models they’re comparing to, except GPT-4, mostly are considered B-tier by the community. This looks like 2 years after the release (edit) training of GPT-4, Apple has approximately trained an original GPT-4 level model. This is likely not their ceiling, but the sweet spot they found with respect to their costs — again, the hardest tasks will be offloaded. Beating models like DBRX and Mixtral 8x22B is not trivial, yet it is where Apple should be. To beat the current GPT-4-Turbo, Apple likely needed to invest way more money than would be worth it (e.g. Meta’s GenAI / Metaverse level spending). It was reported that Apple “used a host of licensed content to train and fine-tune their models” like many big tech peers. There are lots of noteworthy privacy features in the handling of the server model — secure enclave, secure boot, encryption, no persistent storage, etc. — the combination of which Apple is going to make public so security researchers can verify their claims of privacy. Apple is serving this model entirely on its own infrastructure, which is likely the only way this level of privacy could be achieved (so Google may be able to do something similar if they want to too). Alignment strategies: Some new things! I wasn’t expecting to write about this, but Apple buried a revealing paragraph about fine-tuning techniques. in their foundation model blog post (emphasis mine): We find that data quality is essential to model success, so we utilize a hybrid data strategy in our training pipeline, incorporating both human-annotated and synthetic data, and conduct thorough data curation and filtering procedures. We have developed two novel algorithms in post-training: (1) a rejection sampling fine-tuning algorithm with teacher committee, and (2) a reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) algorithm with mirror descent policy optimization and a leave-one-out advantage estimator. We find that these two algorithms lead to significant improvement in the model’s instruction-following quality. The bookends of this paragraph are pretty standard — use all the quality data you can get (human and synthetic) and the right algorithm, and you’ll get great performance out of your model. The algorithmic details are interesting because they are so specific with respect to existing literature. First, rejection sampling with the teacher committee looks like an extension of the rejection sampling approach that was used for Llama 2, Llama 3, Qwen 2, and more models. Rejection sampling is a simple idea to generate completions from your model, rank them by a reward model (trained separately), and then use the language modeling loss again to fine-tune your model on the top texts. The new thing introduced is a “teacher committee,” which is very likely to be building on the extensive work that has been appearing around using reward model ensembles (or merging) to improve performance. Ensembles, in principle, improve performance by giving a more robust and or calibrated reward signal. The second algorithm is far more interesting (and technical, so bear with me). They put a direct reference to an older RL algorithm that never really got a ton of traction (e.g. it isn’t implemented in most popular RL libraries) and mirror descent policy optimization (MDPO). This algorithm is similar to proximal policy optimization (PPO), the algorithm you hear about a lot when people discuss RLHF, but solves the problem in a different way. PPO, and its predecessor TRPO, optimize what they call a “surrogate objective” that looks like maximizing a value with respect to a constraint on a “trust region.” Instead of a constraint, MDPO looks like a penalty (and there are many other details). Leave-one-out error is likely an implementation detail of that algorithm that is grounded broadly in ML theory. The MDPO offers some great intuitions on how the algorithms relate to each other, and how parts of them may impact current RLHF approaches. Let’s start with a comparison of PPO and TRPO, from the paper (additions mine): PPO takes a more relaxed approach [than TRPO] and updates its policies by solving an unconstrained optimization problem in which the ratio of the new to old policies is clipped to remain bounded. This, though, can result in some numerical issues in practice. This phenomenon, which has been reported in (Wang et al., 2019) and (Engstrom et al., 2020), shows that clipping in PPO does not prevent the policy ratios to go out of bound, but it only reduces its probability. This means that despite using clipping, PPO does not guarantee that the trust-region constraint is always satisfied. In fact, recent results, including those in (Engstrom et al., 2020) and our experiments in Section 5.3, show that most of the improved performance exhibited by PPO is due to code-level optimization techniques, such as learning rate annealing, observation and reward normalization, and in particular, the use of generalized advantage estimation (GAE). This is essentially saying that PPO works due to implementation tricks and not exactly due to its designed objective, which MDPO tries to fix. The key differences between MDPO and PPO are that: MDPO updates are on the “entire dataset” rather than batches. With this, MDPO can be run in an on-policy and an off-policy manner. MDPO uses a different scheduling of KL distance (which may not exist in the RLHF version relative to the original paper). MDPO uses opposite direction of KL. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence is a directional measure of distance between two distributions that is not symmetric. PPO does KL distance the old policy to the new policy and MDPO the opposite. Intuitively, this is a change between information gain and loss of the policy, where one direction penalizes the loss of high-probability tokens and the other penalizes the creation of new behaviors. MDPO, being the latter, could potentially explore better. The key takeaway is that seeing new algorithms for RLHF is exciting because it is very unlikely that the current PPO implementations are actually optimal for our final goals, so this will encourage more experimentation across the industry. Realistically, all the details aside, Apple is most likely to innovate here due to their deep company culture of creating personal products. I’m excited to keep tabs on what they build, as true personalization is a large blindspot in the RLHF literature and discourse. Share Orchestrating adapters and on-device magic Apple has done a ton of things to put all of this together on their devices. They figured out how to train great models that use just the right amount of memory with quantization, how to train many adapters that work with different apps or styles, how to get fast latency speeds, and much more they didn’t talk about. This is very serious ML system engineering of a different flavor than large models and large request count handling. This on-device stage relies on a lot of groundwork that Apple has built in the past, such as App Intents, which is a standard way for apps to expose their functionality to automation apps and Siri. Apple has successfully trained a small language model to speak the same functional language. In the WWDC keynote, Apple explained that they focused on fine-tuning specific models for specific tasks, which is likely the 12 categories of applications they will be supporting when this launches. Apple fine-tuned a batch of adapters for the small model that are loaded into memory when the prompt is detected to need them. What I’m not sure about is how the multi-app sequences showcased in the keynote are handled. When Apple Intelligence is asked “Can I make it to my daughter’s play in time,” the example Craig used, are each of the adapters loaded sequentially, or are they applied and mixed together? This sort of technical magic I don’t expect to get an answer to, but represents a serious investment, especially with the high-quality bar that Apple has. It’s extremely validating for the local model community that a model that takes only 1 GB of memory to load when quantized, and another 3.2GB to run inference for can do so much. As Apple expands the memory footprint of their devices to accommodate a larger AI narrative, they have easy performance to gain by just dropping the quantization levels a bit. For more on this area, check out the summary on the AI News newsletter that explains a bit more about the paper Apple published in this area, Talaria. When you put the Apple Intelligence system together, you end up with this slide from the keynote. They left out one detail, predictably, which is the handling of the external language models that Apple hopes to commoditize by letting the user choose. Light for other narratives around AI I’m not the first one to say this, but Apple crushed this presentation (and the markets agree). More important is what this means for the future and narratives of AI. I’ve been saying for a long time that parties outside of the existential risk community need better narratives around the future of AI’s development. Apple's succeeding, especially given that Llama 3 was branded as an “open-source AGI,” is a great addition to a simple and calibrated discourse of AI. Being able to say “Yes, super powerful AI can be folded into many compelling stories around the future of humanity, but it is also a technology that we use today,” will go a long way in policy circles.

This basically says that only a tiny bit of the AI will done on NVDIA hardware for the billions of Apple users. The market is not pricing that in. reply andruby 10 hours agoparentMy opinion is that the market is treating Nvidia as the shovel sellers during a gold rush. If almost every business that wants to do AI needs to buy Nvidia hardware, their sales will go through the roof. That’s what the market is pricing into the Nvidia stock. It is very unlikely that Apple will sell their “server” hardware to other businesses in that way. Their advantage is the vertical integration, for themselves. While I am bullish on AAPL, I don’t expect it to have a run like Nvidia. reply szvsw 9 hours agorootparentThe one area that I think Apple might be setting themself up well for is the longer term edge device AI race. It’s reasonable to think that AI will become more and more embedded in all aspects of computation and communication, and with that, it seems plausible to think that running and executing inference at the edge on devices with low power and compute capabilities relative to what’s available in the cloud will be a desirable deployment methodology - cost, bandwidth, robustness, etc etc. Obviously there’s nothing of the sort in the works now, but it’s not totally implausible to think that the expertise and infrastructure apple is developing now might be setting themselves up to also handle inference for things like home automation systems, industrial sensors and actuators, etc which may all need edge inference capabilities. Chips like the M Series or on the other side the NPU will presumably be coming to many devices outside of the mobile/pc market and it doesn’t seem totally insane to me to think that Apple might want to get into that world. Again, this is all just speculation about long term pathways that might be unlikely after all. reply zarzavat 9 hours agorootparentprevNVIDIA are not selling shovels, they are selling shovel-making machines to the shovel-sellers (the companies making foundation models).

When the prevailing coin still mined on GPUs switched algorithms the bottom of GPU prices fell out on eBay. I expect at some point a) the training and the inference will move to even more specialised hardware and the current existing silicon go to either hobbyists or some other market that requires the current cards b) the way in which we do AI may fundamentally change in ways we can't predict, causing the required hardware to also change (move to FPGA or favouring some other aspect than VRAM) In both scenarios NVIDIA isn't the one who win, because the sudden influx lifts a secondary market nv don't profit from directly. I personally don't think they'll be able to sustain their current valuation past the current AI rush, and will compact back down to somewhere their levels pre-chatgpt.

My eBay watchlist always has a few in it, but the prices just aren't where I need them to be. For now I am focused on inference with a dual 3090 rig, and my next step will be to fit another pair of 3090s, which is the max I can easily support with my AM5 motherboard. What's slowing me down is the fact that I can't run server hardware due to noise, and I can't run an open-air setup because my cats would get into it, so I need to buy or build a case to hold everything. reply pbronez 3 hours agorootparentDug into A100 sale prices using Ebay's Terapeak analytics.

Perhaps. For $2000 I might trust Ebay's buyer protections... reply ants_everywhere 5 hours agorootparentprevThis is totally not a space I understand. But it seems like there are possible threats to NVIDIA, such as (1) MLIR, ROCm, or some other tooling that reduces CUDA's moat, (2) AMD attracting investment to go after NVIDA (3) ARM-based GPUs or accelerators gaining traction among cloud companies that have huge fleets of AI devices and also have the money to devote to custom chips Can anyone who understands the industry explain why those threats (or similar ones) aren't a major issue for NVIDIA? reply itsoktocry 7 hours agorootparentprev>If almost every business that wants to do AI needs to buy Nvidia hardware, their sales will go through the roof. This will undoubtably prove to be temporary. >It is very unlikely that Apple will sell their “server” hardware to other businesses in that way. The point is Nvidia isn't required. reply saberience 7 hours agoparentprevThe reason is because people have stopped buying iPhones every year. Apple has been priced like a growth stock for a very long time but their revenues have stopped growing! (Seriously, look at their earnings reports) Now compare to Nvidia, their stock has been on an AI related run because their revenues have been MASSIVELY increasing over the past year, because they sell the most advanced chips for training and inferencing the most complex models. Apple may be “doing AI” now, but it’s for consumer products, they’re not selling enterprise AI services nor are they selling the actual chips needed to train and inference. Also, I have major doubts as to whether any of the Apple AI announcements are going to drive higher iPhone sales. There will be tech evangelists who buy a new iPhone for the AI features but the bulk of users are folk like my parents, who use their phone for calling, messaging, and taking photos. The only thing they ever noticed with new phones was either it was: 1: better camera 2: better/bigger screen 3: really obviously faster The last few phones have been indistinguishable in terms of screen, performance, or camera, and my own personal iPhone cycle went from every year or every other year, to now roughly every 3/4 years (and I’m an engineer). reply Someone 5 hours agorootparent4: better photo and video filters From what I understand, such gimmicks are (almost) essential utilities for many. It also is possible that small improvements in intelligence will drive sales. For example, I don’t see much use for generating entire novels on-device, but good autocorrect and prediction of a few words may drive sales. I also like the automated tagging that iOS already does on photos. Also, even if the new features only make people upgrade a few months earlier, that will be serious amounts of money for Apple. reply pbronez 7 hours agorootparentprevYeah. I’ve been planning to upgrade from my 12pro this fall, and I’m mostly excited to get better optical zoom and trash my lightning cables. I do think that Siri’s Generative AI upgrade (which is how I think of this whole Apple Intelligence thing) might be significant enough to change the smart phone as a segment. There are so many things that I feel Siri should be able to do, but it just can’t. Maybe this unlocks those use cases. If it does, that’s a major incentive for me to increase my investment/reliance on the Apple ecosystem. I’ll use the calendar and mail apps if it means Siri has all that context. I’ll upgrade devices to get the same answers with less perceptual lag. If we’re focused on hardware sales, I’d be interested in an Apple version of the Rabbit R1. That thing is almost a modernized iPod Touch - great device for kids you don’t trust with an unsupervised connection to the mobile internet. I would be delighted to get a Real One from Apple. The HomePod Mini is close to this already. It’s. Not clear to me how much Apple Intelligence will be available through those. Again, if it actually works I will buy more of them. reply troad 6 hours agorootparentI’m still on the 11 Pro, and I feel similarly. I’ve not seen any reason to update to date, though the new AI functionality might just turn out to be it. I’m unsure I’m willing to lock myself in to the Apple ecosystem to an even greater degree though - they make it devilishly difficult to extricate yourself, and I already find the enforced storefronts built into their apps obnoxious. The Books app went from being a library to a shop - how long until the Photos app is trying to sell me things? If anything, I may wind up bifurcating my life to an even greater degree - iPhone for general life admin (calendar, phone book, banking etc), Linux for productivity, creativity, gaming. reply Angostura 5 hours agorootparent> how long until the Photos app is trying to sell me things? Historically, Apple use to have really nice functionality built into Mac iPhotos to design and order photo books and prints. Sadly they dropped this. reply pbronez 3 hours agorootparentprevThat's fair. I'm not interested in allowing Apple to become a single point of failure for my digital life either. When I think about going deeper into the Apple Ecosystem, I mean stuff like: Continue to use a 3rd party mail and calendar services, but ensure they're available through the native iOS Mail and Calendar apps. Increase usage of reminders Promote iCloud file storage, syncing it with other places to ensure it has a recent view of my holdings. Increase use of Apple version of subscriptions I might get elsewhere, such as News. reply blitzar 6 hours agorootparentprev> There are so many things that I feel Siri should be able to do, but it just can’t. The competitors can and have done these things for a long time now, but all any of these things are (currently) useful for is setting a timer and playing music. Without a rewind style access to your entire life, there is a real limit on how much useful stuff this technology can actually do. reply pbronez 6 hours agorootparentPerhaps. An LLM with exclusively global context (no personal context) is already pretty powerful, but certainly not helpful as an assistant. In theory, perfect personal context would help a lot. Certainly a smart human being who follow me around all day can be very useful, but is expensive and has human limitations. I don’t think I want exactly that from an AI. I am not thrilled with stuff like the Humane pin. I don’t trust that it will keep all those observations secure. I don’t trust that it will sort through all the noise to identify what’s actually important. I think a mobile OS is a good balance. It has a LOT of personal context. I already trust it to process that data securely. The context is already well-structured and actively curated. I’m optimistic that adding LLMs to this will be significantly useful. reply troupo 7 hours agorootparentprev> Siri’s Generative AI upgrade (which is how I think of this whole Apple Intelligence thing) might be significant enough to change the smart phone as a segment. Why? Most play with generative AIs for a few days and then abandon them. The actual gamechanger would be making an AI assistant to be, you know, an actual assistant maybe? reply pbronez 6 hours agorootparentI think LLMs improve Natural Language Understanding enough that we can approach genuine assistance. This is especially true if (1) the AI has access to high quality, well structured context, and (2) there are some constraints on the domain of possible tasks. I think OS integration can provide both of those things. Mobile app selection is already pretty strong, and the Shortcuts ecosystem is a good example of providing direct access to specific functions implemented by apps. AI should use the shortcuts functions exposed by the apps I’ve already selected, installed and configured as tools. If I can use shortcuts on demand with just my voice… that’s a huge win for me. reply shdh 10 hours agoparentprevThat's assuming Apple isn't training their models on Nvidia hardware. Inference is on Apples own silicon though. reply mupuff1234 6 hours agorootparentLooks liked they used Google TPUs https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/h... reply realusername 9 hours agoparentprevBecause nobody is going to buy iPhones in bulk just for this new AI unlike GPUs for Nvidia, it's a nice to have upgrade, not a game changer for the company. reply twoodfin 6 hours agorootparentI don’t think we’ve seen the whole story on how Apple plans to monetize what is effectively a massive, distributed AI platform. Think of all the AI startups paying OpenAI per token for consumer app capabilities. Or having to rely on suboptimal local foundation models. The value Apple can offer here is considerable. I’d expect Google is headed towards a similar architecture, and both platforms will include API monetization for third parties. I wonder if Apple’s deal with OpenAI precludes the latter from attempting to build their own hybrid platform on Apple devices… reply whiplash451 7 hours agorootparentprevIn the short term, you’re right. But in the long term, it totally could be a game changer. reply Grazester 7 hours agorootparentApple isn't interested in anything outside their core interests. Even if they did make very specialized hardware for AI training they would not offer this to the public. reply iLoveOncall 10 hours agoparentprevI'm sorry but that does not make any sense at all. Nvidia's stock is surging because they sell GPUs and big companies by a lot of their GPUs to train AI models. Apple's stock has not surged following the AI boom because they... don't sell GPUs used to train AI models. AI is a profit center for Nvidia and a cost center for Apple (yes, people that weren't buying iPhone won't suddenly buy an iPhone because it has an AI assistant embedded). There's absolutely no link between the two. reply jb1991 9 hours agorootparent> people that weren't buying iPhone won't suddenly buy an iPhone because it has an AI assistant embedded > There's absolutely no link between the two. These are remarkable levels of speculation. Already I've heard from Android friends who are intrigued by the recent AI announcements that they think it would be really cool to have that in their phones. I don't know if they will necessarily switch, but they certainly indicated they were very interested in the iPhone AI announcements. reply moooo99 8 hours agorootparentI feel like this is some sort of biased perception. I suppose most people who are interested enough in technology to talk about smartphone choices are also somewhat interested in this AI craze. However, most people probably aren’t that interested in technology. I still know more people who don’t use ChatGPT on a semi-regular basis than people who do. Most people’s phone choices come down to: 1) is it available in a color I like 2) is the camera any good 3) can I afford it 4) *optional* does my trusted techy family member recommend it reply infecto 7 hours agorootparentApple Intelligence is not just about AI. Although none of us have used it yet, from the keynote, it's clear that it can benefit people who are less technically inclined, regardless of age. For example, while my mom might struggle to use Apple Photos to search for specific pictures, she would have no trouble asking Siri for all the photos of her granddaughter dressed like a princess. The goal here is not about bleeding-edge technology or AI; it's about providing more natural interfaces for users, whether they are tech-savvy or not. reply sigmar 7 hours agorootparent>For example, while my mom might struggle to use Apple Photos to search for specific pictures, she would have no trouble asking Siri for all the photos of her granddaughter dressed like a princess.

It's not about Apple or Google Photos being first; it's about making technology accessible to everyone. And its not about \"AI\" its about a different way for the consumer to utilize technology. reply jb1991 6 hours agorootparentprevI think you’re missing the point, you’re focusing on one very specific feature, but ignoring the larger argument here. reply itsoktocry 7 hours agorootparentprev>Already I've heard from Android friends who are intrigued by the recent AI announcements that they think it would be really cool to have that in their phones. Fancy marketing tends to do that. Have they tried it? reply jb1991 6 hours agorootparentYou know the answer to your question, so the question itself does not add to the discussion. If it turns out the iPhone AI assistant lives up to the expectations, I think you will see people moving platforms. reply talldayo 5 hours agorootparentIf Apple AI succeeds, then Android AI will just look like an upgrade by comparison. Best-case-scenario, Apple creates a super-helpful model that exclusively uses local compute; then Android releases the same feature with the ability to choose uncensored models. Especially considering how Apple's Neural Engine is borderline-pointless for LLMs, neither Android or iOS feel particularly well-poised to deal with this trend. If anything I lean more towards Android, since Android manufacturers have been shipping 8GB of RAM in phones for years, and support the Vulkan accelerators that a lot of inference apps feature. reply itsoktocry 4 hours agorootparentprev>If it turns out the iPhone AI assistant lives up to the expectations... That's a big \"if\". Right now it's marketing. >...I think you will see people moving platforms. This presumes Google can't do something similar, and over-estimates how much normies care about these things. I'm a \"techie\" and personally couldn't care less about having AI get me to the airport on time. reply whiplash451 7 hours agorootparentprev100%. And it’s also about retention too. Iphone’s speech to text has gotten so dismal compared to android that if Apple does not catch up, people would end up switching. reply iLoveOncall 9 hours agorootparentprevAnd you would need extreme short sight to not trust that GenAI on Android will be out in a year if not much earlier than that. Hell, it may come out BEFORE iOS 18. That is of course without mentioning that the only two devices compatible right now (both versions of the iPhone 15 Pro) represent a total market share of 3.1% of smartphones. AI in iPhones is essentially a distraction from the fact that Apple hasn't brought any software innovation to its devices in probably close to a decade (note I say this as someone who has only had iPhones since the 4). reply jb1991 6 hours agorootparent> That is of course without mentioning that the only two devices compatible right now But if you were switching platforms to iOS, you’d be getting a new phone, wouldn’t you? reply realusername 9 hours agorootparentprev> Already I've heard from Android friends who are intrigued by the recent AI announcements that they think it would be really cool to have that in their phones. Most of it has been there for Samsung already and some of them like the emoji generator look suspiciously similar. On Android, usually some large manufacturer (here Samsung) push the platform further and then some of it is integrated in stock later. reply infecto 7 hours agorootparentprevI follow up to the phone part because absolutely people will be buying ipads/mac books/phones to get access to AI Assistant. I am definitely in the camp that if AI Assistant offers some nice workflows on my phone and laptop that I may actually buy a new ipad for a seamless experience. I am sure I am not the only one in this camp. To me Apple Intelligence is the closest to a personal assistant that we have gotten so far and what Siri/Alexa/Hey Google failed at for a decade. reply cma 5 hours agoprevAll of Apple's investment in AI edge capability is almost totally undermined by their huge price discrimination on RAM, shipping 8GB laptops in 2024 and charging like $300-500 for 8GB more. reply talldayo 5 hours agoparentI don't know why you're being downvoted. Unless Apple users want to swap a multi-gig 3B model onto their 256gb SSD and chew through it's lifetime TBW, we should be campaigning for enough RAM to do normal stuff. Our SSDs deserve a break. reply mark_l_watson 6 hours agoprevI think Apple’s approach to (more or less) private local AI, with short term reliance on OpenAI makes sense. When I listened to the Apple Developer’s presentations this week I always filtered everything said with “they are talking about proposed product updates, and some existing working functionality.” I have been enjoying running all of Apple’s beta iOS, iPadOS, and macOS beta releases this week, and there are nice features in Photos, Calendar, etc., but we need to wait to see what they release next fall. I am not an Apple developer, really, I did really well selling a Mac app in 1984, and a Mac app I wrote two years ago had pathetic sales. That said, I have been trying the beta Xcode with LLM code completions, etc., and I have been experimenting with MLX and Apple Silicon for a long while. Apple is definitely an interesting player in the AI product space! reply la64710 5 hours agoprevNothing new , I guess that’s the point anyway,? reply SebFender 8 hours agoprev\"Apple has demonstrated how meaningful AI interactions can be built into every corner of our digital life\" Well not really.

There's a level of integration with AI and your OS/apps that is (as far as I know) unprecedented. One thing I really want is for Siri to be able to control my house with Home Assistant with natural language, e.g. \"turn off all of the lights outside except for the balcony\". The updates to Siri seem like it _could_ make this possible. I would _love_ to be proven wrong, so please do show me alternatives. reply barkerja 6 hours agoparentprev> The whole thing comes down to - your request may get sent to ChatGPT for advanced features.

That's not even remotely close to being accurate. reply jb1991 6 hours agoparentprevIf you didn’t see anything new in the announcement at all, maybe you didn’t actually see all the proposed features they are advertising? I’ve never seen a lot of stuff contained in one personal device or computer before.

Technical capability is rarely more important than product market fit. reply sigmoid10 10 hours agorootparentThe problem here is that for current AI systems, the state of the art is the one that has ironed out the most kinks. I.e. what you would expect from a polished product. That is basically ChatGPT with it's monstrous API that does tons of god knows what behind the scenes in addition to feeding text to an LLM, most of which was figured out by trial and error from user reports. There's no doubt that a modern LLM based Siri would be a much better product than the old one, but if they're not careful, they will fall into the same trap they did the last time introducing an assistant. reply tomashubelbauer 10 hours agorootparentPrivacy is a part of the equation and while Apple could gather all the context off my phone's local data and give ChatGPT the whole thing to really give it the best shot and providing a useful and helpful answer, this would not be a polished product on all axes, mainly the responsiveness and privacy ones. The tradeoff of using local models for less than SoTA inferrence but with unbeatable privacy and latency seems right to me for Apple and what Apple customers want and expect. reply HarHarVeryFunny 6 hours agorootparentprevThe best AI experience right now isn't just using SOTA models, but using them in a way that plays to their strengths and avoids their weaknesses (hallucination, limited reasoning, etc). The way to minimize hallucination is to use LLMs to manipulate text (translate, summarize, query, reword, etc) rather than generate it out of thin air, and arguably Apple are doing this by integrating LLM use into the product and therefore controlling it's application, rather than just providing a chat interface that people are wont to use an hallucinating \"search engine\"/oracle. reply Closi 10 hours agorootparentprevI think this is still a tech-centric view rather than a product-oriented view. E.g. Apple generating emojis using a diffusion model is clearly less SOTA than other image models, but could be a really neat feature from a product/user perspective. Would a better diffusion model help? Maybe, but it probably changes the product less than all the UI and tight integration work they will have done. If I was to guess, I would guess many more emoji's will get created through this feature than images generated in Microsoft's 'Image Creator' in Paint (I could be wrong - just my gut feel). reply viraptor 10 hours agorootparentWhatsApp has integrated AI generated stickers almost a year ago. (https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/15/23832635/whatsapp-ai-gene...) I'm not sure how much they're used globally, but there are people crazy about stickers and the quality of what I got was really decent already. There were already external apps available for this purpose for a while, so yeah, the interest is there. reply andruby 10 hours agorootparentprevIndeed. And that has always been Apple’s forte. reply pjmlp 9 hours agorootparentNot always, specially when Steve Jobs was away. reply tomalbrc 7 hours agorootparentprevExcept for the dozens of products that were neither polished nor state of the art (maps, Siri, iOS 6/7, most of their Mac related software, etc) reply Hippocrates 7 hours agoparentprevWhy does SOTA matter here? OpenAI has actually failed already to make something useful and mass-market. After all these years of pushing SOTA, it's still a website with a text box. Siri in its current form is more useful to me than ChatGPT 4. You simply don't need SOTA models for a lot of valuable features; you need context, annotation APIs, and the right platform and integrations to assist users where they already are (on their phones, in cars, in their IDE, etc). MSFT's GitHub copilot is a good example of getting it right. Apple relegated ChatGPT to a 3rd tier AI capability for \"google answers\", and \"write me a poem\" party tricks, and rightfully put it behind a privacy disclaimer. It looks barely better than the various ChatGPT shortcuts so many people have cobbled together. That part of the announcement stuck out like a sore thumb and looked to me like a huge L for OpenAI. The \"partnership\" was a nothingburger. Like someone at Apple agreed to it early on but then late in the project realized it wasn't needed at all. So much for SOTA. reply infecto 7 hours agorootparentI mostly agree with you. OpenAI is reportedly still doing great in terms of revenue, but Apple's implementation is magical if it performs as shown in the keynote. In my opinion, it's the best implementation of LLM/AI in a consumer device. It's amusing to think back to all the buzz around Humane's AI pin. reply Hippocrates 6 hours agorootparent> It's amusing to think back to all the buzz around Humane's AI pin It certainly is. And the Rabbit R1. How in the world did people who supposedly know anything about AI think they could make that work as a standalone device detached from rich context.

    "originBody": "View image in fullscreen Illustration: Ulises Mendicutty/The Guardian Opinion Smartphones I banned my daughter from using the iPhone she bought. It made her a better person Em Rio I set expectations when she saved up and got the phone – little did I know it would undermine them, and her mental health Thu 13 Jun 2024 08.00 EDT Share The byline on this essay is a pseudonym. My daughter is one of those kids the US surgeon general warned us about. Our nation’s children are “unknowing participants” in a “decades-long experiment”. Social media usage poses mental health risks to youth, who use it “almost constantly”, causing sleep deprivation, depression and anxiety. Before sixth grade, my daughter saved her dog-walking money for a phone. She found a used iPhone 13 Mini on Craigslist. I set expectations to incentivize getting good grades, keeping her room clean and taking out the trash. Little did I know that the iPhone would systematically undermine her ability to complete these tasks – and so much more. When my daughter walked into class through an inflatable arch on her first day of middle school, I took comfort in the fact that I could reach her. Like most parents, I associated the phone with safety, not danger. I didn’t know that social media developers were manipulating her next swipe, or that her “human future” was being sold to the highest bidder, enriching the wealthiest corporations in human history. I learned the hard way – through my daughter’s lies, manipulation, slipping grades. Through the “zebra-stripe” scars sketched across her arms. Her sixth-grade school picture captures my daughter’s “emo” phase: the feather earring, Pink Floyd T-shirt and crooked smile. The innocence in that image was quickly replaced by the selfie. Peace-signs-over-puckered-lips selfie. Head tilt, half-face, full-body selfie. The selfie in bed. Her camera roll documents my child’s downward spiral. Crying selfies, puffy-eyed selfies, unable-to-leave-the-bedroom selfies. By spring semester, my daughter was performing poorly in school. I took her for a psychiatric evaluation, assuming she had ADHD. Afternoon sun filtered through faux wood blinds, casting light strips across her ever-present black hoodie. The doctor’s questions started predictably. Trouble focusing in class? Completing homework? Sleeping? Then the interview took a turn for the dreadful. Do you feel your life isn’t worth living? Have you ever harmed yourself? Do you wish you were dead? I gaped at my child’s profile, each “yes” lacerating my guts. Her treatment assumed her struggles were individual, as opposed to structural. In our country, we prescribe drugs to solve this social crisis The doctor diagnosed my daughter with depression and anxiety. Further testing showed that gaining her friends’ approval occupied 80% of her attention. No wonder she was failing math. It was a miracle she was passing any of her classes at all with only 20% of her brain available for school. The doctor prescribed therapy and Lexapro. While these were helpful, the doctor failed to alert me to the sweeping phone trends among middle school students. I have since learned that my daughter is among the first generation of 10-to-14-year-olds active on social media. For these girls, suicide rates have risen 151%, self-harm 182%. Her treatment assumed her struggles were individual, as opposed to structural. In our country, we prescribe drugs to solve this social crisis. Ignorant of these dynamics at the time, I allowed my daughter to continue her social media use. One day, I received a text from another mom. I stared at the screen, wondering why this mom had sent me a graphic selfie. Then I recognized the mole on the woman’s chest. My kid’s mole. My daughter gasped when I showed her the photo. She handed over her phone. I discovered she’d circumvented the screen limits and had been using social media into the wee hours of the morning. She’d sent the image to someone named PJ on Snapchat. He claimed to be a 16-year-old boy, but his response was so graphic I suspected someone older. The phone was a two-way street, I realized with dread, with platforms adults could use to kidnap and traffic our children. I called a family meeting with my daughter, her dad and her stepmom. My daughter would delete her social media accounts and give up her phone until the start of the school year. As the summer months passed with travels, in-person hangouts and family time, my daughter returned to herself. The dark circles under her eyes faded. The sighs, shrugs and eyerolls stopped. She got up in the morning. She laughed. She even let me hug her, sometimes. It was hard to give her phone back before seventh grade, but we had a deal. I wanted to reinforce her good behavior. I made new rules: no social media, no devices in bedrooms, phones off at 8pm. We charged our phones on the kitchen counter. I bought alarm clocks and sound machines. We endured digital detox. My daughter started soccer. My insomnia resolved. We joined a gym and worked out together. ‘They give us liberty with less anxiety’: A teenager, a parent and a teacher on smartphones for under-14spanel Read more But within a few months, my daughter relapsed. Little lies. Big lies. Another text came from a friend’s mom with selfies of our daughters vaping and hanging out with boys I’d never met at the mall. We held another family meeting. “This may sound crazy,” my daughter’s stepmom said. “But maybe she doesn’t need a phone.” The words rippled across my mind. How had I never thought of it? The phone was destroying my daughter, but I couldn’t imagine life without it. I’d remained loyal to the idea of it, the ideal of it. I took custody of the phone again. My daughter threw a tantrum when I told her she’d lost her phone until high school. She didn’t want to be that kid, the only one in class without her phone. But as the tantrum subsided, she began to return to herself. Then, within a few weeks, signs of her addictive behavior began to resurface. I found iPhone chargers in the outlets by her bed – for charging her AirPods, she said. She threw her body on the ground to stop me from searching beneath her bed. One night, as I lay in bed ruminating, it hit me. I remembered my daughter had two phones. When I’d accidentally broken the Mini in a weight machine during our workout, I bought her a new iPhone 13. I’d seized the 13, but she could still have the Mini. “I sold it to a friend at school,” my daughter said when I asked her the next morning. She couldn’t say to whom, or for how much. “I’ll find it,” I said with an I-see-you gesture. I was frantic, but displayed calm confidence, even a little humor, as I searched her backpack and drawers, patted down her pockets, entered her room unannounced, trying to catch her in the act. My daughter remained calm throughout my searches. I began to think I’d gone completely mad. I bought a metal detector. Then one evening, I came into her room. My daughter bolted upright and shuffled her comforter. I rushed to the bed, ran my hands under the covers. A charging cord! My fingers traced its length to the attached phone. We stared at the Mini lying in my hands. The Snapchat app glowed beneath the shattered screen. She looked at me. Her eyes went wide, then filled with tears. She assessed her worth within a system where she was simultaneously attention-addicted and attention-starved. She’d internalized an algorithm where provocative content wins That night, my heartbeat tapped wildly against my pillow as I scrolled her social media. Her exchanges were desperate with need. She pleaded with people to reply, especially a boy named Damien. When he didn’t respond, she said she was depressed, sexted, sent a boob pic. I found answers via my sister in Johann Hari’s book Stolen Focus, which explores how and why our attention is collapsing: “The phones we have, and the programs that run on them, were deliberately designed by the smartest people in the world to maximally grab and maximally hold our attention.” Of course. At such a young age, my daughter was defenseless against this manipulation. She assessed her worth within a system where she was simultaneously attention-addicted and attention-starved. She’d internalized an algorithm where provocative content wins: “If it’s more enraging, it’s more engaging,” Hari writes. The social experiment in our house is being replicated in homes across the country. As parents, we want to keep our kids safe. We want them to call us if an active shooter comes to campus. But the greatest danger lies within the phone, not outside if it. One reason our kids are so addicted to their phones is because we’re addicted to ours. My friends complain of insomnia, but can’t imagine leaving their phones outside the bedroom. Addressing my child’s phone use has meant addressing my own. I have to restrain myself from texting while driving. I’ve stopped rushing to the charge station every morning to see if I missed a message. As seventh grade ends, my daughter is that kid. Without her phone, she’s the kid who dribbles her soccer ball across the living room, rides her skateboard down the street, makes the honor roll, joins the track team. She’s the kid whose hands gesture wildly as she chats with her friends, who plaits her hair and falls asleep reading a book. These days, we use my phone together to coordinate hangouts, listen to audiobooks, sing along to her songs and mine – Shakira and Sade, Ice Cube and the Fugees. Last weekend, we drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to visit family. June gloom hugged the coastline as my daughter and I bodysurfed a glassy wave that rushed us to the shore. “Again!” she said, leaping to her feet. She’s addicted to the feeling of the water rolling beneath her belly. My daughter’s not the only kid. I recently met a woman who seized her 11-year-old son’s phone when she discovered he was sexting. Students at the Illing middle school in Connecticut build community and pay attention in class now that the school makes them put their phones in rubber pouches – a trend that’s quickly spreading. British children are largely learning in “a mobile phone-free environment” since a department of education mandate. We need both individual and systemic changes to check our phone use. I’m curious where these changes will take us by the time my daughter enters high school. Until then, I’ll hold the phone.

That’s a really interesting suggestion. It reminds me of haolez’s comment yesterday (abridged by me) [0]: > I was a CTO and was a member of a group chat for CTOs. We had very insightful and rich discussions about topics that affected our roles, like vendor reputation, frameworks, team management, talent acquisition and so on. > The group became popular and the admin […] merged all group chats into a single one of thousands of users. […] What ended up happening was that the discussions plummeted in quality, where a very noisy minority would take up most of the space in the discussions. There were some high profile CTOs that stopped engaging at that point. > This left me wondering if there is enough demand for smaller social networks with very limited visibility that can foster rich and insightful discussions (although this sounds like forums from the nineties). ——— Both of you get at the same point - private and manageable (and moderatable) communities are probably a much better option to allow everyone freedom to interact without feeling insignificant (due to size), and with the right moderation, can be a place which allows healthy conflict, discovery and rule-bending, and the other things that we were able to get up to as kids without our parents knowing, while maybe being moderated by a third party who isn’t acting as an authority figure (people won’t get in trouble for reasonable rule-testing), maybe even some sort of private task-specific bot which looks only for egregious bullying, hate, and scheming? I really like your suggestion and would love to see it fleshed out. The one thing that I feel differentiates from current-day is that I would like to see automatic enrollment (or ability to enroll) for everyone from the target audience, e.g. not student-run and only one clique, but nothing wrong with it also allowing private sub-areas. There shouldn’t be a technological or social barrier to entry, it should be up to each person (child, in this example) to log in and participate. That would probably help a lot of the shy or socially awkward kids bridge the gap. 0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40673691 reply squigz 20 hours agorootparentprev> Now, we ask kids to define themselves completely, wholly, all at once, finally, in front of everyone.

This is hard. You can lead a horse to water but can't make them drink. Meta Quest is the only tech that's being used as a tool in my house. Everything else are used as toys. I've even tried to restrict games heavily and it still was tough. Basically, some kids will not seek out education things even if they are installed. This was not my upbringing. I would eventually bore of games and looked for educational things like Dangerous Creatures, Microsoft Bob, Encarta, etc. But I am not seeing the same in my kids. reply lovethevoid 20 hours agorootparentIt is hard, but don't forget that toys are learning tools too! You can learn a lot without overtly feeling like you're studying. An example is playing a \"learn math\" game vs playing Slay the Spire which innately includes a lot of math you have to grasp. Or Hue to understand color theory and color grading without it ever feeling like a \"lesson\". Kerbal Space Program for basic physics, Portal for momentum and logic (Portal 2 can be great for coop sessions where they figure out how to collaborate and communicate through tough problems that seem impossible). A lot of the lack of curiosity is because so many kids are taught to view curiosity as boring, rather than fostering that curiosity as just another form of play. There are even things like minecraft plugins/servers where text is translated to a language of your choice, and everyone is encouraged to use only that language to collaborate which can be such an exponentially fast way to learn languages without ever feeling like it's a chore.

This was the early 2010s in the United States. Imagine being a teenager and trying to include someone lacking a cellphone to your social group. It adds a huge amount of friction. Including someone without a cellphone means you give up the ability to be spontaneous (assuming the kid needs to adhere to an agreed-upon schedule to be picked up by a parent), and trivial things become a literal telephone-game ordeal. It also means almost invariably that the kid is relying on a friend's phone to communicate parents / a ride, unless that kid is so privileged as to own their own car. Could you imagine if every time you hung out with a friend, they asked to borrow your phone, open Facebook Messenger (or whatever sensitive messaging app you use), and to contact a parent? It also means the kid isn't included in group chats, which means they just aren't part of conversations other kids are having. You can't have a rich social life with someone you can only talk to in classes you share and for 20 minutes during lunch break. The \"green bubble\" phenomenon is bad enough as it is. I don't like it, but for all practical reasons, owning a cellphone is necessary for a kids social life in the United States. reply euroderf 21 hours agorootparent> Could you imagine if every time you hung out with a friend, they asked to borrow your phone, open Facebook Messenger (or whatever sensitive messaging app you use), and to contact a parent?

Well the Unifi system he has setup in his house has a separate ssid for the stepson and his gadgets that gets shut off after 10PM on school nights and if he is punished, remains off until the sanctions are lifted. Kid is blacked out on personal devices but is still allowed to - watch TV if he is done with homework or go out with friends in meat space with strict curfew.

(They weren't allowed actually at school though, weren't even supposed to be in your locker, so I always think it's a bit weird when it occasionally pops up debate about banning them from schools or that X school has banned them - curious when and why they allowed them, or maybe they were just always allowed to begin with?) reply tanseydavid 21 hours agorootparent>> then just go there and hope they show up at the right time and don't want to change plans Why make plans in the first place then?

Thinking about it now, I think mobiles probably had quite a role in changing that: we got phones and then just started texting (hey wuu2 do u wnt 2 go in2 town l8r) instead. I imagine now it's just straight to the latter, (albeit with less txt spk and more memes & emoji) because children get phones and start making their own plans at about the same age.

More than ever, kids are choosing not to go out and spend time with friends, instead doomscrolling, binge-watch tv and chat on instagram or whatever. That's not a bristling social life, but it does behave as a surrogate for one. When kids hang outside of school, as was always the case, they usually live nearby. Notwithstanding that dumbphones and managed social media use are options, unless you think teens are all monsters (which would not be solved by phones anyway), it's not a lord of the flies situation of shunning people without phones. I think there's a culture of inactive shut ins and we're acting like this should be cause for FOMO.

As long as some kids have access, the others will feel like they are being deprived of something fundamental, will resent their parents and will look for any opportunity to get on social media. A technological solution is to have complete control over the computing devices we \"own\". But that goes against the interests of trillion dollar corporations and so we can't have that. Like I was figuring out if there is a way to let my kid use Youtube with a select set of channels, but no. Youtube needs to keep showing suggestions on what to watch next. I would gladly pay for the ability to control what content my kid sees, but Youtube stands to make more profit by getting the kid addicted to their app. reply armchairhacker 19 hours agoparentIt's not just that. Some kids live in unsafe or car-centric areas, with parents who are uncaring or unable to take them to places where they can socialize in-person. Every kid goes to school, but maybe the kids at school bully them, or maybe the school is too focused on coursework and doesn't dedicate enough time for socialization, or maybe the kid is home-schooled. Especially if a ban were enacted today, some kids spent most of their life on social media, so they might have trouble adapting and socializing in-person. Personally, I think the most likely and best solution is better social media. Currently, social media is regulated to shield kids from explicit content and predators, but it should also be regulated to shield them from negativity and mindless engagement, and to promote positivity and healthy behaviors (including not spending too much time on it). Recommendation algorithms for kids should be strictly controlled by the government; keep in mind that the government already strictly controls what kids learn in school, and it doesn't have to outright ban \"non-explicit harmful\" content, just down-weight it enough that kids don't find it without intentionally looking. Plus, a social media with healthier recommendations and discourse may become popular for adults as well, even though they wouldn't be locked into this version like minors (I can imagine a system that requires consent like adult ID but then lets adults stay anonymous, which could be bypassed by dedicated minors, but most wouldn't care enough to do so). reply somethingreen 20 hours agoparentprevI don't know from where came this idea that not having a certain thing will inevitably ruin child's relationship with the parent and cause a collapse of at least some part of their life, but if it was implanted - someone somewhere should have a pure gold Marketer of The Century award on their table.

We have discussed trimming the screen time down even more, since school finished up. Also, she's not doing any social media at all. Still, kids are more fun when they aren't staring at a screen (in my opinion and possibly contrary to what many believe). I think this is obvious to any parent, right? Too much screen time bad. I know it's bad for me as well, though my current bias is heavily against technology in general - I will admit that. reply talldatethrow 19 hours agoparentIf she's not on social media, what is she even doing online these days?

By that I mean instagram/tiktok/snapchat I have been talking to my kids (10/7) about \"the internet\". The normal stuff: no real names, no photos, no giving away details to anyone. They have a shared iPad, but it has time limits, and it stays in the living room. and as an adult leader for a \"uniformed organisation\" for kids, one of the badges is about staying safe online. Some of the shit that I hear from them leaves me a bit worried. Roblox is a fucking nest of paedophiles. Instgram isn't a place for kids, and neither is youtube. But, the biggest issue, apart from google and facebook not having any commercial incentive to stop kids from using their stuff: is parents not talking to their kids to find out whats happening. Who are they talking to? How long are they spending online? What are they watching? You as a parent have to be involved. You can't let your kid wander alone on the internet. You need to set barriers. You don't need to be a helicopter, but you do need to take an interest.

Just because modernity has social nonsense baked into it by default doesn't mean that they were social experiences to begin with. Entertainment, utility and creativity were valued over social e-peen points once upon a time. Shocking, I know. Adding this kind of friction to be able to communicate with family and peers is a recipe for a teenage dropout that's more focused on chump change just to have a phone than further education. I left school at sixteen, I was never given pocket money. You bet having a girlfriend, cool clothes, a phone, an iPod and video games was more important to me than anything my dad had to say, especially when what we were being taught was nothing I had any interest in. The final straw was needing a new computer to run Boinx to make stop-motion animations (my hobby at the time before CG movies really took off). Having the things you want and need is a big deal to teenage brain, especially when they're attainable without much effort and make you happy. If a parent isn't giving resources or nurturing interests and is instead adding friction to something a teen can actually have for themselves, that parent is losing all leverage over a teenager because they can't threaten to take away pocket money and thus their source of \"cool\" and pleasure in life. Kids should focus on their studies if their parents can facilitate them being able to do so. \"I wouldn't allow my kids to leave school at sixteen\", in the UK at the time, they were legally adults, but also didn't stop plenty of kids dropping out at fourteen to work and get the things their parents weren't giving them. Neither parent wanted me to leave, but neither parent was relevant in any way anymore to me, they were just obstacles between me and my teenage bullshit. reply walterbell 22 hours agoprevHas anyone made a rate-limited phone UX? Not just measuring screen time, but pre-agreed quotas, e.g. N mins per hour during specific time periods or locations, for the entire phone, specific apps, and/or contact groups. reply adolph 21 hours agoparentiOS parent controls handle this pretty ok. The time limits can be by application class (which can be customized) or individually. The controls are linked to their Apple ID, so the same permissions flow across devices: tablet, phone, watch (probably desktop too?). The child can request \"more time\" on an app and an alert pops up on the parents' devices (which can be obnoxious until some boundaries are set). The communication/contacts control strikes a reasonable balance too. I think the cell enabled watch offers better mobile function than carrying around a full phone and its baggage of capability. reply ricardobeat 21 hours agorootparentWe went the cell enabled watch route and it’s not there yet. Calling and location often don’t work, even though there is perfect mobile signal. Updates must be managed from a phone, so you need one anyway.

However none of them are essential, and I'm not convinced any of the benefits of these conveniences outweigh ingraining this device dependance on children at critical habit forming points of their lives.

Boomers+: Barely at all Gen X: A bit Gen Y: A real problem Gen Z: I'd be surprised if 5/100 can watch a full length movie without looking at their phone If you consider at what point in life each group gained access to engaging modern tech, there is a clear correlation.

I mean: maps, phone, whatsapp. Obviously in theory stock Android can do that but they don't really take child locks seriously because they have the wrong threat model for it - they think \"it only has to be securish because most children aren't going to be smart enough to circumvent it and it's not serious if they do anyway\", instead of \"it has to be actually secure because you only need one smart child out of thousands to figure out a bypass and it is serious because it affects peoples lives\". So maybe you could have an Android distro where it literally white-lists a few apps and servers at the OS level. reply turboat 20 hours agoparentYes, the market exists and there are several competitors. I've looked at https://sunbeamwireless.com, which runs their Android variant, BasicOS. Haven't purchased yet though. Light Phone is similar. Gabb and Pinwheel sell phones oriented at kids, and both have OSes based on Android. Unfortunately, as you say stock Android as well as iOS don't make effective locks. What they offer is passable for parents managing their kids' phones, although in practice kids often find ways to bypass. It's very difficult for an adult who wants to self-regulate.

It's just a portable computer, you control how and when you interact with it. reply falsaberN1 19 hours agorootparentHeh, the only reason I complain about my phone is because I can't do enough things with it. Or at least not comfortably (and without requiring root, which is easier said than done depending on model). It just annoys me how bad the UX is compared to a proper computer with a keyboard and window management. I was once hospitalized and unable to move, with only my phone to pass time, and the experience was SO frustrating! I don't use my phone a lot, all I got for entertainment is Retroarch, Lichess and a generic sudoku app I got from F-Droid, so obviously my opinion is highly subjective, but it feels like having a supercomputer that can only run MSDOS. One thing at a time in fullscreen with maybe a few passive resident processes. I know some phones let you split things in two or so, but not all of them and the implementation is never flawless or limits what apps can be split. If you mean hating the phone as a social thing, I am a bit self-conscious about being seen using it too much or taking it out in front of someone unless warranted. I wouldn't do stuff like crossing the street or driving with my eyes glued to it. But that's a people problem and not a phone problem, I think. reply swayvil 21 hours agorootparentprevWell, \"control\" is a fuzzy zone. There's temptation, confusion, marketing...

With this they can add an e-sim to the watch with unlimited minutes, and they can stay in touch with their kids 24/7, track their location, etc. Just remember to ALWAYS charge the watch when the kids get home. I also suggest that they lock-down the settings of the kids' watch (the customisation/locking-down is very good) just add a few contacts (papa, mama, sis/bro) and that's it.

Auch, weil Deutschland keine Kontrolle hatte? Der Umweltausschuss nimmt Stellung.Update vom 12. Juni, 16.21 Uhr: Schwere Vorwürfe gegen das Umweltministerium des Bundes: Viel zu fahrlässig habe man chinesische Projekte zum Klimaschutz unterstützt. Dabei seien Millionen an Geldern geflossen, die aus der sogenannten THG-Quote stammten. „Seit August 2023 gibt es erhebliche Betrugsvorwürfe gegen Klimaschutzprojekte in China, welche zur Anrechnung auf die Treibhausgasminderungsquote genutzt werden“, sagte Daniel Rinkert (SPD) in einem Plenum des Umweltausschusses am Mittwoch. „In der heutigen Sitzung wurde das Thema ausführlich diskutiert und Vorwürfe ausgeräumt.“Die Betrugsanschuldigungen bei den Upstream-Emission-Reduction-Projekten – kurz UER-Projekte – seien laut Parlamentarier erheblich und verlangten eine konsequente Aufklärung. Laut Umweltbundesamt stehen aktuell 40 von 60 Projekten in China unter einem Betrugsverdacht. „Das ist Wirtschaftskriminalität im großen Umfang“, sagte Rinkert. „Es ist mehr als offensichtlich, dass bei diesen Projekten keine Kontrolle auf anspruchsvollem Niveau sichergestellt werden kann. Daher wird die Förderung dieser Projekte auch durch die Bundesregierung Ende 2024 eingestellt. Die entsprechende Verordnung wurde am 8. Juni im Kabinett verabschiedet.“Umweltministerium will mit Auswärtigem Amt deutsche Kontrollen in China durchdrückenDas Bundesumweltministerium und das Umweltbundesamt hätten damit „sehr deutlich gemacht“, dass die zuständigen Stellen in Deutschland frühzeitig eine „vollumfängliche Aufklärung“ eingeleitet haben. „In aufwendigen Prüfungsschritten wird seit den ersten aufkommenden Betrugsvorwürfen jedes einzelne Projekt untersucht und überprüft“, betonte Rinkert. Die in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder vorgebrachten Vorwürfe der Tatenlosigkeit der zuständigen Stellen hätten sich damit als haltlos herausgestellt. „Die Union sollte die Vorwürfe daher nicht wiederholen und Nebelkerzen werfen. Sie sollte vielmehr die Bundesregierung bei der Aufklärung unterstützen“, sagte Rinkert.Gemeinsam mit dem Auswärtigen Amt dränge das Umweltministerium nun die chinesische Regierung dazu, eine unabhängige deutsche Kontrollmission in China zuzulassen. Nur dadurch könne ein vollumfänglicher Einblick in die Situation vor Ort gewonnen werden. „Für dieses Vorgehen gibt es die volle Unterstützung der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion“, sagte Rinkert zum Schluss.Millionen-Betrug in China: Haben Konzerne die deutschen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen unterwandert?Erstmeldung vom 11. Juni: Berlin – Der Image-Schaden für den deutschen Klimaschutz dürfte fast schwerer wiegen, als die verlorenen Milliarden an Euros. Nagelneue Ölförderungsanlagen in China sollen angeblich CO₂ einsparen. Gebaut von internationalen Großkonzernen zur „grüneren“ Gewinnung von Öl. Die Bauvorhaben ermöglicht jeder, der in Deutschland tankt. Denn als Nutzer:in von fossilen Brennstoffen zahlt man beim Tanken Klima-Abgaben über die „Treibhausgasminderungsquote“ – kurz THG-Quote. Das Problem: Wahrscheinlich gibt es diese neuen und sauberen Anlagen in China gar nicht, wie Recherchen von ZDF frontal ergaben. Und anscheinend ist es auch nicht möglich für das Umweltministerium des Bundes, den Betrugsvorwürfen effektiv nachzugehen, wie die Welt berichtet.Meine newsUkraine-Schlag auf russische Kampfjets lässt heftige Reaktion folgen: „Putin ist wirklich wütend“lesenAusraster wegen US-Sanktionen: Medwedew droht dem Westen mit massiver Vergeltunglesen„Chaotische Minenfelder“ und Sprengfallen auf 144.000km2: Russland fährt „perfide“ Strategien im Ukraine-KrieglesenVor 53 Min.Selenskyj übt scharfe Kritik an Putins Waffenruhe-Vorschlag: „Hitler hat das Gleiche gemacht“lesenCharkiw-Offensive von Russland: Nato-Offizier spricht von „astronomischen“ Verlusten der Putin-ArmeelesenMehrere Explosionen im Westen der Ukraine – Luftwaffenstützpunkt getroffen?lesenDoch von Anfang an: Verstrickt in den Skandal sind anscheinend mehrere Ölmultis, die die Anlagen angeblich gebaut haben. Die meisten dieser Projekte sollen auf den Öl- und Gasfeldern der Provinz Xinjang entstanden sein. Für die Konzerne ein lukratives Geschäft mit dem Handel von Umwelt-Zertifikaten. Denn für jede eingesparte Tonne Kohlendioxid konnten die Unternehmen bis zu 400 Euro in Deutschland kassieren. Viele Projekte waren nach Recherchen von „ZDF Frontal“ aber nur vorgetäuscht. Eigentlich sollten mit der Umlage Öl- und Gasbohrungen vor allem in China finanziert werden, die umweltfreundlicher als die gewöhnliche Förderung sind. Das scheint in vielen Fällen nicht der Fall gewesen zu sein. (Symbolbild) © Xiao Yijiu/dpaBetrugsverdacht: Chinesischer Konzern meldet sich bei deutschen BehördenDabei waren die Gefahren Geld nach China zu zahlen für solche Projekte dem Bundesumweltministerium eigentlich bekannt. Zuletzt im April meldete sich ein chinesischer Öl- und Gaskonzern von selbst bei dem von Steffi Lemke (Grüne) geführten Umweltministerium und erklärte deutlich, dass von Betrugsfällen auszugehen ist. „Wir vermuten, dass es eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit gibt, dass Dokumente gefälscht wurden und wir bitten dringend, dass Ihre Behörde dazu ermittelt“, teilte der chinesische Konzern dem Ministerium mit. Dieses wimmelte wohl ab, wie die Welt berichtet. Deutsche Prüfstellen haben anscheinend einige Daten der Anlagen des chinesischen Unternehmens geändert und ohne dessen Zustimmung verwendet. Das Ziel war, möglichst hohe CO₂-Einsparungen in Deutschland geltend zu machen. Allein in diesem offenbar gefälschten Projekt ging es laut ZDF um eine Million Tonnen Kohlendioxid, die angeblich eingespart wurden – der Marktwert: etwa 180 Millionen Euro.Ein weiteres Beispiel: Deutsche Autofahrerinnen und Autofahrer zahlten mit ihrer Klima-Abgabe vermutlich rund 80 Millionen Euro für ein Klimaschutzprojekt in der chinesischen Provinz der unterdrückten Uiguren. Am Ende stand dort laut Welt lediglich ein Hühnerstall. Recherchen deutscher Bioenergie-Unternehmen bestätigten den Vorfall.Es existieren wohl mindestens 60 weitere und ähnlich gelagerte Verdachtsfälle in China. Der Schaden könnte sich auf mehr als 4,5 Milliarden Euro belaufen, wie das Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie schätzt. Beim Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie handelt es sich um eine Vertretung der Branche in Berlin.Der Kern des vermutlichen Betrugs liegt in den Klimaschutzauflagen für Öl-Konzerne. Sie sind gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet, die von etwa Benzin und Diesel verursachten Emissionen jährlich zu senken. Die Kennzahlen dafür legt die Bundesregierung fest. Dabei reicht es nicht mehr, biologische Anteile in die Kraftstoffe zu mischen. Da so die Quoten nicht mehr erfüllt werden können.Behörden können zur Kontrolle der Klimaschutz-Projekte nicht in China einreisenEin anderer vom Gesetzgeber vorgesehener Weg zur Einhaltung der THG-Quote ist die Möglichkeit, als Alternative im Ausland CO₂-Sparmaßnahmen zu finanzieren. Bei der Öl- und Gasförderung gibt es verschiedene technische Möglichkeiten, die Emissionen zu drücken. Mit der Reduzierung dieser sogenannten „Upstream-Emissionen“ – kurz UER – dürfen Konzerne seit 2020 ein Fünftel ihrer THG-Quoten erfüllen. Um die UER zu bestimmen, wird eine mögliche Menge an Emissionen der „grünen Anlage“ mit dem Wert verglichen, der entstünde, wenn die Förderungsanlagen nicht mit einem Projekt zur Minderung der Abgase gebaut worden wäre. Der Wert wird dabei über genormte Grundsätze nach ISO 14065 ermittelt. Ölkonzerne können aber auch Zertifikate kaufen, die für eine Klimaschutz-Investition in eine Raffinerie oder andere Förderanlage stehen. Die Ausgaben für alle Vorhaben werden auf den Kraftstoffpreis an der Tankstelle umgelegt.Das Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten 75 dieser UER-Projekte – fast ausschließlich in China. Und das, obwohl weitere Hinweise dafür sprachen, besser nicht dort zu investieren. Denn China lässt unabhängige Kontrollen im eigenen Land nicht zu. Peking verweigert entsprechenden Prüfer:innen die Einreise.„Das Ausmaß des Betrugs am Klimaschutz ist verheerend. Mehr als 7,6 Millionen Tonnen angeblicher CO₂-Einsparung hat es real nie gegeben. Das können wir jetzt nicht einfach mit einem Achselzucken abtun“, sagte Sandra Rostek dazu in einem Statement. Sie ist Leiterin des Hauptstadtbüros Bioenergie. „Hinweisgeber aus der Branche wurden von den Behörden abgewimmelt – noch vor wenigen Wochen wurden offenkundig gefälschte Projekte durchgewunken. Wir hoffen, dass vor dem Hintergrund der Recherche-Ergebnisse des ZDF die verantwortlichen Behörden endlich aufwachen.“Was Rostek mit dem „Durchwinken“ meint, ist die anscheinend unzureichende Prüfung der Bauvorhaben durch das Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle. Über Satellitenbilder wäre einfach zu erkennen gewesen, dass einige der eingereichten chinesischen Vorhaben schon vor dem eigentlichen Baustart existiert haben. Dazu würden die Anlagen in keiner Weise den Vorgaben als UER-Projekt gerecht, wie das ZDF herausfand.In ihrem Ministerium soll es massive Fehler in der Zulassung von Emissions-Projekten gegeben haben: Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke (Grüne). © Kay Nietfeld/dpaMöglicher Milliarden-Betrug: Verbraucherschützer, Opposition und Verbände üben Kritik„Durch fehlerhafte Zertifizierungen und schlampige Kontrollen deutscher Behörden ist nicht nur ein horrender finanzieller Schaden entstanden, sondern auch ein massiver Vertrauensverlust in Klimaschutzprojekte im Ausland“, kritisiert Anja Weisgerber, klimapolitische Sprecherin der Union den Vorfall im Bundestag.Die THG-Quoten an sich sind dadurch laut ADAC kaum aussagekräftig. Manipulierte Reduzierungen durch gefälschte Projekte wie in China sorgen dafür, dass THG-Quoten finanziell günstiger erreicht werden könnten, als durch legal erreichte THG-Quoten. „Damit erzielen Elektrofahrzeughalter geringere Erlöse beim THG-Bonus und das Förderinstrument für Elektromobilität wird geschwächt“, schreibt der Autoclub dazu. Denn Fahrerinnen und Fahrer von E-Autos können die von ihnen nicht ausgestoßenen CO₂-Abgase als Zertifikate an Zwischenhändler verkaufen.Dazu seien die Zuständigkeiten zwischen EU-Kommission und Mitgliedstaat unklar geregelt, es fehle an belastbaren Kontrollmechanismen für Zertifizierungssysteme und Zertifizierer und die Klärung von Hinweisen auf fehlerhafte Zertifizierung dauere zu lange.Verbände, die Politik und der Verbraucherschutz fordern von der Bundesregierung, etwas zu unternehmen. Immerhin: Die Bundesregierung arbeitete nun mit Frankreich und den Niederlanden zusammen, um das Thema auf die Tagesordnung des EU-Minister:innen-Rates zu bringen und die Kommission zum Handeln zu bewegen.

Zuletzt im April meldete sich ein chinesischer Öl- und Gaskonzern von selbst bei dem von Steffi Lemke (Grüne) geführten Umweltministerium und erklärte deutlich, dass von Betrugsfällen auszugehen ist. „Wir vermuten, dass es eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit gibt, dass Dokumente gefälscht wurden und wir bitten dringend, dass Ihre Behörde dazu ermittelt“, teilte der chinesische Konzern dem Ministerium mit.

The German authorities accepted this claim even though there was reasonable doubt and it could not be verified because China doesn't allow German authorities to come to China and verify it.

It'd also be the same as saying that India's medicine factories have a competitive advantage because they're able to illegally dumb toxic waste in rural areas, which is currently the world's biggest breeding ground for super bacteria (resistant to antibiotics) The article doesn't blame China, it's just plainly stating that the currently undertaken initiatives in China are almost all fraudulent.

It obviously is. We are talking about intra-EU advantage, where the same GHG rules apply. If e.g. French industries actually invest in reducing their GHGs instead of using a fraud scheme, isn't that an advantage? > Calling that a competitive advantage is like saying German companies have a competitive advantage because some have been stealing billions of taxes over the last few years via CumEx. Also a competitive advantage. If, let's say now, Spain does more rigorous checks for tax fraud than Germany, then their industry growth is comparatively stifled. And did the participating industries get anything more than a slap in the wrist? German stakeholders pointing each other, and then everybody pointing outside of Germany may work internally, but is not fooling anyone else on the outside.

After all, our Kanzler forgot about it. I still wouldn't call this a competitive advantage. The only companies that gain this advantage do so through fraud. And Germany has a gigantic problem with corrupt politicians that help fraudulent companies profit. It's objectively terrible for Germany, and not a competitive advantage. The companies using these schemes do not pay taxes for the most part, so calling that great for the economy is such a gigantic stretch that it's hilarious. It's great for the politicians though. After all, they always get paid to make the scandals go away. > Nein mein herr. Das ist alles mein herr. /s That's fair, I was definitely too aggressive with that statement. Sorry for that.

What's spicy is that the secretary is a green party member. I am not under the impression that anyone has illusions about the Green party here. It is evident they are greenwashing and destroying environment (for the climate of course) among other things they supposedly \"don't stand for\". The reasons they get votes still is likely due to choosing the lesser evil, even if that is also untrue, or conscience. I have seen the sentiment here too, so I have no illusions that this is going to change either no matter what the Green party does. > Über Satellitenbilder wäre einfach zu erkennen gewesen, dass einige der eingereichten chinesischen Vorhaben schon vor dem eigentlichen Baustart existiert haben.

Not a single name of any multinational corporation is even mentioned in the article. reply Propelloni 11 hours agoparentThe part of China in this situation is that the Chinese government does not allow foreign inspectors into China to check if the sponsored projects are actually doing what they claim, and either China does not check these projects itself or does a bad job at it, thus enabling fraud. I don't know why anyone would sponsor a project in China under these conditions in the first place (or anywhere under similar conditions), but that's a different story.

The choice of China will give a nice cover against an investigation. The controlling powers will then divert the resources to these jurisdictions. The sponsor (Germany) will not see a net benefit but this is the problem with public funds since they are disconnected from the tax payer. reply Propelloni 5 hours agorootparentThanks for clearing that up! However, we don't have cases of embezzlement but of fraud. Of course the fraudster, ie. the involved corporations, would have an interest in obfuscating their tracks, but the sponsor would not. The controlling power is the sponsor, ie. the federal ministry of environmental protection, and I doubt they wanted to be defrauded. This is why I said I don't get why anybody would sponsor under these conditions. That's a case of ineptitude and neglect, but not malice. reply mike_hearn 10 hours agorootparentprevGermans sponsor such projects in China because European emissions aren't growing much and are an irrelevant slice of global output.

The current reality is that US and EU per capita emissions are rather flat ATM whereas those of India and China are on the rise. There is work to do all about, the EU and US could certainly come down per capita (but by how much) and India and China ideally should be capped (but by whom and how) at less per capita than the EU|US currently .. ideally new technology will achieve that while allowing \"modern\" expectations of consumption. The future reality is even should that all come to pass we're still looking at a global net increase in emmissions when ideally we very much want a global reduction.

Well, but India is a huge country. It has 3 times the population of the EU. Which means that pro-capita the EU is emitting 3x more than India. reply mike_hearn 4 hours agorootparentThat's irrelevant though for the purposes of this discussion, which is why are Germans funding projects in China. If you care about absolute levels of emissions the west just isn't relevant. All the decisions that matter are being made in Asia. And as we can see from the fraud rates on these projects, they don't care. reply blackoil 10 hours agorootparentprev> If you want to subsidize people to reduce emissions you have to go where the emissions are. Emission is everywhere and EU can work to further reduce the emissions they have. e.g. heat pumps vs Gas heater, insulation.

It is literally the argument for why they shouldn't set their money on fire and yet.. Germany sponsors such projects for the one and only reason that greenie weenies are all about the perception of doing good rather than rational decision making.

I fear a relapse into authoritarian, racist isolationism and protectionism. It makes me depressed.) but with regards to quality of life all available numbers point in a different direction. Granted, the most up-to-date dataset [1] does not draw a simple graph, but it shows a pretty promising development across twelve areas. Combined it looks pretty good to me. Which metrics do you refer to? Compared to other nations the situation gets even more confusing. The OECD Better Life index [2] places Germany consistently above average. The index is compiled from available data and surveys conducted in the corresponding country. So Germans feel everything is doomed but when asked they rank themselves in most metrics concerning quality of life above average. That does not make sense and I doubt the numbers are wrong. So why are Germans so gloomy? Is it the Mittelschicht-Problem? That's a serious question, because I don't know and it is important.

In the grand scheme, this is (yet) an(other) elaborate scam against the public. Politicians outsource the responsibility of implementing policies to the \"market\" and pretend they're doing something, just to get votes. The \"market\" outsources what they promised to implement to the lowest bidder in some distant land with no oversight. And then they can all blame it to \"China\". reply croes 10 hours agorootparentAnd why did politicians outsource that to the market? It's not like the industry and certain media companies lobbied for it big time claiming the market is so much better. Just look who they voted in Germany for the EU. The same party that blocked the energy transition with faulty studies, made Germany dependent on russian resources, botched the nuclear exit leading to large compensation payments, installed a debt break in the constitution that is based on a faulty Excel calculation etc. Seems to me like people want to get fooled. As soon you tell them the truth they listen to those who promise easy solutions for complex problems. reply m000 10 hours agorootparent> And why did politicians outsource that to the market? It's not like the industry and certain media companies lobbied for it big time claiming the market is so much better. Still the politicians' fault if you ask me. It's in their job description to serve the public interest. And it is granted that there will be attempts to influence them. For this, they are paid well-above the average of a person with similar qualifications, typically granted handsome pension schemes, and afforded many other protections and benefits. All, so they are not financially insecure and susceptible to influence. If they cave to lobby interests against the public interest, they should be held accountable, and not only on election day. reply croes 9 hours agorootparentOf course it's the politicians fault, but voters are to blame too if they fall for campaigns to get rid of those politicians who really want to serve the public interest. One example is the treatment of Robert Habeck, despite the other errors he made he handled the russian gas crises pretty well. He explained in detail what he wants to do, what the consequences are and why he did it the way he did. He still gets attacked by right wing media, voters and the industry just because he had to fix what the prebious government botched on behalf of the german industry because they wanted cheap gas. That was a refreshing amount of clear communication from a politician. The result: h is made fun of because he has also written children's books. Seems like people prefer politicians like Merkel, who said and did next to nothing. Better fail while you try than do nothing. reply Phelinofist 9 hours agorootparentEven though I don't really like the Grünen I think Habeck is quite okay.

It seems to me that people just ... like to forget stuff like that. They just want someone else in charge. And now with the advent of TikTok a certain party frequently targets young people and tells them that there are easy solutions to their problems. Sad thing is, other parties don't seem to get that they need to be where the young people are and provide content that matches what they like to see. I can also only recommend to read \"the invisible doctrine\" by goerge monbiot. Sad enough that I can't think of a similar book in German.

That's something... reply netsharc 11 hours agorootparentPoints 1 and 2 sound like the ravings of a lunatic, but I can agree with points 3 and 4, however unplanned it was by the rulers. Merkel and her finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble were stupid believers in running a country/continent like a family or factory (micro- instead of macroeconomics). If you're in debt, you gotta save. With the Euro crisis and PIIGS (anyone here old enough to remember PIIGS?) inflation problem (caused by the currency pegging masked as a single currency, btw), the continent had a lot of problems. And so Merkel as the de-facto ruler of the EU told everyone to cut social services, social benefits, etc, instead of doing stimulus packages like the Obama admin. The results were more unemployment and destitution, even suicides[1]. And when Merkel decided to show her humane side and allowed Syrians to settle in Germany, it was morally a great move which I agree (how can we call ourselves human if we refuse shelter to humans who are being shot at and bombed - well one way to do it is to not treat them as humans and classify them in our brains, all of them, as cowards (for running away instead of fighting) and lazy benefits-seekers)), but of course for the average Joe European who's been told for many years \"There's no money, we have to save\", to suddenly hear \"We're a prosperous continent, we can do it.\", this sounds like a huge truckload of shit. And the half-hearted policy of just sticking these refugees in makeshift camps and probably no budget in proper integration (and TBH, there's probably lazy refugees too, but then again, wouldn't you lose motivation against bureaucracies that don't let you work, confuse you in a language/culture foreign to yours, etc, even though you fought your way out of a warzone on a precarious journey) didn't make it any better. [1] https://www.bbc.com/news/health-27796628 reply surfingdino 9 hours agorootparentLet me introduce you to this fine German politician https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schr%C3%B6der who \"Since leaving public office, Schröder has worked for Russian state-owned energy companies, including Nord Stream AG, Rosneft, and Gazprom. (...) He was chairman of the board of Nord Stream AG and of Rosneft but in 2022 resigned from the latter and opted not to join the board of Russian state-run gas company Gazprom. (...) In his last days in office in 2005 he signed a deal between Germany and Russian state-owned Gazprom to build Nord Stream 1 before leaving office and almost immediately joining the pipeline company’s board.\" A politician of his calibre cannot function without an extensive support network and connections across the political spectrum. There were a lot of people helping him. It was and still is a broad, cross-party support based on the German Ostpolitik from 1970s. That gives him and the people around him a lot of influence over German and European politics. The Nord Stream deal was designed to make Europe dependent on Russian natural resources and weaken position of Eastern Europe. It was opposed by Eastern European countries who saw it quite rightly as the next Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pac... in disguise. But even if we discard their opinions, here's a document prepared by the European Parliament in 2008 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/... Nobody in Europe was fooled by Russians, but German politicians could not or did not want to hear it. Germans kept rejecting all Eastern European objections to the deal and other decisions that followed, including Nord Stream 2. German politicians crossed the line and began implementing Russian foreign policy in Europe. In 20214 Ukraine paid the price of German Ostpolitik. Here's a good summary of how Germany played this game: https://www.politico.eu/article/germany-inc-played-russian-r... and here's an early summary of Germany's behaviour https://www.osw.waw.pl/en/publikacje/osw-commentary/2014-04-...

You cannot have united Europe with a significant member undermining its principles by making it dependent on energy supplies from an aggressive enemy and being an advocate of the enemy's interests.

Then there was the scandal about leaked chats from a obvious paedophile guy (Holger Arppe), low key criminals like Gunnar Beck who stole something in a shop, etc etc This is met with denial by their rabid voter base. That party doesn't care about Germans or Germany. They care about lining their pockets. That is all. Where that money is coming from doesn't matter.

AfD will continue making huge gains (which I’m absolutely worried about) as long as their opponents continue to reason like toddlers. reply aniviacat 10 hours agorootparentThe AfD still does not believe in man-made climate change. How are you supposed to reason about that? If AfD members ignore obvious scientific developments, you can't really do much more than present yet another paper saying that yes, man-made climate change is indeed a thing, just for then to ignore it, too. You cannot reason with someone who does not want to be reasoned with. You can claim that many policies by the AfD are made in good faith. (I don't believe that, but I'd be willing to entertain the thought.) But once you get to something like if climate change exists, there isn't really any way you can argue with reason anymore. You are met with pure denial. Denial, which is used as a base for action that is clearly and actively destructive. reply Gasp0de 10 hours agorootparentprevSo arguing that someone voting for a (court ruled) nazi who wants mass deportation is a bad person is arguing like a toddler? reply smcin 9 hours agorootparentprev [–] > No one is telling anyone that they are a bad person for voting \"someone else\". That's exactly how Germany got the current disastrous SPD-FDP-Green coalition, whose approval rating is down to 17% (SPD 14%; Greens 15%; FDP only 4%), the worst since that poll started in 1997. Germany's GDP growth was -0.3% in 2023 (gas pipelines inoperational and nuclear plants mothballed) and 0.1-0.2% in 2024 (stagnation, manufacturing fleeing the country). > However, there are some political parties (AfD, NPD)... that have mass deportation of foreigners as their main goals. If you meant \"deport German citizens of foreign origin\", that's unconstitutional. The AfD knows that, it rowed back from that policy. Even trying mass deportations of non-citizens would be widely opposed and would be challenged in courts (up to the ECJ). Obviously whoever the next govt is (most likely CDU/CSU), will restrict new asylum claims, and possibly enact measures to improve assimilation. What percent of votes for the AfD are a tactical vote of no-confidence/protest against the mainstream parties? (like how many mainstream French voters tactically voted FN/RN in 2012 and then 2017 Presidential elections to signal no-confidence in Hollande's socialists, Fillon's Républicains and all the others)? (And in 2018-9 nearly until Covid, Macron was still trying to impose carbon taxes disproportionately on working-class households. That's insane. Also shows total contempt for his own electorate.) So if many of western Europe's voters tactically vote for parties with unimplementable platforms as a message to their preferred mainstream parties to impose more restrictions on immigration, how is that not a democratic exercise in tactical voting? Just like how most parties deliberately campaign on unimplementable policies of taxing/spending/borrowing? (Sunak's current electoral antics in the UK being an example). The weird pattern of the 2024 MEP elections is that Poland's PiS and Hungary's Fidesz lost voteshare, while many western countries tacked centre-right. The EU consensus will meet in the middle. The next multiyear EU Pact on Migration and Asylum will be more restrictive. > If you vote for these people, then yes, you are a bad person and undeniably (very) rightwing. Depends on which election: traditionally in many European countries, voters vote tactically or protest-vote in MEP and/or local elections (~ like the very rough equivalent of voting in midterm elections, for US readers), but then swing back towards the mainstream (or else third-way/independent) in national and/or Presidential elections. One way to estimate the relative size of the protest vote is to look at the differential between voting in MEP/local elections vs national/Presidential elections. Normally we'd have to wait a year or two to find out, but in the case of France, Macron is rolling the dice on calling a snap national election in three weeks, so we can see those vote differentials then. Should be the most interesting comparative data on France for many decades, by issue, by region, by demographic. Worth noting that France's 2024 MEP election turnout was only 51.5% [0], national election turnouts similar, whereas Presidential election turnout in 2027 will be expected to hit ~80% [1]. So that suggests France currently has tons of disaffected mainstream voters, rather than that everyone swung to the right).

    "originLink": "https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/06/07/update-on-the-recall-preview-feature-for-copilot-pcs/",
    "originBody": "AI June 7, 2024 Update on the Recall preview feature for Copilot+ PCs By Pavan Davuluri – Corporate Vice President, Windows + Devices Update: June 13, 2024: Today, we are communicating an additional update on the Recall (preview) feature for Copilot+ PCs. Recall will now shift from a preview experience broadly available for Copilot+ PCs on June 18, 2024, to a preview available first in the Windows Insider Program (WIP) in the coming weeks. Following receiving feedback on Recall from our Windows Insider Community, as we typically do, we plan to make Recall (preview) available for all Copilot+ PCs coming soon. We are adjusting the release model for Recall to leverage the expertise of the Windows Insider community to ensure the experience meets our high standards for quality and security. This decision is rooted in our commitment to providing a trusted, secure and robust experience for all customers and to seek additional feedback prior to making the feature available to all Copilot+ PC users. Additionally, as we shared in our May 3 blog, security is our top priority at Microsoft, in line with our Secure Future Initiative (SFI). This is reflected in additional security protections we are providing for Recall content, including “just in time” decryption protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS), so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates. The development of Copilot+ PCs, Recall and Windows will continue to be guided by SFI. When Recall (preview) becomes available in the Windows Insider Program, we will publish a blog post with details on how to get the preview. To try Recall (preview) WIP customers will need a Copilot+ PC due to our hardware requirements. We look forward to hearing Windows Insider feedback. Today, we are sharing an update on the Recall (preview) feature for Copilot+ PCs, including more information on the set-up experience, privacy controls and additional details on our approach to security. On May 20, we introduced Copilot+ PCs, our fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever. Copilot+ PCs have been reimagined from the inside out to deliver better performance and all new AI experiences to help you be more productive, creative and communicate more effectively. One of the new experiences exclusive to Copilot+ PCs is Recall, a new way to instantly find something you’ve previously seen on your PC. To create an explorable visual timeline, Recall periodically takes a snapshot of what appears on your screen. These images are encrypted, stored and analyzed locally, using on-device AI capabilities to understand their context. When logged into your Copilot+ PC, you can easily retrace your steps visually using Recall to find things from apps, websites, images and documents that you’ve seen, operating like your own virtual and completely private “photographic memory.” You are always in control of what’s saved. You can disable saving snapshots, pause temporarily, filter applications and delete your snapshots at any time. As AI becomes more prevalent, we are rearchitecting Windows to give customers and developers more choice to leverage both the cloud and the power of local processing on the device made possible by the neural processing unit (NPU). This distributed computing model offers choice for both privacy and security. All of this work will continue to be guided by our Secure Future Initiative (SFI). Our team is driven by a relentless desire to empower people through the transformative potential of AI and we see great utility in Recall and the problem it can solve. We also know for people to get the full value out of experiences like Recall, they have to trust it. That’s why we are launching Recall in preview on Copilot+ PCs – to give customers a choice to engage with the feature early, or not, and to give us an opportunity to learn from the types of real world scenarios customers and the Windows community finds most useful. Listening to and acting on customer feedback Even before making Recall available to customers, we have heard a clear signal that we can make it easier for people to choose to enable Recall on their Copilot+ PC and improve privacy and security safeguards. With that in mind we are announcing updates that will go into effect before Recall (preview) ships to customers on June 18. First, we are updating the set-up experience of Copilot+ PCs to give people a clearer choice to opt-in to saving snapshots using Recall. If you don’t proactively choose to turn it on, it will be off by default. Second, Windows Hello enrollment is required to enable Recall. In addition, proof of presence is also required to view your timeline and search in Recall. Third, we are adding additional layers of data protection including “just in time” decryption protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS) so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates. In addition, we encrypted the search index database. Secure by design and secure by default In line with Microsoft’s SFI principles, before the preview release of Recall to customers, we are taking steps to increase data protection. Copilot+ PCs will launch with “just in time” decryption protected by Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS), so Recall snapshots will only be decrypted and accessible when the user authenticates. This gives an additional layer of protection to Recall data in addition to other default enabled Window Security features like SmartScreen and Defender which use advanced AI techniques to help prevent malware from accessing data like Recall. We also know the best way to secure information on a PC is to secure the whole PC itself. We want to reinforce what has previously been shared from David Weston, vice president of Enterprise and OS Security, about how Copilot+ PCs have been designed to be secure by default and share additional details about our security approach. Some notable examples of security enhancements include: All Copilot+ PCs will be Secured-core PCs, bringing advanced security to both commercial and consumer devices. In addition to the layers of protection in Windows 11, Secured-core PCs provide advanced firmware safeguards and dynamic root-of-trust measurement to help protect from chip to cloud. Microsoft Pluton security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs. Pluton is a chip-to-cloud security technology – designed by Microsoft and built by silicon partners – with Zero Trust principles at the core. This helps protect credentials, identities, personal data and encryption keys, making them significantly harder to remove from the device, even if a user is tricked into installing malware or an attacker has physical possession of the PC. All Copilot+ PCs will ship with Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS). This provides more secure biometric sign ins and eliminates the need for a password. Protecting your privacy on Copilot+ PCs In our early internal testing, we have seen different people use Recall in the way that works best for them. Some love the way it makes remembering what they’ve seen across the web so much easier to find than reviewing their browser history. Others like the way it allows them to better review an online course or find a PowerPoint. And people are taking advantage of the controls to exclude apps they don’t want captured in snapshots, from communication apps or Teams calls, or to delete some or all their snapshots. This is why we built Recall with fine-grained controls to allow each person to customize the experience to their comfort level, ensuring your information is protected and that you are in control of when, what and how it is captured. Snapshots are stored locally. Copilot+ PCs have powerful AI that works on your device itself. No internet or cloud connections are used to store and process snapshots. Recall’s AI processing happens exclusively on your device, and your snapshots are kept safely on your local device only. Your snapshots are yours and they are not used to train the AI on Copilot+ PCs. Snapshots are not shared. Recall does not send your snapshots to Microsoft. Snapshots are not shared with any other companies or applications. Recall doesn’t share snapshots with other users who are signed into the same device, and per-user encryption ensures even administrators cannot view other users’ snapshots. You will know when Recall is saving snapshots. You’ll see Recall pinned to the taskbar when you reach your desktop. You’ll have a Recall snapshot icon on the system tray letting you know when Windows is saving snapshots. Digital rights managed or InPrivate browsing snapshots are not saved. Recall does not save snapshots of digital rights managed content or InPrivate browsing in supported web browsers. You can pause, filter and delete what’s saved at any time. You’re always in control of what’s saved as a snapshot. You can disable saving snapshots, pause them temporarily, filter applications and websites from being in snapshots, and delete your snapshots at any time. Enterprise and customer choice. For customers using managed work devices, your IT administrator is provided the control to disable the ability to save snapshots. However, your IT administrator cannot enable saving snapshots on your behalf. The choice to enable saving snapshots is solely yours. Empowering people with experiences they can trust We are on a journey to build products and experiences that live up to our company mission to empower people and organizations to achieve more, and are driven by the critical importance of maintaining our customers’ privacy, security and trust. As we always do, we will continue to listen to and learn from our customers, including consumers, developers and enterprises, to evolve our experiences in ways that are meaningful to them. We are excited for the upcoming launch of Copilot+ PCs on June 18 and for the innovative new features and benefits this entirely new category of PCs will bring.

    "commentBody": "Microsoft's Recall AI feature is now indefinitely delayed (windows.com)144 points by retskrad 1 hour agohidepastfavorite50 comments digging 41 minutes agoThis is confusing and vague to me, which I believe is exactly the intent. It focuses on security, reiterates that security is their top priority (and we know that this is untrue). What were the security problems? They don't even allude to the existence or detection of any specific security problems. It sounds to me like they're figuring out a new marketing approach, or they're softening the blow by \"listening to users\" and then rolling out more slowly, when outrage has died down and people will just accept it. reply segasaturn 33 minutes agoparentMy takeaway is that Microsoft has been trying to boil the frog, but slipped and turned the temperature up too quickly. They're retreating for now, but make no mistake that Recall will slowly trickle back into Windows under another name. Every major power broker wants something like Recall to become the norm - bosses to spy on their employees, governments to spy on their citizens/enemies, and tech CEO's to collect training data for AI and target more ads at end users. reply ugjka 24 minutes agorootparentThere are already Recall type of products on the market, not just that, they also work on the cloud not just locally. All Microsoft had to do was make it opt in by default reply simonw 21 minutes agorootparentprevThis is a very cynical take. I've not seen anything to make me think this feature is intended for surveillance as opposed to personal utility. The personal utility benefits are very clear to me - the problem is the ease with which malicious attackers might steal the data (if they can breach the system). reply neltnerb 1 minute agorootparentI do not think it is cynical to assume that Microsoft would sell this to companies as a way to do constant surveillance of their employees with OCR and LLMs used to make it easier for a manager to sift through massive amounts of data. That's just an actual use case that their true customers would pay for, I think it's awful and should be illegal under any reasonable worker protections but why would they not advertise it this way privately to business customers? I also don't think it's cynical to think that a manager looking for a reason to get rid of someone will have a much easier time justifying a PIP or just straight up firing someone if they can retroactively have an AI do it for them. Why wouldn't they be able to ask the system \"how much of 's time do they spend doing things on the computer that are not directly related to ?\" Is it technically happening already? Sure, there's nasty nasty spyware being forced on people and it is awful and I hate that those employers are getting away with it. But integrated into the OS, on by default, with a long memory? Just imagine how easy it will be to fire anyone that tries to unionize in an effort to fight against such surveillance. reply Avshalom 4 minutes agorootparentprevIt's a system that constantly surveils you, of course it's meant for surveillance.

There's a strong chance that the primary reason is for personal utility. But MS (like all big tech) are all about two-birds-one-stone wins. If you can get the personal utility, while also gaining capability that \"rightsholders\" and advertisers, etc will want, that's a huge win to them. Reminds me a lot of Apple's hardware DRM that is primarily about reducing the value of stolen Apple hardware, but which also serves to make third party repairs way more difficult and expensive, which is not a \"con\" to them. reply throw20240511 6 minutes agorootparentprevand your take is quite naive. Surveillance is absolutely the purpose, overt or not.

They had to get all that backlash to understand why everyone wouldn't want it. Is someone at Microsoft taking crazy pills to think consumers would be into that? They pulled the exact same shit 11 years ago when they launched the Xbox One as a \"home media center\" instead of a gaming console and it came with mandatory always-on internet connection, disc games DRM tied to a single console unable to lend them to a friend, and with Kinect camera, and just like this time, it took community backlash to get them to roll back on this shit while Sony was having the time of their lives seeing how the succes of the PS4 was already in the bag from the start before they evens started. What is wrong with them? Does Microsoft think consumers are stupid masochists who enjoy being shit on by megacorporations while paying for the privilege? Does Nadella not look into the stupid decisions his execs are making and make necessary organizational adjustments to prevent stuff like this? People shit on Steve Balmer but I don't remember Microsoft's products having that level of anti-consumer disrespect during his tenure. Sure Microsoft Zune and Window Phone 7-10 eventually flopped, by not because they had anti-consumer features but because they were too late and not very popular. And the Xbox 360, despite the Red ring of death was still smash hit. Now, Microsoft is an even richer company that during Balmer's tenure but it's products seem way more anti-consumer.

For almost all tech companies - hell, almost all companies in the modern world - customer abuse is a first-class strategy. Some push it further than others, some are more blatant than others. It's probably not about them being insanely out-of-touch with what people want, but about them miscalculating what people will tolerate.

    "originBody": "Cost Of Self Hosting Llama-3 8B-Instruct Sid Premkumar,Thu Jun 13 2024•llama-3 Back How much does it cost to self host a LLM? ⚡ TLDR: Assuming 100% utilization of your model Llama-3 8B-Instruct model costs about $17 dollars per 1M tokens when self hosting with EKS, vs ChatGPT with the same workload can offer $1 per 1M tokens. Choosing to self host the hardware can make the cost \") ] now = time.time() print(f\"Starting pipeline now: {now}...\") outputs = pipeline( messages, max_new_tokens=256, eos_token_id=terminators, do_sample=True, temperature=0.8, top_p=0.9, ) modelOutput = outputs[0][\"generated_text\"][-1] later = time.time() difference = int(later - now) print(f\"Prompt took: {difference} seconds to respond: {modelOutput}”) These results seemed a lot more promising as the response time lowered from ~10m to sub 10 seconds consistently. I was able to get a response in a much more reasonable 5-7 seconds. At this point I wanted to start calculating the cost of this request. g5dn.12xlarge costs $3.912 per hour on demand (see (opens in a new tab)). If we assume a full month of use, that costs: Per hour cost * 24 * 30 = Total Cost $3.912 * 24 * 30 = $2,816.64 I had trouble with getting the token count in hugging face so ended up using llama-tokenizer-js (opens in a new tab) to get an approximation of tokens used. Note: This ended up being incorrect way of calculating the tokens used. If we look at this result, we assume we used 39 tokens over ~6 seconds. Assuming Im processing tokens 24/7, extrapolating that we get: 39 tokens over 6 seconds = 6.5 tokens/s With 6.5 tokens per second, over the month I can process: Tokens Per Second * 60 (to get to minutes) * 60 (to get to hours) * 24 (to get to days) * 30 (to get to month) = Total Tokens Per Month 6.5 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 16,848,000 With 16,848,000 tokens per month, every million tokens costs: Total Cost / Total Tokens processed => Cost per token * 1,000,000 => Cost Per 1M token ( 2,816.64 / 16,848,000 ) * 1,000,000 = $167.17 😵Yikes. It is not looking good. Lets compare this to what ChatGPT 3.5 can get us. Looking at their pricing (opens in a new tab), ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo charges $0.5 per 1M input token, and $1.5 per 1M output token. For sake of simplicity, assuming an average input:output ratio, that means per 1M tokens they charge $1 and thats the number to beat. Far from my $167.17. Realization Something Was Wrong At this point I felt I was doing something wrong. Llama 3 with 8B params is hard to run, but I didn’t feel it should be this hard, especially considering I have 4 GPUs available 🤔. I decided to try to use vLLM to host an API server instead of attempting to do it myself via hugging face libraries. This was dead simple and just involved me installing ray and vllm via pip3 and then changing my docker entry point to: python3 -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --tensor-parallel-size 4 --dtype=half --port 8000 Specifically noting that I call —tensor-parallel-size 4 to enforce that we use all 4 GPUs. Using this got significantly better results. In this example you can see the query took 2044ms to complete. This was also the time I realized my previous method of calculating token usage was incorrect. vLLM returned the tokens used which was perfect. Going back to cost, now we can calculate tokens per second: Total Tokens / Total Time => Token/s 124/2.044 => 60.6 Token/s Again assuming I produce tokens 24/7, this means that I can ingest a total of: Tokens Per Second * 60 (to get to minutes) * 60 (to get to hours) * 24 (to get to days) * 30 (to get to month) 60.6 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 157,075,200 Which means the cost per 1 million tokens would cost me: Total Cost / Total Tokens processed => Cost per token * 1,000,000 => Cost Per 1M token ( 2,816.64 / 157,075,200 ) * 1,000,000 = $17.93 Unfortunately this is still not below the value that ChatGPT offers, you’d lose about $17 a day 😭 An Unconventional Approach Instead of using AWS another approach involves self hosting the hardware as well. Even after factoring in energy, this does dramatically lower the price. Assuming we want to mirror our setup in AWS, we’d need 4xNVidia Tesla T4s. You can buy them for about $700 dollars on eBay Add in $1,000 to setup the rest of the rig and you have a final price of around: $2,800 + $1,000 = $3,800 If we calculate energy for this, we get about ~$50 bucks. I determined power consumption by 70W per GPU + 20W overhead: After factoring in the ~$3,800 fixed cost, you have a monthly cost of ~$50 bucks, lets round up to ~$100 to factor any misc items we might have missed. Re-calculating our cost per 1M tokens now: Total Cost / Total Tokens processed => Cost per token * 1,000,000 => Cost Per 1M token ( 100 / 157,075,200 ) * 1,000,000 = $0.000000636637738 Which is significantly cheaper than our ChatGPT costs. Trying to determine when you’d break even, assuming you want to produce 157,075,200 tokens with ChatGPT, you’re looking at a bill of: 157 * Cost per 1M token ~= 157 * $1 = $157 You have a fixed cost of ~$100 a month, which results in a ‘profit’ of $57. To make up your initial server cost of $3,800, you’d need about 66 months or 5.5 years to benefit from this approach. Although this approach does come with negatives such as having to manage and scale your own hardware, it does seem to be possible to undercut the prices that ChatGPT offer by a significant amount in theory. In pracitice however, you'd have to evaluate how often you are utilizing your LLM, these hypotheticals all assume 100% utilization which is not realistic and would have to be tailord per use case. 2024 © lytix.ai.",

The SOFTWARE is not licensed for datacenter deployment, except that blockchain processing in a datacenter is permitted. - https://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownloads/licence.php?l... There's no further elaboration on what \"datacenter\" means here, and it's a fair argument to say that a closet with one consumer-GPU-enriched PC is not a \"datacenter deployment\". The odds that Nvidia would pursue a claim against an individual or small business who used it that way is infinitesimal. So both the ethical issue (it's a fair-if-debatable read of the clause) and the practical legal issue (Nvidia wouldn't bother to argue either way) seem to say one needn't worry about.

SageMaker Jumpstart includes some pretty easy out-of-the-box configurations for fine-tuning models that are a good starting point. They will incorporate some basic quantization and other cost-savings techniques to help reduce the total compute time. To help control costs, you can choose pretty conservative settings in terms of how long you want to let the model train for. Once that iteration is done and you have a model artifact saved, you can always pick back up and perform more rounds of training using the previous checkpoint as a starting point. reply johnklos 49 minutes agoparentprev> How long did this server take to build?

I think the distinction the author intends to make is between running something that can't be hosted elsewhere, like ChatGPT, versus running Llama-3 yourself. Overlooking that, the rest of the article feels a bit strange. Would we really have a use case where we can make use of those 157 million tokens a month? Would we really round $50 of energy cost to $100 a month? (Granted, the author didn't include power for the computer) If we buy our own system to run, why would we need to \"scale your own hardware\"? I get that this is just to give us an idea of what running something yourself would cost when comparing with services like ChatGPT, but if so, we wouldn't be making most of the choices made here such as getting four NVIDIA Tesla T4 cards. Memory is cheap, so running Llama-3 entirely on CPU is also an option. It's slower, of course, but it's infinitely more flexible.

The fact that the rest of the article talks about \"enabled users to run their own servers on remote hardware or virtual machines\" is just wrong.

I have a bunch of problems with LLM's in general. The major one is that all LLMs(even openAI) will produce output which will give anyone a great sense of confidence, only to be later slapped across the face with the harsh reality-for anything involving serious reasoning, chances are the response you got was at large bullshit. The second one is that I do not entirely trust those companies with my data, be it OpenAI, Microsoft or Github or any other. That said, a while ago there was this[1] thread on here which helped me snatch a brand new, unboxed p40 for peanuts. Really, the cost was 2 or 3 jars of good quality peanut butter. Sadly it's still collecting dust since although my workstation can accommodate it, cooling is a bit of an issue - I 3D printed a bunch of hacky vents but I haven't had the time to put it all together. The reason why I went this road was phi-3, which blew me away by how powerful, yet compact it is. Again, I would not trust it with anything big, but I have been using it for sifting through a bunch of raw, unstructured text and extract data from it and it's honestly done wonders.

So it does splitting. --- (2) EVAL WORD TO STRING But there are many other contexts where the shell does not \"want\" a sequence of strings. It wants a SINGLE string. And conversely, it actually JOINS arrays of strings, rather than splitting. Usually \"$@\" is an array / sequence of strings, while $@ or $* is a string, roughly speaking. But the shell doesn't want sequences of strings in MANY cases, e.g. a=$@ # I only want 1 string here, so I JOIN rather than splitting echo hi > \"$@\" # redirect arg (not all shells agree though!) case \"$@\" in ... esac # as you point out So the bottom line is that variables aren't really strings OR arrays of strings. Whatever the shell wants, it converts it to. And shells also DISAGREE on the specifics of those rules. POSIX shell has the array \"$@\", but arrays in general are not in POSIX. --- And even worse, think about this case: local x=$a Does it behave like an assignment, which wants a single string? Or does it behave like a simple command, which wants a sequence? You can look at it both ways. The bottom line is that assignment builtins are special and they don't follow the normal rules of simple commands. Shells have differed, but POSIX decided on this awhile ago. --- This is all of course mind numbing trivia that has no real reason for existing ...

There's no auto-conversion, and you can upgrade to those rules with shopt --set ysh:upgrade reply unnah 1 hour agorootparentThat's also one of the more notable incompatibilities of zsh - by default it treats $a the same as \"$a\", and you're supposed to use arrays if you want multiple words. Although I'm not an expert - maybe ysh and zsh differ in the details here? reply chubot 51 minutes agorootparentYup, in terms of ls $a -- YSH happens to be like zsh. OSH is compatible with bash and does the POSIX word splitting, but YSH is not. In general YSH is pretty different than zsh though -- it's more of a Python- JS-like language with structured data, e.g. ysh$ var a = ['list', 'of' strings'] ysh$ write -- @a list of strings In zsh I still think that's the pretty obscure \"${a[@]}\" rather than @a. Arrays are also \"flat\" in zsh -- you can't have an array of arrays, because there's no garbage collector. But YSH has arbitrarily nested JSON-like data structures, and JSON serialization built in.

Anything you add from there is gravy. It's more for implementers than users, e.g. for someone writing a new shell rather than writing shell scripts. Having the standard handy is also pretty useful when writing foreign interfaces, like the posix modules in python and perl. As for the current state of POSIX, well, you're looking at it. Might find a blog or two of someone on the POSIX committees, but the organizations aren't the kind that keep blogs. Probably best to just dive into the Wikipedia article on POSIX and start following the references on the bottom. You'll probably want to look into SUS, the Single Unix Specification, as well: it's identical to POSIX (plus curses for some reason) but it's the label that OS vendors may use rather than POSIX. macOS and some Linux distributions claim to be fully SUS-compliant; Linux as a whole does not, because its official scope is limited to the kernel which only implements a subset of POSIX. Fun fact: the name \"POSIX\" was coined by Richard Stallman. reply jjmarr 3 hours agoparentprevThe original discussion on why Debian switched from bash to dash for /bin/sh is insightful. https://lwn.net/Articles/343924/ One big factor is for performance reasons in shell scripts. At the time, the switch decreased boot times for Debian by 7.5%. Bourne shell features add a lot of overhead and that's not always an acceptable tradeoff.

I seem to recall it was much smaller than that, something like 4% on a 2008 EEE-PC or something like that, but I can't find any numbers on that right now. The Debian startup scripts were already POSIX; it's not hard to get better performance out of zsh or bash by avoiding expensive processes lookups. Overall, I consider this to be mostly a myth, or at least extremely simplistic. reply susam 4 hours agoparentprev> Aren't people targetting bash or basic bourne shell features intead of posix? I know many banks still have AIX systems with shells like ksh89, ksh93, etc. as the default shell. So if a shell script is written to work with a POSIX shell (instead of a particular shell), it has a better chance of running on such systems. Also, on Debian, the default non-interactive shell is dash [1]. This is the Debian Almquist Shell (dash). It is a POSIX-compliant shell derived from ash. So again, if we write system scripts for Debian and want it to run on Debian without any hassle, it makes sense to write the system scripts to conform to POSIX shell. Although shellcheck cannot perform full POSIX compliance check at this time, it is still a pretty good tool that can help with checking compliance with dash in particular.

After all, Debian uses Bash as the default interactive shell. But that's not the point of writing system scripts for dash. They are written for dash because that's still the default non-interactive shell. And it is so because dash is leaner and faster.

    "title": "Lamini Memory Tuning: 10x Fewer Hallucinations",
    "originLink": "https://www.lamini.ai/blog/lamini-memory-tuning",
    "originBody": "Introducing Lamini Memory Tuning: 95% LLM Accuracy, 10x Fewer Hallucinations TLDR: Lamini Memory Tuning is a new way to embed facts into LLMs that improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations to previously unachievable levels — for one Fortune 500 customer, Lamini Memory Tuning led to 95% accuracy compared to 50% with other approaches. Hallucinations were reduced from 50% to 5%. Lamini Memory Tuning is a research breakthrough that overcomes a seeming paradox in the AI world: achieving precise factual accuracy (i.e. no hallucinations) while upholding the generalization capabilities that make LLMs valuable in the first place. The method entails tuning millions of expert adapters (e.g. LoRAs) with precise facts on top of any open-source LLM, like Llama 3 or Mistral 3. If the goal is to get Roman Empire facts exactly right, Lamini Memory Tuning would create experts on Caesar, aqueducts, legions, and any other facts you provide. Inspired by information retrieval, the model retrieves only the most relevant experts from an index at inference time — not all the model weights — so latency and cost are dramatically lower. High accuracy, high speed, low cost: with Lamini Memory Tuning, you don’t have to choose. Contact us to try Lamini Memory Tuning. Accuracy matters immensely Yet, general-purpose LLMs are designed to hallucinate, because they are trained to reduce the average error across the examples they’ve seen. They’re pretty good at everything, but perfect at nothing. They can produce fluent English prose because they’ve seen so much of it across the internet, but specific facts—like a date, a revenue number, or a variable name—get muddled in probabilities. As a result, companies have not been able to count on LLMs for the most critical and most valuable use cases – until now. Introducing Lamini Memory Tuning Lamini Memory Tuning is a completely new way to fine-tune any existing LLM by tuning millions of LoRA adapters and selecting across them in a wide Mixture of Experts at inference time. Instead of optimizing average error on everything, Lamini Memory Tuning optimizes for zero error on the specific facts you tell it to remember, so it recalls those facts nearly perfectly. That’s not special on its own. This approach is particularly groundbreaking because it preserves the LLM’s ability to generalize with average error on everything else, and thus continue to produce fluent prose around those facts. Lamini Memory Tuning is a systematic tool for eliminating hallucinations on the facts you care about. Fortune 500 customers are already using Lamini Memory Tuning to achieve 95% factual accuracy on critical use cases where previous state-of-the-art approaches peaked at 50%. THE PROBLEM Prompting and RAG: necessary but not sufficient Prompting and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are important methods for surfacing relevant information to the model, shifting its probabilities to consider similar information. This is an important step to getting the model to condition on the right concepts and information, because the model has been trained on so many tasks. Good prompt-engineering and RAG pipelines are critical to improve the overall accuracy of the model. At times, this is all you need. But other times, you provide the relevant information and the response is still wrong but so close to right — leading to hallucinations. Why do hallucinations happen with the right data? In the model’s internal representation, the right answer is likely clustered with similar, but wrong, options. The right context increases the probabilities of the right answer and nearby wrong options. The model doesn’t know that a nearly right answer is still wrong, because general models don’t distinguish between exactly right and nearly right — they never learned to take the loss on those answers to zero. Prompting and RAG don’t change that. Lamini Memory Tuning addresses this directly, by combining methods from information retrieval and AI to teach the model that getting the answer nearly right is the same as getting it totally wrong. Instruction fine-tuning: the wrong tool for the job Many teams turn to instruction fine-tuning when other techniques hit a wall on factual accuracy, but instruction fine-tuning, with or without LoRAs, lead to the same issue that pre-training has: it gets to be pretty good at a more narrow dataset, but still perfect at nothing, while being finicky to work with (losing the ability to perform on some general tasks, if you do it wrong). As a result, teams struggle with unclear choices, long feedback loops, high compute bills, and ultimately underwhelming performance improvements. While instruction fine-tuning can be really valuable (it’s what turned GPT-3 into ChatGPT), it doesn't make models perfect at the facts that matter. In other words, traditional fine-tuning does not ensure that the model's answers are faithful to facts in its training data. This is why we developed Lamini Memory Tuning. OUR INNOVATION Lamini Memory Tuning: near-perfect fact recall via 1 million-way MoE Lamini Memory Tuning is a fundamentally different fine-tuning approach that effectively teaches any open-source LLM to be near-perfect on facts, while still maintaining its ability to be pretty good at everything else. When the model is supposed to recall a specific fact, Lamini Memory Tuning shifts the entire probability mass to that particular fact (i.e. specific tokens within a particular context), such as the exact SQL schema for your database. This results in output probabilities that are not just closer to the right result, but exactly there. To do this, Lamini Memory Tuning tunes a massive mixture of memory experts on any open-source LLM. Each memory expert acts like a LoRA adapter that functionally operates as memory for the model. Together, the memory experts specialize in a million different ways to ensure faithful and factual accuracy to the data that it was tuned on. Inspired by information retrieval, these million memory experts are equivalent to indices from which the model intelligently retrieves and routes. At inference time, the model retrieves the most relevant experts at each layer and merges back into the base model to respond to the user query. The result is a sparsely activated model, called a Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME), that can scale to an enormous number of parameters at a fixed computational inference cost. This means MoMEs have extremely high capacity for the number of facts that can be learned, bounded only by the total size of the training data set. Llama 3 was trained on 15 trillion tokens. Realistically, you will run out of system memory before you run out of memory capacity in a MoME. Ultimately, this approach makes what were impossible use cases that critically suffer from hallucinations within reach, and drastically improves LLM time-to-accuracy and thus time-to-market. Read more details in our research paper. Results Lamini Memory Tuning has been a game-changing capability with Lamini’s Fortune 500 clients, who are deploying it for the following use cases: High precision text-to-SQL Client need: Democratize data access by using LLMs to turn natural language questions into database queries.

That’s kind of surprising to me - it would mean with every new Lora they’d need to fine tune the router, no? Embedding a description of the Lora and using RAG to pull the nearest Loras in the embedding space is where my mind goes; it’s super extensible, minimal additional training for customer use cases, and the way the Loras probably work it’s not terrible to pull a few extras. Anyway I just speculate —- no idea what they’re actually doing on the backend. reply liuliu 3 hours agorootparentThat's where it is confusing to me. They mentioned that for LoRA fine-tuning, the router weights are frozen, so you don't update the routing when training different concept. But how that expert router is trained? Could be a pretraining with some aux loss to encourage diversity. reply sage92 13 hours agoparentprevThey mention \"tuning millions of expert adapters\", not 100k reply magicalhippo 3 hours agoparentprevBit late to the party and I'm not into the AI scene, but from glossing over the three key papers they cite to describe their model, my take is as follows. The idea from LoRA[1] is to take pre-trained, dense weights W_0 for a model and adapt them to new training data by using the weights W = W_0 + BA for inference. The key is that the matrices A and B have a very low rank[2] compared to W_0. Training is then done by treating W_0 as constant, and only updating the A and B matrices. The idea from MoE[3] is to pick just a few \"experts\" from a large number using Softmax, and insert them between other layers in a neural network. The \"experts\" can be just some simple matrices or neural networks in their own right. The Lamini model seems to combine these ideas, where they use several \"experts\" layered between the BA matrices. However instead of just a simple Softmax to select the \"experts\" they use (chunked?) cross-attention[4], and a much larger number of \"experts\" compared to the MoE paper. From what I gather the cross-attention allows the expert selection to react to the context, unlike the more naive plain Softmax gating approach. Similarly to LoRA, they train the Lamini model by keeping the pre-trained LLM weights constant. From what I can gather they do a bit of training on the cross-attention layer but then freeze that too, to avoid the cross-attention layer favoring the same \"experts\" all the time. The idea then is to train the \"experts\" and the LoRA layer on facts until the combined model (W above) gets each fact correct (zero loss). Thus when the model \"sees\" a keyword in a sentence, a set of \"experts\" will steer/adjust the output of the pre-trained LLM to output the correct fact. Or at least that's how I imagine it works. What's less clear to me is what exactly the \"experts\" are and how they are combined. Since they're used to adjust the weights of the combined model, I it makes the most sense to my un-trained eye that they're simple matrices as mentioned in the MoE paper. Given they're layered between the low-rank portions of the LoRA section, they're necessarily relatively small matrices, so having millions of these \"expert\" matrices doesn't add too many parameters overall. And while they're portrayed as stacked in the Lamini paper, suggesting matrix multiplication, matrices are generally not commutative[5]. So to the un-trained eye it seems likely the \"experts\" are simply added like in the MoE paper. But yeah, I'm very much not an expert and the paper was more like a conference poster at best, lacking a lot of detail, so this might be all gibberish and I'd appreciate being corrected.

Because people perceive 1/4 to be larger than 1/3. reply 22c 16 hours agoparentprevI think it depends how you think of the initial number, I think of it as a fraction and the multiplier applies to the denominator. eg. if hallucinations occur roughly 1 in 20 prompts then 10x fewer is 1 in 200 prompts, rather than 0.1 in 20 prompts. reply m463 15 hours agorootparentIsn't 1 in 200 equivalent to .1 in 20? reply bryzaguy 14 hours agorootparentIt is. I think their point is “10x fewer” makes sense if you imagine going from a denominator of 20 to 200. reply scottapotamas 16 hours agoparentprevBigger number better, obviously! I am also annoyed by most modern tech marketing using percentages incorrectly and inconsistently. But 150% is a bigger number than 1.5x so I suppose their hands are tied. reply esafak 16 hours agoparentprevThey are overloading \"fewer\" to mean division as well as subtraction. According to this logic \"twice fewer\" means \"half as much\". reply Dylan16807 10 hours agorootparentFewer is subtraction, times fewer is division. More is addition, times more is multiplication (or 1 plus multiplication, oops). I don't think anyone says \"twice fewer\". Or \"twice more\" when talking about quantities. reply peter_l_downs 18 hours agoprevHas anyone here used this, or anything similar? This sounds phenomenal if it really works. Looks like “contact us” is the only way to try it or buy it right now, and the purported benefit (memorize facts up to the model training size, basically trillions of tokens of facts) is wild. I’d love to try a system running this way to understand the failure modes, like for instance how does it reliably infer which “facts” to use? reply xrd 7 hours agoprevIt feels like the two dumb ways to customize an open LLM are fine tuning and RAG. The former is expensive and complicated, the latter adds complexity to your queries but doesn't require up front compute for retraining. I couldn't tell how expensive this is up front, or what complexity it adds to the setup. Anyone know? It's definitely an interesting idea but if you have to pay $100k for all that LoRA, what margins are left over? reply qeternity 6 hours agoparentWhat do you think is complicated about RAG? I'm not arguing that it's effortless, but it's not that complicated?

Let's say I have a counter value, X = 100. I reduce that to 10. How can I phrase that in English? \"Value reduced to 10% of original value\" \"Value reduced by 90%“ \"New value is one tenth the original Value\" Using multiplication with a positive integer and saying \"less\" just seems incomprehensible when it flies by during a sentence and I can't stop myself from mentally saying \"No\", like Neo at the end of the Matrix when the three agents fire a volley of bullets at him down the corridor. \"No, this sentence stops right here while I pick it apart\" reply Dylan16807 10 hours agoparentI don't understand how you can build up this sort of reaction but you still need to \"work out\" what it means. It sounds like you learned what it means just fine. Also the most direct translation is \"value reduced by a factor of ten\". \"x\" means factor, \"fewer\" or \"less\" means reduced. reply bombela 10 hours agoparentprev\"10 times less\" contracted to \"10x less\" maybe?

A single page in their paper, including the diagram. They do reference some papers I’m not familiar with and say their method is “similar”. If you check the huggingface page mentioned in a footnote, they have two directories: one for a model, and the other which contains a FAISS index. Although in the paper they say they use cross attention, so I have no idea how those could be combined. reply gdiamos 3 hours agorootparentThat’s fair - I’ll try to go through the weekend and write out some of the equations for the kernel that loads the weights out of the index and does the adaptor ops. It’s inspired by cross attention in retro but there are some differences for training stability and to use as an adaptor rather than training from scratch. I consider that paper an early draft - hot off the press so to say - it needs review & editing before we would submit it to a conference. I tend to prefer a few rounds of open review before a final submission these days anyways - so appreciate the feedback I think the main idea should be reproducible - you can repeat the randomization and generalization tests with any LLM and get similar training curves and eval results - it just wouldn’t be efficient. We have tried it on about 5 real customer use cases with different facts and good success. Obviously we can’t publish customer data to reproduce which is why we focused on the randomization tests in the paper . There are also some missing hyper parameters from the appendix as well we will add eventually reply luke-stanley 7 hours agoprevIf less hallucinations are the goal, surely this is a bit over the top? Surely if you have the ground truth facts available, then fine-tuning for EVERY subject area seems much more work than using the facts with retrieval augmented generation, and making sure that the facts line up? reply aetherspawn 18 hours agoprevHere I was hoping that there would be some kind of regulatory framework or protections put in place for AI before it became smart enough to actually take over the world. Being able to say \"you are wrong, taking over the world is a bad idea\" and have the model respond with \"oh you are completely right, I am very sorry for that\" was our first line of defense. I wonder if this model will argue insistently that you are wrong if you try and tell it that 1+1=3, and if so, whether that expands to philosophical issues such as the model arguing back at you based on its formed opinions on ethics and history. reply UniverseHacker 18 hours agoprev\"Hallucinations\" are the creative aspect of LLMs, which is what they are more useful for- if anything we want more of them. We already have much simpler systems that search and regurgitate facts. We need more intelligent hallucinations that are consistent with and extend rather than conflict with the data. reply MattPalmer1086 11 hours agoparentI would argue with your definition of hallucination here. It's just a value judgement we humans apply to output that does not correspond to reality in some way that we don't find useful. We can control how diverse or creative output is via temperature. I am assuming that these new models could work at higher temperatures (i.e. more creative) while maintaining factual accuracy for things you care about. Or alternatively, keep the same temperature but have far fewer hallucinations (i.e. wrong answers). reply thwarted 16 hours agoparentprevIs it even possible to measure and distinguish the output as being hallucinated or not? All LLM output is hallucinated, it's only by statistics or chance that some of the output reflects facts, and we're only able to make that assessment because we can compare the output to facts. The model can't make that assessment itself. Going from 50% \"accurate\" to 90% \"accurate\" may actually be more insidious because it changes the utility from being a coin flip to trying to determine which 10% is inaccurate, or downplaying the existence of inaccuracies because at 90% it is \"mostly correct\". reply youssefabdelm 18 hours agoprevHopefully someone reproduces results with code... cant find any code they shared reply tzekid 12 hours agoparentThey are offering a product/service, so going in too much detail would be a bad business practice, no?

    "originBody": "notebooks are McDonalds of code You can come to McDonalds and order a salad, but you won't. Same with notebooks, you can write NASA-production-grade software in a notebook, but most likely you won't. Notebooks make you lazy, and encourage bad practices. common arguments I first watched this talk by Joel Grus and laughed hard. I later saw the extensive use of notebooks everywhere, even in production, and I don't laugh anymore. I'm scared and sad. This section will have arguments mostly from that talk, but I might add a couple more here in the future. state State is like Jesus from the Big Lebowski, you don't fuck with Jesus. But state will for sure fuck you up. You execute a cell, you change the variable value, save the colab and forget to execute the cell. Twenty minutes later you find a bug, hello there! versioning We've seen it before. tfinal_final_final_of_final.xls is back. You want to play with a notebook, you copy it, change a couple of cells. Two weeks later, you have 25 different versions, which one do you need? Good luck with that! bad habits This is exactly the McDonalds methaphor. If people are given a chance to be lazy, they will be (I will be for sure). Quickly hacking some stuff without properly testing? Sure! Linting? Pfff, living on the edge, you'll throw the colab away in an hour anyways. Writing everything in one file? Of course! Scrolling is so fun! notebooks slow you down Here I try making a point why using notebooks is bad for you personally. distractions I don't have a diagnosed ADHD, but I have 90% of the symptoms from the NHS website. I'm very easy to distract. And when I use colabs, I'm just one tab away from everything else. Wikipedia? Sure, let's open five more tabs. Gmail? Let's check the inbox! Youtube music? Let's change the playlist. You got it, my tmux pane with neovim or any IDE of your choice is far less destructive. execution environment Notebooks are often used as a playground to easily have access to an accelerator. In this case, the execution environment is often set up differently and with different dependencies. In this case, you make your code work in a colab, smile widely and run your experiment after on a cluster or whatever. You start crying in twenty minutes after your code crashes due to lack of dependency or versioning or anything else similar. efficiency Notebooks keep the state, you have all the data on your fingertips, you are not encouraged to optimise your code. When you rerun scripts, you want them be damn fast, you think more about the efficiency of your code. reading code I find notebooks broken for moving around the codebase. In neovim (or Pycharm, or VSCode), you can easily go to the place where the function is defined and change it, it's just one hotkey away. You can easily look at all the places where the function is used. How do you do that in a notebook? Do you go to your IDE and search for it? What do you do if you change a function? Reload the whole thing? Autoreload can help, but now you have to remember to rerun the cells you need and potentially fuck up your state if you skip a cell. notebooks slow your team down Enough with personal reasons, let's think about the issues affecting the whole team. breaking changes You use some function in a colab. Another developer changes the function signature and their IDE changes all other calls of this function in the code, but not in the notebooks! If the notebook is not used often (e.g. for leaderboarding), you are in for a treat. Apart from the frustration, this is also bad from the context switching and credit assignment perspective. Who is to fix this? You, who uses the notebook? Developer who changed the function signature? Both of the cases suck. awareness You don't usually check in notebooks in your version control system (if you do, I'm sorry). They usually pile up either locally or on some cloud drive. In this case, people are unaware of what's going on. When you check in your data analysis scripts or any modules, people can glance over PRs and have an idea of what's going on. Notebooks are like dark matter of development (yes, I have almost zero knowledge of physics, and still think I can use this metaphor here). fucking around -> production Some people like notebooks as they allow them to easily check some ideas and move on. However, when their ideas work out, they are having hard time moving this code to modules. Let's think about what you need to do. First, you need to move the code to modules, sometimes it's not just a single file, it can be multiple files across the codebase. Now you need to test it somehow. Personally for me, after I've moved the code, I'm already exhausted and sometimes bored. I know my code runs in a colab, why do I need to test it again? Often I end up not unit testing my code for this reason. But even if you don't test your code, you have to make sure that it runs and produces similar results to what you've had in a notebook. This also takes time and energy. sharing is caring You have hunderds of notebooks with useful utils that are accessible only to you. If that was a library within your team codebase, everyone could use that and the whole team could avoid code duplication. But as discussed earlier, you are not encouraged to move this to a module because you are lazy. FAQ I'll try to answer some common answers I get when I tell people I do not use notebooks. If your question is not here, let's chat on twitter. how do you do plotting? I have small utils that unify how my plots look. In case I want incrementally play with the plot, I pickle the data for it and run the plotting script for each iteration. how do you work with a remote machine? sshfs works greatly for these purposes in case you need interactivity. I am using code autoreload and write code in modules Nice! I've done this for a while as well. This is a good use-case. However, this approach does not address some of the issues, e.g. data analysis scripts should be checked by another team member. i considered you to be my friend, how could you do this to me? Hi Lucas, I'm not judging you. We can still be friends. But we can be better friends if you stop using notebooks. some of your points are valid, but why stop using notebooks completely? I don't think I'm losing much. I'm also constantly exploring other options and having fun.",

Then I started mentoring a junior staff member who worked on another project. The lead of that project was a physicist who wrote primarily in Jupyter notebooks. Like, thousands and thousands of lines of code. This junior staff member spent like 90% of her time confused and copying-and-pasting between notebooks. She had no idea what a virtual environment was and her go-to solution for solving import errors was to nuke and re-download the repo and re-run the setup script, or create a new notebook from scratch containing all the prerequisite user functions.

Luckily though she just left the project and got on a better one instead. reply ahmadmijot 6 hours agorootparentThis is why spaghetti code is so prevalent in scientific community. We are not really train (especially for non engineering research projects) to become programmers and we do programming just as a way to do research. reply alan-hn 20 hours agoparentprevI can change parameters in a script. What's the advantage? reply abdullahkhalids 20 hours agorootparentRemember back university, we used to do course projects (for science/engineering course) and at the end we would have to write a report. The report would typically include, among other stuff, two things. (1) The calculational methods we used - could either be a set of mathematical equations or a description of the algorithms. (2) The results of evaluating these equations/algorithms for different parameter values. Usually some graphs, and some discussion of their meaning. A Jupyter notebook is designed to replicate that process but make it easier because the figures are produced by code right there. Personally, all my notebooks include a discussion in the markdown cells what I am doing, and why. It includes discussions of the code. And directly from the code, some graphs or numbers, with a discussion attached. With the script workflow, I would have two different files. One with the code, and one with the results pasted in. It's annoying when my primary goal is to develop and test the algorithms under discussions. Best thing is, if done right, my work is completely replicable. Just run the notebook again. Just because some people misuse the tool doesn't mean the tool isn't useful. reply whywhywhywhy 7 hours agorootparentprevYou can rerun something halfway down a script without re-running the whole thing. If your script requires loading 12+ GB of ml models into a gpu before running anything at all this is the difference between a few seconds and a minute to see a change also if the output isn't text you can see the image or chart result inline to that code. reply pipe2devnull 20 hours agorootparentprevSometimes you want to quickly iterate on a portion of code doing some sort of analysis or tweaking a plot. If your data pipeline takes a while to run then rerunning the whole script is really awful. Notebooks make it easy to cache rerun and tweak chunks of the code. reply jhbadger 20 hours agorootparentprevYou can't embed graphs in a script, and plotting is an important part of systematic research. Also, it is easier to have an obvious sequential set of experiments over months in a notebook rather than a bunch of scripts. It's the same reason scientists use lab notebooks to keep track of things rather than just a bunch of loose papers. reply alan-hn 20 hours agorootparentYes, I have a lab notebook and I work in a lab. However I use folder structures to organize my scripts and as for graph outputs I save them as files. In my line of work I generate hundreds of graphs for data analysis verification and a notebook isn't set up to handle things like that as far as I can tell reply williamcotton 20 hours agorootparentMy workflow normally starts in the shell (SQL, R/rush/ggplot csvtk, etc), moves to Jupyter (F# in .NET Interactive, with some SQL and R/ggplot inlined), and then to a Makefile when I’m ready to make some deliverables. I’ve got an ever growing tool set of F# data related functions that I’ve moved to a personal lib in my dotfiles and use in scripts, notebooks, etc. reply setopt 11 hours agorootparentprevThere’s also a hybrid version that I like: Write proper scripts (which are easier to e.g. push to HPC servers or deploy later), and explore them using something like Quarto (neé RMarkdown, renamed now that it supports Python). Then you still get a digital lab notebook that ties together scripts, plots, and documentation, but the scripts remain usable standalone. reply cqqxo4zV46cp 20 hours agorootparentprevYou are asking what the advantage of a notebook is. Can you truly not see a job / workflow in which inline plotting would be advantageous? I find that very hard to believe. reply szvsw 20 hours agorootparentprevAnother advantage is when you have very slow code, you can use cells as caches, essentially without having to worry about serialization to disk. This often makes it much easier to interactively explore/develop downstream methods without needing to re-run earlier upstream dependencies. This is especially useful with large datasets. Even if serialization is straightforward, if you have enough data (or the data is remotely hosted), loading it might take anywhere from 2s to multiple minutes, and even 2s is enough to get you out of the flow if you are working rapidly and want quick feedback. reply zellyn 4 hours agorootparentThis.

It’s been ported to most code editors by now (VSCode “Interactive Python”, Vim “hydrogen”, Emacs “code-cells.el”, Sublime “Send Code” extension, Spyder has it built-in, etc.), so a lot of people have found that feature useful. In contrast to Jupyter, you’re still working with plain text files and not JSON, and you don’t end up saving the cached data in the same file as the script. In contrast to Quarto, Jupytext, etc., this is still just a code file and not a MarkDown file with code blocks. Not all editors have fully working “go to definition” etc. in MarkDown code blocks, and in any case, many people need a standalone script that can be placed in an HPC job queue after initial local testing is done. reply sneed_chucker 8 hours agorootparentprevFormatted markdown, embedded images, graphs, plots, etc. Can't really do that in a script unless you're running TempleOS reply Cacti 20 hours agorootparentprevIt’s a REPL, for starters. reply lelandbatey 19 hours agorootparentREPL stands for Read–eval–print loop https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93prin... A REPL, by its name, is a very narrow version of the broader paradigm of interactive computer programming environments. But Notebooks are not REPLs, unless you use REPL to mean \"interactive programming environment\" and not REPL. Notebooks are much broader than a REPL! In a notebook, you can go back and edit and run individual lines of the notebook without re-running the whole notebook from the start and without re-computing everything that depends on what you just edited. Behavior like this makes it super hard to track the actual state, and super easy to lose track of how things are how they are. That's pretty terrible! The parent article links this great talk that goes into more detail than the parent post and is much easier to understand: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U reply nikonyrh 18 hours agorootparent\"In a notebook, you can go back and edit and run individual lines of the notebook without re-running the whole notebook from the start and without re-computing everything that depends on what you just edited.\" Isn't this a standard on REPLs as well? You can select the code you wish to run, and press Ctrl+Enter or what ever. I must admit, I've programmed Python for about 10 years in Spyder and VS Code now, but I haven't used notebooks at any point. Just either ad-hoc scripts or actual source files. My definition of a \"notebook\" is an ad-hoc script, split into individual \"cells\" which are typically run as a whole. On my workflow, I just select the code I wish to run. Sometimes it is one expression, one line, 100 lines or 1000 lines depending what I've changed on the script. reply lelanthran 13 hours agorootparent> Isn't this a standard on REPLs as well? You can select the code you wish to run, and press Ctrl+Enter or what ever. Not usually, no. Type `python` at the command prompt - what you get is a REPL. Type `clisp` at the command prompt, or `wish`, or `psql`, or `perl` or even `bash` - those are al REPLs. Very different to a program that presents an editor, and then lets the user selectively choose which lines/expressions in that editor to run next. For example, type `emacs somefile.sql` in the command prompt. The application that opens is most definitely not a READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP. reply dahart 12 hours agorootparentWhy would adding fancy select or cut-and-paste features to a REPL make it not a REPL? Selectively choosing which lines to run is just a convenience to let you not have to type the whole line or set of lines again, it doesn’t really change the base interaction with the interpreter. reply lelanthran 12 hours agorootparent> Why would adding fancy select or cut-and-paste features to a REPL make it not a REPL? For the same reason that adding (working) wings to a car makes it not a car anymore.[1] I mean, to my mind, when something is satisfying a different primary use-case, then that thing is a different thing. I'm sure there's some fuzziness in the distinction between \"This is a REPL/car and this is a Notebook/plane\". Usually it's very easy to see the distinction - the REPL is waiting for the next command and the next command only while the notebook takes whatever input you give it, determines whether it got a command or content, and reacts appropriately. [1] Tons of examples, TBH. I don't refer to my computer as my calculator, even though the computer does everything a fancy calculator can do. People don't call motorcycles 'bicycles', even though the motorcycle can go anywhere that a legal bicycle can go. More telling is how people don't call their computer monitor 'TV' and don't call the TV a 'Monitor' even when the same actual item is used for both (i.e. I repurposed an old monitor as a small-screen netflix-box, and now an item that used to be called 'monitor' by wife and kids is called 'TV' by wife and kids). reply fragmede 12 hours agorootparenta flying car with wings is still a car. that's the whole point of it. it can drive you to the airport and drive like like a car. I don't care what you call your computer, it can still do math. people who have their TV hooked up to their computer would more readily refer to it as a monitor. idk, I just think REPLs are kinda shit for interacting with the present state of a kernel (as Jupyter calls them). Jupyters better, but still kinda shit because it could automatically infer the important variables in scope and keep a watch list like a debugger does. And then suggest things to do with them since it's a repl and not an IDE. but the thing is fundamentally they're Read Edit Print Loop interfaces to the computer and its current working state. reply dahart 11 hours agorootparentprevUgh this is a gish gallop of broken straw man analogies. Being able to select and evaluate a single line in a notebook is nothing like adding wings to a car. Fundamentally, selecting a line to evaluate is no different from typing that line again. It’s a shortcut and nothing more, the interaction is still read-eval-print. Note REPL doesn’t even refer to where the input comes from, the point is simply that it handles your input, processes it, displays the result, and then waits for you for more input. This is as opposed to executing a file where the interpreter exits once the execution is completed, and the return value is not automatically printed. Jupyter Notebook absolutely is a REPL, see my sibling comment above for the WP link describing it as such. It waits for input, then evals the input, the prints the return value, and then loops. reply dahart 12 hours agorootparentprevI’m not sure what distinction you’re trying to make. Maybe you can give some examples of notebooks that are not REPLs, since some of them definitely are. For example, Wikipedia says Jupyter Notebook is a REPL. The bare Python REPL (and the command line REPLs in any language, for that matter) has the exact same issue with tracking state, because what you describe is a problem with all REPLs, and all notebooks that are REPLs. That isn’t generally a serious problem with command line REPLs, because those REPLs aren’t meant or used for large system programming, they’re for trying small experiments. The parent article is pure opinion and seems a bit confused about the idea of using the right tool for the job, because command line REPLs and notebooks both have their place, as do IDE projects with lots of files. “A Jupyter Notebook application is a browser-based REPL containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text (using Github Flavored Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media.” https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter reply yowlingcat 12 hours agorootparentprevI think the workflow improvement happens but it's not because notebooks allow you to do something that you can't do otherwise. They just improve ergonomics. For example, there are a lot of cases my team uses notebooks for proofs of concept where we make a large expensive call to load a large chunk of data, slice a small piece of it, iteratively try to reprocess the piece until you get the reprocessing to occur the desired way, validate it reprocessed correctly, and then extend the reprocessing the the rest of the data set. That can all be done after only making 1 expensive call. Further more, if the last cell evaluation fails, it just resets you back to the line before and you can retry it. Can you do this with a script? Absolutely. You can write a script to download the data, and a script to process the data, and sub scripts for the individual steps. But that's not the path of least resistance; the path of least resistance involves you having to edit a piece and recompile everything and reset the entry point. Avoiding really makes it easier to brute force to the desired state ASAP. reply WalterSear 20 hours agoparentprevSome people, such as Jeremy Howard, think otherwise: https://nbdev.fast.ai/ reply bdjsiqoocwk 14 hours agoparentprevIt's just a name, you're overthinking it. reply lucw 20 hours agoprevThe article should start with more context, what is a notebook ?

Out-of-date cells happen because Jupyter works like a buggy makefile that doesn't reliably rebuild dependencies, forcing you to run \"make clean\" when anything weird happens. There are better build systems. Observable notebooks will automatically rerun cells that changed, like a spreadsheet. It works nicely for calculations that aren't too heavy, but it might not be what you want for a heavy batch job. Their newer tool, Observable Framework, works more like a regular build system. You can still have it automatically build when you save a file in your editor. A second complaint, that it's browser based, is basically an editor preference.

R is an awkward language, but it's repl-first, has a lot of Lisp's metaprogramming (done in very ad-hoc ways), and Smalltalk's serializable image model -- so a lot of exploratory/experimental statistical methods research happens there, and then gradually makes its way to Python when it needs to be stabilized for production. F# based .Net would've made a fine math-centric environment, but it's a language with a high initial barrier, and though .Net community has been making a decent effort at porting over a lot of NumPy/SciPy, it's not fully caught up after many years. We have Julia now, it's jitted, multicore/GPU friendly, and has interesting REPL innovations, and yes, serializable state (though, ugh, ligatures).

When I asked him what's wrong with the current thing, he couldn't answer and gave up on this idea. That backend had decent integration tests, and it took less than 5 minutes to add a small new feature.

Technically, I was using gradio to create a localhost webpage and then piping it through cloudflare. The website would only work when the notebook was running on the cmd line of EC2. Hey if it works, it works! Notebooks allowed me to do a 2 week project in 2 hours. Like most things, notebooks have their pros and cons. One of the biggest adv is very rapid experimentation. Even a regular script takes a while for python interpreter to run and that time (even if only a few seconds) adds up in lack of creativity (\"Bret Victor - Inventing on Principle\" [1]). And if your script is loading a big database, then notebook is a no-brainer. One of the biggest disadv of notebook is mis-ordering. You are allowed to declare a variable in cell 3 and then go and use it in cell 2. Even worse, you can declare a variable in cell 3 and then delete cell 3 and still be able to use that variable. That I believe is the biggest dis-adv of notebooks. It adds way too many subtle errors. One way to bypass this is to write everything in functions - no global vars. I am willing to accept the issue of mis-ordering in order to get rapid experimentation. It's subjective whether you think the pros outweight the cons. I definitely think they do.

It's just that notebooks are the method du jour for creating hacked-together code. But regardless of the tool chosen, hacked-together code does eventually leak into production. Mine has. It's harder to breach that barrier in embedded, because someone has to approve of getting the hardware made. In most organizations, there's a kind of no mans land between hacked code, and professionally written software. That's because the real SWE's are always overbooked, and for good reasons -- business and career wise -- should be working on the biggest projects.

For me, a lot relates to scale. I use notebooks occasionally for the university classes I teach. I like how I can write equations and text to explain ideas, and present interactive graphs to illustrate the ideas. But it's quite a lot of work to set things up, and there can be a problem when components of the work take a long time. In my research work, it is common for a calculation or a graph to take hours to days. Doing work like that in a notebook is just a non-starter. I use scripts (in various languages) along with Makefiles that \"know\" if I've changed my code or my data, and only rebuilds a result file or a graph when require. Almost always, I separate code that does analysis from code that creates graphical displays. And of course the text (of a paper, course notes, etc.) is written to incorporate these numerical and graphical results. The whole point is to subdivide complex tasks into smaller tasks that can be executed in an organized way. I don't see the sense in using one tool (notebooks, say) for simple tasks and other tools (scripts, a strong editor, tmux, unix, etc.) for complex tasks. So, apart from the toy tools that I make for some teaching tasks, I stick to simple unix-style tools for the tricky stuff. It's important to have many tools in the toolbox.

To suggest real work doesn’t get done in notebooks is simply asinine. As I have embedded further into data science and machine learning teams within my career I have come to learn that a lot of the things software engineers care about around maintainability, reusability etc. are often completely antithetical to data science productivity. In many cases practitioners would consider some of the listed cons of notebooks as features rather than bugs. There is obviously a time and a place for pulling out those practices in such settings but blindly applying software engineering standards to this kind of work is both all too common and often rather counter productive.

I know that's not how they're used, but it's really bizarre to me that people use them for exploratory data analysis. They're great for teaching and for _documenting_ the results of exploration, but fairly bad for any type of interactive data exploration, let alone actually writing code. Frankly, notebooks are pretty terrible for exploratory data analysis, especially in python. The main issue is that they absolutely kill interactivity. Straight up CLI based ipython is far more interactive, and often better for exploratory data analysis. In a lot of ways, pretty much any other interface is better than code blocks that aren't independent but can be run independently. Part of it is the interface (i.e. non-linear state, code blocks, etc), which is great for teaching, but bad for exploration. However, i.m.o. even more of it is the fact that it's browser based. E.g. folks often think it's best to use matplotlib in a notebook. However, using a notebook means you get very little interactivity out of a highly interactive library and remarkably poor performance out of something that's actually _very_ interactive and quite performant on standard Tk/Qt/etc backends. If you ditch browser based stuff, you're usually far better off. This part is mostly just me griping, but I don't understand why we've stepped back 20 years in basic usability, interactivity, and performance by making everything use a web browser (and then making that not even remotely cross platform). reply rcxdude 6 hours agoparentThe issue with CLI is it's crap for editing the code. It's rare that your data analysis will just be one-liners, it'll be some mess of steps and you want to go edit one in the middle (but not re-run the whole script). That's the first thing that the notebooks give you that you don't tend to get elsewhere. The second thing is the presentation of the plots: it's really handy to have multiple interactive plots laid out right next to the code block that produced them. There's nothing that requires that this is done in a web interface, but no-one seems interested in making a non-web version (IIRC there was a QT version in the very very early days of ipython notebook but it's long dead). One big thing that any replacement will need is the easy ability for the code to actually be running on a remote machine, something that's trivial for a web interface but requires active effort for a native client (and makes a lot of interactive chart work more difficult: certainly there's currently no other matplotlib backend which can do it). I'm fairly sure a better interface than jupyter is possible for data exploration, but I haven't found one yet since there's not really anything else that gives you the two features above. (one thing people often miss about notebooks and the kind of work that go into them is that the code itself isn't actually really hard code. It's 100% about interacting with the data and the algorithms running on it. Working in one isn't much like software engineering) reply fock 4 hours agorootparent> It's rare that your data analysis will just be one-liners, it'll be some mess of steps and you want to go edit one in the middle (but not re-run the whole script.

Also tramp + SSH-X-forwarding likely beats whatever ergonomics jupyterlab offers. reply jofer 4 hours agorootparentprevYou're not editing code in the CLI. You're editing code in your preferred editor/IDE. ipython + %edit works wonders. That's one of the main reasons to avoid notebooks and stick with CLI-based or similar tools. Jumping into the middle of a script and editing is often a bit dangerous. You usually wind up with something that can't be reproduced, as it depends on modifying state in a way that wasn't recorded. You do often need some sort of caching during exploration, for sure (it's not really feasible to wait an hour every time you want to tweak a visualization), but it's often better to break pipelines up a bit and do disk I/O rather than leaning on cells in a notebook. I do agree on the remote client part, though. Browser-based interactivity often is a good solution for a dev instance + a local thin client. It's slower than native for a local solution, though. reply __mharrison__ 14 hours agoparentprevNot sure if this is sarcastic or not... I've taught and worked with some of the biggest companies in the world. They were using Jupyter and sound EDA to great effect. reply jofer 4 hours agorootparentSo have I (not FAANG, though). I've been working in scientific python for over 20 years and long before notebooks came to the python world. (Yes, pre-numpy) And I've seen notebooks abused far more than used well. The same general thing was heavily abused in Matlab/etc too. It's not only Jupyter and it's not new. It's not that they're not a good tool, it's that they're the wrong tool for a lot of what they're used for. They're an excellent teaching and documentation tool. However, they're remarkably bad for actually doing any type of analysis or exploration. They're a great way of presenting your analysis after you complete it, but they're bad for actually doing that analysis. Write analysis code and data exploration code using the same tools you would for production code. There's nothing wrong with an edit + run + explore loop. Do that with a standard REPL like ipython + your preferred editor. But there's a lot wrong with trying to use a notebook to write and execute code, as it: 1) encourages writing code that won't actually run later (dependent on non-linear code execution and unsaved changes made to earlier cells), and 2) is a poor environment for writing code compared to more full featured editors or IDEs, and 3) discourages interactivity and data exploration due to being browser-based (poor performance compared to running directly limits interactivity during data exploration). Your data analysis work needs to actually run independently later. Notebooks rarely do unless they're re-made from scratch. At that point, you're better off working in a more full-featured environment for the exploration phase and then using the notebook as later documentation / communication. reply __mharrison__ 2 hours agorootparentYour experience differs from mine... Shrug reply toxik 20 hours agoprevI disagree with the idea that notebooks and McDonalds are somehow inherently and fundamentally bad. They fit a certain niche, and you should use them accordingly. reply DeathArrow 12 hours agoprevWhen I've read just the the title I thought the article was about laptops. reply makmanalp 20 hours agoprev> If people are given a chance to be lazy, they will be (I will be for sure). Quickly hacking some stuff without properly testing? Sure! Linting? Pfff, living on the edge, you'll throw the colab away in an hour anyways To save everyone time, I think the fundamental disagreement comes down to this. A vast chunk of the audience of notebooks is people whose brain has not been drilled on the daily about best practices and maintainable code and often don't get judged on that criteria or affected by the consequences of this. If you believe that these people are irredeemable as engineers, or more charitably that the incentives driving this cannot be fixed, then you probably believe in taking away good tools from these people because they'll misuse it, and then you'll agree with these articles. If you don't, then you won't. > I am using code autoreload and write code in modules >> Nice! I've done this for a while as well. This is a good use-case. However, this approach does not address some of the issues, e.g. data analysis scripts should be checked by another team member. How come? When you write your code in a module, it gets committed and PR'd and linted and tested and reviewed just like any other code, which is the whole point of this approach. Which I think is the most reasonable and mature one. The notebook then is mostly reserved for a very thin interaction layer optimized for play, on top of your vast iceberg of reviewed & tested & maintainable code. Including lots of prewritten convenience routines for plotting and munging to minimize business logic in the notebooks further, and not have paragraphs of matplotlib crud in hidden cells. You construct what's almost like a shell + DSL that's optimized for the domain and datasets you care about, and you can focus on investigating. If there's more significant code, it soon goes in a module again, without interrupting your ongoing flow and thought process. reply alan-hn 20 hours agoprevI've never been a fan of notebooks, it always felt like a strange way to run my code. What's the real advantage over creating scripts? If I want my code to run somewhere I would need to notebook architecture or just turn it into a normal script anyhow reply YurgenJurgensen 20 hours agoparentNotebooks have at least one advantage, but it's one that shouldn't really be an advantage: In a world where every big organisation rushed to adopt all the latest cloud buzzwords, we now have an awful lot of half-baked fontends for AWS and Azure that will certainly be mandated by company policy. Actually getting a computer that can access all the data you want and run in a way you want through EU law, US law, EULAs, company security policy, cloud billing policy et cetera et cetera is a nightmare. But for some reason, no matter what nonsensical environment you're being forced to operate in, there's always a Jupyter web interface with access to exactly what you need that none of the auditors, accountants or systems administrators seem to care about. It may not be good, but it works, and won't be bricked by some inexplicable change to IAM roles or VPS settings applied by some automated policy tool you didn't even know exists. reply hot_gril 19 hours agorootparentSame reason spreadsheets are so powerful. reply pquki4 20 hours agoparentprevFor a script, you run it from start to end. For a notebook/repl environment, you can create any number of intermediate steps, rerun the previous step with minor modifications and check if the results are better, rinse and repeat. For jupyter notebook specifically, you can visualize data and add markdown inline which are very useful. You won't understand it unless you are already familiar with the workflow. reply alan-hn 18 hours agorootparentSometimes I need to run my code in small pieces for testing and evaluation, I do this with multiple smaller scripts. Data can be saved to files and this accomplishes nearly the same thing as a notebook without needing to have the notebook environment reply rcxdude 6 hours agorootparentSure, if you don't mind the overhead (both development and processing time) of loading/saving state to disk (about 10-30 minutes for a lot of my data). In notebooks you don't have to think about it since it's just the objects in memory (and indeed they don't make it easy to think about it, which is a reasonable criticism, but I don't currently know of a framework or system which gives you the advatages of both). reply eldenring 20 hours agoparentprevof course, running a script from start to finish is better when it's fast, but if your code is slow to run, each cell acts like an in memory cache of your previous work. reply Tarq0n 20 hours agorootparentThere's so many other ways to achieve the same effect though. I would argue that serializing the result of some expensive computation explicitly is even just better, as it can have a meaningful name and metadata. reply rcxdude 6 hours agorootparentJust serialising and deserialising the results can be expensive though: it's quite for jupyter notebooks to have >64GB of data loaded. Even with high-end SSDs that's a fairly significant overhead. reply giraffe_lady 20 hours agoparentprevI've seen them used really effectively for debugging and incident response & documentation in elixir and erlang. You can connect to a running node in a controlled way, repl around the live environment, and dump potentially interesting things out to the notebook as you build your understanding of what's going on. I wasn't too active in ops stuff at that job, but as a dev it was so awesome for them to hand me off a notebook that was basically an in-progress investigation, including the entire path of exploration they took to narrow it down and dead ends along the way. You can't ask for a better bugfix ticket. Now I guess a lot of that depends BEAM particulars, and doesn't apply to jupyter or whatever. But it's at least an illustration that notebooks can uncover novel workflows for certain tasks. reply pdav 7 hours agoprevL reply rufus_foreman 15 hours agoprev>> You can come to McDonalds and order a salad, but you won't. But I often did. reply dahart 12 hours agoprevIt’s disappointing to have someone’s misguided hot take get lots of attention. There’s nothing inherently wrong with Notebooks, just like there’s nothing inherently wrong with a command line REPL. They are tools. Sure, neither is a great choice for coding a million-line application, and yet the REPL is the better choice for one-liners, and the notebook is the better choice for a few plots or developing a 10-line algorithm. I’d rather read something thoughtful about when and how and why to migrate from a notebook to something better. Making that easier, without judgement, is going to do a whole lot more good than attempting to shame people with a bad analogy will do. Anyway, McDonalds has scaled larger than any other food chain in the world, so the title is accidentally paying a huge compliment to Notebooks. reply bitwize 19 hours agoprevNotebooks are used for crunching data, for scientific, mathematical, or engineering purposes, and showing your work (revealing to your colleagues exactly how the data was crunched). If you're deploying them to production you get what you f'n deserve. That said, when I'm writing code, if I want it to be good quality code then I might use org-mode and its literate programming facilities to type up my thoughts, interlineating code as necessary. This is more useful on greenfield and personal stuff, but there is a high probability that I too have undiagnosed ADHD and the use of org-mode helps to organize and clarify my thoughts before I commit them to code. It is a hallmark of the programmer personality to jump into coding without thinking things through beforehand -- or really, sometimes, at all. The management consultant Tim Bryce wrote about a programming class he took in the 70s: \"When given an assignment, the other two members of my team started coding immediately, then keyed up the source code (Yes, we were using punchcards back then), and kept compiling and debugging until they finally got a clean compile. While this was going on, I pulled out my trusty old template, worked out the logic, wrote the code, keyed it up and usually got a clean compile on my first shot. Inevitably, I beat my teammates everytime.\" The use of org-mode and LP helps with these organization and planning issues... well, at least it does for me. reply localfirst 20 hours agoprevI like notebooks because they let me see the result of immediately and i can trace my steps having said that when i see Jupyter notebook I close the tab and do not continue theres just a sense of dread that I can't explain...perhaps its PTSD from data structure/algorithm comp sci courses that i never completed. reply hotdogscout 20 hours agoprevIt's what I have, some people are poor. Obsessing over silly details like these can be deceptively tempting procrastination. reply kkfx 9 hours agoprevHum... I do not use Jupyter and co BUT I have my configs and various personal stuff in org-mode/org-bable witch is a kind of notebook and my desktop boot to Emacs, who not retain state but it's still a live environment and it's flexibility and user-programmability with ease are it's strongest points. So well... Writing in org-mode makes me waste a bit of time but produce much clearer designs because I do not design in code but in natural language and if the narrative is suboptimal is immediately clear, also it proper document the code non with comments but with complete human language. The downside it's that's very time consuming and I do loose some coding helpers that can't work much in babel blocks instead of full source files. So well, for me such interaction is the most powerful UI we have, the best human-computer interface so far, the default go-to solution for any day-to-day work. A project could be an independent entity but still the day-to-day work born and evolve like that, so I'm not agreeing much, notebooks are not quick&dirty stuff but a tool to reason and reasoning often take much more time than directly write code, if you are disciplined. On contrary might disperse you if you are in \"silicon valley mode\". This is probably than main point not of the tool, but of the human using it: how many are constantly in Silicon Valley mode vs in Donald Knuth mode? reply spit2wind 14 hours agoprev [–] I try to avoid Jupyter related things.
