The automaker last year became so inundated with driving-range complaints that it created a special team to cancel owners’ service appointments.By STEVE STECKLOW and NORIHIKO SHIROUZU Filed July 27, 2023, 10 a.m. GMTAUSTIN, TexasIn March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter. A Tesla logo shown outside a Beijing showroom. The automaker’s estimates of its electric vehicles’ driving range have been among the most aggressive in the industry. It has faced thousands of complaints from customers disappointed by the vehicles’ real-world performance. REUTERS/Thomas PeterInside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales. An image from a statement by South Korean regulators, who cited Tesla for false advertising this year. The agency said the company failed to disclose that cold weather could greatly reduce its vehicles’ driving range. Regulators also required Tesla to change certain wording on its local website.At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, shown here in Beijing this year, gave the directive about a decade ago to write software for vehicles that gave drivers “rosy” estimates of driving range, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. REUTERS/Tingshu WangFailed tests and false advertisingTesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director of Edmunds.com, on how Tesla approaches estimating its vehicles’ driving rangeEV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment. A screengrab from Tesla’s website advertising the Model S sport sedan. Driving range is among the most important factors considered by electric vehicle buyers.Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”So-called range anxiety - the fear of getting stranded in an electric car before reaching a charger - has been a major obstacle to increasing electric vehicle sales. REUTERS/Albert GeaCreating a diversionBy last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”RELATED CONTENTSpecial Report: Tesla workers shared sensitive images recorded by customer carsTesla resumes US orders for a Model 3 version at lower price, rangeSouth Korea fines Tesla $2.2 mln for exaggerating driving range of EVsFor EV batteries, lithium iron phosphate narrows the gap with nickel, cobaltSuch advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates. The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.On the roadBy the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”REUTERS INVESTIGATESMore Reuters investigations and long-form narrativesGot a confidential news tip?

I hate almost everything about it. But most germane, The \"Battery meter\" at the top of the display is total bunk. That's got to be \"rosy\" numbers. It'll display a the battery in miles, but it's at least 25% inflated.However if you punch in a destination, you'll get exact numbers, and those are insanely reliable. It claims (and I don't believe any claims coming from tesla) that it'll factor wind, elevation, temperature, etc. But regardless of what it factors in, it's on the money.replymalwrar 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] I actually got stranded once for some hours because of the mileage indicator!Was driving back from a campsite that I turned out to not have charging compatibility with, but thought I had plenty of margin to get to the nearest charger. As I drove through the mountains however, I began noticing that a.) my battery was depleting much faster than expected and b.) I wasn’t seeing any houses and very few motorists. I watched with increasing dread as the trip miles began converging with the battery miles, as my friends in the car got more and more quiet. We reached the inflection point, and the best I could do was hope we’d encounter somewhere with a plug that might be able to get us the rest of the way. Eventually though the milage indicator reached zero, and I pulled off the road to what I thought was a campsite but turned out to be a sort of rest stop with no power plugs in sight. To make matters worse I was in a mountain valley and had no phone signal, and hiking wasn’t an option as it was pretty hot and we had no water. We were there for hours until I was able to flag down a nice older couple and get a ride to a place with cell signal, where I was able to get a tow truck capable of transporting my car (turns out you need one that has a full bed because of the regenerative breaking, and tesla’s service doesn’t have infinite coverage) to the charger I was trying to get to.Ironically that last part was probably the most frustrating. The charging spot was full save one spot in the back, which my tow truck guy Mel couldn’t get back to. No sweat I thought, I’ll just try asking someone to swap, but people in their cars pretended to ignore me, and one couple leaving theirs just walked away, as I asked if they could move so we could unload my dead car. Had a sudden wave of empathy for the people I usually walk away from who ask me for spare change lol. Eventually someone left and I was able to charge and resume the 6 hour road trip home. Biggest lesson learned was that slow is fast, keep it at 60 if you want the milage meter to not die as quick.replyjohntiger1 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a very humbling experience to be ignored by so many folks, glad you reflected on that. The story about the couple just flat out walking away strikes me as obtusely anti-social, but sadly not unexpected in our day and age.Just out of curiosity, where was this?replymalwrar 1 minute ago | root | parent | next [–] I went camping somewhere at/near Sequoia National Forest (forgot where) and was traveling to the charger at Inyokern. I think we got stuck on highway 178, about 3/4 of the way there.replyhot_gril 31 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Crown Vic owners to other Vic owners: Wave and smile, leave friendly notes in parking lots.Tesla owners to other Tesla owners:> people in their cars pretended to ignore mereplyyafbum 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tbh though, going up a mountain is insanely more energy consuming than regular driving, so the range indicator can't possibly take this into consideration ahead of time unless you chart a specific trip. In the other direction, I've had the experience of the battery charge level continuously increasing while going down a long mountain road - infinite range!replybumby 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] According to TSLA, it takes into account elevation though...replyfrumper 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If you tell it where you're going it will.replyleemelone 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] and that should be obvious right? Let's say you're familiar with how fast your car eats gas and you drive around on flats all the time.When you take it into the mountains, it's not surprising that your gas gauge goes down a bit faster when you're pushing that gas pedal a little further than usual.Perhaps the takeaway is that EVs shouldn't so prominently display the range as part of the \"gas\" gauge the way they tend to do.replyfrumper 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have it show percent, not range. Tesla defaults to percent on the main display. I'm not sure about other cars. When you use navigation then Tesla will show you the expected charge at your destination and it's been pretty accurate.replyjodrellblank 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"unless you chart a specific trip\"replybumby 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So the implication is it's getting it's data from local weather stations and not from the vehicle itself, no?If anyone know, I'd be interested in the more details and what led to that decision.replypests 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] He did chart a trip.replylowbloodsugar 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Using the trip counter isn't the same as entering the destination in navigation. If you tell navigation your destination it will tell you if you're going to make it or not. If you start driving like a madman halfway through it will reevaluate and start navigating you to a charger. I rented one for a week and took it up into the mountains, far from a charger. It was scary, but we made it back with 17% charge once I stopped passing everyone every time there was a dotted line.replypests 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm aware - pretty sure they did chart the trip in autopilot though from my reading. Telling the autopilot system you are headed to a supercharger also starts pre-warming the battery.reply7thaccount 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] On a highway my hood latch broke (old car) and it flew up at 50 mph and crushed my windshield. I had no service (but knew the other carrier would have full bars) and spent over an hour waving at every car trying to get someone to stop to let me call my parents (I was 18 and not exactly intimidating). It was a crazy experience as I'd obviously had an accident. Nobody would help. Finally I just stood in the road like a crazy person and a nice family stopped and one of their kids was on the carrier I needed. It was far enough from a nearby town to be at least a few hours walk and not before nightfall.replywillcipriano 7 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I know what gender you are.replypjc50 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > slow is fast, keep it at 60 if you want the milage meter to not die as quickThis also works in petrol cars: the air resistance efficiency falloff is dramatic at higher speeds.replyprewett 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Air resistance is proportional to v^2.My dad told a story once where he was driving out west borrowing one of his brother's cars with a broken speedometer. After he got back he said to his brother, \"the car just seemed to top out at a certain point\" and his brother said \"yeah, that's about 85 mph\" (the national speed limit was 55 mph at that time). So at 85 mph the air resistance equaled the force the engine could apply and the car wouldn't go any faster.replyklaff 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Force is proportional to square of speed but power = force*speed so proportional to speed^3.replyAnimalMuppet 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's not how this works.First, the force that is proportional to the square of the speed is the drag force, which means it's the force you need to supply just to keep the speed from dropping. Power = force * speed is a different \"force\" - it's the force produced by the engine.Second, power output of an engine typically has an RPM where it peaks. Past that point, more speed means less power output, which means much less force output, because the force is the power divided by the speed. But force needed still increases as the square of speed.replysyndicatedjelly 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's how top speed works.replymcronce 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Either that or you're limited by revs - in other words, there's enough net torque that, in the highest gear, the engine is running at redline before wind resistance stops you accelerating.You don't see that much these days, though, as having your highest gear that short is just leaving fuel economy on the table on the highway. If you can pick up speed going uphill without changing down at least one gear, you're wasting fuel to pumping losses on flats/downhill.replylancesells 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The use of AC / Heat will also just burn through your battery or your gas at a much faster rate.replydghlsakjg 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Slight nitpick: Using heat won't affect gas consumption of an ICE car. The heat is waste heat that otherwise would be dissipated through the radiator at the front of the car. Turning on the heat diverts coolant to a heat exchanger (tiny radiator) in the ventilation system that warms the air in the cabin.replyXylakant 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Old trick for people that had cars with somewhat inadequate cooling systems: open the windows, turn on the heating to full helps to cool the engine.replysomat 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] However note that sometimes the A/C will be on at the same time as the heater in order to dry out the air.This is one of those stupid facts that lives rent-free in my head. \"If you want 'dry' hot air you need to dry it before sending it to the heater. The primary purpose of the A/C is to dry the air(this also happens to cool it), there is already an A/C unit in the ductwork, profit\" But I decided to fact check myself and was not able to find much information. I did find one page that said this mainly occurs on the \"defrost\" setting, which makes sense as this is what is used when you don't want your windows to fog.replylancesells 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Thanks. Learned something today!replydtech 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Heating for ICE vehicles is free because it redirects engine heat.If your engine is overheating, one of the things you should do is turn the heater on max.replyFatnino 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] And since overheating usually happens on a hot day, open your windows and try to point the ac vets out them too.replyfilleokus 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Does heating in internal combustion engine cars really affect fuel consumption? My assumption was that most cabin heat was waste heat from the engine, that would otherwise be vented out? Given the dismal efficiency of ICE, shouldn't it be enough to keep a cabin warm even in quite cold climates?replyglogla 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The engine by itself produces a lot of waste heat. But modern engines are more efficient and take a while to warm up (especially diesels, but small turbos like Honda 1.5 too) so cars sometimes implement resistive heating to heat the cabin quicker.Also some cars have independent heating that can be used to heat up the car up without running an engine. Not sure how exactly it works but I think it uses special battery.AC compressor of course takes a lot of power.replyeMSF 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Block heaters can be used to heat the engine coolant (and afterwards the cabin) with or without running the engine. I doubt any cars have special batteries for these (even a drive battery of a non-plugin hybrid is somewhat small to be useful); block heaters that don't require external electricity simply use the car's fuel in an auxiliary burner.replyAloha 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Which ICE cars use resistive heating?

E.g. my moldy old Subaru requires flatbed towing, because spinning the rear wheels while the fronts are immobile will destroy the limited-slip center diff, but it's totally possible to push it along with all four wheels on the ground.I think AWD Teslas have an independent motor and drivetrain for the rear wheels. Naively, one would expect that if you unload the rear axle motor/generator you could just tow the car with little resistance and no damage, but in practice the picture is probably more complicated. I would love to hear from an expert.replypurpleidea 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tesla cars are way heavier. Nobody is pushing one with their friend. Unless it's downhill.replygiobox 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can push a tesla in most typical push situations. Sure its heavy, but its in the ballpark of pushing any large sedan or SUV, not just electric ones. You can enable free-rolling wheels in the car and push away, especially if you have luxury of two people pushing.The weight of a Tesla is not some unprecedented figure for a passenger car - a model 3 is no heavier than many BMW 5 series configurations etc.The far bigger problem for pushing EVs in my experience is blown pyro-fuses that lock the axle after crashes preventing the wheels from turning - a common issue after an EV shunt. This is why you will often see EVs \"dragged\" out of shunts by the recovery vehicle until they can get the locked wheels onto dollies. This is only an issue if the EV being pushed has been in an impact generally, but the bar for a pyrofuse blow seems to be low too - it will trip even if airbags haven't deployed. The wheels on many EV motor axles wont turn again until the pyrofuse is replaced.I think the earlier example that required a full recovery truck - that sounds exactly like a blown pyrofuse, which is by far the most common reason an EV ends up requiring a full lift/dollies rather than a simple tow on its own axles.This is also why you generally always smell burning in the cabin after a tesla shunt too - nothing to do with a battery fire, its the smell of the pyrofuse burning out under the rear passenger seat.> https://www.wired.com/story/evs-fire-pyroswitches-cut-risk-s...replypests 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > You can enable free-roling wheels in the car and push awayIs that possible when the car is persumed dead?

Every Tesla model except the original roadster is locked in a single gear transmission that never disconnects - one of the big reasons EV drivetrains can be built so reliable with virtually no maintenance requirements (there is no service items on most EV drivetrains until a quick coolant flush in ~10th year of car's life span).The Model 3/Y just dump the output of the rotor into a permanently locked 9:1 trans. There is no need for a reverse gear either as unlike a gas engine the electric motor can easily rotate in both directions.An electric motor cant \"stall\" like a gas engine and generally never has to change gear, so there is usually no real benefit to fitting the cost and complexity of clutching driveshafts you typically need when you have a gearbox or gas engine.Someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but to best of my memory the only \"mainstream\" EV with a gearbox on sale today is the Porche Taycan/Audi E-Tron GT (they are both the same chasis/drivetrain underneath) with its pretty unusual 2-speed setup. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the next generation of that car eliminates the gearbox.replycolejohnson66 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If the drivetrain never disengages, how does “freewheeling mode” (neutral) work?

In other words, I don't see new internal combustion cars renaming neutral to be \"car wash mode\"... lol.Cars should have neutral. And, if yours does then it should be named as such.Making sure I've got \"car was mode\" is not what I want to do when I'm in the market for a new car.

After all, a single strongman can pull a passenger airliner, and any car is nearly impossible to push uphill -- you have to really get some momentum built up first to let them coast up driveways/etc.replyReubachi 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not about weight or incline, it's the mechanical gearing in the \"transmission\" that can't turn the wheels without 100 percent power from the engine. You'll be able to push it and think it's really heavy, but it's just the transmission fighting you.standards and automatic trans have neutral that disconnects driveshaft from engine, removing any resistance from the engaged gear.

There's no mechanical disconnect between the wheels and the motor (i.e. a clutch) so pushing the car essentially turns it into a generator.replymannykannot 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Your second sentence is correct, but it takes a lot more torque to turn a generator at a given speed when it is driving current through a load, than it does when it is open-circuit.Inside the motor/generator, what happens is that if there's current flowing in the windings as a result of the EMF induced by turning the rotor, then, loosely speaking, it creates a magnetic field which opposes the rotation - but if it is not connected to some load (or a short-circuit) there's no current, even though there is still an induced EMF.It's a standard case of the conservation of energy - if it were not the case, you could put an arbitrary number of generators on the same shaft, all supplying power to external loads, and then use the output of a couple of them to power a motor spinning the assembly...If you are turning a motor/generator slowly, then the difference in torque is not much, but I am responding to the implication that the motor would have to be mechanically disengaged in order to disable the braking effect.replydinom 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Correct me if I'm wrong but, if I understand things correctly... at this point we're wondering if manual locking hubs are a better (or worse) solution than electrically isolating the motor(s). Right?And, off the top of my head I'm going to say the manual locking hubs will be better overall. Better from an energy efficiency perspective as well as overall convenience and simplicity of design. They might be worse for Tesla's P&L though since anyone with a tire jack and a standard parts dealer nearby could work on the car.Then again, besides the fact that I'm a cynic... what the heck do I really know!??!replyzh3 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes and no. Spinning the motor will generate a voltage but if it's not connected to anything there's no current flow and so the only resistance is friction. For it to act as a brake, something has to use the current - for example, charging the battery or more simply just shorting the motor (try turning an efficient DC motor with the wires open and the wires shorted - even with a stepper motor, you'll find a huge difference).replynot2b 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"a scenario that will not occur for the majority of cars\" isn't the standard, otherwise there would be no need to require most safety features, as the majority of cars never get into a major crash.If a car runs out of charge or malfunctions, it would help everyone if it is easier to move it so it doesn't block traffic. It might be wise to make this a requirement. Seems to me that a clutch that simply switches between connected and neutral and that only operates when the car isn't moving would be far simpler and cheaper than a clutch that handles shifting between different gears while the engine is turning.replydinom 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > don't have any clutches in the drivetrainWouldn't a clutch be unnecessary in this case... a complete disconnect from the drive train should suffice, no?replycaconym_ 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's exactly what a clutch does.

Then you're only adding the weight and drag of a few hundred lbs of trailer and battery.I would think the penalty would be in the high single digits or at most in the very low double digits which could be offset by having 1.5x or 2x normal battery capacity in the trailer.*Ninja edit, I decided to look this up. The Model Y's battery is 1700 lbs, so you are absolutely right that there would be a significant distance penalty adding that much weight to the vehicle plus the trailer weight and the battery armor as well if that isn't included in the weight.https://www.carparts.com/blog/how-heavy-is-a-tesla-battery/Curb weight of the Model Y is also 4400 lbs, so having to tow a 2500 lb trailer would be a significant hassle.Perhaps that could be offset by making the trailer smart and adding motors to it that the main brain could control through the power link. If it could push its own weight and it had a 1.5x battery, and if it also had regenerative braking, then it could get close to doubling the distance.Then again, each trailer would cost right about the same as a full vehicle, and would require an entire factory to be spun up to make them, and it would be an incredibly valuable product and therefore ripe for theft.Lots of negatives, not a lot of positives.It would be better all in all to be able to hot swap the batteries then. With standardized batteries put onto an integrated sled system, a robot at the fuel pump could pull the discharged battery and put it on a battery tester/charger and insert a fresh charged battery in its place.I guess that would be more like an oil change or system flush, but the advantages would be manifold. Batteries wouldn't be the weak spot in the system any longer. The likelihood of people keeping batteries until they degraded would be significantly reduced, problematic batteries could be identified and repaired or recycled before they erupted, and assuming that the system was in wide usage it could enable road trippers to stay on the road longer quicker and waste less daylight.Plus, for manufacturers, fuel stations, and mechanics, it would be an opportunity to make more money off of vehicle owners while providing safer, longer lasting vehicles to customers.It's probably still a post-scarcity pipe dream though.replymlyle 58 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] > It would be better all in all to be able to hot swap the batteries then.

Pretty soon all the batteries end up in crappy shape.The only way you could really do this is by having the swap stations own the batteries--- but this is so capital intensive that it's really a non-starter.

That was a US only implementation and as you know there is a work around. The other European feature that should be available in the USA is the ability to set when the REX starts to kick in.The USA requires the REX to kick in at 6% charge. The problem at that level is that the battery can't compensate during short high power drawls. There is a cheat code that enables the REX to kick in a 25% charge remaining. This seems to provide more on demand amperage but I'm not sure what is happening. Hills and wind have a larger effect on speed when off the REX. The REX is just a tiny motor that maintains the battery level but doesn't connect directly to the electric drive train.replybumby 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm curious if they recommend purging the tank (or using the gas) periodically?

It would only serve to confuse users to try and guess whether the current trip is a highway or city drive, will end in the next minute or two hours from now, which way the wind will be blowing and whether or not you're driving uphill, etc. It'd just be a useless guess, instead of an at least consistent one.If you tell it where you're going, it already gives you a great estimate, as it doe stake into account all of those factors.[1] https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17405906/tesla-model-3-hy...replysteveBK123 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Look, I get it, some people love these cars and will stand no criticism, fine.

They only make sense in that context: Just using one of those numbers on the dashboard would be misleading and inconsistent.Guessing based on the Wh/m of your last ten drives might be a closer estimate, but would be wrong if your next drive isn't like your last ten. It might even be more accurate when guessing your last nine drives, so then you learn to trust it, but those were city miles, and for the next drive, it's highway miles. And now the estimate is way off.It's just meaningless. We'd quickly learn that the number given is a bad estimate that can't be trusted and needs to be adjusted based on the way you'll actually be driving and other real world conditions... and that's where we already are.

The range you got going to the store yesterday is not the range you will get driving to your friend’s house tomorrow.The car doesn’t know where you are going, whether it is city or highway driving, whether or not there is an elevation change, unless you tell it by navigating somewhere.It could take a guess, but that guess still has plenty of chances to be wrong if your next X miles of driving is not going to be similar to your previous X miles of driving.replysteveBK123 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Why should the car use an average .250 kWh/mi hardcoded rate on a car I have owned for 4 years when it knows my lifetime average is 0.300 kWh/mi?There's plenty of smarter things it can do by default other than \"its hard, meh\".They are gonna figure out how to do coast to coast self driving this year but can't project a reasonable battery range estimate given temperature/driver history/weather?

It could show kWh, but that isn't good, either. What consumers actually care about is range, and whether that comes from more kWh, better aerodynamics, or a lighter car, the range is the bottom-line number. We wouldn't want consumers buying a car with a bigger battery just because it has more kWh if it doesn't get better range.I think EPA-rated miles is the best of available options--it just needs to be understood by consumers. And I think cases where it isn't are a bit overstated. I suspect very few consumers genuinely believe they'll get the same range in miles regardless of their driving speed, headwinds, or whether they're going uphill or downhill.replyblake929 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The article says it was a mandate from Elon Musk.

The range value ('guessimeter' people call it) on my Volt takes something like a rolling average of your last few drives and that's what it shows you. So if it's winter, it shows you less range because your last few drives had less efficiency. It's not always accurate (if there's, say, major temp fluctuations), but it's way more useful than what you're describing.To me, what you're describing is borderline dishonest marketing, and technically unnecessary.What I'd like to see is two numbers: estimated range as I've described, and beside it a kWh # (which I can guesstimate from the battery % gauge visual, but not precise).EDIT: Not sure why car manufacturers in general hide the kWh remaining-capacity of the battery so much. They seem to think consumers are too stupid to understand such technical terms? But they're clearly aware of it every time they use a public charger, and it's the closest equivalent to litres/gallons in an ICE.replystetrain 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Tesla has the guess-o-meter based on recent driving, it’s just on a separate Energy page.I leave the dashboard meter set to percent because the “miles” option is just the dumb EPA rated range mapped to percent anyway.The real way to predict range in a Tesla is to use the nav system which takes many factors into account and has been very accurate in my experience.replyjackmott42 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] EPA range is a mix of city and highway range.

How did you arrive at that conclusion. Even if the laws of thermodynamics and entropy took a holiday, and you recovered 100% of the energy when you brake, at best you would break even and not hurt your range (vs not braking aggressively).Regen breaking increases range over no regen braking, but braking aggressively will always be worse than not braking aggressively.replytialaramex 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No? Accelerating and decelerating are both lossy, and for the brief intervals when you're going faster you're also taking additional wind friction loss.Most EVs (including Tesla) do have regenerative braking, so some of your energy is converted back into electricity when you brake, but nowhere close to all of it, so people who have a smoother, less aggressive profile will get more range.Also if you brake really aggressively, you're dissipating more energy than can be successfully harvested and the rest is converted to heat, losing the energy you paid for and also increasing maintenance costs.replylotsofpulp 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I see, thanks for explaining!replyidlewords 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You can also recharge the battery by going in reverse, a solution I'm baffled more people don't know about.reply_jal 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yep.

The power required to maintain a constant velocity v against a constant drag force of F is P = Fv. With air drag on a car moving at highway speeds, the drag force F actually depends on v: it's proportional to the square of v, i.e. F ~ v^2. All together then:P ~ v^3So doubling the speed will increase the required power by a factor of eight.replyooterness 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Power is energy power unit time.You are correct that power lost to aerodynamic drag increases with the cube of velocity.

BMW - I exceed the advertised range during low-speed highway cruises in ideal summer conditions.Tesla - the range it shows me in car (not in nav) is the never-achievable EPA range. BMW - the range it shows me in car (not in nav) adjusts ride to ride based on efficiency on most recent trips. So in the depths of winter it's showing me something 20% lower than in the peak of summer. This means it's factoring in driver behavior, drive mode used, speed, and temperature effectively.It is reasonable to assume that your range on a trip is most similar to the range in your recent trips.I can get in my BMW, look at the range meter, guesstimate the range on arrival and be correct to within 1% 9 times out of 10.In my Tesla, I would constantly be doing mental math to discount the range it was showing me, to what I typically got, the weather, to see how big a delta it would be.Sure, the nav range in Tesla got smarter over time and factored things in.. but this doesn't help on long round trips. It might tell me that I'm going to reach my destination with X% left, but I now have to do mental math to figure out if I am going to make it back or not.With Tesla, I can't simply get in the car, see 300mi range on dash.. know I am making a trip 100mi each way so I'll be fine. Instead it's like - 300mi range, NAV says I'll have 58% remaining at destination.. OK so that means it's estimating X burn rate, which means I will make it home with... 17% instead of 33%.replycevn 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Exactly.

It may not accurately convey the distance available at the start of a trip but you're going to know well ahead of time if you're burn rate is too high.

It's misleading because miles don't map directly onto battery charge. The range that that indicates is miles on flat level ground with no wind at 55mph which you will never experience in real life. At 80mph you're going to get 2/3 of that range every time. At 35mph you can get significantly higher range, but no one is ever going to drive 300+ miles at 35mph. If you just tap on the range icon it will change to percent, which is less misleading. ICE vehicles have all the same problems, but most ICE vehicles always just show gas level, rather than range.replymartin8412 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My PHEV VW car shows range which is estimated based on the petrol level and the battery charge. I learned this the hard way because I noticed my petrol tank was very very close to empty driving on the motorway. I simply engaged fully electric mode, which turns off the petrol engine, and that way made it to the fueling station.It sort of learns based on the immediately previous drive what the driving style is, and therefore what the range is.replycameronh90 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] For what it's worth, I have a Nissan standard petrol car and it's pretty much the same. Every time I fill it up, it says I have 400 miles of range, then by the time I've driven about 300 miles, I've only got a few miles of range left.Interestingly the accuracy seems to get a lot better by the time I'm down to half a tank. I don't know if it's a sensor issue, or maybe my driving habits just change a lot when I have a full tank versus when I'm running low.The type of driving and time I'm driving can also make a huge difference to my trip MPG - some trips I average about 10MPG, others closer to 40MPG. Generally speaking, low speed but clear rural roads get the best, followed by motorway, followed by pootering around the city. The absolute worst mileage is during the winter, when I might only be driving lots of short trips around town on a very cold engine, with the headlights on, in the rain. In that case, I might only get around 200 miles out of a tank.Anyway, my point is that knowing the specifics of this trip's fuel consumption is a much easier problem than knowing how many miles it'll be until you next need to refuel.replywnissen 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, my Mazda does the same. It will happily report a 450 mile (725 km) range on my 13.2 gallon / 50 L tank, when I have never gotten more than 380 miles. Sometimes much less. To be fair, if you cruised slightly above the speed limit on the highway in fair conditions and drove it to truly empty, I think you would actually get that. But the gauge reads empty when there is easily 1.5 gal / 5.7 L in the tank, so in practice there is no way you're going to get the stated range.However, the key difference is that my gas car can be filled up anywhere, and worst case I'd need to get a gas can.

I drove a RWD Long Range Model 3 for 4.5 years. Absolutely loved everything about it. But the range was no where near 310 miles like stated. But I couldn’t have really cared less once I knew that fact. The few times a year I needed more than 200 miles, I used superchargers on my route just like I would if I had 250-300 and had to wait an extra 2 minutes at the charger. I averaged ~300-325 wh/m going 80-90mph on the highway (wind speed/direction obviously makes a big difference). 75kwh battery. 230 mile range. Every other day was charge to 80%, incredibly convenient to never think about it or gas and have more torque, speed than any other car you’re around. And low to no maintenance.I now own a Long Range Model X. It is MUCH closer to the EPA mileage. I average ~330wh/m but I have a 100kwh battery, so much closer to a legitimate 300 mile range. Once again, doesn’t really make a different unless you happen to have an exact 275 mile trip. Either way, you’ll be stopping at a halfway supercharger to stay in optimal charge range (15-85%).replyWatchDog 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Seems like it’s common across all EVs for the range to be inflated by around 20%, at least for freeway driving.In a recent review, a Tesla did a slightly better job than most of the cars tested, as far as portion of stated range achieved.https://youtu.be/fvwOa7TCd1E&t=36m15sreplyantisthenes 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Seems like it’s common across all EVs for the range to be inflated by around 20%, at least for freeway driving.Most people speed on the freeway.

We live in Ohio and so I have actually done long drives like that to go to remote places to go camping. (There are, surprisingly, both L2 and fast chargers around in rural Ohio but you definitely need an app and need to check ahead of time.)Speed matters because air resistance increases exponentially with speed, not linearly. Driving 60+, lots of stop and go, or using HVAC a lot will bring it down the range to as low as 180, but that seems like the worst range I've seen.

It is undesirable and illegal to drive down the mountain at 200mph, so you must reduce your speed.Mechanical brakes do this by converting that energy to heat and brake dust.Regen brakes do that by converting around 70% of that energy into battery storage to be used later.Your sack likely does not roll down the hill with zero losses to friction along the way. The sack has the same energy as it did before you moved it, but it does not mean the journey consumed net zero energy.replyCorrectHorseBat 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Without any resistance or breaking you are correct, but in real life you do have to break.

Thus, when I arrived, 22%, as predicted.replynunez 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It's the same problem as displaying the battery percentage on your phone. you're more inclined to look at it, and will be more anxious when that number drops.I wish Tesla would allow you to hide the battery percentage entirely (unless it drops below a threshold).reply14u2c 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Huh? Do you constantly stare at a car gas gauge too? Battery level is important information for planning your usage, with both phones and cars.replywilg 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I recommend tapping the battery meter to put it into percent instead of EPA miles (useless, misleading) and only estimate range using the trip planner, which is usually quite good.reply01100011 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Rented a MY a couple months ago and was surprised how much I, and more surprisingly, my wife, hated it. Now, I despise Elon and the risky safety decisions of Tesla engineers, so I'm biased, but I wanted to give them a shot.Range was horrible. We drove about 100 miles and spent a couple hours over several sessions at superchargers. The handling and turning radius sucked. The controls were frighteningly distracting and confusing. Sound in the cabin seemed very weird, probably due to the glass roof and noise cancelling system. Finally, for a dual motor, I expected a lot more acceleration. I drove a Chevy Bolt for a year and was surprised how heavy and sluggish the MY felt.replyconcordDance 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] > We drove about 100 miles and spent a couple hours over several sessions at superchargersHonestly I don't believe this. Requiring two hours sessions in 100 miles is an absolutely extraordinary claim, requiring something to be extremely wrong with the car in some way that didnt brick it entirely.replyjayd16 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You drive 100 miles and spent hours charging? That makes no sense. We're you towing something?reply01100011 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Exactly. Nope, no towing. Drove about half those miles and spent about 45 minutes at a supercharger, then drove another 35 or so and spent a little over an hour at another one. In the second case I was trying to get to 90% so I could return the car above the 72% I picked it up at.We ran the A/C most of the time. I was driving pretty conservatively with about 50/50 highway/city streets. I did try to show off the acceleration abilities once but didn't fully floor it. It's possible that, being a rental(although fairly new) the battery had taken some charging abuse.replydzhiurgis 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] 1h45m at supercharger, depending on charging curve, should result in 200-300 miles. So maybe you were just queueing at supercharger or something else doesn't check out at all.replyyayitswei 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This has been my experience as well. When there's a disparity, the Energy app gives additional details why the estimate was wrong (driving speed, climate control, etc).replyhuijzer 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > I have a model Y.

Don't waste your money on the FSD option, and you're fine. It's an expensive car that's super cheap to drive. The motors are basically zero maintenance.

Call it “standard” range if you will. The car has no idea where you’re going so it uses the standard calculation.When you set a destination it can now (and does) factor in elevation change, speed on given roads, wind speed, wind direction, temperature along the route, etc etc etc and is more accurate.So your least favorite feature is one you openly admit to not using properly? If you want laser precise range estimation set a destination ffs. Or, if you’re like most drivers you start every day with 200-300mi of range and unless you’re going out of state you don’t even think about range.replydubeye 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The obvious question is why don't you sell the car if you hate everything about it.Sunk cost and all thatreply 304 more comments...",

    "originLink": "https://www.neelc.org/posts/google-webauth-palladium/",
    "originBody": "Neel Chauhan ABOUT POSTS PROJECTS Google Web Environment Integrity is the new Microsoft Trusted ComputingDisclaimer: I work at Microsoft but not on Windows or Edge. I also don’t have a full understanding about Web Environment Integrity, but am basing this off what I understand. This article states my opinions, as opposed to that of my employer.If you haven’t been under a rock, you may have heard about Google’s evil Web Environment Integrity “proposal”. Supposedly, this is to make sure a browser environemnt can be “trusted”, but it seems Google wants this so they can kill ad blockers.This looks a lot like Microsoft’s ill-fated “Palladium” they wanted to ship with Vista. Palladium was an attempt to improve Windows security by adding attestation and integrity, but could also be abused to enforce DRM everywhere on your PC, block competing but “untrusted” applications such as Firefox. The only saving grace was Vista’s very painful and long development period where Palladium was eventually killed so Vista could actually ship.Palladium was renamed “Next-Generation Secure Computing Base” but it’s easier to call it by the former name so I’ll just use that. Also, some features such as BitLocker, UEFI Secure Boot (Windows 8), and TPM requirements (Windows 11) did make their way, but they can be disabled or bypassed.While I was only a young child during the development of Windows Vista, I am pretty good at reading up on tech history.Going back, Google takes “inspiration” from their infamous Play Integrity API (also known as SafetyNet) used on Android, which is often used to block rooted phones from using certain apps such as Netflix, Google Pay, and banking apps.Well, guess what? People who root their devices and use custom ROMs like LineageOS (myself included) nowadays hide root from bad apps and can pass these checks anyways. I use Google Pay all the time on my OnePlus 11 running an unofficial LineageOS build, thanks to root hiding. Does Google not realize how commonly bypassed Play Integrity is? In fact, it is easy even on Google’s very own Pixel devices, as someone who previously used multiple generations of Pixel devices, including the Pixel 7.Unless you can only use an official signed Google Chrome binary, what’s stopping people from modifying Chromium and faking these checks? Unless that’s the strategy.Even on the web today, there are bad actors like Chase Bank who claims to “require” only Windows or Mac (like it’s still 2003) and uses this as justification to block BSD and Linux-on-ARM without user agent switchers. The only reason why this isn’t in the media is because Chase allows Linux-on-x86 and Chrome OS, due to both having >2-3% market share each. In fact, I can log into Chase.com on my Fedora laptop fine without modifications.If Chase was equipped with Web Environment Integrity, they could impose the worst of the early 2000s web on their customers, maybe only making “exceptions” for Chromebooks and common Linux distros to avoid the obvious uproar. Or worse, Chase could mandate your PC has Secure Boot and no ad blocker in order to pay your credit card or mortgage. And not just Chase, but any bank. It would be even worse for certain fintechs which require their app for customer service and bill payments: look at the X1 credit card.In many ways, if we get Web Environment Integrity, we’ll need every government to regulate Google, Apple, Microsoft, and adtech in every way possible, and also add unbundling requirements so any browser can attest as long as it’s not obvious malware.After all, going back to the Windows 8 era, UEFI Secure Boot couldn’t lock out Linux since we put pressure on Microsoft to sign Linux distros. There was also an antitrust fear if desktop Linux went extinct, which helped. We could force Google to bless small browsers like Vivaldi and Tor Browser the same way.Better off Web Environment Integrity API becomes Palladium and dies in a long-abandoned Chromium branch. After all, Windows Longhorn pre-reset, compete with Palladium probably still exists in source, but is full of cobwebs rotting away on some long-forgotten-about Azure DevOps server.It’s not impossible to win this fight, we won the fight against Palladium, even with a well-resourced Microsoft combined with the PC industry, if not the NSA and MPAA. If we fight hard, we can win against Google’s anti-user Web Integrity attempts also.So, get the EFF and FSF involved: we need to be loud.← PREVIOUS POSTNeel Chauhan  • © 2023  •  Neel ChauhanHugo v0.115.0 powered  •  Theme Beautiful Hugo adapted from Beautiful Jekyll",

    "commentBody": "Google Web Environment Integrity Is the New Microsoft Trusted Computing (neelc.org)547 points by neelc 21 hours ago | hide | past | favorite | 268 commentsKnee_Pain 17 hours ago | next [–] There is a freedom problem, there is a hardware problem and there is a social problem.The freedom problem is this: you will not be able to roll your own keys.This is probably the biggest nail in the coffin for a ton of computers out there. In theory you could simulate via software the workings of a TPM. If you built a kernel module the browser would have no real way of knowing if it sent requests to a piece of hardware or a piece of software. But the fact that you would have to use Microsoft's or Apple's keys makes this completely impossible.The hardware problem is this: you will not be able to use older or niche/independent hardware.As we established that software simulation is impossible, this makes a ton of older devices utter e-waste for the near future. Most Chromebooks themselves don't have a TPM, so even though they are guaranteed updates for 10 years how are they going to browse the web? (maybe in that case Google could actually deploy a software TPM with their keys since it's closed source). I have a few old business laptops at home that have a 1.X version of the TPM. In theory it performs just as well as TPM 2.X, but they will not be supported because, again, I will not be able to use my own keys.Lastly there is the social problem: is DRM the future of the web?Maybe this trusted computing stuff really is what the web is bound to become, either using your certified TPM keys or maybe your Electronic National ID card or maybe both in order to attest the genuineness of the device that is making the requests. Maybe the Wild West era of the web was a silly dream fueled by novelty and inexperience and in the future we will look back and clearly see we needed more guarantees regarding web browsing, just like we need a central authority to guarantee and regulate SSL certificates or domain names.replymike_hearn 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] > Most Chromebooks themselves don't have a TPMCitation needed. I'm pretty sure all Chromebooks have a TPM and it's a firm requirement for making one. ChromeOS uses the TPM extensively and fully supports remote attestation:https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/tpm-usa...TPMs have been a requirement on PCs since at least 2016 I think, and in reality most came with them before that too (but there's a v1 vs v2 difference).> a 1.X version of the TPM. In theory it performs just as well as TPM 2.X but they will not be supported because, again, I will not be able to use my own keys.This is all wrong. TPM 1.2 uses SHA1 for everything which is a broken hash function so there is a major difference in robustness between them. That's why TPM 1.2 is being phased out. It has nothing to do with \"using your own keys\" which is out of the domain of what TPMs do anyway, TPMs are always owned by the device user. You're thinking of firmware boot signing and other things that are separate to the TPM chip but even there, you can use your own signing keys.replyKnee_Pain 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thank you for the knowledgeable reply.This choice will still render a ton of devices basically e-waste for no real good reasonreplyBSEdlMMldESB 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] you're calling the bottom line of hardware manufacturers \"no good reason\"!replyyjftsjthsd-h 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well... yes?

There are some problems here and there that could be improved. None of them are addressed by suggestion like this. This is for control and market reach, nothing else. Secure boot was as well. Evil maid problem is at least believable in a corporate context. These suggestions are just fluffy crap.replykahnclusions 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Really? Spam, scams, seo trash, bots and AIs, are utterly rampant.I don’t want Google and Microsoft to have the keys to the kingdom, but on the other hand, I really want a way to know that I’m having genuine interactions with real people.I wish government was getting more involved here.replyvetinari 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It won't solve any of these problem.But you will have to use hardware and software from approved vendors.replymike_hearn 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It can (that's why it's being pursued) and that, ironically enough, could even empower decentralized and P2P networks. Hear me out.If you look at the history of the internet it's basically a story of decentralized protocols with a choice of clients being outcompeted by centralized services with a single client, usually because centralized services can control spam better (+have incentives to innovate etc, it's not just one issue).Examples: USENET -> phpBB -> reddit, IRC -> Slack, ISP hosted email -> Gmail -> Facebook Messenger, SMS -> WhatsApp/iMessage, self-hosted git -> GitHub.The reason spam kills decentralized systems is that all the techniques for fighting it are totally ad-hoc security-through-obscurity tricks combined with large dollops of expensive Big Data and ML processing, all handled by full time teams. It's stuff that's totally out of reach for indy server hosters. Even for the big guys it frequently fails!Decentralized networks suffer other problems beyond spam due to their reliance on peers being trusted. They're fully open to attack at all times, making it risky and high effort to run nodes. They're open to obscure app-specific DoS attacks. They are riddled with Sybil attacks. They leak private data like sieves. Many features can't be implemented at all. Given all these problems, most users just give up and either outsource hosting or switch to entirely centralized services.I used to work on the Gmail spam team, and also Bitcoin, so I have direct experience of the problems in both contexts.Remote attestation (RA) isn't by itself enough to fix these problems, but it's a tool that can solve some of them. Consider that if USENET operators had the ability to reliably identify clients, then USENET would probably have lasted a fair bit longer. Servers wouldn't have needed to make block/allow decisions themselves, they could have simply propagated app identity through the messages. Then you could have killfiled programs as well as people. If SpamBot2000 shows up and starts flooding groups, one command is all it takes to wipe out the spam. Where it gets trickier is if someone releases an NNTP client that has legit users but which can be turned into a spambot, like via scripting features. At that point users would have to make the call themselves, or the client devs would need to find a way to limit how much damage a scripted client can do. So the decision on what is or is not \"approved\" would be in the hands of the users themselves, in that design.The above may sound weird, but it's a technique that allows P2P networks with client choice to be competitive against centralised alternatives. And it's worth remembering that for all the talk of the open web and maybe the EU can do this or that, Facebook just did the most successful social network launch in history as a mobile/tablet only app that blocks the EU. A really good reason to not offer a web version is because mobile only services are much easier to defend against spam, again, because mobiles can do RA and browsers cannot. So the web is already losing in this space due to lack of these tools. Denying the web this sort of tech may seem like a short term win but just means that stuff won't be served to browsers at all, and nor will P2P apps that want to be accessible from desktops be able to use it either.Anyway it's all very theoretical, because at this time Windows doesn't have a workable app-level RA implementation, so it's mobile-only for now anyway (Linux can do it between servers in theory, but not really on the desktop).replyvetinari 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > It can (that's why it's being pursued)No, it can't -- see bellow; there's also no quantitative objective stated or communicated. Hence, it is not controllable, whether it achieved the stated objective or not. What would happen, if it doesn't achieve it? Nothing, because it was not promised clearly enough, just in some vague way.But it happens to achieve different goal -- for example, even more concentrating the control over general computing into fewer hands.Would it be rolled back, if it doesn't achieve the stated goal? Of course not; it will achieve the hidden (\"it just happened, who could ever know, pinky swear\") goal, and that's important. Not the pretend-goals that was used to sell it to the general public.Now, why it won't achieve the stated goals: because spam is problem also with closed systems. Ever got a junk call? Users use only \"approved\" devices, and even if the system can put limits on the source, it also limits how the destination can protect itself. The important thing with spam, scams, etc. is, what whenever there is a possibility to make money, the scammers will find a way. Even with low-tech approach (like hire a bunch of human operators of the approved machines). They weren't stopped even when what they did was illegal, why do you think RA achieve what the law didn't? To make things worse, the closed nature made it more difficult for the victims to save evidence of the spam, scam.So of course it won't reduce the scams. But it will make the situation worse for us all. And web losing to proprietary platforms? It will certainly lose, when it is turned into one of the proprietary platforms.replymike_hearn 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Spam is much less of a problem with closed systems. BTW phone calls aren't a great example. The global telco system has enough players that it's closer to email than Facebook, and telcos are classed as common carriers so there's a limit to how much spam fighting they can do.I don't really know what to tell you. This stuff does work extremely well, it's unambiguously the case. Google already use a software-only form of RA on the web and have done for years. It cut through spam like a knife through hot butter. They could already detect 10 years ago if a Python script was pretending to be Chrome, or if Chrome was pretending to be Firefox, or if IE was being driven by VBScripts or an IE WebView was embedded into apps that then manipulated the web page externally. No hardware chips or new web standards needed! But, the approach used is/was in the end just a neat hack, and it's guaranteed that spammers will eventually defeat it. Perhaps they already did. I guess there must be a reason why this proposal surfaces now, given the ideas aren't new.> To make things worse, the closed nature made it more difficult for the victims to save evidence of the spam, scam.I don't quite follow the logic here. Why wouldn't they be able to save evidence?replymwcampbell 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > at this time Windows doesn't have a workable app-level RA implementationTo make this work, I suppose it will finally be necessary for Windows to disallow all user-space code injection (e.g. in-process hook DLLs), including from assistive technologies. I guess this tightened security could be a per-app opt-in feature, at least initially. UI Automation on Windows 11 may finally be ready to take over the work that in-process injected DLLs (particularly from screen readers) previously did without performance regressions, though as far as I know, this hypothesis hasn't really been tested yet (or if it has, that happened inside the Windows accessibility team at Microsoft after I left). The trick will be to give the third-party screen reader developers a strong incentive to prioritize moving away from third-party code injection, without harming end-users in the process (i.e. not suddenly releasing a browser or OS update that breaks web browsing with screen readers).What other changes or API additions do you think will be necessary to enable workable app-level RA on Windows?replymike_hearn 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, it's harder for Windows. Desktop operating systems don't have all the details figured out especially around detecting and controlling automation. RA has been around as a concept for decades, and implementations in consoles/phones/servers do pretty much work for a while, but RA that works on general purpose desktop computers is very new and really only Apple has it.The Windows team would need to at least:- Get apps using MSIX (package identity)- Design an API to get an RA for an app that has package identity. Make a proper keychain API (or better) whilst they're at it.- You don't have to block debuggers or code injection, but if those things occur, that has to leave a trace that shows up in the RA data structure.- Expose to apps where events come from.- Compile databases of machine-level PCRs that reflect known good configurations on different boards. Individuals can't do that work, it's too much effort to keep up with all the different manufacturers and Windows versions that are out there. MS would need to offer an attestation service like Apple does.Some of that stuff is already there because they pushed RA in an enterprise context for a long time. I don't know how widely adopted it is though.replyyjftsjthsd-h 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > If SpamBot2000 shows up and starts flooding groups, one command is all it takes to wipe out the spam.

At that point users would have to make the call themselves, or the client devs would need to find a way to limit how much damage a scripted client can doAt which it comes back to not allowing anything but the most locked-down clients, and disempowering users... and still failing, bcecause all clients can be turned into spam bots with the most trivial application of autohotkey et al.replymike_hearn 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's all built in chains:- The OS can trivially expose to the app whether events are coming from real hardware or another app, information the app can then either report or not report.- The attested user-agent string given can be extended to include information about any scripts that are driving it, e.g. script hashes.And so on. Then these things can have reputations computed over them. If there's a script hash that shows up reliably in spam, and never shows up in ham, then you can auto-mark those posts as spam. If the scripts aren't known then messages can be throttled until enough users have voted on whether the messages are spam or not. All this is fairly straightforward to code up, again, in a theoretical world in which operating systems expose information like whether events are emulated or not (today they don't).The trick is that clients don't have to be locked down. The tech is fundamentally about letting you prove true statements. Those statements can be as complex as needed to allow whatever level of customization and control is desired. The more malleable clients are the more complex it becomes to determine what is and isn't considered OK, but in a decentralized system that policy complexity is up to the end users themselves to decide. They can share logic in the same way USENET users used to share killfiles.Anyway, my point isn't to try and design a full system here. It's research level stuff. Only to point out that this stuff brings spam/abuse control out of BigTech-only world back into the realm of small scripts that can be written and shared by users in a decentralized way.replyyjftsjthsd-h 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > If there's a script hash that shows up reliably in spam, and never shows up in ham, then you can auto-mark those posts as spam. [...] All this is fairly straightforward to code up, again, in a theoretical world in which operating systems expose information like whether events are emulated or not (today they don't).And in a world that has zero outliers or unusual users. In reality, I guarantee my accessibility software would get flagged as emulated input (because it is) and marked as spam.replymike_hearn 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Again, it's all chainable. If an app is being controlled by accessibility software, the identity of that software can show up in the RA, so readers can say \"it's OK if this app is automated as long as it's by something on this community maintained list of genuine accessibility tools\".replymwcampbell 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Then maybe we can also take into account whether the emulated input comes from remotely attested assistive technology. Yes, this will have the effect of at least restricting third-party assistive technology, but we have to keep in mind what's best for the largest number of people (including disabled people who aren't hackers) in the big picture, rather than taking an absolutist stance on hacker freedom.replyspixy 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] what is RA?replymike_hearn 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Remote attestation.

Even if I did not trust my government to act in my interest. Because WEI and remote assertion will create absolute dependencies on American companies (who have no incentive to act on my interests anyway), even more than ever. And I don't think this is any good in terms of national security. F16 fighters sold to us which didn't fire on targets USA didn't want us to comes to my mind.

Otherwise whats the point? But I think the root of trust is whatever signs the hardware TPM module. So, Intel, AMD and Apple.If I understand it correctly, the secure chain of trust will be something like, hardware TPM module -> secure boot -> windows signed kernel -> Chrome (signed binary). Its not clear to me if desktop linux will be able to participate in this ecosystem at all - which is ironic given how much google uses linux. Maybe a couple of the big distributions like Canonical will be able to sign their linux kernel builds.> Lastly there is the social problem: is DRM the future of the web?Its opt-in by website operators at least. Assuming this happens, there are two big questions in my mind:1. How much of the web will go dark to anyone not using a corpo software stack?

Those countries don't care about \"citizen privacy\".Apart from that, we all see the bill in the UK which is as much a disaster to human freedoms as Russian and Chinese laws, for example. So even being a citizen of a more modern country is not a guarantee.People don't always live in their country of citizenship, they don't always live in one place (see digital nomads) and have a residence, they don't always trust their government and they should not be discriminated on internet usage because of that.

The deliberately pick forms of ID that are less prevalent among poor and minority voters and that for many are expensive to obtain. In several they have also taken measures to make it even more difficult for those people to obtain ID.For example if they require an ID that you get from the state's department of motor vehicles (DMV) they (in the name of budget cuts) close many DMV offices, and in the ones that remain open the cut back on the hours during which they will issue licenses to a few hours on weekdays. The closures mostly hit in poor and minority districts.Yes, some of those laws do make some forms of acceptable ID free, but only in the sense that there is no fee to obtain that ID.

Apart from maybe US with their specific global tax residence regulation.You can stay in UAE for half a year, start being their resident with 0% tax and then moving around stayng less than 183 days anywhere. It's of course better to be connected to UAE or other low tax jurisdiction in case of \"personal connection\" taxes requirements. Nothing unethical, illegal or bad in that. As far as it's perfectly legal in lots of countries, that's optimizing and not dodging or avoiding.If you are staying UAE resident this way, you probably will have some troubles receiving gov services, because you don't live there in fact most of the time (and you are still just a tax resident and not always resident in terms of long-term living permit).Anyway, placing a person to be \"managed\" by some government is a really dystopian concept.replysolatic 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Bear in mind as well, you need to be earning a ton for the tax savings to offset the price of flights + price differential of short-term housing compared to long-term housing.

I personally traveled just because I wanted to travel a lot, it was before the war and stuff, but as I know currently lots of Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians are changing countries to find the best for them. When you don't have home anymore, there is no reason to settle to the first place you visited.BTW, 3 flights per year with 2-3 bags will cost you around 3k USD, you will probably overpay around 300-400 USD per month staying in Airbnb in low-cost of living countries like Thailand, so in fact the whole cost of moving will be around 7-10k USD per year.

The website only has the attestation. There are other things that can be nitpicked against, but not this. For instance, can we require local ID cards? What about foreign visitors? Possibly an attestation from their passport? And of course, browsers sit in the middle and see everything.However, this could be a useful mechanism to have.

There are forms of encryption that prevent this (the user does a cryptographic operation on their own device that munges the data so the site can still verify the signature but can't tell which one it was), but now you need the government to implement that system -- and update it if any vulnerability is found -- and do a coordinated update of all the sites in the world with the new protocol that patches whatever vulnerability is found -- and do this rapidly and competently because in the meantime the system would have to be taken offline to avoid it being actively exploited.Do Not Attempt.

Their only meaningful competition at that scale is other ad companies, as nobody else can monetize arbitrary digital devices as effectively.This is why we need to be politically active and politically effective and I'm glad OP called that out in their post too. It's like reminding people to vote when dealing with the consequences of elected officials.edit: What business, other than an ad business, can safely say \"we don't care what digital technologies we invent, as long as they are popular we can make piles of money.\" IMO, that is the motto of a dominant tech company.

Do businesses also don't care about commercial secrecy?Effectively adtech short-circuited the digital society motherboard by identifying an emerging opportunity that did not exist in traditional physically organized economies.

Appeals to authority can easily turn dark if the wrong authority is in charge, and by then the people have been conditioned to blindly follow them.People should never be expected to make meaningful decisions in their life only because someone with degrees said it's best for them, or even worse make no decision because the leader already made it for them. People need to be able to think for themselves and make their own decisions, even if the few experts may disagree with the decisions made.In my opinion, this should have been the most important lesson from three years of pandemic response. We had a small group of experts getting out over their skis and speaking with certainty about the virus and what everyone must do. In reality these experts had much less research-based data to support this level of confidence, and in some cases the data even contradicted them. In the meantime we were all forced or coerced into various decisions and protocols that didn't seem to pan out, for a virus that we once got kicked off social media platforms for comparing to the cold or flu while that's precisely how said experts discuss it today.Experts should absolutely weigh in and attempt to educate people on what's at stake and why they should make one decision of another. But a system in which a few at the top decide for and control the rest of the population is extremely dangerous and should be reserved for only the absolutely most important situations.replynologic01 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes I definitely share the same concerns. But there is a practical need to rank risks and identify what are immediate, first order ones versus second order and broader concerns. In the absence of independent and minimally competent bodies we are in dire straits, effectively in snake-oil-salesmen territory regarding a technology that is considered as central to our future.I don't think there is or there will ever be perfect regulation. Pick any sector (banking is a prime example) and you can identify recurring failure, capture, complacency and other pathologies on top of the intrinsic difficulty of working out the unknown-unknowns.Ultimately the only structural mitigation available is to have as many checks-and-balances as possible and transparency about motivations and incentives of all actors involved.But that is not the immediate problem with \"tech\". I put the term in quotes because even that is a conceit. The accurate term is probably \"random conglomerates that were first movers in adopting digital technologies, with user-data based advertising the overwhelming business model\".The shtick has been that \"heavy handed\" regulation of said \"tech\" will stifle innovation and other such drivel.

The result could be widespread cruelty.The solution cannot be for each and everyone of us to be aware of and emotionally enganged with every possible predicament in which others could find themselves.

You'll still be fingerprinted and tracked no matter what because even if you're using Chrome 1/20 times you send a request the website will just revert back to the original fingerprinting.- Or if they aren't effective at forcing sites not to rely on attestation, well... then they haven't solved the DRM problem.- Finally, attestation might be used to primarily decrease annoying behaviors, which will still in practice make browsing the web for anyone who doesn't use a browser with attestation so painful that they'll eventually switch. Think \"you're not on Chrome, so you're going to see 9x the captchas you otherwise would see.\"You can't simultaneously have \"this allows us to trust the client\" and \"we can't rely on it.\" One of them has to give. At their best holdbacks would turn this into another tracking vector and would change nothing about the web for the better. More likely, holdbacks will allow sites that would previously be judicious about where they used captchas and blocks around the site to start spamming them everywhere -- because Chrome users will only see 5-10% of those annoyances. And at their worst, sites would just not implement the fallbacks because the attestation signal is still reliable enough.Holdbacks call the entire motivation of this spec into question, since the whole point of holdbacks is to make it impossible for websites to get rid of the invasive \"backup\" walls and tracking and captchas that the spec claims to be trying to replace. Blocking ad fraud? Blocking automated requests? WEI only helps with that if websites can trust the signal and block browsers that aren't sending it; otherwise websites are right back to square one trying to prevent fraud. But if they can do better blocking based on that signal, then we're back in DRM territory.----Another point raised by another commenter: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36884649Implementing holdbacks in a way that actually prevents DRM is likely to be fairly challenging. In the most straightforward implementation, websites can simply retry the request until they get an attesation token or until they hit 10 iterations, at which point they'll ban you as normal.Statistically profiling users and determining whether or not their browser supports attestation is likely to be fairly easy, unless Google has a much cleverer implementation of holdbacks than they've revealed so far in the spec.This would be the worst case scenario -- holdbacks would be used as an excuse to push the changes through and sites would simply ignore them and block users based on aggregate stats: you haven't passed an attestation check in the past 30 minutes even though you made 20 different requests that should have had a token attached? Yeah, you're pretty likely on an \"unsupported\" browser.replyPaul_S 10 hours ago | prev | next [–] I think I have become a web accelerationist.

The strongest Play Integrity level (MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY) is simply not possible to fake on a device with an unlocked bootloader, it's just not a big problem right now because most apps do not require it yet, since there are still many old devices that don't pass it, because of missing hardware or outdated android versions.Eventually, in a few years, a time will come where the number of non-unlocked devices not compatible with MEETS_STRONG_INTEGRITY will be low enough that apps will start requiring it, and that will be the end of bootloader unlocking for most users that still do it.replykevincox 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] It seems to me that they plan on \"fixing\" that bug in this API by requiring hardware attestation from the start.replynubinetwork 15 hours ago | prev | next [–] See also https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875940 https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36875226replyfsflover 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] and https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36882654reply 17 more comments...",

    "originBody": "[Date Prev][Date Next][Thread Prev][Thread Next][Date Index][Thread Index] 2023-07-02 -- 2023-07-03 Tarsnap outage post-mortem To: tarsnap-announce@tarsnap.com Subject: 2023-07-02 -- 2023-07-03 Tarsnap outage post-mortem From: Colin PercivalDate: Wed, 26 Jul 2023 21:05:15 -0700 I promised a post-mortem three weeks ago after I brought the Tarsnap service back online.It took me an unforgivably long time to get around to writing this, but here it is.At approximately 2023-07-02 13:07:58 UTC, the central Tarsnap server (hosted in Amazon's EC2 us-east-1 region) went offline suffering a \"failed system status check\".As a virtual machine, this could mean many things, including a power outage, a hardware failure on the physical server, or an outage in EC2's network; all I can say is that since I haven't seen reports of any widespread EC2 issues at the same time, it was most likely just an isolated hardware fault.Tarsnap's monitoring systems detected the failure at 2023-07-02 13:10 UTC (I have monitoring writing/reading/deleting archives every 5 minutes from a different EC2 region) and alerted me.(The text message at 13:10 UTC didn't wake me up, but the phone call at 13:15 UTC did.)My initial investigation didn't reveal any clearly transient errors so I assumed the system was dead and started spinning up a replacement EC2 instance.At approximately 2023-07-02 13:52 UTC (45 minutes after the initial outage) Amazon restarted the failed server on a new EC2 instance; this brought up the operating system (FreeBSD) but did not restart the Tarsnap server code since I don't have the system configured to start that automatically -- if anything causes the system to unexpectedly reboot, I want to check things over before any tarsnap traffic gets handled, since \"preventing data loss if something breaks\" is far more important than \"maximize service availability\".The server logs after rebooting showed filesystem corruption; it's clear that whatever took the system offline either killed the hardware or severed it from the Elastic Block Store which holds its filesystems.I decided to continue with setting up a new server rather than attempting to recover the old one.The Tarsnap service stores data in Amazon S3 as a log-structured filesystem with each S3 object consisting of a header with metadata for all of the log entries, followed by (optionally) data for the log entries.For example, a \"start write transaction\" log entry has a header identifying the machine and transaction nonce but has no log data, while a \"store data block\" log entry has a header identifying the machine and block name, along with the block data.Under normal conditions, the log entry metadata is also cached in EC2 and is never read from Amazon S3; the only reads from Amazon S3 are to read block data in response to requests from the tarsnap client.The process of recovering the EC2 instance state consists of two steps: First, reading all of the metadata headers from S3; and second, \"replaying\" all of those operations locally.(These cannot be performed at the same time, since the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are \"rewritten\" to free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)The first step proceeded without incident, completing at 2023-07-03 01:49:49 UTC.In hindsight it probably could have been faster: I had the recovery process configured to make 250 simultaneous requests to Amazon S3 because that is what Amazon S3 could sustain a decade ago, but I suspect that this could be significantly increased now.The second step failed almost immediately, with an error telling me that a replayed log entry was recording data belonging to a machine which didn't exist.This provoked some head-scratching until I realized that this was introduced by some code I wrote in 2014: Occasionally Tarsnap users need to move a machine between accounts, and I handle this storing a new \"machine registration\" log entry and deleting the previous one.Unfortunately while I had tests for this, I never tested regenerating the server state after a machine is \"re-owned\" *while having data stored* -- and since the new machine \"registration\" log entry has a higher sequence number, the server was quite right in objecting that data was stored belonging to a machine which didn't exist... yet.Once I figured out what was going on, I disabled that \"seatbelt\" and resumed the state reconstruction process.It then failed again almost immediately complaining that it couldn't find data in Amazon S3, because my attempt at \"resuming\" the process involved skipping the downloading-data-from-S3 step and thereby left a \"maximum log entry sequence number\" value uninitialized (and therefore set to zero).A short time later I had that fixed and the state reconstruction process continued properly.This process was also somewhat slower than it should have been; had I realized that it was disk throughput bound I would have configured the relevant EBS volume for higher throughput.Unfortunately by this point I was quite sleep deprived so I wasn't monitoring the process closely -- otherwise I would have noticed this (in both gstat(8) and Amazon CloudWatch) and reconfigured the EBS volume.By about 2023-07-03 15:10 UTC (I didn't record the exact time) the state reconstruction process had completed.I ran some quick tests with the server in read-only mode and compared against the old server state (to make sure that things matched up aside from the old server's filesystem having lost the last few seconds of data when the server failed), and then I brought it online. The first live post-outage traffic was at 2023-07-03 15:25:58 UTC, roughly 26 hours and 16 minutes after the outage started.Following my ill-defined \"Tarsnap doesn't have an SLA but I'll give people credits for outages when it seems fair\" policy, on 2023-07-13 (after some dust settled and I caught up on some sleep) I credited everyone's Tarsnap accounts with 50% of a month's storage costs.As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions.-- Colin Percival FreeBSD Deputy Release Engineer & EC2 platform maintainer Founder, Tarsnap | www.tarsnap.com | Online backups for the truly paranoid Attachment: OpenPGP_signature Description: OpenPGP digital signaturePrev by Date: Tarsnap is back online Previous by thread: Tarsnap outage 2023-07-02 Index(es): Date Thread",

I'm glad you're clear about no SLA, but this seems like a big liability between me and my backups.replyivanhoe 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a pretty well-known fact for years that tarsnap is basically a one-man show, and yet Colin has managed to provide fantastic service so far. Sometimes having ppl who built the service also managing it is actually a big plus, compared to other services where you first have to fight through outsourced & underpaid support that's limited to template answers, only to finally get some \"engineer\" who got that job 2 months ago and is more clueless on their system than myself...replystouset 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] And to be frank, I've seen plenty of mission-critical services at $bigco which may have had a team of engineers working on them, but the core functionality was maintained, understood, and supported by effectively one senior engineer. If anything went wrong, the supporting junior staff might have been able to fix reasonably simple stuff, but there was essentially one person who understood the system deeply enough to handle problems of any real significance.replyandrewmunsell 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I hate to bring this up, but what about the bus factor? If Colin is physically unable to continue maintaining the service and something like this happens again, how will anyone be able to get their data out? It's not really a concern about the service Tarsnap provides todayreplyAlupis 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There's an old Sys Admin saying (perhaps from Allan Jude of ScaleEngine) that goes something like \"if your data doesn't exist in at least three places, it doesn't actually exist at all...\"That is to say, if Tarsnap is the only place you've keeping sensitive/important data, then you're \"not doing it right\" as a backup. Things happen... your hard drive can die suddenly, and a data center bursts into flames all on the same day.replydryrun 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I feel like ovh will never stop earing about this. This has been, frankly, a traumatic event for many sysadmins I believe, and one that was shared by many from the same source, which is quite different from the standard variation of \"that time when I erased the production database\" (looking at you gitlab, but also at myself!). I mean, at this point it's between a legend and a warning tale and I don't know what else to call it. A bad Wednesday probably.replytomjakubowski 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Why the scare quotes? I would expect any well-experienced power user to know a complicated system better than a fresh engineer two months into working on it, with no previous experience on the system.

For the same reason I’ll never use PurelyMail otherwise it’s perfect.I know you didn’t ask me — but I don’t think Colin can answer differently other than saying that he is training a family member or friend to take over if needed.Here’s more https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7514753 this is also linked there http://mail.tarsnap.com/tarsnap-users/msg00846.htmlVery old threads but I am not sure much has changed there https://www.tarsnap.com/contact.htmlWhy would you use it instead of restic?

Google Cloud Storage’s similarly named versioning feature appears to be far weaker.)replye1g 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yep, S3 is reasonably easy to configure for immutability. I personally use restic to send (encrypted) blobs to https://www.borgbase.com which has append-only mode and monitoring to warn me if some backups didn't happen.replycrossroadsguy 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] borgbase is another “little” service that I use and like just like tarsnap and to some extent rsync.net. And they also have an excellent gui app Vorta (it’s FOSS; borgbase dev is the maintainer).reply88913527 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even large organizations can have fairly regular availability issues. I appreciate the noted flaws of \"single point of failure\", but I also see orgs where 100s of people have access to the infrastructure, make a change, and then it breaks something. I wouldn't do business with an org just because they have many people, that won't mean they're operationally sound, at least not to my expectations.replyk8sToGo 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If the data is super important you should be setting on two different providers anyways for backups.replyVWWHFSfQ 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Honestly, whose data isn't \"super important\"?. All my data is super important. Even the crap I just throw on my Google drive. I want to keep it.What is this mythical unimportant data that people still want to back up?replymeesles 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I mean, you called it crap and then said it's super important. That's what hoarders say.Subjectively you may feel that your data is super important, but objectively it probably isn't.When people talk about 'super important' (totally a technical term), I think of things like DB backups in software companies, backups of financial reporting for firms, etc. Not your tax return from 2008.replyrocqua 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My nginx config is not super important. My old reports written for study are not super important. My pirated movie copies are not super important.These are examples of data that I could easily live without. Where losing it would either be a matter of re-doing old work, or just forgetting about old and minor things.replyRoark66 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >What is this mythical unimportant data that people still want to back up?I have lots of stuff like this. Often it is easier to just back up an entire folder than go through sub/sub folders separating stuff into: important, not very important. Storage costs are low enough to just backup everything (almost). Also, one often doesn't know what may be important/useful in future. For example a couple of years ago I had this huge buildroot system (600gb) to build firmware images for a single board computer I spent quite a while to put together. The project I was doing it for got cancelled so I had no need to keep it. Still I wish I did, as I'd love to be able to tinker with it now, but 600gb is not a trivial amount to store so it got deleted. Most of this data was pulled from various online resources that don't exist anymore too.What's the morale of my story? If you have a fast internet connection (I don't) backup \"everything\" to cloud. Then find \"really important stuff\" like the pictures of your children etc and back it up again to a different cloud.If you're in a middle of nowhere on a slow LTE connection like me, building a nas box is not a bad idea for backups.replyivanhoe 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Anything that you stashed just for convenience, but you could re-download or re-generate it if really needed, or simply live without it... frankly, like 90% of stuff on my disks fall in the category \"I'll read/view it one day\", which in reality I'll probably never have time or patience to open ever again.replynixpulvis 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Strange, 90% of the things trapped in my flash memory are system files.replyilyt 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The stuff I don't want to fuck around searching re-downloading from torrent for example.replynixpulvis 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I really used to enjoy formatting my machines about every 6 months.Well I used to until macOS kinda went off the rails a bit. Now it’s mostly an exercise in running my arch script for my thinkpad.Being stuck between operating systems is kinda a mess though, makes backup and file sync in general really hard. But everyone’s gotta have their own cloud, right?!Why can’t I just put a cloud under my bed and forget about it?replyIntelMiner 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm curious how the prices shake out against services like Wasabi, since it's just dumping to an AWS S3 bucketWasabi does $7/TB with no ingress/egress fees. My NAS is set up to rclone to it about once a day and I've yet to have any problemsreplycrossroadsguy 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I haven’t checked the pricing in a long time but you can use Tarsnap also if you have to backup only 7.3kb (okay I might ne exaggerating here but you get the drift) and pay for only that much. You can’t do that with Wasabi et al.Also it’s really simple and does what it says it does, nothing more, nothing less. In today’s everything convoluted and bloated world this is a luxury imho. The GUI app is also quite good and functional. Support is prompt (that is if you need it).You don’t have to worry about file being deleted just because your machine didn’t connect or backup for some time even if you keep paying (hello Backblaze) etc. I mean there’s no circus, melodrama , and cliffhangers involved.I personally would never use it backup my entire laptop, due to price alone. But I have a subset of VVI files and Tarsnap is one of more than one backups for those files. So for that use-case Tarsnap is perfect for me, so far.replyAeolun 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Backblaze has kept my ‘shutdown two years ago’ machine data without issue. What problems did you have with them (or did others have)?replyterinjokes 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Backblaze has a policy of allowing backups of external disks, but the disks have to be connected at least once every 30 days, or they'll delete the backups. I understand they want to avoid abuse, but the lack of any grace period, or ability of support to ad an override, really soured the service for me.replyandrioni 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can just pay extra for extended or infinite retention. https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/features/extended-ver...replyseanthemon 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I did this, it's come in use a few times..replyAeolun 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Huh, I had to start paying them $2 more for my nonexistent PC I think, but otherwise was fine. I have only 1 TB of total storage on that PC though, so maybe that’s the reason.replyMawr 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Uptime isn't an important property of a backup solution, so I'm not sure where the expectation comes from?replythrowaway290 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] What use is SLA? If a service goes down for too long, are you really going to hire a lawyer sue it over SLA or just... use another backup?replyabofh 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not even then - most SLAs say that if it's breached, you pay less. Not that you get money backreplyAceJohnny2 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's not about suing, but defining expectations about how you can rely on a service.For example, my team has people across the world for HW bringup, so we can't allow our code hosting or CI to be down for more than a few hours. Of course, backups have different uptime requirements, but as for everything, it's a tradeoff between features, of which an SLA is one.Tarsnap's features are granularity of cost, reliability of storage, and encryption, but not 99.999% uptime.replymrweasel 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > It's not about suing, but defining expectations about how you can rely on a service.Meeeeh, my ISP cut of around 100+ fiber connections in my town and spend three weeks fixing it. My neighbor have business line, there's an SLA on those that among other things, require them if reestablish his connection within 3 - 5 hours. It took them over 500 hours, so that SLA is useless for anything but forcing compensations.The problem is that the SLA should give an indication of available resources, but in reality it's mostly a contractual thing for most companies, they'll pay the \"fine\" or refund a customer if they fail to hit their SLA and that's about it. Tarsnap most likely have better availability than many midsize competitors simply because it's just one person who really cares about it. Doesn't help if he's hit by a bus though.replybluGill 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] SLAs can be meaningless like that. However the better ISPs have in place a backup system that doesn't use the same fiber/wires. Sure the backup might be a radio or satellite feed and so be slower, but it will get/keep you online. This costs are lot more per month though, so if you are not paying for that service your SLA will probably just be we give you a free month (which hurts them enough that they will do some things to prevent downtime, but not enough that they put redundant fiber paths in the ground)replyilyt 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The \"problem\" is that no sane company will sign for any damage compensation on some cheapo few dollars a month service.replythrowaway290 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] A company could... if you have N users and you pay M for storage per user and downtime cost you X then it could be that a discount of Y means (M - Y) * N = Xreplyplayingalong 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Then SLO (service level objectives) should be enough.replyAceJohnny2 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] huh, never heard of SLO before.replytoong 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] and now also go google what SLI means ;-)replylifeisstillgood 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Very roughly:SLI - Service Level Indicators - Metrics ie Latency of each request / response cycleSLO - Service Level Objective - What threshold we are aiming for - 10 ms from request to response averaged over 1 hour period.SLA - SL agreement - contract with custom yet what happens if we breach (credits given, put the CTO in stocks and throw eggs at him etc)replyjustin_oaks 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I know it's a joke, but I think if an SLA involved putting a CTO in stocks and throwing eggs at him then that'd encourage me to sign up for the service. Especially if the video of it were posted after every incident.Instead we get refunded some pitiful amount when our business is seriously disrupted for an extended period of time.replylifeisstillgood 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] :-)My youngest once found some sort of chocolate drops called \"unicorn poo\" - which seems a more ironic thing to chuck at CTOs !replyjacquesm 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] In future postmortems (of which I hope there will be very few or even none) you may want to spell out your 'lessons learned' to show why particular items will never recur.replyidlewords 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It always amuses me how people want reassurance that the next crisis will be a fresh, new problem, and not one the person can demonstrably solve.A lot of 'lessons learned' analysis boils down to this: in order to prevent a recurrence of X, we introduced complex subsystem Y, the unexpected effects of which you can read about in our next post-mortem.replybityard 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's an overly cynical take, post-mortems are not for anyone's reassurance, they are a learning opportunity.The airline industry is as safe as it is because every accident gets thoroughly investigated with detailed reports (\"post-mortems\") including what to do differently going forward. These are taken as gospel among all players in the industry and as a result, you very rarely see two different accidents caused by the same thing anymore.replyjacquesm 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That was entirely not what I was getting at and is a cheap shot that is well beneath you, especially because I suspect that you know that that wasn't what I was getting at.replyidlewords 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] My comment wasn't intended personally; your words about \"will never recur\" just reminded me of this peculiarity of software systems, where it's often error handling/monitoring/backups/etc. that cause cascading failures in the systems they're intended to safeguard.I'm sorry if I misconstrued your meaning, but I am flattered that you think there are things beneath me!replyjacquesm 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Fair enough. I see the whole function of a postmortem in a very simple way: to avoid recurrence of the same fault. Yes, there will be plenty of new ones to make. But if you don't change your processes as the result of a failure you are almost certainly going to see a repeat because the bulk of the conditions are still the same. All it takes then is a minor regression and you're back to where you were before. This I've seen many times in practice and I suspect that Colin isn't immune to it. And yes, I look up to you, your writing is usually sharp and on point and has both amused me and educated me. So you have an image to live up to ;)replyrsync 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You should consider this possible lesson:\"Our simple model that fails gracefully did so and was simple to recover\"Redundancies and failsafes are not free - they add complexity.99.9% availability fails in boring ways.99.999% availability fails in fascinating ways.replycperciva 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yeah, I was going to do that but it was getting late, I wanted to get some sleep, and the post-mortem had already been waiting far too long to be sent out.The main lesson learned was \"rehearse this process at least once a year\".replyjacquesm 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Agreed, that's the big one. But also: when sleep deprived: take a nap!replyvintagedave 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The infrastructure page* says,> at the present time it is possible — but quite unlikely — that a hardware failure would result in the Tarsnap service becoming unavailable until a new EC2 instance can be launched and the Tarsnap server code can be restarted ... So far such an outage has never occurredI read the postmortem as that a hardware failure did cause it to be unavailable and the code could not be restarted, a new server had to be built.If that is correct, as well as writing up learning (as Jacques mentions) this page could be updated with outage information -- or even info on changes to reduce risk of repetition.For what it's worth, one outage of a single day in fifteen years is impressive.

Of course increases cost, but should be able to automatically failover to a standby EC2 instance (assuming all the code works automatically which the blog post indicates is not currently the case).replyidlewords 8 hours ago | prev | next [–] Hats off to you for an honest postmortem and your capable handling of a difficult situation. The only remark I would offer is with respect to sleep deprivation—when you're the only person who can fix a problem, there's no shame in trading some additional outage time for a fresh mind. Though it feels weird to go nap when all the klaxons are blaring, problems are too easy to compound under the combination of adrenaline and inadequate sleep.replycperciva 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] Don't worry, I had a couple naps in there. \"This seems to be running smoothly but it will take several more hours; I'll set my alarm to wake me up in two hours and have a nap\" is part of why I didn't notice the second step was unnecessarily I/O bound.replygus_massa 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] IIUC the process had a few steps were you only had to wait while data was transferred or processed for long times. They were probably useful to take a nap or eat or just drink more coffee.replyzokier 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] Based on the description it sounds like it should be relatively easy to test this recovery process on a regular basis, to catch any lingering bugs and evaluate the recovery time. As they say, the only backups are the ones you have tested.replybaz00 17 hours ago | parent | next [–] As someone who just discovered my DR process does not work by testing it, 100% this. The only plan that is likely to work is a repeatable tested one.replytialaramex 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ideally, the thing you do in an emergency is largely routine, so that it happens by instinct rather than being a special case you need to remember. It should not be different in arbitrary ways.For example in both trains and cars, thanks to anti-lock braking, the correct way to stop the vehicle ASAP is to brake just like normal but as hard as you can, the computers will automatically solve the much trickier problem of turning your input into maximum deliverable braking force by periodically releasing brakes on sticking wheels.If you run a fire drill, it's surprisingly difficult to get employees to use fire doors that they're used to finding alarmed and unusable. Even though intellectually they know that, say, the door at the bottom of the stairwell is a fire door, with crash bars and leads directly to the outside world, and this is a fire drill, they are likely to (for example) exit on a higher floor and go through a chokepoint lobby, as they would normally, instead of following this safer path that is emergency only. Sadly it is hard to fix buildings after construction if they were designed with such \"unused\" emergency exits.For a backup process, having restoring machine images be a service that is sometimes, though not constantly, used anyway for some other reason, is a good way to be comfortable with how it works, that it works, etc. At work for example we routinely test upgrades on test servers restored from a recent backup. Restore serviceA to testA, apply upgrade, discover upgrade completely ruins the service, throw testA away and report this upgrade is garbage. But in the process we gained confidence in the restore process, infrastructure people instead of trying to recall something they only ever did in a drill, when things go badly wrong are very used to this procedure because they do it \"all the time\".replybaz00 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is terrible. Instinct cannot be trusted. Write it down.replybombcar 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There are two types of emergencies - checklist ones, and panic ones. You need to have both, but realize that in the panic ones people do NOT operate rationally.This is why house doors open in but business doors have to open out - if there’s a crush against a fire door it opens.You even see this in aviation, where everything is checkisted; the pilots will first stabilize the plane in an emergency and then run the checklist. And small plane that operate unexpectedly are always higher in crash rates.replyjpgvm 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Pilots are a little special, their panic mode is also a checklist, known as the memory items.This doesn't work for normal people because normal people don't drill non-normal events until the response is instinctive.replybombcar 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Normal people should drill certain non-normal events (for example, all drivers should know how to deaccelerate and get off the road quickly).But you should NEVER design a system that requires normal people to drill non-normal events; even planes have been redesigned to \"fix\" problems where the pilot had to do something unintuitive or unexpected, because eventually it WILL catch up to you.replybluGill 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Note that in airplanes (unlike cars) you normally cannot just get in a new one and fly. You first get training on that particular plane. If everything goes perfect any pilot can get in any plane and fly it, but if any little thing goes wrong they better know how the plane flys very well so they can get it stable enough to run the checklist.replytialaramex 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You probably shouldn't just get in a new car and drive it, but people do. I remember at a hire car place once the team I worked with were given an automatic, the guy driving has never driven an automatic transmission before, but his license authorises it (UK licenses allow everybody to drive an automatic, but you need to test in a manual to drive manual), and so they just lent him a car with a completely different driving style. He had to get them to show him how to even drive it away out of their car park.I learned in the small car from the same brand as my father's larger car, so that the controls are in the same place, the symbols on stuff are identical, all that was different once I have a license and borrow dad's car is it's longer and has more power.It also probably shouldn't be legal for me to drive today, but it is. I learned 25 years ago, and I haven't driven anything in over a decade, so a rational system would say nah, you're too rusty, get a refresher course, but there's no mandate for that.replybombcar 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It is kind of mind-boggling insane that you can be 25 years or (younger in some states/places), having only ever driven a smart car (so you have your license) and you can walk into U-Haul and rent a 26 foot box truck with a trailer, and the most they do is tell you not to go under low overpasses or into drive-thrus.replycperciva 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yep! I've been meaning to do it for a while but there was always something higher priority...

Create a full fledged separate staging system which you can bring down and recreate and periodically test various failure modes + document all detailed steps of system restore etc.Also I would suggest to think about the business long term and seeing if you can increase the revenue enough to enable you to hire a part-timer who can be of great help in case a similar event happens.We are also a small cloud solution provider (we focus on ML API's) and over the years it has become clear to us that when you use cloud hardware (either dedicated or virtual), from time to time the outages periodically happen. RAM, HDD or other parts of the hardware just can malfunction anytime. So this is something which 100% needs to be taken into consideration when running any high availability online service over long-term.replyverytrivial 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] (caveat: I may be running on old tarsnap company info but) I must say, the ONLY thing that has ever made me shy away from seriously using tarsnap was the prospect of an unexpected Colin Percival outage. i.e. key person risk. I'm guessing I'm not alone in this.replyjacquesm 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] It's an MTBF like calculation: do you trust the well engineered one person company that has a well engineered solution with few moving parts over the much larger company that has far more moving parts and their probably less well engineered solution with far more moving parts?I personally would go with the simpler solution because in my experience you need an awful lot of extra complexity before you get to the same level of reliability that you have with the simpler system. Most complexity is just making things worse.You can see this clearly when it comes to clustering servers. A single server with a solid power supply and network hookup will be more reliable than any attempt at making that service redundant until you get to something like 5x more costly and complex. Then maybe you'll have the same MTBF as you had with the single server. Beyond that you can have actualy improvements. YMMV and you may be able to get better reliability at the same level of performance in some cases but on average it always first gets far more complex, costly and fragile before you see any real improvements.I strongly believe that the best path to real reliability is simplicity (which is: as simple as possible) and good backups. For stuff that needs to be available 24x7 and 365 days per year this limits your choices in available technologies considerably.replydeltarholamda 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] While I get this as a risk, I'm not convinced it's any more risky than a larger corporate entity.This is Colin's job. Colin has his name attached to it. It's really important to Colin.You're not going to get the same kind of service from BigBackupCorp. Their employees are replaceable, their management is replaceable, and to be honest, you as a customer are replaceable, if they decide to move in a different direction and become BigFlowerArrangementShippingCorp.The neat thing about a small business is that it runs entirely on its own profits. There are no stock price games or VC jiggery-pokery or anything like that. If it's a profitable business, there will be somebody to come along and take it over and make it their job with their name attached to it. I think the open Internet benefits a lot from this sort of thing.replycowsandmilk 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It isn’t necessarily about Colin quitting. Key person gets hit by bus is also always a concern. You can say someone will pick it up, but I know nothing of whether such plans are in place.

Is there enough documentation in place for a transfer of assets to be successful?replyidlewords 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is how that scenario shakes out:1. Key person gets hit by bus 2. You see the black bar on Hacker News and learn the sad news 3. You go download all your data from the service, which is still up because there is no bus access to data centers. 4. You feel like a jerk for all your creepy \"hit by bus\" talk. 5.

The risk you need to evaluate is not \"what if something happens to the proprietor\" (which I've always found pretty macabre), but \"what if something happens to him and then the service goes down and also I never backed up my backups\". This is a risk you can make as small as you want with judicious planning.replysaalweachter 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I mean, if you are on HN, you will probably learn of a Colin outage within 24 hours, so practically speaking you would really only have a problem if your primary data storage, Tarsnap, and Colin all failed in the same 24 hour window or so before you had time to switch to a new backup provider.replykoolba 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Pretty sure his brother works on tarsnap too.They should take separate buses to ______.replycperciva 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Pretty sure his brother works on tarsnap too.Yes, I hired him in 2015 IIRC.

For me, all of my most important personal and business data, from multiple decades, compresses-and-deduplicates down to around 6GiB. Considering the high value of the data I store in it, tarsnap's pricing actually feels absurdly low.replypatrec 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Tarsnap makes a lot of sense when you benefit from the encryption and (especially) de-duplication features that it offers.Can you provide more detail why you think so? I don't believe there is any use case in which tarsnap makes sense, other than maybe some Plan-C backup solution which you fall back on in the highly unlikely event that neither Plan-A nor Plan-B worked.Concretely, what benefits does tarsnap offer over restic or borg in combination with rsync.net, to make up for the substantial downsides (such as insanely slow restore, complete lack of wetware redundancy or being written in C[1])?[1] https://www.tarsnap.com/bounty-winners.htmlreplyrssoconnor 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I use tarsnap because the asymmetric crypto means I can give my cron job authorization to create backups, but it doesn't have authorization to read or delete(!) backups.This ability is critical to prevent a compromised system from having its data wiped and having all backups wiped as well.I haven't been able to figure out how to do this in any other system. But if someone has a tutorial, I am all ears.replyufmace 3 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] IMO AWS S3 works fine for this:* Create a S3 bucket and enable versioning * Create a new user and give it only s3:PutObject on your new bucket * Create an auth keypair for that user and put it on your serverNow any server compromise that gets those keys can only add new data to your backup bucket, and can't read, overwrite, or delete any previous backup.There's no dedup, so that could be a deal-breaker.There's also no real encryption (though that shouldn't be too hard to add I guess). I don't really see the gain though. Anyone who compromises the server keys is blocked from reading by AWS permissions. Granted, that's not quite as reliable as good crypto for blocking reading, but on the deleting side, there's never going to be anything but the auth system of whatever solution you're using to block that.I get that there's some applications out there where preventing data exfiltration is important enough to need strong crypto (though is that really important when we're talking about full compromise of your server, which gets the attacker direct access to the data anyways?), but I decided that the risk of failing to implement properly or full data loss due to losing the keys or them being corrupted wasn't worth the risk of blocking somebody who somehow compromised the AWS account security from being able to read backup data.replyrssoconnor 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Replying to myself:I've been musing on this subject all afternoon. I'm a user of Tarsnap, and I do find it expensive, in the sense that I would prefer to backup larger amounts of data for less amount of money. At the moment I backup photos separately from Tarsnap and in an adhoc way.But I still cannot figure out a way to get all the benefits I get from Tarsnap from any other software solution.* Must be usable under Nixos.* Backups must be asymmetrically encrypted so that backups can be automated, yet a compromise of the system cannot immediately gain read authorization to arcived data.* Backups must be append-only without further credentials, or otherwise prevent a compromised system from being able to delete existing archives.* Deduplication between archives while still allowing archives to independently be deleted.Using the ZFS snapshot functionality with rsync.net, for example, with Duplicity comes close. However, as I recall, duplicity wants to regular (typically monthly) full backups and then incremental backups from there. You cannot remove these full backups without deleting the entire month's worth of backups, and because the full backups are independently encrypted, there is (of course) no deduplication between full snapshots, even though the data is still likely largely the same. And because the snapshots are encrypted, it is impossible for the rsync.net storage to see or even know that large parts of the encrypted data is identical.AFAICT there is really nothing else that does what Tarsnap does.replyrcxdude 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rsync.net can do similar, because of their snapshot system. By default there's no way to delete a snapshot except through the schedule set up (you can write to them and ask if it's necessary for some reason). It doesn't use asymmetric crypto to do this but it's neither necessary not sufficient for the purpose of preventing accidental or malicious deletion of backupshttps://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/snapshots.htmlreplyrssoconnor 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Right I've considered that. It is however limited to like 7 snapshots.The thing is that tarsnap deduplicates over arbitrarily long time periods, letting me make arbitrarily long staggered sequences of retained archives.Perhaps I should really reconsider if I really need such long lived archives, but it is hard to bring myself to drop them.replyrcxdude 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can do the same with rsync, they just charge you for the extra space (the differential space, like with tarsnap) instead of providing them for free (from what I can see the limits in the web UI are like 1000 daily and weekly snapshots, 200 monthy snapshots, 100 quarterly snapshows, and 10 yearly snapshots, which I suspect are arbitrary 'good enough for most' numbers, not some hard limit based on what they can profitably provide). I personally use the direct ZFS option so I can set up the snapshots exactly how I want, but it is extra effort and doesn't provide quite as good a guarantee that they won't be overwritten (it's resilient against a compromise of the server uploading the backups because I've set up scripts that way, but it doesn't protect against compromise of the logic credentials for the VM in the same way).replyrssoconnor 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Oh thanks. I did not know that. That does seem good enough.I just now need a deduplicating asymmetrically encrypted backup program.I've tried duplicity in the past, and maybe I should try it again. But my recollection is that duplicity will just fail to do backups at the slightest hint of any problem. Like maybe if the last backup was interrupted then no more backups for you until you attend to it.Edit: More memories returning of having to dig out my decryption key to resync the metadata when duplicity gets unhappy, and then since my target server was append-only, duplicity was upset when it wasn't allowed overwrite any of it's incomplete metadata files. I guess the ZFS snapshot technique would alleviate the latter issue.To be fair, if tarsnap gets confused it needs the keys to do its fsck command, but I recall this sort of thing happening regularly with duplicity and almost never with tarsnap.replyrsync 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No, not limited.An rsync.net account can have any arbitrary schedule of snapshots - including days, weeks, months, quarters and years.replygnfargbl 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My post was specifically addressing the comments around cost.replypatrec 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, you specifically claimed that \"tarsnap makes a lot of sense\" in certain situations.

These days I'm a customer of rsync.net, not of Tarsnap.But I still firmly disagree with the \"Colin's just exploiting the uninformed\" angle.replypatrec 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Completely ignoring costs, can you name a single use case for which tarsnap would be better than Borg or restic on rsync.net?replyrssoconnor 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] With regards to restic, Tarsnap preforms asymmetric encryption which lets you perform automated backups without needing to enter any passwords (or otherwise storing your encryption passwords in plain text).With regards to duplicity, Tarsnap does full deduplication across all backups for any given \"machine\", while still letting you independently remove any snapshots you like. i.e. no special \"full snapshot\" that must always be kept around, and no need for multiple full snapshots that have no deduplication between them.replyi_have_an_idea 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] As a consultant on a DR project, you can increase your billables by 10x due to the extremely slow backup restore speeds.replydoolallylah 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Backing up anything Windows with more granularity than top level directories?Ugh.Try picking a choosing specific file types or file extensions from filesystems holding thousands of files.I ended up having to cobble together some god-awful pre-process powershell with multiple pipes just because restic fails to be able to grep using Windows reliably.:(replytredre3 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] > restic fails to be able to grep using Windows reliablyThat is news to me.

What am I missing?I agree that restic filtering options are pretty limited. Too limited, really. But what's there seems to work?replyelectroly 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] rsync.net is also overpriced for strictly backup purposes. Make sure you do check out restic; it can use S3 or Backblaze B2 (I actually use both) as backends instead of something expensive like rsync.net. The value of these boutique storage services evaporates when you start using restic.replymekster 13 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I treat zfs far more reliable than restic which is still rough around the edges the last time I tried a few years ago.Run rsync to the target and forget is quite easy, though I admit rsync.net's deal is getting worse these days posing minimum usages here and there.replyAnonHP 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The complexity with S3 or Backblaze B2 is the granular pricing for various operations on the service. It’s difficult to optimize costs compared to a fixed “$X per GB” pricing that’s easier for people to understand and forecast expenses a bit more easily. Other than that, rsync.net provides the same pricing for different days center locations, which means there is some subsidization going on.There are services like rsync.net that support borg at a lower price. Borgbase is one of them. I haven’t used either of these.replyLukeShu 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > There are services like rsync.net that support borg at a lower price.And rsync.net is even one of them!\"Special \"borg accounts\" are available at a very deep discount for technically proficient users.\" -- https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html...hrm, it seems they didn't update that page with last year's price drop. https://web.archive.org/web/20220319135035/https://www.rsync...

My 120Gb costs $1.80 a month. No way would I pay tarsnap prices.The 120Gb is the contents of my OneDrive and local repository trees.

It’s actually quite an interesting read that covers a lot of the things brought up in this discussion:https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/replyilyt 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] To be fair, any backup service should probably best have model of \"pay per length of backup stored\".If I want to store my 100GB of data now, and I want to have it stored for a year, I want to pay for that year's worth of storage of 100GB of data now and not worry about any money or account problems for that bit of data.replynottorp 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] But basically what he suggests is turning Tarsnap into yet another SaaS offering I wouldn't give a second glance to. The screenhot of his proposal for the new entry page says... nothing.Which is probably okay if you want to pivot from a geek-ish service to one that geeks don't use, of course. Does the owner want that?replymekster 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If it's the latter, then reader quality is quite screwed up in here trying to make people endorse crazy pricing because he's some known guy around here.replycrossroadsguy 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > because he's some known guy around hereOh dear. It’s an HN thing. I have had brushes with it only once or twice across various accounts across years but it’s very much an HN thing.Whenever you see an utterly useless quip (or sometimes even name calling or offensive words) being heavily upvoted you should know that some alpha HNer has arrived on the scene :)But to be honest I have never seen author Tarsnap engage in such privileged gentlemanly d-baggery. He is quite cool, as they say it.Anyway I just ignore it and move on. But again OP could have worded the question better. I mean no matter how good or bad you want to feel about it — it’s just a vc run anon forum and just another forum.replyRockRobotRock 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I definitely could have worded it better, but it's a little crazy how different the discourse is seen when the subject of a discussion is something well-liked by HN vs hated.replyRockRobotRock 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I didn't mean for it to sound like the first one but I understand ;)replysilisili 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Don't want to speak for Colin, but every time this is brought up, it's explained that Tarsnap uses very little data due to its design. Probably much less than rsyncing your data every hour to a cheaper provider.replyjpalomaki 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Since pricing is purely based on storage used, it's very cost efficient for certain use cases.I've been using Tarsnap for 10+ years. There's some Linux stuff getting backed up, configs and such. It costs next to nothing for this kind of usage.replyAnonHP 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It’s meant for people who have a lot of duplicate data and store small files. Anyone who has data that cannot be deduplicated much would be paying tons of money.While on the price, patio11 (Patrick) has written an article about tarsnap’s issues more than nine years ago (April 2014). One of the suggestions was to raise prices, IIRC. It’s a long post, but you can read it [1] and the HN post [2] from that time.[1]: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7523953replyGhostWhisperer 17 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] yes, people have been saying they should \"charge more\" for over a decadereplyRockRobotRock 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Can you not be snide and please help me understand? It seems 50 times more expensive than B2. I'm genuinely curious about the product.replyJimDabell 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] “What I Would Do If I Ran Tarsnap” goes into a lot of detail:https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/04/03/fantasy-tarsnap/replymst 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Roughly: The number of hours of my time that would be required to get something with even theoretically equivalent features would be sufficient to make the cost - and opportunity cost - involved seem far more reasonable.Plus \"written by cperciva and heavily battle tested by Serious Sysadmins\" is a feature I couldn't recreate myself - notice that while there was an outage, part of the reason for it taking a while was a conscious choice to take a much longer path to resolution than bringing up the previous server in the name of paranoia. Paranoia about data corruption is a nice thing to have in a backup system and something I'm happily willing to trade-off uptime for.However: For backups of bulk data then, yes, it's going to be relatively expensive. I wouldn't put e.g. my media backups on tarsnap, but \"use tarsnap for your git repositories and other high value data, and something else for the rest\" is both perfectly doable and an approach I suspect cperciva himself would endorse.replyilyt 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > notice that while there was an outage, part of the reason for it taking a while was a conscious choice to take a much longer path to resolution than bringing up the previous server in the name of paranoia. Paranoia about data corruption is a nice thing to have in a backup system and something I'm happily willing to trade-off uptime for.As Actual Serious Sysadmin that Actually Manages Big Systems for Living that screams more lack of preparation than anything else.Yes you should be careful but you should also have procedures in place and know the system well enough to trust it. And the fact is that the \"boring\" architecture of RDS DB instead of that S3 database abomination thing would just start right up if master DB server failed.It honestly looks like a trap many intelligent people fall into where they turn their cool-but-ulimately-flawed mental excercise into bedrock of the product. I don't want to use baby's-first-database on my production servers (I'm looking at you Lennart Poettering and journald) and I don't want my data/metadata stored on some experimental one.replymst 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Your comments seem to me to be about how long it took to bring up a new system.Without agreeing or disagreeing with those, \"I'm not going to trust the filesystem on the existing machine\" was the choice I was talking about.replyzetalyrae 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You don't need to build it yourself. You can use restic or rclone with S3/B2 and both support encryption.replymst 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I am aware there are existing tools that handle encryption.The tarsnap architecture still does more things.You're welcome to feel that you don't need those things, but that wasn't my point.replystigz 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The service is a layer on top of S3 if that helps answer things.https://www.tarsnap.com/faq.html#is-tarsnap-reliablereplyyjftsjthsd-h 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Then the obvious question is \"why would I use this instead of something else over S3\" (ex. rclone), to which I think the answer is ease of use (don't need to deal with AWS yourself, encryption/deduplication/compression handled for you, nice interface), which isn't everything to everyone but is certainly useful.replyalanfranz 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You need a remote service that keeps backup readonly. You’re not covering attack scenarios if you just use raw object storage from your client machine.I have written about this some time ago if you’re interested: https://www.franzoni.eu/ransomware-resistant-backups/replyyjftsjthsd-h 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'd classify that under \"ease of use\" - you can do it with S3 yourself (your post is a pretty good explanation of the how, from a quick skim), or you can just use tarsnap and not worry about it.replyalanfranz 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can see from my post that doing that _properly_ is quite convoluted and requires a good deal of technical skills.So it's not just ease of use. It's actual _functionality_ to me - getting from raw object storage to a fully working, attack-resistant backup strategy, is not trivial; hence, comparing tarsnap (or rsync.net, or borgbase, or whatever) to B2 or S3 makes little to no sense.You _could_ compare it to crashplan or backblaze personal backup if you like, but IIRC those don't work for *nix systems, only for Win and Mac.replyilyt 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] How tarsnap keeps backups readonly ? Just having service being a barrier is not enoughreplycatiopatio 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It supports distinct authentication keys with read, write, and/or delete permissions for the same data protected by a given encryption key.Those restrictions are enforced by the service.replymekster 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Learning to use some backup tool that does same things sounds way better than paying 10 times more for the storage cost that lasts.There's also a service like rsync.net where you can just rsync to the destination and they do the versioning and so on for less than 10th of the cost of tarsnap.replyyjftsjthsd-h 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Eh, cost/benefit; some people are backing up 100MB of documents and don't care, some people are backing up terabytes of media and have the time.replyRockRobotRock 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Thank you.replyGhostWhisperer 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] i'm being snide if the prices are considered high; i don't have to agree with thatreplypatrec 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Everything about tarsnap is absurd. It's basically the world's most absurd backup service (insanely expensive, poor UX, bus factor of ~1, restoring moderate amounts of data appears to take days (!)[1]), brought about by an absurdly bad allocation of human capital (it's run by a double Putnam challenge winner, with several other impressive accomplishments), and as such, absurdly beloved by HN.[1] In case of an emergency, you will always be able to get back your data from tarsnap at a blazing rate of 50kB/s https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap/issues/333.replytinco 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If tarsnap has even a modicum of popularity, thanks to these prices it would be bringing in bank. If he's making bank, that means he's providing value (even if it's just to \"uninformed\"). And it seems this system mostly runs itself, so it's a side gig. It's probably a far more effective allocation than many other possible allocations of human capital.How many of the world's best and brightest are doing all sorts of busywork? At least Colin has some time to do whatever he wants to do while running tarsnap.replyelectroly 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > If tarsnap has even a modicum of popularityIt won't, though, because of the points mentioned by the post you're replying to.

(These cannot be performed at the same time, since the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are \"rewritten\" to free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)Far be it from me to tell anyone how to write software, but why build a database on top of S3 when you can just chuck the metadata into RDS with however much replication you want?The backups themselves should be in S3, but using S3 as a NoSQL append-only database seems unwise.This would benefit from being further from the metal.replythrowawaaarrgh 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] Forget about software or data architecture. S3 is the most reliable data storage mechanism in the world, and insanely simpler than a relational database. There is no operational failure mode to S3, other than \"region went down\". There is no instance to go down, no replication to fail, no worry about whether there's enough capacity for writes or too many connections, no thought to a schema, no migrations to manage, no storage to grow, no logs to rotate, no software to upgrade on a maintenance window. Plus S3 is versioned, has multiple kinds of access control built in, is a protocol supported by many vendors and open source projects, and is (on AWS) strongly read-after-write consistent. I would also argue (though I don't have figures) that it's faster than RDS. Almost guaranteed it's cheaper. And it's integrated into many services in AWS making it easier to build more functionality into the system without programming.On a less technical note: Always avoid the fancy option when it makes sense.

If all your data is strictly ordered and you have no meaningful concurrency, this is a far, far simpler system.replyzetalyrae 11 hours ago [flagged] | root | parent | next [–] Did I fall into a timewarp into the 70's? How on Earth, by what sane standard, is a Postgres instance too complex? If you're `fopen`ing files as a \"database\" you are wasting your time and lowering the world's economic productivity.Complex is Greenspunning a database and having it blow up in your face and cause a twenty-six hour outage. You never hear about such things with Postgres because Postgres is rock-solid.replybastawhiz 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm not defending the choice to use S3. I probably wouldn't have made the same choice. But I am pointing out that it's empirically wrong to say that storing data in flat files necessitates the considerations of an ACID-capable RDBMS.But to your point, if your system requires less than a thousand lines of code to open a file, do basic parsing and processing (which no data storage system is going to do anyway), and write the output to another file, I personally can't say that Postgres or MySQL or any other solution is really worth the effort/cost to build and maintain. In the system being discussed, the benefits of an RDBMS simply don't matter: any strongly consistent key-value store would work.> Complex is Greenspunning a database and having it blow up in your face and cause a twenty-six hour outage.S3 didn't cause the outage, and from the look of it, neither did the code that processes the files. It was an application logic problem which caused issues during the restore process, and this would have been an issue regardless.You could make an argument that the recovery being slower than it could have been was a problem, but it's wild to say that and imply that traditional databases have no performance cliffs. Especially when dealing with corruption or data recovery. Raw file storage will never have a Postgres transaction id wraparound incident (see: Sentry outage for most of a day in 2015, MailChimp/Mandrill for over a day in 2019) or have to rebuild a critical index.In this case there was a hard coded concurrency limit with S3 of 250 outstanding requests. Bumping that up to 3000 would have been easy and reasonable (S3 rate limits at 5000). How confident would you be that your database can performantly handle a backfill during recovery? Have you provisioned enough iops? Are you running an RDS instance with only a burstable vCPU limit? To say Postgres is \"rock-solid\" (and make no mistake, I am a Postgres fanboy) dismisses the many and varying ways that it can fail in unusual and surprising ways.replykhiqxj 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] ok boomerreplynemothekid 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >Cheaper than a 26-hour outage?AFAICT, using HN theres been roughly 30 hours of non-availability over 15 years.

Popularized in England, these wavy walls actually use less bricks than a straight wall because they can be made just one brick thin, while a straight wall—without buttresses—would easily topple over.According to Wikipedia, these wavy walls are also known as: crinkle crankle walls, crinkum crankum walls, serpentine walls, or ribbon walls. The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist lateral forces. [source]The county of Suffolk seems to be home to countless examples of these crinkle crankle walls. On freston.net you can find 100 wavy walls that have been documented and photographed. In the United States, the best known serpentine wall can be found at the University of Virginia where Thomas Jefferson incorporated the wavy walls into the architecture. Although some authorities claim that Jefferson invented this design, he was merely adapting a well-established English style of construction. [source]As for the mathematics behind these serpentine walls and why the waves make them more resistant to horizontal forces like wind vs straight walls, check out this post by John D. Cook.Below you will find additional examples of these intriguing wavy walls that lawnmowers surely detest![h/t smell1s on reddit]          Email This Subscribe For EmailsAdd TwistedSifter to your Google News:Categories: ARCHITECTURE, BEST OF, DESIGN, HISTORY, STORIES, TRAVEL Tags: · bricks, construction, design, engineering, england, mathematics, patterns, top, wallsTRENDING ON TWISTEDSIFTER ‘She kept pressing on why I didn’t want them over here…’ He Told His Girlfriend Her Home Decor Is the Reason He Won’t Host a Work Gathering at Her House.

Given that often the bricks used were made and fired on site, it definitely saved on resources and labour.There's a stately home close to me that has a very short run of one of these walls, and the remains of the old brick kiln up on the hill side.

For N repetitions of the wave you need N + 1 buttresses not 2 N.Also, while brick is stronger in compression a buttress increases toppling resistance in both directions so you need to consider material properties not just the geometry.replychrisweekly 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"athletics\" -> \"aesthetics\", right?replyhinkley 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > these are curved for athletics.Autocorrect strikes again.replytetrep 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > *A straight wall of the approximal strength and length of a wavy wall, not just length.The article suggests that, if you attempted to build a straight wall with a similar amount of bricks, that it would not be able to be freestanding (i.e. it would need to be buttressed or it would fall over). That's a significant feature of a wall to some people, so I don't think it's fair to dismiss the utility of that by suggesting that it's simply \"less bricks for comparable strength,\" it's \"less bricks for a freestanding wall.\"If you want a freestanding brick wall, this seems to be the \"ideal\" way to do it, assuming you have the space required for the wave. I think the space needed would be a function of the wall height, so if you need a tall wall, you need more horizontal space for the wave and a wavey wall becomes less ideal.replykbenson 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > so if you need a tall wall, you need more horizontal space for the wave and a wavey wall becomes less ideal.Not necessarily. You might need a straight wall to be thicker or have more buttressing in that case as well. The requirements for each (waviness, thickness, buttressing) likely change to different degrees based on height, so wavy walls could become less ideal, or they could become more ideal.replyvehemenz 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The extra space doesn't have to be fully wasted. You could plant bushes or small trees in the concave sections.replyLutger 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Indeed. Historically these walls have been used in orchards, where they are ideal. The wall serves an important function: it buffers heat. This can make all the difference, especially in late frosts, which are doom for the bloom. Of course, the added warmth can also mean you can grow varieties in a colder climate that you normally wouldn't be able to.replyhammock 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Applies to flat walls not wavy, but espalier,[1] a way to cultivate trees in tight spaces, is one of my favorite things ever.[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espalierreplydeveloper93 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I mean I don't see a reason why it couldn't be applied to wavy walls if they were high enough, it's just training isn't it?replyhammock 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Fair point.

The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help to resist lateral forces. Furthermore, the slopes give a warmer microclimate than a flat wall. This was obviously important for the Dutch, who are almost 400 km north of Paris.> Variants of the serpentine wall had recessed and protruding parts with more angular forms. Few of these seem to have been built outside the Netherlands, with the exception of those erected by the Dutch in the eastern parts of England (two thirds of them in Suffolk county). In their own country, the Dutch built fruit walls as high up north as Groningen (53°N).replynottorp 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Interesting, locally the same word is used for the structures used for cultivating climbing plants.

If I have to make it all double width, suddenly its $200,000. $100,000 delta is still pretty relevant for a modern small scale farmer.replyHWR_14 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The difference is people enclosing 100 acres today are either wealthy estates or using non-brick fences for farmers.replylondons_explore 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Historically, lots of countries had laws saying you had to enclose your land.

The roads will even have equestrian gates alongside them when they have stock grids to prevent the sheep from using the road.It's all about adapting to local materials. The same technique was used by early settlers in New England (think about the ending of The Shawshank Redemption) because they had to get the stones out of the ground in order to plow and harvest - rather than just make a pile, they used the stones to build walls separating fields.replytoast0 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Depends on how long you intend to keep livestock and what materials you have access to.

Or is it just stronger than the single layer wall?Without knowing anything about the subject matter, I’d assume that the strength goes in order of single-layer straight, wavy, double-layer straight. No? Seems like needing just the amount of strength the wavy wall provides, and no more, would be a fairly rare use case. Leading to double-layer straights most of the time anyway.replyhorsawlarway 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] The wavy design is probably just as strong as the double layer (possibly stronger depending on the direction of force).The issue with a single layer wall isn't really the strength between bricks, or the bricks themselves - it's that a single layer wall has a very narrow base and is subject to tipping over.The wave in the design makes the base of the wall act is if it were MUCH wider, preventing the tipping action of a single layer.So the wavy design is only as strong as single layer of bricks, but it has a base 2 to 3 times the width of even the double layer wall designs. It will be much more resistant to tipping forces, but less resistant to impact forces.The thing about most walls is they aren't really load bearing - they just delineate owned space - so the wavy design is great for large properties. Much less great if it's a tiny space and you're losing a good chunk of sqft to the wave.replyke88y 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Additionally: you need the wall to be \"stable enough\", not \"equally as stable as a double-layer base\". Possibly, double-layer brick walls are over-engineered.replyethanbond 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It's a matter of stability more so than \"strength\", no? Having never attempted to push over a brick wall, I'd guess that it'd be easier to do so for a straight double wythe than a wavy single... but yeah, baseless intuition here!The base of a double wythe wall is still only like 7\", which if you're stacking say 84\" of brick on top of that... seems pretty unstable to me.replyHWR_14 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] \"Strength\" is used to refer to things like wind hitting the wall, not a car.

You need to make it thicker (how thick depends on how tall, but the important aspect is the staggered construction of multiple layers giving a similar self-reinforcement) to give it the proper foundation. Keep in mind that it's multiple thin horizontal layers held by a relatively weak adhesive, not a solid object.A wavy wall reinforces itself against the same forces (wind being the big one) allowing for thinner construction at an equivalent height.replyilyt 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Take a piece of paper.

One will fall over by itself.

Thinking of it as a point moving along the path through time, it will dwell and the peaks, and cruise through he centre. The contribution of each brick to wall stiffness will be related to the cube of the distance from the centre line (neutral axis), so more 'time' spent at the peaks is best. This holds true on the macro scale, but could vary on the scale of a half 'wavelength' as the lack of inversion of curvature could be beneficial there.Everything moderately reasonable seems to be better than a straight line in this instance. In the limit, two much thinner walls, far apart, is the optimal solution, but that becomes unreasonable as those walls must be coupled together to provide strength.replycarabiner 8 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] If you made the arcs deeper than the curves of the wave I think yes.

It's a great question and I think the answer to that would require a full model of the two walls to calculate all the stresses, etc. But I think it would also depend on the question of \"stronger against what?\" A pushing force but at what point and at what angle. Even height might make a difference.My gut instinct is that the point where a wavy wall changes from curving one way to another is a slight weak point and perhaps an angle there would actually be stronger.

I had the name search.. search.batcave.net until one day when they decided to take back the search subdomain name and use it for themselves. From that point I've avoid great common usernames that one day might be too greatreplythayne 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's one reason why if you give out subdomains to users, you should do so on a different base domain than you use for your own subdomains.replyWorldMaker 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's the exact reason that GitHub moved to github.io for GitHub Pages hosting. At first there were a few individual users still grandfathered in to be allowed to use .github.com for their GitHub Pages, but I don't remember who they were and I don't know if that still works for them this many years later.replyyencabulator 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The real reason is avoiding user-generated content from stealing authentication cookies. If worldmaker.github.com can run a little bit of javascript to add @worldmaker as admin to all the user's repositories on github.com, well, that's a problem.replyWorldMaker 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Both reasons are true. Also, relatedly, \"stealing perceived authenticity\": if a user sets up \"help.github.com\" or \"about.github.com\" or \"wwww.github.com\" and then runs a scam from it, it looks like GitHub is running the scam.reply_huayra_ 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > From that point I've avoid great common usernames that one day might be too greathttps://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-takes-over...replyimp0cat 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think it was Vodafone who once let a user register the username root@ and then later had to take it back. ;)replyprpl 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I got sshole for the same reason.replyslau 18 hours ago | prev | next [–] I used to work at Realm (the mobile database company). In order to keep an eye on what was going on, there was a Slack integration that reposted any mention of @realm on Twitter.One morning, we woke up to a #twitter channel full of very nearly porn. Young men, scantily dressed, flexing their abs and flashing smiles at the camera.Turns out someone added a bot on Twitter that would repost things from Instagram to Twitter, except that Instagram allows dots in usernames and Twitter didn’t. I think the IG account was @realm.of.beauty, which was promptly understood by Twitter as @realm.replycmg 11 hours ago | parent | next [–] I'm also @cmg on Twitter, which used to get plenty of Instagram mentions of this type, as well as people thinking I'm CheckMate Gaming, Canadian Media Guild, Cocaine Muzik Group, Chipotle Mexican Grill and all sorts of wild stuff.replylambdas 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] We had something similar. Public board that went by an acronym that was also used in gay paddling fetish.You’d be scrolling through hashtags/mentions of us and occasionally be greeted by some young actor being coquettishly tapped on the bare bum with a cricket bat or something.replyvarispeed 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > tapped on the bare bumThat's a kind of public board too...replymrtranscendence 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I have @CommonFirstNameCommonLastName on Twitter, and I occasionally get mentioned or DMed by people thinking of an entirely different person. It’s not often enough to be too annoying, though.replynaikrovek 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I get that at work. looking at my name, you would not think it common, but where I live, not only is it common, there are many of us with the same name at my employer.replyTazeTSchnitzel 14 hours ago | prev | next [–] At my previous job, I decided to make a Slack channel named after one of the C preprocessor directives (#define I think, or maybe #endif). A handful of people found it and appreciated the joke.But then, a few months later, one of the admins contacted me to ask if it would be okay to delete the channel. You see, in large organisations, Slack knows which channels are not meant to be visible to other parts of the org, and it was causing mentions of the C preprocessor directive to be censored for people outside my group ^^;replyOJFord 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] That'll teach 'em to put it in a code block!replyonionisafruit 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Funny that slack’s attempt to keep it from being mentioned revealed the existence of a private channel.replyTazeTSchnitzel 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Slack's search actually had a bug where it would return results with matches inside hidden channel names, highlighting the censored section :)replykubanczyk 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I don't think it works for private channels.Since, as OP says, non-members occasionally could find the channel, it was probably a public channel. The people who complained were probably \"multi-channel guests\". They'd see masked-out channel names except where they are explicitly allowed.replyTazeTSchnitzel 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ah, no, they wouldn't have been guests. The organisation was large enough that it had multiple “workspaces” corresponding to different divisions. Channels always belong to a workspace, but some are shared between workspaces. You can only see the channels belonging to or shared with your workspace.replyRetr0id 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I accidentally pasted a backtrace into a github issue outside of a code block. It was a deep stack, with each line prefixed by \"#0\" \"#1\", \"#2\", etc. GitHub decided to turn these into links to the corresponding numbered issues, for every issue, (including back-reference notifications in each of those issues) and there didn't seem to be any way to undo that action.replyremram 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] A bigger problem I've had with issue references is in commits. A repo we used as template was using \"Fixes #123\" in commits messages, to close tickets filled against that template repo. The problem is that when the updated template was merged in the downstream repo, it would close issues in each of them too...replypm215 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] For QEMU's gitlab issue tracker we deliberately started our issue numbering from a higher number (I think 100 or thereabouts) to avoid that. (We ran into it very early on during the migration from launchpad so it wasn't a big deal to re-number the two or three issues that had already been created with low numbers.)replydwaltrip 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Oof. There should definitely be an undo button for that, which displays right afterwards.replymoffkalast 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sounds like you should... open an issue.replyveave 14 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] >there didn't seem to be any way to undo that action.Well thank God there isn't a button to undo sent mails.replyjkaplowitz 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] In many email systems there is an undo send feature. Outside of those closed contexts where yanking a message out of the recipient’s inbox is possible, it is generally implemented by waiting a few seconds between when the UI says the message has been sent and when the message is actually sent. During that interval, an undo send option is offered which simply cancels the upcoming send action.replyonionisafruit 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Nothing calls attention to an email better than those messages saying that the sender wishes to retract a message you have already downloaded.replyjrockway 19 hours ago | prev | next [–] That's funny. Sometimes people experiencing a bug @ me because I've recently contributed to the repository. I just reply \"LGTM Approved\" and then they get mad. I'm like, I don't care what you check into this project. It's not mine!replyqingcharles 17 hours ago | prev | next [–] I once changed my mobile phone number so the last 8 digits were 69696969. I thought this was hilarious. Then I found out that people have randomly scrawled that number on every toilet cubicle \"For a good time call XYZ69696969\" and I would get calls all the way through the night, every night.replychiph 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] Steve Wozniak had 888-8888 for a while. Which is a très cool number to have, but he was getting hundreds of calls with nothing but random sounds in the background. Eventually he figured out that babies were pushing the buttons on their parent's phones, and all-eights were apparently easy for them to press.https://www.wired.com/1998/09/woz/replygodzillabrennus 16 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I own a few 867-5309 numbers for different areas. I have them do nothing these days but for a while I let them hit a pbx and we’d get up to 2500 calls a day on each line. Lots of drunk dudes trying to call Jenny.replydroidist2 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You need to go to stores in those areas and collect all the rewards points people have gifted to you by putting your number in at checkout!replymarssaxman 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I once did this by accident when fueling up my car; it just so happened that the gas station's rewards program was linked with the Safeway rewards program, and I happened to be filling up my tank just as the 867-5309 account for my area code hit some critical threshold. Hey presto, 20% off (or something like that; it was a long time ago).replyhbn 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There's a prank call podcast called The Snow Plow Show, and the guy set up a bot at a phone number that will automatically reply to callers with voice clips from a lady who yelled at him in a prank call one time. So fans of the show will put the number on windshields or craigslist ads so people will call the number and get yelled at, and the calls are all recorded so he can listen back to them later and pull out the better ones.I think you should utilize a similar technology for your phone numbers.replyrav3ndust 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Hahaha! Never thought I'd see BeverlyBot and Sorry I Dinged Your Car mentioned on HN.Been listening to RBCP (The guy who does Snow Plow Show and Phone Losers of America) for a long time now. Great to throw on in the background for some laughs at the end of the day while reading.replykbenson 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If I was less scrupulous, I can think of a few ways to easily monetize that. The first and simplest is to have a toll line that charges on call and have a recording on the 867-5309 numbers that refers them to call it.Whether you go the sultry \"really meet Jenny\" angle or just try to find something that piques the interest of the average drunk male that would call, just to see what they're being referred to, you'd probably get enough takers to turn a tidy profit regardless of how crappy the ultimate toll line was. I doubt it takes all that much to convince callers that are already drunk and trying to do something they think is mildly funny already.replyjustinclift 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There's got to be an automated chatbot (or perhaps \"voice bot\") opportunity in there somewhere. ;)replybityard 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This was my friend's grandfather's number in my area when I was growing up.

Don’t change your number.replyBizarroLand 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's been 41 years since the song came out.Assuming that Jenny was 21 when the song was written, (since there is a chance the number was written on a bar's bathroom wall) she would be at least 62 years old now.Statistically, there's at least a 1 in 4 chance that Jenny is dead now, and there is no chance that she didn't change her number after receiving 800 million horny crank calls.replyhinkley 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It was about 5 years ago when I realized that 8675309 is hitting all of the numbers on the keypad diagonally in stripes from the upper left to the lower right, skipping 1 for some reason.Probably so he could rhyme 'mine' with 'nine'replybaz00 16 hours ago | prev | next [–] Github has some very dangerous features when it comes to tagging and mentions. For example, when you add someone to an organisation, it autocompletes the username. We had someone with a fairly common name and accidentally added someone else to the org with a close but not identical name. Fortunately they didn't accept the invitation before we removed them again and added the correct person.reply9dev 12 hours ago | parent | next [–] Right? This bugs me like hell. They make you jump through all kinds of hoops to attestate your source code and use layers upon layers of encryption, but make it the simplest thing to grant someone completely unrelated write access to all of your company’s code. Like what??replynaikrovek 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] you need one of those new fancy GitHub EMU enterprises instead of a normal one. it is driven solely by an identity provider like Okta or AzureAD.no one outside of your identity provider will ever know about you. your users have a read-only view of the greater github.com, but whatever access you give them within your enterprise.it's impossible to make anything public in a GitHub EMU enterprise, and your users won't even be able to star repos outside of the enterprise, because that would reveal your presence.if you can live without any public access to your stuff at all, have a look. you can convert your old enterprise org(s) to a Teams subscription and continue to publish open stuff there, but you'll need personal accounts there, like always.replyWashuu 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I had that happen to me before. I accepted the invitation, looked at their stuff, and then submitted an issue/PR to remove myself. They panicked, I laughed a bit.replyTheHappyOddish 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yep, I got added to someones internal company trello board oncr. I commented a few times asking to be removed, and when it didn't happen, I started adding suggestions to their product designs.

I only bothered creating an account when it was clear that Github was more than a fad and a few of the projects I contributed to moved there. I tried just my initials and it worked.Having a two-letter username is less exciting than simply a common word or name, though. Once in a while I get mentioned by accident in issues, or added to some organization. Twice I have had someone beg me to give it to them under the rationalization that it was \"really cool\" and I wasn't really \"doing anything\" with it...EDIT: I just looked up my ID and apparently none of the first half-million people to sign up for a github account tried to brute-force the small-username space.EDIT2: There are a few single-letter usernames with IDs in the millions, so I wonder if those are somehow \"kept in reserve\" by github admins and given out to friends or what's the story there.replylabster 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There are 17576 three-letter combinations in the English alphabet.replyhawaiianbrah 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not to mention all the one- and two-letter combinations!replyhinkley 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Well there’s about 1/26th as many of those.replyw-m 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There are some more three-character user names if you count dashes and digits, which are also allowed in GitHub usernames.

We were rather alarmed to find, under an issue for a public repo, a link to a PR in our private repo.Fortunately, in incognito mode it disappeared, and also when logged in under a different account.

But for a moment it was a very unpleasant surprise.replydzaima 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] \"https://github.com./a/b\" or \"https://www.github.com/a/b\" also work as \"workarounds\".

Add malicious code to that PR and merge.Edit: also what is stupid is at work when setting up your organisation security access you can add anyone globally in the combo search. No org-only filter is even available!And of course most people use weird handles for their work or personal githubs. So using their UI you need to be an excellent human string comparator or make sure you copy and paste each persons handle which you meed to figure out for each person.Attack 3: create a bunch of accounts with a similar name to people who work at target company and hope you get added to an org’s repo by mistake.replydpedu 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] Some people have done it by accident:GitHub user sends notification to 400k users [2022]https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31627061replyavgcorrection 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don’t know who should be embarrassed here.

Is it mostly because of synchronous/asynchronous needs or there is something else such as latency or even ease of implementation?replyozarker 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] Depends on your use case. Queueing messages enables the competing consumer flow which implicitly allows load-leveling which is great if your traffic is spiky and you need a little time to auto-scale or other scenarios like that. If you’re just looking to blast out data to all consumers or just load-balancing is fine, approaches like yours are probably better.replypravus 41 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] If your workers can hop onto the next task without having to reach out for any additional state or report back to anything synchronously a distributed log/spool/queue/broker works well.If you need light-weight reporting like a status code you can use RPC/reply mechanisms if the broker supports it (e.g. rabbitmq), build your own (custom headers), or use an API/gRPC call.Everything else starts needing some sort of more sophisticated coordination mechanism and gRPC will look attractive for that although there are usually other options as well.replyimachine1980_ 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] grpc client a -> grpc server a for client a grpc client b -> grpc server a for client bgrpc client a -> message broker(implemen a) -->grpc client b -> message broker(implemen b) -->message broker-> your app for the broker this make sense if dont make sense manage the quque in your app if ypu want to abstract the implementations is worth if you have n to 1 or n to n and all works differentreplyMathMonkeyMan 35 minutes ago | prev | next [–] They actually open sourced it!I worked on this team very briefly.

One of the reasons this was probably created was because of a network constrained environment where data is expensive in more than one way.Cloud Providers can be expensive.replyWJW 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Bloomberg (who built this) operate a system that makes money by transmitting the same data to a huge amount of clients. Having one server transmit the same piece of information to a million client is approximately 500 times slower than having one server transmit it to 1000 proxies who each pass it on to 1000 end users.replypclmulqdq 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The actual architecture of most of these systems in finance relies heavily on UDP multicast, which is a technology that big tech has basically forgotten because it can be tough to administer at large scale.Multicast puts the entire load of distributing the data in its natural place: the network. The pub/sub queues that the rest of the world uses are more complicated and a lot worse.This appears to be the beginning of a \"cloud-native\" bloomberg that can't lean on multicast.replyeric-hu 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Cloud Providers can be expensive.Do you have a story around this?

It's part of a pricing strategy by cloud providers that encourages folks to put all their infrastructure inside of the cloud and to have none of it outside the cloud.

Don't forget to group items and set names so you can reference them later.2. Once exported, insert the SVG in an HTML page and add anime.js.

Looking at it the other way, you go from having problems when 2/3 are slow/broken to having problems when 2/4 are slow/broken. (also note slow doesn't even mean the machine is having problems; in geographically distributed setups it may just be due to physical distance from the leader.)Yes, 4 servers might handle more load than 3 servers [1], but so would 5 servers. I'd guess that if you've got enough message queue traffic that 3 servers can't handle the load, those servers aren't a significant fraction of your total cost. You might as well go to 5. Likewise, if 5 aren't enough, I'd skip over 6 and go to 7. If 7 aren't enough...I'd probably rethink my design entirely...but I'd prefer 9 to 8.Alternatively, quorum systems can support \"zero-weight replicas\" which effectively don't vote but still can be useful for eventually consistent reads. Then you have this server that helps handle the load but doesn't increase the number of servers that have to participate in a round.[1] if the load is overwhelmingly eventually consistent read operations and their multi-hop topology with proxies doesn't sufficiently reduce the load on the replicas. It's not obvious to me if this scenario is plausible or not.replynine_zeros 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Agreed.

Things like writing another queue system will have zero impact on the industry unless it's adopted widely (and cargo culted) and later made worse.Maybe I'm about to eat my shoe, but if a capable of team at Bloomberg wanted to reinvent something considered unnecessary in terms of industry need, they probably could if for no other reason that management allowing some indulgence in exchange for keeping talented people around is Worth It™.replyBossingAround 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > I'm curious if hospitals (if that's even analogous to a company) do similar things by having different processes to solve the same problem.Of course they do, unless the processes are regulated by a country (such as handling highly addictive opiates in the US).replythfuran 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, pretty much any medium to large company is going to have a bunch of processes for doing things that any company that size needs to do and some more that are a bit more industry/domain specific but still basically the same as those at every other company in the space.replyquercusa 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] In the US, all hospitals are required to use electronic health records (EHRs) and most are implemented in Epic, the leading EHR system.

It is by no means exhaustive and deliberately avoids any formal specification or proof. Readers looking for an exhaustive explanation should refer to the Raft paper, which acts as a strong inspiration for BlazingMQ’s leader election algorithm.So their own homegrown leader election algorithm?> BlazingMQ’s leader election and state machine replication differs from that of Raft in one way: in Rafts leader election, only the node having the most up-to-date log can become the leader. If a follower receives an election proposal from a node with stale view of the log, it will not support it. This ensures that the elected leader has up-to-date messages in the replicated stream, and simply needs to sync up any followers which are not up to date. A good thing about this choice is that messages always flow from leader to follower nodes.> BlazingMQ’s elector implementation relaxes this requirement. Any node in the cluster can become a leader, irrespective of its position in the log. This adds additional complexity in that a new leader needs to synchronize its state with the followers and that a follower node may need to send messages to the new leader if the latter is not up to date. However, this deviation from Raft and the custom synchronization protocol comes in handy because it allows BlazingMQ to avoid flushing (fsync) every message to disk. Readers familiar with Apache Kafka internals will see similarities between the two systems here.\"a new leader needs to synchronize its state with the followers and that a follower node may need to send messages to the new leader if the latter is not up to date\".

Systems of this sort are best secured at the network level, i.e. only trusted hosts should be able to connect to it. Redis is a good example of where this has been tried: it does support password based log in, but the password is stored and transmitted in plaintext, and a redis server will happily accept thousands of auth attempts per second making brute forcing a viable attack. Rather than improve the auth system Redis has instead doubled down on encouraging appropriate network level security by defaulting to only being accessible to the local host, so admins have to go through an explicit step (with warnings) before they can just expose it to the internet.replyljm 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Do you really need it?

It's not even that hard to achieve, compared to the learning curve of the borrow checker.Once rust gets plugged into Why3 and gets some industrial-grade proof capacity, the question of 'is it written in rust?' will be automatic (as in 'why would you do it any other way?').replymikepurvis 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rust's guarantees are all about what's happening inside your own process with memory ownership. \"Security\" in the context of a middleware like this is almost certainly more about external validation/auth— what prevents some random node from injecting messages into the queue, or adding itself as a subscriber to the output?Also, it's a super bad-faith argument to talk about an entire program being in an unsafe block.

It appears predominant delay is in ACKing to ensure durability, right?C++ and Java client examples are very simple which is cool.Would appreciate if there is hook to enable `SO_TIMESTAMPNS` on socket and retrieve `cmsg` to get accurate timestamping and permit client code benchmarking.replysay_it_as_it_is 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] Why is Bloomberg approving the open sourcing of this system?replyloire280 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] Why wouldn’t they?

Not long ago, it was a common decision for C++ projects because dependency management was a mess. But that hasn’t been the case for a long time (arguably we have the opposite problem - there are so many ways of doing it: Conan, vcpkg, bazel, spack, raw cmake, nix, etc)So what would the pros and cons be today and why is it a selling point?For instance, a pro is that everything is bespoke to the task at hand, no hammering square pegs into round holes designed for a slightly different use case.A con is that the entire attack surface is managed by one team. CVEs identified and solved on another project is a pretty good thing when you depend on that project.The main reason I’m surprised, though, is that there are some no-brainer dependencies these days.

As this is a high speed message bus, it's entirely appropriate.These are also basically application-level network routers which really don't need huge levels of dependencies so to be honest I'd be running away from anything that claims it's written using 1000s of the newest, latest and greatest whatevers. Churning out a faster string grinder is what I'm looking for.replyomeid2 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sending patches to fix a project is hard work, sending patches to fix issues in a projects' upstream projects is even harder.This alone is an important point to avoid dependencies, specially if you're anything like Bloomberg.replyi-use-nixos-btw 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I run into that problem a lot, to be fair.Though my approach is to fork and maintain the fork until my PR is accepted, merged, and in a tagged release.Another is to apply a diff to the dependency within the build system, which is what I do a lot in Nix (mainly to solve cmake issues on hermetic builds).Either way, it isn't unsurmountable. It doesn't really matter so much if it's used as an executable rather than as a library, though in the case of the latter it's really handy to be able to e.g. pass a custom spdlog sink for logging.replydavidkunz 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] It's called BlazingMQ but not written in Rust?!replygabereiser 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] I’ll admit, I went into their repo expecting to find Rust, or at the very least go.

Queueing things is literally the opposite of making things fast.You likely need to read about message queues, why they are used, and why they have performance constraints. Message queues are a system, and the system to maintain those queues and content has an overhead. The project is building a solution that is higher performing than comparable systems.Queuing things often makes things faster (!) as you are usually dealing with limited resources (ex: web and job workers) and need to operate on other systems (ex: payments) that have their own distinct capacity.If you have 1000 web workers, and your upstream payment provider supports 10 payments per minute, you'll quickly have timeouts and other issues with 1000 web workers trying to process payments. Your site won't process anything else while waiting for the payment provider if all web workers are doing this task.A queue will let you process 1000 web requests, and trickle 10 requests to your payment provider. At some point that queue will fill, but that's a separate issue.Meanwhile, your 1000 web workers are free to process the next requests (ex: your homepage news feed).replygdy 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] \"At some point that queue will fill, but that's a separate issue\"Would you recommend something to read about that?replymasom 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a bit difficult to cover as it is highly dependent on the queue system you use.You'd usually want your queue system to fail the enqueue if it is full, and you'd want monitoring to ensure the queue isn't growing at an unsustainable rate.It also forces you to think a bit about your message payload (rich data or foreign keys the worker loads).RabbitMQ, Redis-based queues (ex: ActiveJob or sidekiq), Gearman, and others will all offer different mechanisms to tackle full queues.replyinsanitybit 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think there's two really obvious points.1. They're referring to the queueing itself. They're not saying \"this will make some other thing fast\" they're saying \"this is fast at queueing\".2. Queuing is not the opposite of making things fast.replytherealdrag0 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You’re misunderstanding the discussion. If you think of queuing as “waiting to process” then yes it’s slower than not waiting. But that’s not at all the necessary implication of these components. In fact “synchronous” requests are buffered (queued?) internally and can be delayed before processing. So the distinction is irrelevant to performance. And the implementation is what matters.replyLoganDark 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Queueing things can result in better throughput because you don't have to wait for the other side to process your last message before you can begin work on the next one.replyjeffbee 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's just buffering. A lot of people use Kafka this way, as an impedance adapter for a producer with an internal architecture that can't tolerate blocking on production. Of course this requires you to unrealistically assume that Kafka is a zero-impedance message sink.But what I think the other post is alluding to is the fact that in-order delivery is often not a requirement, and can be an anti-feature. I know that in every use of Kafka I have personally encountered the relative order of messages was quite irrelevant but the in-order implementation of Kafka converts the inability to process a single record into an emergency.replytherealdrag0 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There’s a lot of brokers without ordering guarantees.

    "originBody": "SchemescapeDevelopment log of a life-long coderTopics:  programming-languages lisp It's 2023, so of course I'm learning Common LispApril 25, 2023I've spent some time contemplating future-proof programming languages because I want to enusre that code I write will be usable in the future. Generally, if I want to build something and share it with others, I'm a pragmatist, so I'll use JavaScript choose a programming language that is popular, portable, and convenient.But other times, I just want to have fun and experiment with other programming languages and tools. In that vein, I've been monitoring a few single-syllable, intriguing-but-maybe-not-future-proof programming languages such as Nim and Zig. Sometimes these experiments open my eyes to new ways of programming or new tools that eventually become indispensible.JanetVery recently, I ran across a newly-published (free) book about the Janet programming language called Janet for Mortals and it piqued my interest. Janet is a relatively small Lisp/Clojure-inspired scripting language that tries to fill a similar niche to Lua, but with an actual standard library (and, of course, Lisp-style metaprogramming and compile-time execution via macros).Janet for Mortals is an entertaining and informative read, and it gave me the nudge I needed to become interested in Lisps again. I had previously abandoned using Scheme because, frankly, I ran out of free time for exploratory programming. But while I was reading about Janet, I kept coming back to one question: why should I use Janet instead of an established Lisp, e.g. Scheme?For me, the most attractive qualities of Janet (other than general Lispiness) are portability, embeddability, and Parsing Expression Grammars. Realistically, however, I don't currently have any need to embed a language, so that leaves portability and parsing. As far as portability, CHICKEN Scheme, CLISP, and Steel Bank Common Lisp looked acceptable. For parsing, Packrat looked reasonable.At this point, I started to run out of reasons to pursue Janet instead of an established Lisp.Common LispDuring my research, I ran across a blog post describing Common Lisp's (mostly) unique REPL-driven workflow. In that post, the author describes handling a runtime error by just fixing the broken code--in-place, without any restarts:Try this in your favorite repl:Define a function, foo, that calls some other function, bar, that is not yet defined. Now call foo. What happens?Obviously, the call to foo breaks, because bar is not defined. But what happens when it breaks?...The answer to that question is the differentiating point of repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk environment, the break in foo drops you into a breakloop.A breakloop is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data in the running program.What's more, you can edit all live data in the program. If you think that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended function....Moreover, because the entire language and development system are available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing function bar, resume foo, and get a sensible result.I've seen various (often unreliable) \"edit and continue\" features over the years, but I didn't realize that Common Lisp was built with this sort of workflow in mind.When I first learned to program, I used \"printf debugging\", where I'd temporarily add in code to log values, recompile, run, and inspect the output to troubleshoot problems. Eventually, I ran into scenarios where I couldn't modify the program or rerun it, so I learned to use a debugger. Using a real debugger is definitely the right thing to do, but setting up a debugging environment is often painful (and sometimes impossible).Common Lisp seems to take debugging a step further. Sure, I've modified memory in a debugger to test out potential fixes, but being able to rewrite code and patch into a live process in a sane way sounds amazing--almost too good to be true.That new workflow is my motivation for learning Common Lisp. I want to try interactively building a program to see if it's a pleasant way to work.Is it a good idea to learn a new programming language and standard library just to explore a new workflow? Maybe not, but I'm not sure there's a great alternative. I'm sure similar REPL-editor integrations exist in other languages, but I also suspect that they're buggier because they've been bolted on, rather than supported from the beginning. Additionally, if I put in the work and am not satisfied with the workflow after all, I can rest assured that I gave it the best possible chance, using standard tools.Regardless, it should be an interesting adventure!↵ Back to home",

Eventually, I want to write a follow-up, but I'm still a beginner.Here's what I've liked about Common Lisp so far:* The condition system is neat and I've never used anything like it -- you can easily control code from afar with restarts* REPL-driven programming is handy in situations where you don't quite know what will happen and don't want to lose context -- for example parsing data from a source you're unfamiliar with, you can just update your code and continue on instead of having to save, possibly compile, and restart from the very beginning* Common Lisp has a lot of implementations and there's a good deal of interoperability -- I was able to swap out implementations to trade speed (SBCL) for memory usage (CLISP) in one case (multiple compatible implementations is one of the reasons I've been leaning towards CL instead of Scheme for learning a Lisp)* Even as an Emacs noob, the integration with Common Lisp is excellent, and it works great even on my super slow netbook where I've been developing -- this isn't as big of an advantage these days with fast computers, VS Code, and language servers, but it's definitely retrofuturisticThere's also a few things I don't like:* The most popular package manager (QuickLisp) is nice, but not nearly as featureful as I've become accustomed to with newer languages/ecosystems* Since the language itself is frozen in time, you need lots of interoperability libraries for threads, synchronization, command line arguments, and tons of other things* I really, really wish SBCL could support fully static builds, to enable distributing binaries to non-glibc Linux distributionsI'm sure there are more pros/cons, but that's what came to mind just now.replychlorion 20 hours ago | parent | next [–] I have some cons!Last time I checked on it, QuickLisp doesn't support fetching packages over anything except for plain http, with no encryption and no verification mechanism in place to detect files that may have been tampered with during transmission.I think not supporting encryption or authentication for something as important as fetching source code makes QL a non-starter for me and hopefully for anyone else who cares about security.Another issue I have ran into, is that SBCL is hosted on sourceforge, which has in the past injected malware into projects downloadable archives! I consider this to also be a security issue, and sourceforge in general is not pleasant to work with. I don't think there are any valid reasons to continue to use sourceforge today, so why such an important project continues to use it confuses me a lot.I don't see these issues mentioned by anyone else which is bizarre to me.I really like lisps and common lisp specifically but things like this has driven me away from using it and it doesn't appear that anyone cares about fixing these things.replyvindarel 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Solutions for the lack of https:- add in https://github.com/rudolfochrist/ql-https (downloads packages with curl)- use another package manager, CLPM: https://www.clpm.dev (or the newest ocicl)> CLPM comes as a pre-built binary, supports HTTPS by default, supports installing multiple package versions, supports versioned systems, and more.- use mitmproxy: https://hiphish.github.io/blog/2022/03/19/securing-quicklisp...replyristos 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] These issues get mentioned a lot, you just haven't noticed I guess. Sourceforge is also an issue with some C libraries too, I'm guessing because it was done a long time ago? not sure.I use ECL because it has really good C interop. It actually lets you inline C and access macros directly, making it a great glue language for C libraries. It's what I'm using it for now. I think you might even be able to avoid the GC entirely and use it to script C programs together in a performant way, by using the C FFI to allocate and manage the memory, including the ECL types, instead of the GC. And that's actually doable because of how good the inspector/debugger for lisp is. You can even inline assembly. I'm working on a bunch of CL stuff around this sort of thing, I plan to do a writeup of it and share it once I've developed it more.Lisp has it's downsides, but the C FFI/embeddability, along with the excellent low-level debugger/inspector, interactivity, and conditions and restarts, makes it worth the time for me to invest in it. And the stability of the language. My main gripe is the reader, but it's easy-ish enough to avoid the problems with named-readtables, or a simple lisp parser for `read` or whatever. I like Clojure, but it's missing some key stuff from the old lisp world that I'd love to see. Shadow-cljs is awesome.replylukego 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Nix has a really convenient new CL libraries packaging upstream now. That verifies everything with sha256. It's quite complete because it's seeded from Quicklisp and had more packages added on (aswell as their native library dependcies.)Nix isn't to everyone's taste but it demonstrates that you can treat security/reproducibility/etc as orthogonal to Quicklisp and Sourceforge (and to Lisp native tooling in general.)replyschemescape 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Quicklisp doesn’t use TLS or signatures? How have I not heard this before?That would be unbelievably irresponsible. Has this really not been addressed by the CL community?Edit: here’s the issue: https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-client/issues/167Thanks for bringing this up!replykoito17 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The reason for this is quite simple: portability. Quicklisp also uses plain TAR files to distribute dists. Why? Because quicklisp has a built-in TAR extractor written in 100% standard/portable CL. This allows Quicklisp to run on just about everything, from your computer to real LispMs and operating systems like Mezzano.TLS comes up every time someone discusses Quicklisp, but nobody bothers to go ahead and actually implement it portably (and even if they did, have fun with performance and side channel attacks, both of which require you to break portability to implement well for every platform you want to target).If you would like a more stereotypical package manager, consider using CLPM. Though one of the big reasons to use CLPM is not encryption IMO, but versioning. ASDF supports locking versions of dependencies, but Quicklisp doesnt ever use this and instead constantly pushes latest of everything from git repositories. This IMO sucks a lot more than using plain HTTP given that this actually breaks code, whereas some MITM from plain HTTP connection to Quicklisp would require so much coordination (and specificity of target) that it's just not in my threat model at all.replychlorion 23 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't really buy this argument at all.There is no technical reason why quicklisp couldn't use the systems libcurl and openssl when its available and fallback to fetching with its portable http implementation when they aren't available.Every other languages package manager has managed to solve this issue!If the issue is that nobody has actually had time to work on it, that's fair, but I don't believe that optionally supporting libcurl would cause QL to be less portable.replyristos 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] This does keep coming up, and it's a few years old now. I think Quicklisp can easily still support https while supporting the older packages that are tar+http, which could easily be mirrored in a git repo. Quicklisp has unfortunately taken over the entire ecosystem, making it hard to use anything else, and you often need to depend on it to use a lot of tools in the ecosystem. It sort of reminds me of Systemd in that way.I agree on the version pinning being a worse situation, and also not having something like \"node_modules\" for lisp. I haven't tried CLPM since a while back, it was kind of hard to setup back then.I have a little package manager thing, cl-micropm, that just uses Quicklisp to fetch everything via docker (should probably support podman too), and an .envrc file to tell ASDF to look in the project directory (a project-local node_modules-like folder called \"lisp-systems\") for systems. That way I can pin my deps manually by picking the commits + git submodule in lisp-systems/, and it's isolated to my local project. I looked into using the Docker container to rewrite the requests to use https, bypassing whatever Quicklisp is doing, but I never got around to that.I'm looking to switch it to something even simpler/explicit though, cl-pm, that'll only optionally need/use Quicklisp via podman _only_ to figure out what the dependencies are, and then just have a function that uses wget/curl/git-pull to conveniently explicitly pull them in on request. That way you can decide to add a git mirror for an old http library, or pin a specific version, etc. It's slightly more manual than Quicklisp or CLPM, not a big deal, but very easy for anyone with just a little bit of lisp knowledge to understand the whole thing in under an hour.replyaidenn0 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Quicklisp has unfortunately taken over the entire ecosystem, making it hard to use anything else, and you often need to depend on it to use a lot of tools in the ecosystem. It sort of reminds me of Systemd in that way.This is a strange statement.What requires QL to work? In the \"bad old days\" you had to manually download the sources and drop them somewhere ASDF could find them[1]. This still works. You can blithely live as if QL does not exist and get that same experience.1: Yes, there was asdf-install, but I think I managed to get that to work once with about half-a-dozen tries?replyristos 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ultralisp, Rowsell, Qlot, Quickdocs, etc. Virtually every modern project build/install instructions reference Quicklisp. You have no idea which dependencies you need to pull and from where, which can be a real PITA for a large project. A lot of project code I've looked at also has Quicklisp references in the actual code for whatever reason, usually for testing or building or whatever else, so to run those you need Quicklisp. It's really hard not to say it's taken over the ecosystem or that there isn't lock-in, I don't know what you mean to be honest. Quicklisp is also a curated list gatekept by one person, so whatever is on there isn't really representative of everything that's being worked on. You can publish on Ultralisp if you don't want to wait or if it wasn't accepted, but then you're still using Quicklisp under the hood. And it's hard to discover things on Github/Gitlab/etc because there's a lot of stub repos just trying things out, with little to no stars.I'd love to see ecosystem support for other package managers. CLPM is still in beta and has been for a good while now. Quicklisp too. Quicklisp famously doesn't support HTTPS, version pinning, project locals, etc, which has really throttled any progress with the Common Lisp ecosystem. It's not like ASDF at all, which is become a standard that's built into a lot of the lisp compilers.replyschemescape 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Quicklisp doesnt ever use this and instead constantly pushes latest of everything from git repositoriesYeah, I didn't recall off hand, but this was one of my main complaints with Quicklisp vs. other package managers I've used (for other ecosystems--not CL).> whereas some MITM from plain HTTP connection to Quicklisp would require so much coordination (and specificity of target) that it's just not in my threat model at allI hope you're right, but it still seems like an unnecessary risk. Even if I can't imagine a scenario where someone is able to MITM me (or, more likely, a server I'm deploying code to), there's still the lingering feeling that it's possible. I certainly wouldn't download an executable over HTTP and run it, and downloading library code is fairly similar (although easier to inspect, at least).replyeadmund 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Quicklisp doesn’t need to support TLS, but it does need to support authentication of some sort.

There’s a ton of future work to improve things even above the current state of the art.But that state of the art is still better than what everyone else is using.

I edit the source files and have my editor eval the changes I made in the source. This gets me the benefit that should my changes work, I don't have to retype them to get them into version control. This works because the Lisp REPL is designed to be able to switch into any existing package, apply code there, and also switch back to the CL-USER package after. My editor uses the same mechanism and only has to inject a single prefix (`in-package :xyz`) before it pastes the code I've selected for eval.In Python, editing a method in a class inside some module (i.e., not toplevel) is less easy. At least, I haven't found any editor support for it. What I did find is the common advice to just reload the whole module/file.Okay, so let's reload the whole module, then? Well, Python isn't really built for frequent module reloads and that can sometimes bite. In Common Lisp, the assumption that any code may be re-eval-ed is built in. For example, there's two ways of declaring a global value in CL: defvar and defparameter. The latter is simply an assignment of a value to a variable in the global scope, but the former is special. By default, `defvar` defines a variable only if it's not already defined. So that a CL source file may be loaded and reloaded any number of times without resetting a global variable.Then there's classes. Oh my. Common Lisp has the most powerful (in terms of flexibility) OO system I know of. Not only can you redefine functions and methods, you can even redefine classes dynamically. Adding a property to a class adds that property to all existing objects of that class. Removing a property from a class removes it from all existing objects of that class. This feature is no longer CL-exclusive, but it is sufficient to offer a massive advantage over Python. I don't need to talk about method combinations, multi-methods and the many other cool features of the Common Lisp Object System here.Then there's the debugging system. In Python, when an exception is thrown, it immediately unwinds the stack all the way up until it is first caught. So not only do you need to know beforehand where to catch what exception, if you get it wrong you cannot inspect the site of the error. In CL, a condition (\"exception\") does not unwind the stack until a restart is chosen. Not when it is caught, but rather when — after being caught — a resolution mechanism has been chosen. This allows interactive debugging (another cool CL feature) to inspect the stack frames at (and above) the site of error, redefine whatever code needs to be corrected, all before the error is allowed to unwind and destroy the stack. You still need to set-up handlers (and restarts) before the error happens, but you can be absolutely wildly lax and use catch-all handlers anywhere on the stack and restarts that take absolutely anything (even functions) at debug-time so you don't really need to be prescient with your error handling code unlike in Python.I'm sure there's more, but I think this is pretty sufficient.replymathisfun123 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >Note that we are not in some debug mode, to get this functionality.Jesus Christ I swear it's like you ascribe mysterious powers to the parens.

Like seriously tell me how you think this works if it's not effectively catching/trapping some sigkill or something that's the equivalent thereof?I have never in my life met this kind of intransigence on just manifestly obvious things.replylispm 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Common Lisp programs run by default in a way that calls to undefined functions are detected.Here the Lisp simply tries to look up the function object from the symbol. There is no function, so it signals a condition (aka exception). The default exception handler gets called (without unwinding the stack). This handler prints the restarts and calls another REPL.

A CL program can very well have a mix of interpreted functions and compiled functions, and use late or eager binding based on that. This is mostly up to the programmer to decide, by using declarations to control how, when, and if compilation should happen.replywhartung 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It should also be noted that by spec symbols in the system package (like + and such) should not be redefined.

I do this absolutely all the time. You can debug from one process to another if you've loaded the right hooks. You don't need to take my word for it or even try to do it; you just need to reason a fortiori: python can do it because it's an interpreter with a boxed calling convention and managed memory, just like lisp interpreters.It's amazing: people will die on this hill for some reason but lisp isn't some kind of mysterious system that was and continues to be beyond us mere mortal language/runtime designers. the good ideas in lisp were recognized as good ideas and then incorporated and improved upon.replyvkazanov 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The answer to all these things should be \"just doesn't work in practise\", not for real programs anyways.

It’s a communication failure. The thing that you think you are doing in Python is not the thing that people are doing in Lisp.As an example, I suppose that when you’re developing code in Python’s pseudo-REPL you often reimport a file containing class definitions. When you do that, what happens to all the old objects with the old class definition? Nothing, they still belong to the old class.If you did this on a REPL connected to a server, what would happen to the classes of objects currently being computed on? Nothing, they would still belong to the old class.In Lisp, it’s different. There is a defined protocol for what happens when a class is redefined. Every single object belonging to the old class gets updated to the new class. You can define code to get called when this happens (say, you added a new mandatory field, or need to calculate a new field based on old ones — and of course ‘calculate’ could also mean ‘open a network connection, dial out to a database and look up the answer’ or even ‘print the old object and offer the system operator a list of options for how to proceed’). And everything that is currently in-flight gets updated, in a regular and easy-to-understand way.People are telling you ‘with Lisp central air conditioning, I can easily heat my house in the winter’ and you are saying ‘with Python, I can easily build a fire whenever my house gets cold too!’replyregularfry 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Python is the wrong example here.

But then Ruby always was explicitly very lispy.replyLispSporks22 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I think in just about every response you left in these threads, you misunderstood what was being said. Possibly through impatience, or just plain arrogance. I really encourage you to spend some time trying to understand how interactivity/restartability (as in Lisp restarts, not process restarts) is built into the language. Especially if you're specializing in the compilers of dynamic languages.You might also check out Smalltalk, which has a similar level of dynamism.replynmlrpzt 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] As others here, I don't understand how those features (seamless continuation of a program with the exact state) could possibly work in Python.What I do know is that the Python community has a propensity for claiming that approximations of complex features by gigantic hacks work and are sound, while they are not.The Python community also has an extreme tolerance for unsound and buggy software that is propped up by censoring those who complain. Occasional complaints are offset by happy (and selected) marketing talks at your nearest PyCon.replyvkazanov 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Listen, I've been on many sides: Lisp stuff, Python stuff, C stuff, etc. I don't think that \"something has to be learned\". Lisp has many good ideas, Python has good ideas. But REPL-driven development is not one of them. But let me explain.You see, it's not about how REPL in Python just does not allow something (even though it is rather primitive). Python makes it superhard to tweak things, even if you can change a certain variable in memory. Here's why.Think about Lisp programs, including OOP flavours. These fundamentally consist of 2 things: a list of functions + a list a variables. If you replace a function or a variable then every call will go through it. And that's it. You change a function - all calls to it will be routed through the new implementation. Because of REPL-centric culture of things people really do organise their programs around this style of development.Python was developed with an dynamic OOP idea in mind where everything is an object, everything is a reference. Endless references to references of references to references. It's a massive graph, including methods and functions and objects and classes and metaclasses. There is no single list of functions where you can just replace this name-to-implementation mapping.TL;DR Replacing a single reference doesn't change much in the general case. It does work in some cases. But that's not enough for people to rely on it as main development driver.Python fundamentally makes a different tradeoff than your average lisp.replyregularfry 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've mentioned this in a sibling thread, but it's interesting to compare this to Ruby. Ruby does support the sort of redefinition you're talking about. And yet REPL-centric development isn't primary there, either. Yes, there are very good REPL implementations, but I don't know of anyone who develops at the Ruby REPL the same way you would in a Lisp REPL. Maybe it's a performance thing? Maybe it's the lack of images?replyvkazanov 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Lispy expressions are easy to type into a repl?

In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk environment, the break in foo drops you into a breakloop.do you want me to show you how to do this in a python repl? it's literally just breaking on exception...replyeadmund 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, it’s not: an exception unwinds the stack all the way up to where the exception is caught. By the time the enclosing Python pseudo-REPL sees the undefined function error, all the intervening stack frames have dissolved. The way it works is that a function tries code, and catches exceptions.In Lisp (and I believe Smalltalk), it doesn’t work that way: there is an indirection. Rather than try/except, a function registers a condition handler; when that particular condition happens, the handler is called without unwinding the stack. That handler can do anything, to include reading and evaluating more code. And re-trying the failed operation.It would be possible to implement this in Python, of course, but it doesn’t offer the affordances (e.g. macros) that Lisp has, and it’s not built into the language like it is in Lisp (e.g., every single unoptimised function call in Lisp offers an implicit ‘retry’).replyactuallyalys 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] IMO, the downside with the term REPL is that if you don't understand the specific Lisp definitions of the terms, it sounds like any other interactive execution environment.replyCalamitous 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > i get downvoted by the lisp crowd every time i bring up that the repl isn't a differentiating feature anymoreI’d suggest it has more to do with tone than content.replyrfrey 20 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The repls you mention are not like lisp repls.

Whether or not it's possible (or how close just quick live reload) is to this it' definitely not a first class citizen like you presented. It also reminds me of Pharo (or maybe just smalltalk, I've only played with Pharo) where you build the program incrementally \"inside out\".It does make me wonder how aplicable this way of programming is to what I do at work but that is more because of the technologies and architectural choices where most of the work is plumbing stuff that is not local to the program itself together. And maybe even for that with the edges mocked out it would make sense to work like this.Again, interesting video that made me think. Thanks.replyschemescape 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, Smalltalk/Pharo also support this.Being able to interactively update code in response to an error, without leaving the error context and being able to restart stack frames (not just a “catch” or top level, as in most languages) is one of the key features that makes REPL-driven development possible. Or at least that’s how I see it.It’s not something you always need to use, but it can be handy, especially for prototyping and validating fixes.replymathisfun123 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] There's a person above saying that it's about being to able to mutate program state from the repl, which is a thing that's also possible in any repl for a language with managed memory.replyschemescape 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not just from the REPL, but from the REPL in the context where the error occurred, without having to structure the code ahead of time to support this. It’s not always an important distinction, but it’s handy when prototyping or if the error is difficult to reproduce.There are some other affordances for interactive programming, such as a standard way to update existing instances of classes. I’m sure you could implement this sort of functionality in any language, but this is universal and comes for free in Common Lisp.CL also has other interesting features such as macros, multiple dispatch, compilation at runtime, and being able to save a memory snapshot of the program. It’s quite unique.replyohyes 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Cl Condition system + repl = godmode. Your software crashes? Do you go back and set a breakpoint?

Also most other computer algebra systems are in this category, similar to Mathematica: Macsyma/Maxima, Axiom, ...> WolframLang has all the characteristics of LISPIt has many, but there are a lot of differences, too.The big difference is the actual engine. Mathematica is based on a 'rewrite system'. It translates expressions by applying rewrite rules.Lisp evaluates expressions either based on an interpreted evaluator or by evaluating compiled code. Lisp has macros, but those can be transformed before the code is compiled or running. The practical effect is that in many Lisp implementations usually all code is compiled, incl. user code. Mathematica uses C++ then. Most of the UI in Mathematica is implemented in C++, where many Lisp systems would implement that in native compiled Lisp.Thus the computation is very different. Using a rewrite system for programming is quite clunky and inefficient under the hood. A simple example would be to look how lexical closures are implemented.Another difference is that Mathematica does not expose the data representation of programs to the user all the time, where Lisp programs are also on the surface written as s-expressions (aka symbolic expressions) in text.The linked page from the Mathematica book also claims that Mathematica is a higher level language. Which is true. Lisp is lower level and languages like the Wolfram Language can be implemented in it. That's one of its original purposes: it's an implementation language for other ('higher-level') languages. Sometimes it already comes with embedded higher-level languages. CLOS + MOP (the meta-object protocol) would be an example for that.replymathisfun123 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Another difference is that Mathematica does not expose the data representation of programs to the user all the time, where Lisp programs are also on the surface written as s-expressions (aka symbolic expressions) in text.I have already addressed this: FullFormhttps://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/Expressions....>Thus the computation is very different.

Debug-run your code, an exception will be thrown at the call site, step up one frame from the exception (ie module level), define the missing function, call again and it succeeds - all without leaving the same repl instance. Don't believe me? Try it.I'll say it again: you guys are in plain denial not about python or lisp as languages but about how interpreters work. There's just nothing more to be said about this dimension of it.replyversteegen 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What's being asked is, after defining the missing function, whether it's possible to clear the exception and continue the execution without having to restart from the beginning. This is very useful when you hit an exception after 10 minutes of execution. (This is a real usecase which would have saved me untold hours.)I hope it's possible somehow, but if you just load pdb (e.g. with %pdb in ipython), pdb is entered in post-mortem mode, from which it's impossible to modify code/data and resume execution. Setting a breakpoint (or pdb.set_trace()) would requiring knowing about the bug ahead of time. Does it only work when interrupting with a remote debugger rather than on exception?However, it wouldn't be possible if the interpreter unwinds the stack looking for exception handlers before finding that there is none? In other languages/VMs such as SBCL the runtime can look up the stack for handlers, and invoke the debugger before destructively unwinding.replymathisfun123 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The other guy up above claims this is a feature unique to calling functions, rather than all error states, and that the lisp runtime specifically guards against this. If that's the case then my answer is very simple: it would be trivial to guard function calls (all function calls) to achieve the exact same functionality in python. I'm in bed but it would literally take me 5 minutes (I would hook eval of the CALL_FUNCTION opcode). Now it would be asinine because it's a six-sigma event that I call a function that isn't defined. On the other hand, setting a breakpoint and redefining functions as you go works perfectly well and is the common case and simultaneously the kind of \"repl driven development\" discussed all up and down this thread.replyversteegen 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thank you, you're very helpful despite this raging flame war.

Then when your bytecode of choice pops up, do what you want (including manipulate the stack) and advance the line number (cpython let's you advance the manipulate the line number).replyyaantc 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Calling again and continuing are not the same thing. Sure, with the above trivial example it is. But if the parent function has non idempotent code before calling the missing function (like doing some global change / side effects), then calling again will give a different result than just continuing from the current state.So is it possible to define the missing function and continue from the same state in Python? I don't think so, but I'm not a heavy Python user (just for small/medium scripts).replymathisfun123 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >So is it possible to define the missing function and continue from the same state in Python? I don't think so, but I'm not a heavy Python userThis is a pointless debate - someone has to catch the exception, save caller registers, handle the exception (if there's a handler) or reraise. Either you have to do it (by putting a try except there) or your runtime has to be always defensively saving registers or something. Lisp isn't magic, it's just a point on trade-off curve and I have without a shadow of a doubt proven that that point is very close to python (wrt the repl). So okay maybe clisp has made some design decisions that make it a hair more effective at resuming than python.

I'm really sad CPython can't do that, but maybe some other Python can. It shouldn't necessarily be any slower for the interpreter to figure out where to jump to before saving the execution trace and jumping.It's not \"pointless\", I was tearing out my hair and losing days because I couldn't do this in CPython.

This is a lot harder to do in a purely functional style, or at least it is in most opinionated functional programming implementations I’ve used, because you’re no longer “just” evaluating some expression but instead initializing state, reacting to I/O, then updating state and/or performing further I/O potentially while using parallelization to perform monitoring/listen for other things/perform further I/O and state updates.Of course it’s not impossible to do these things with Lisp but from my couple of semesters of exposure of FP in undergrad and use of FP features in C++ and Scala professionally to solve these kinds of problems… it seems quite hard to get FP to work for these applications, and that lack of suitability is what discourages me from diving more fully into FPreplyschemescape 18 hours ago | parent | next [–] > I see a lot of “coding” talk in the blog and comments from the author here, but few mentions as to what kind of software they’re building or what use cases they’re targeting.Good point! This is all currently just a hobby. For Common Lisp specifically, the only things I've produced are a (mediocre) Battlesnake client and a (now defunct, as of yesterday) multiplayer word scramble game. Neither of these really derives much benefit from being created in Lisp, but I learned a lot along the way (which was really the point).Unrelated to Common Lisp, I've found myself often needing to write code that generates code. This is an area where I suspect Lisp will shine, although I haven't had a chance to give it a try yet. Two examples from recent projects (which I tackled before ever thinking about using Common Lisp) are:* Generating code to validate a particular JSON Schema (used in a static site generator)* Generating JSX from Markdown (used for story content in a programming game)To say nothing of the innumerable C macros I've written in my lifetime :)replyopportune 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Thanks for the answer!

Though, the cost is that I seem to incur a few extra lookups or even sorts on each dynamically dispatched method, to resolve the implementation?

(asking as someone who almost never writes code)replytikhonj 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Because language popularity is, at best, loosely correlated with any intrinsic qualities of the language itself.replydb48x 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] See also advertising. C++ and Java had enormous advertising budgets, while Common Lisp had virtually none. For years, virtually every programming book and magazine was touting C++ and then later Java.

The nearest you might find is marketing for implementations back when people paid for programming languages, but the only surviving one of those is really Visual Studio.Lisp has had decades to break out of its niche if it delivered a really advantageous solution, but somehow that never happened.replyeadmund 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Lisp has had decades to break out of its niche if it delivered a really advantageous solution, but somehow that never happened.I think a huge part of it is that it is not immediately obvious that one needs what Lisp offers, and by the time the system has grown to the extent that the need is obvious, it has also grown to the extent that one no longer sees the fores for the trees. One doesn’t think ‘oh man, I need garbage collection’; one thinks, ‘oh man, I need to manage malloc and free better!’. One doesn’t think, ‘oh man, dynamic scope would really fit this problem well’; one thinks ‘oh man, I need dependency injection.’ Peter Norvig famously noted that 16 of the original 23 design patterns were invisible or simpler in dynamic languages such as Lisp†. Heck, there was a time when one couldn’t rely on recursion, or even conditionals! But the programmer who has managed to get stuff done without recursion, or without conditionals, or without macros doesn’t really see the point. He’s even worried: those things may add too much expressivity to the language. Why, folks could write unmaintainable code with them!Of course, folks write unmaintainable code without them, too …Anyway, I think a huge issue is one of education and experience. Ours is a massively growing field. The vast majority of folks are juniors, and don’t know any better; a portion of their education was miseducation. The seniors often have one year of experience, twenty times (rather than twenty years of experience). Objective standards are rare to nonexistent. Norms and standards are absent.But yeah, when I’m working on a large project in a language other than Lisp, I often think, ‘man, this would be so much easier in Lisp!’ or even ‘man, this would be practical in Lisp!’ (because anything is possible in a Turing-complete language …).†: https://norvig.com/design-patterns/ppframe.htmreplydb48x 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes, and whose advertisements do you think show up in every single one of those magazines? Which implementations get mentioned by every single C++ book? Which organization sponsored every single C++ conference? Don’t forget that they had stiff competition from the advertising budgets of other large companies, such as Oracle and IBM.Also, don’t forget that Lisp machines were once the most coveted development machines on the market. But Symbolics had to develop not only the language and IDE, but also the OS, the hardware, the microcode, and everything else all at once. It’s pretty telling that they soon began running Unix (on a separate processor) and then their next product was an add–in card for an Apple Macintosh II containing a Lisp processor ASIC. By then the C++ hype train was gathering steam and the AI winter had begun. Symbolics didn’t survive, and their direct competitor LMI had even less chance. So it’s not that Lisp offers no advantages, it’s just that market conditions killed off the companies that were offering it. Note that these market conditions were created by advertising and shifting public perception.I thus return to my thesis, which is that the market success of a language has little, if anything, to do with the advantages of the language. Instead marketing and advertising rule the day.replypjc50 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > But Symbolics had to develop not only the language and IDE, but also the OS, the hardware, the microcode, and everything else all at onceThis was forty years ago. Doing LISP advocacy like this just makes people sound like they're that Japanese guy who refused to surrender until the 1970s. The world has moved on; there have been other opportunities; and LISP has not won them either.replyAnimalMuppet 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I was going to disagree with you, until I re-read and noticed the word \"intrinsic\".I would say that language popularity is highly correlated with the actual usefulness of the language. But \"actual usefulness\" covers far more than the \"intrinsic qualities\" of the language. It also covers the scope and quality of the standard libraries, the third-party libraries, the available tools like compilers, IDEs, and debuggers (which may be third-party), available documentation and training, and people available to hire who know the language. Of those items I listed, the only parts that could be considered \"intrinsic\" are the standard libraries and the tooling that comes with the language by default.replydleslie 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Eventually you need to work with other people, and using a common time-shared or multi user session is unlikely. Now consider that lisp images generally can't be easily diff'd or merged.And with that the edit-and-continue paradigm loses much of its value. If you have to commit changes to a shared source file anyhow then you'll be not much worse off with debugging a core dump.replydb48x 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] People say this a lot, but they fail to take into account that you can debug your server live as it continues to handle normal traffic. Even if you don’t deploy changes via the REPL, merely debugging the problem in a REPL without restarting anything is a huge win.replydleslie 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Lots of languages that are not lisp have this ability.replydb48x 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don’t think that they do. I know that Erlang has something similar; you can reload a module and it will gradually replace the old code as processes are replaced. In principle you could debug a single thread in a C (or C++) program without stopping the others, and some IDEs will let you edit the code and recompile while the program is running (they patch out the old function definition so that it jumps to the new one instead), but good luck doing that in production.But don’t forget that in Common Lisp, you can redefine classes at run time as well as functions. All existing instances of the class will be updated to the new definition, and you can provide the code that decides how the old fields are translated into the new ones if the default behavior is insufficient. Good luck doing that in C or C++.My favorite story involved a race condition that was discovered in the code running on a satellite, after it had been launched. The software on the satellite was mostly written in Common Lisp (there was a C component as well), so they opened a connection to the satellite, started the REPL, debugged the problem, and uploaded replacement code (which obviously added a lock or something) to the satellite all through that same REPL. While the satellite was a hundred million miles away from Earth, and while it kept performing it’s other duties. You can’t do that on a system which merely dumps core any time something unexpected happens.replymaxwelljoslyn 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Said \"software on satellite\" story is from Ron Garret, for anyone interested.https://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html> During that time we were able to debug and fix a race condition that had not shown up during ground testing. (Debugging a program running on a $100M piece of hardware that is 100 million miles away is an interesting experience. Having a read-eval-print loop running on the spacecraft proved invaluable in finding and fixing the problem.replyem-bee 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] examples please, because so far i have only seen this from common lisp and smalltalk. there is also pike where i can reload classes or objects at runtime, thus avoiding a full restart, but it's not as closely integrated as in smalltalk and you actually have to build your app in a way that allows you to do that.replypjc50 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not always usable, but Visual Studio offers this for C# (works most of the time) or C++ (works in fewer cases because of the terrible header model)replydleslie 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] JavaScript immediately comes to mind.replyem-bee 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] how do you do it? in the browsers debugger? maybe, but that is not integrated with your actual source files, so you have to be careful to track your changes and copy them to your source. that may help in some cases but isn't really practical.replylenkite 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Java supports live debugging and profiling.replydb48x 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But that’s not the same thing at all.

The same as any other language. Source files and live development are not mutually exclusive. SLIME can send code snippets from your file over to the REPL for live development. You have your cake and eat it too.The REPL (or scratch buffer) is typically used for testing/observing. Not the actual source code development. Although it is possible to never write your source code to a file if you're just playing around with a toy experiment.replykgwgk 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > The classic lisp way is to build a runtime image by editing the image while running it, then dumping a binary.

It's better now (common-lisp.net was reshaped, there's lisp-lang.org, a better Cookbook, the CL Community Spec, more YT tutorials…)there is no full-featured web framework (although you can write web apps of course),no satisfactory GUI lib (now Gtk4, Qt5 (hard to install), IUP, nice-looking Tk themes, more low-level bindings to graphics libraries etc)the package manager came late,good open-source compilers came late,less choice in editors (now many https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/editor-support.ht...),and, well, lots of FUD and a language not for everyone.replynine_k 19 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Lisp is more of a meta-language than a mere language. Since it's homoiconic, you eventually end up developing a domain-specific language that works great for your subject area. It also may make it a bit harder to onboard new team members, because the level of abstraction which you can reach can be relly high, all while keeping performance reasonable.Technically, you could run e.g. a Python program under pdb, break on certain exceptions, and fix things inside a living system. It's just not a customary way to do that.replyjokethrowaway 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's hard to maintain and read. There you go.I'm not a huge fan of lisp, but I do like the language. Unfortunately, it's way too hard on 90% of the developers. They need some more structure so they can think about one thing at a time, which is why C-like syntax won in the end.All the best developers I know are into Lisp or Haskell (or both). They can crank out ridiculous code which then goes unused because maintenance would be too much of a burden. Sometimes I write some really complex one-liners (which are like 5-10 lines long) to do some tasks using all the possible hacks to avoid having to type an extra character. I might be able to do that, but most developers wouldn't be able to see how the data get transformed and keep all of that in their mind. Whatever I wrote is unmaintainable by most people.The reality is that the majority of people can't grasp their mind around complex concepts. Which is ok, most developers write a few API endpoints and some UI components, they don't need much to create value.We can get some good concepts from the functional world and transfer them to C-like syntax languages though. We can even have some of the programmability of Lisp (but not all of it) via macros.replyBlackthorn 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It's questionable whether it's really much better than just a debugger with a core dump (what I usually work on, it's not any better). It is, however, a pretty snazzy feature.replyem-bee 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] with a debugger, after you fix the application, you still have to restart and run it again. the big benefit here is that no restart is required.smalltalk can do the same btw. i had been working on a small website where a specific request from the browser would fail. instead of sending a failure message the request would just hang. in the mean time on the server in my pharo smalltalk window an error would pop up. when i fixed the error, the download of the request resumed in the browser as if nothing had happened other than a delay.replyBlackthorn 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > with a debugger, after you fix the application, you still have to restart and run it again. the big benefit here is that no restart is required.We like to make sure everything running in prod is verifiably built from source in-repo. So that's the thing, while it's a really snazzy feature for sure, the value over the rest of the world is on the questionable side. At least for our use case, but I think it's true for most use cases.edit: Also really curious about your smalltalk and pharo experience. Sounds fascinating!replyem-bee 22 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] once you fixed the problem you of course commit the change to the code on disk. there is nothing in the workflow that prevents you from doing that. you are not going to just fix apps in production without running your tests and what not. at worst you fix an error in a production system, and run the tests afterwards to make sure everything is clean. but mostly this feature is used during development when your code is still incomplete. not having to restart every time there is an error simply speeds up your development loop.replybehnamoh 22 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I am really curious about your experience with Smalltalk and Pharo!replyem-bee 21 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] i am really just a beginner with smalltalk and CL. as a vim user i didn't really have a good integration of the CL repl with the editor (there were tools, but they weren't as straightforward to set up as slime would have been). and when i encountered the breakloop i didn't really know what do to and just tried to get out of it as quickly as i could. (exiting vim is easier ;-) the thing that bothered me was that when i change code in the repl without an integrated editor, then how do i keep track of the changes and make sure i don't loose them? but then, i just never tried to set up a proper environment.in smalltalk on the other hand you get a nice IDE with all the comforts of a GUI. you have your windows where you browse your code neatly structured in classes and methods. there is a window where you run your app and manage your tests which light up red or green if they fail or pass, another which logs error or other print messages, and if an error happens while an app is running a new window pops up, showing you a trace of what was running and a text field with the code that failed, like in a debugger, and right there you can edit the code and resume.the code is written to your class, and when you go back to your code browser the change is reflected there, and you can commit it to a version control system. pharo btw has pretty good integration with git, and already a few years ago it almost acted like a git gui. it's probably even better now. the primary downside is that the text editor in pharo is simple, like a browser text area, and not a sophisticated editor like emacs or vim.replymaxwelljoslyn 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > [Lisp] the thing that bothered me was that when i change code in the repl without an integrated editor, then how do i keep track of the changes and make sure i don't loose them> [Smalltalk] the code is written to your class, and when you go back to your code browser the change is reflected thereI feel your pain. \"writing the changes back to the source code definition\" seemed like a no-brainer desirable feature of a Lisp REPL, yet I could not find a way to do that out of the box using Slime.

The ever popular syntax issue continues to haunt it.CL has had no real “unknown unknowns” for a very long time. While folks who newly discover it feel they found the gold idol in the jungle cave, the cave is, in truth, well explored, mapped, and documented but the idol is left behind.All excuses to not use CL have long been, or have had the opportunity to be, addressed. Today, it’s fast enough, small enough, empowered through utilities and libraries enough, has different build and deployment scenarios to work with a vast array of applications. And yet here we are...still.ABCL runs on the JVM, which runs everywhere on everything. Clojure, first class system on top of the JVM, but no real adoption. Some, to be sure, likely (I have no data) more than CL itself. But it’s still an blip on the radar.Meanwhile, a bunch of hackers threw together a language sharing many aspects of the core feature set made popular in Lisp and Scheme runtime environments, made it look like an Algol step child with curly braces and everything, and since then an entire ecosystem of software has been written (and rewritten) into this system and it’s runtime is the focus of some of the largest companies in the history of civilization.Raise your hand if you think that if the creators of JavaScript went with an S-expression syntax instead of a C/Java derivative, we’d be running a VBA clone in our browsers (but nowhere else)?Because at this juncture, THE thing that distinguishes CL and other Lisps from where we are today, is the syntax. Every other charm these systems enjoyed have been cherry picked away.Advocates say the syntax is not an issue. It’s a feature m, not a bug. But the “wisdom of the crowds” has spoken, and they stay away.replyTacticalCoder 21 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] That sounds intriguing as a Clojure dev but what happens in the following case (not very lispy code but it's just to show what I don't get):(do-it (do-it first))What if (do-it first) works fine, but it's the call to (do-it (do-it first)) that fails?I get control right where it's broken, so I can fix the do-it defun.

Electric word, “chatbot”. It means automation of human interactions and that’s a mighty cost effective thing. But I am here to tell you, no one wants to talk to your chatbot.So before you call up your programmers, and ask them about ChatGPT. Before you launch yet another automated calling system or virtual assistant, put down the Large Language Model. Don’t go crazy. It’s all be done before…Party Like It’s 1999In the late 90’s, it was a race to build commercial websites. We imagined that users would create direct relationships with our URLs. We imagined there would be brand loyalty. We scrambled to buy meaningful domain names. (My company sold start.com to Microsoft. We were very excited!).In our glorious future, websites would be the next generation of applications. Just like millions of users clicked on an Excel or Word icon on their desktops, millions would launch our websites from their bookmark bars. We were the apps and the browser was the new OS.But of course, that isn’t how it worked out. It was the search engines that became to the entry point for users. We watched most users launch their browsers to Google and then search for us.We tried everything to get them to come to us directly. We added buttons to our sites that would automatically bookmark us. We worked with browser and computer manufacturers to pre-install our links. There is a still a host of shady browser toolbars and plugins that try to get their sites directly in front of users.But the users have spoken. In response, we have created SEO, a whole new field of marketing to search engine algorithms in hopes that down the line they will market us to humans.We are the apps. The browser is the new OS. But the search engine turned out to be the main interface. It is the shell that wraps all the apps.Rise of the AppsIn 2007, 14 years after the launch of the web, 9 years after Google introduced their search; the iPhone launched. There had been other mobile platforms that came earlier, but none that reached the scale of the iTunes App Store (Now just the App Store).All of a sudden, our dreams were coming true. We had our icons on the screen. Users launched us directly. Once installed, we didn’t have to continually re-invest in SEO for users to find our app versus others. Our websites became apps and we had full relationships with our users. Or, so we thought.Apps were the new applications and iOS/Android was the new OS.Apps are not Applications.Apps are limited. They fit on smaller screens and can be used with only a few finger swipes and clicks. They don’t have mice, right-clicks, and sub-menus. Users don’t save and open files. Apps, and users, rely on their host OS for most advanced functions.The OS handles payments, security, sharing, etc. As more features get handled by the OS, the more they become first point of contact with the user. The more the user has a relationship with their device and less with their apps.Rise of the AssistantsIn 2010, Apple launched Siri on MacOS (OS X back then) and added it to their iPhones in 2011. MicroSoft and Amazon followed suite in 2014 and Google’s assistant joined in 2016. Microsoft shutdown their assistant, Cortana, in 2020, but their voice assistant has merged with their search as part of Bing. (MicroSoft has been trying to crack the virtual assistant market since 1997 with Clippy!)Up until now these voice powered personal assistants have been mostly curiosities, used for simple tasks like checking the weather, turning on or off lights, or playing music.But if you look at the OS APIs, each company has been creating deeper integrations with their virtual personal assistants and their hosted Apps. iPhone and Android allow apps to chat through their assistance, expose functionality, and offer input. Siri can pull weather from one app, your calendar from another, and check traffic and directions from a third to offer you a complex and well informed dialogue.Amazon’s Alexa is more direct. In addition to accessing your apps, developers can create Amazon Alexa Skills, programs which expand your Alexa virtual assistant with new capabilities. Skills can only be accessed via Alexa. Users talk to Alexa and skills respond back through her and in her voice.Language Has Been the LogjamUp until now, all of these virtual assistants have been held back by their lack of language skills. Anything beyond simple tasks become either comical and/or frustrating. You can get stonewalled by a benign “I don’t understand” to sidetracked by your assistant totally misunderstanding your request and launching the wrong thing.Suddenly with Large Language Models (LLM) and each of these companies running their own LLM as a Service, these virtual assistants will see massive upgrades. Now they will understand not just you, but also the output of of your apps and skills.The Relationship Is With The AssistantApple and Amazon sell hardware. They are less interested in trying to monetize free users. Google and MicroSoft do both, but still want to own your device and assistant. They sell the operating system (and bundled assistant) that powers much of our hardware.Their devices are in our pockets and our houses. We trust these companies with our personal clouds: our payments, our histories, our contacts, our logins, etc. They are the first devices we interact with when we wakeup and the last screens we stare at before going to sleep. We know their names and voices.We have been trained to call on them personally and we don’t switch easily. We have all seen a frustrated friend trying to talk to our Alexa by asking it “Hey Siri,” and trying to figure out why she won’t respond.With LLM, these personal virtual assistants are the new starting point. They will be to apps what Google and Bing are to the web.Few people will be willing to interact with an army of different chatbots and online assistants. They will expect these other chat enabled systems to speak to and through their personal virtual assistant. They will log into their smart phone and expect all the other apps and skills to integrate with their personal clouds, arbitrated by their trusted personal virtual assistant.When they do come directly to your site or app, they are not looking for a chatbot. They are looking for a UI that works. They know why they came to you. They expect your UI to do what it should do.If you have a chatbot, it is for Sir or Alexa to use, not people. I am here to tell you, no human wants to talk to your chatbot.Support independent authors and access the best of Medium. Authors earn when you read member-only stories.

The dream it seems to tap into is \"You don't need to deal with the arbitrary whims of 5 different groups of web designers, just talk to one thing and get a single response.\" When faced with the state of the modern web chatbots actually are preferable, sorry.A great problematic side effect of the web being so ad-driven is it leads to confusing the user interface, which can host ads, with the information. We need publishers to be able to make money from content without ads, and to be able to make money from providing it in raw form via APIs to third parties. It's that or the chatbot intermediaries are going to take over.replydvngnt_ 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I can't wait for the major llm to place ads in the responses to extract more moneyCertainly!

The ad buy was for “people going to restaurants” but it might have been “people going to {type} restaurants.”Thought it’s probably not that simple. A naive ad buy might not care to target, or targeting is too expensive and you’re ok wasting some impressions because it might be all-in cheaper, or {brand} has the media budget to pay to be in front of your eyeballs all the time.replynomat 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes it is a bit backwards. The McDonalds stop afterwards makes more sense.replyvuln 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] That’s the rub right?If they are taking an Uber to of the fancy restaurant and passing a McDonald’s chances are highly likely they will take a very similar route on the way home. They will still want to stop at McDonald’s for a $4 Large fry or an ice cream cone but no coupon this time. The line is now longer which increases the ride time and the drivers perceived profit.replycratermoon 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I suspect a more sophisticated chatbot will upsell the restaurant's offerings. \"Would you like a bottle of champagne chilled and waiting for you?

The chatbot will be constantly upselling. \"Would you like fries with that?\" or \"Extra cheese on your pizza is only 50 cents, add it?\", only more sophisticated.

The \"yes, please add more things to my cart\" answer will be the default and easy answer, declining the offer will take more effort.replyPaulHoule 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] … I think of how annoying the kiosks at McDonalds have gotten.replyLapsangGuzzler 29 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Or even worse, giving answers that sound objective but are actually paid for.replyhinkley 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Ad blindness has fucked me so many times on web UIs.There have been a couple of particularly vivid incidents where the company put some sort of interaction on a page and positioned it and shaped it like an ad.

They hide any useful navigation options and present you with a list that must be navigated in order, therefore ensuring ads placed in between the list items will be the only thing on the screen for at least 1 attention cycle.Terrifying to think of a future where your device doesn't have any real capability because all the websites and apps are just AI driven chatbots/suggestion engines.this post encapsulates the general feeling. https://032c.com/magazine/berlin-review-lan-partyIs this the feeling that every generation gets about the future as they age? oh noreplyreaperducer 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Name and shame, so the rest of us know which bank to avoid.replyimbnwa 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] >The dream it seems to tap into is \"You don't need to deal with the arbitrary whims of 5 different groups of web designers, just talk to one thing and get a single response.\"Except that's the business' perspective, because it means paying less people, rather than consumers, who generally wanna talk to and haggle with humans, which requires a business to pay more people.replyExoticPearTree 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] The main pet peeve about chatbots is that now they're on almost every page, popping up with \"I am here to help, what would you like to buy today\" and the more atrocious ones that are implemented instead of a call center to reduce the number of human operators to the minimum possible.Yeah, I really don't want to talk to a chatbot.replyjeroenhd 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] > the more atrocious ones that are implemented instead of a call center to reduce the number of human operators to the minimum possibleThis is what's driving me crazy. The stupid \"I want to sell you our crap\" chatbots are easy to block (uBlock rules exist for most of them, as they are often existing products integrated into websites) but the chatbots people are forced to engage with are the ones that exist to replace callcenter workers.First companies reduced the influence and power of callcenter workers to make them useless for customers. Now they're saving a buck dumping human operators and letting the powerless chatbots tell the users \"sorry but I can't change your situation, have a nice day\".With advances in voice synthesis, I expect chatbots to replace phone operators any day now, probably with a prompt like \"you are a company X helpdesk operator. Try to upsell to any customer as much as you can, and try to make them feel pleased even if you can't help them solve their problems\".replyreaperducer 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Now they're saving a buck dumping human operators and letting the powerless chatbots tell the users \"sorry but I can't change your situation, have a nice day\"I saw a television ad a few days ago where the entire point of the ad was for the company to show off that it has real, live customer service people answering the phones in Arizona.\"I'm Brittany, and I'm a real human being, here to help you!\"It was the one tiny glimmer of hope that the market may sort this out. But it won't.replyaoweijrti 50 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The Verizon website has the worst chatbot I've ever interacted with. It's the worst because it's mandatory and useless. It's just about the only way to start a tech support interaction, and it is completely incapable of actually solving any problems beyond telling you to power cycle. (Granted, probably half of all of Verizon's tech support problems can be solved by power cycling) But then it's also self-unaware and misleading. It will straight up tell you \"yes, I can do that\", and then twelve statements and twenty five minutes later tell you \"sorry, I can't do that, you need to call this phone support number\". What a shit pile. I hate chatbots and I also hate Verizon.replyxg15 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Before LLMs I actually tried those chats a few times. If the bot had actually tried to solve my issue (or at least collect some basic data, then open a support ticket) I wouldn't have minded it.However what actually happened was that it started the chat with some (pre-scripted) smalltalk, giving the impression I could just write my inquiry in freeform - then completely ignored my text and just asked me a series of scripted questions and directed me to a help page (which I already knew) in the end.I think LLMs could really be an improvement here, because there is at least the possibility they could give you some answers that are actually tailored to your problem.Of course it might just as well be that we'll now get a very charming and deeply empathetic response that exactly sums up the gist of your problem and then ... redirects you to the generic help page.replyorwin 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] When I worked in an internal team at a bank, we chose to make a bot to replace the FAQ when the number of daily tickets where the response that could be summed up as 'rtfm' hit 30.It might have been frustrating for the users, but at least we avoided basic questions and our tickets at least we're filled correctly.I hacked a bypass for the secops who worked a lot with us and at least knew how to fill tickets.replynottorp 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, the problem is your management then removed any option to talk to a human and left the chatbot do all support.replydeepspace 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, and since everybody did that, everyone managed to sour their entire user base on the idea of chatbots.replyaoweijrti 47 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I've done tech support and I can sympathize, but good god I still hate you for not telling me how to use the bypass.replyjoezydeco 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] They don't just pop up - they pop up the moment the page loads, getting in your way.A little bit tuning, say, to keep the popup from happening until the browser has been idle for N seconds, would go a long long way to reducing this frustration.replym463 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I hate amazon chat.

Used to work on dashboard software that monitors them (almost 20 years ago), and it's a metric of organizational success when you get a caller off the line without letting them talk to a human. All the hoop jumping and maze-like options etc are explicitly for this purpose.Even back then there was talk about when chatbots would be good enough to remove as many humans as possible from the process. And considering how low paid some contact center workers are, it's pretty sad.replytolciho 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] > All the hoop jumping and maze-like options etc are explicitly for this purpose.So, market pressures have implemented \"The Castle\" by Kafka.

Most comments here seem to take the title at face value.Based on how low companies are willing to go to in the support space, it won't be at all surprising when all of them move to some form of ChatGPT-enabled crapbot, specially adjusted to maximise whatever metric the company wants at huge financial and psychological cost to the user. It's gotten so bad it's hard not to think of employees of such scummy companies as scum for supporting and enabling this toxic ad-driven hell.replyCharlieDigital 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] My take away is a bit different: if a user lands on your site/app, they don't want to talk to a chatbot.If they did, they would have asked ChatGPT or another chat assistant instead.\"When they do come directly to your site or app, they are not looking for a chatbot. They are looking for a UI that works. They know why they came to you. They expect your UI to do what it should do.\"replydqv 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >My take away is a bit different: if a user lands on your site/app, they don't want to talk to a chatbot.But part of that is Siri, Google Assistant, et al. often just say \"here's a website\" when you ask a question like \"Hey Siri, does Walgreens on Blob Street have the FreeStyle Libre 3 in stock?\"But in what TFA describes, Siri would do something like>I need to ask walgreens.com, is it OK to send your question to them?Yeah ok>Walgreens.com says yes the Blob Street Walgreens has the FreeStyle Libre 3 in stockreplykromem 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Also, very importantly, it's not saying not to build a chatbot, but to recognize that the main consumer of your chatbot interface will be a user's primary LLM, not the user themselves.The headline is exactly the kind of thing the largely anti-AI attitudes online today will blindly vote up, but the message of the article couldn't be further from the appearance of the headline.It's about the nuanced infrastructure of a future where chatbots exist in multiple layers, not about a future without chatbots.replymtlmtlmtlmtl 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] The chatbot as it's used in most cases is not a UI paradigm, it's the complete lack of a UI.

This article is pure grade A poppycock.Are there any metrics to back this up? This bullshit has been spewed since 2014: chat/voice as a service-to-service protocol and has yet to actually materialize.I agree that people don't like to talk to chatbots in general (cue the intentionally ambiguous click-baity title) but they won't have any problems talking to Alexa vs ChatGPT or other custom system if they're forced to. They will dislike or like all of them equally. Source? Trust me, bro. Just like the author of the article.Let's not forget that the Alexa org has been losing billions per quarter and revenue never materialized from people ordering shit from Amazon. So... people also don't want to talk to that Chatbot and that chatbot may actually join its extinct brethren.replyplaguuuuuu 14 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Hard disagree. Most people already type questions into google when they want to know stuff. That's part of why Google's algo is so borked now for technical users, needing to use NLP to field complex search queries and not using straight PageRank.It's way easier, IMO, to type the question into ChatGPT and it just gives me a paragraph or two about how to make a certain cocktail or cocktails with some arbitrary ingredients, about what Octopuses eat, or popular restaurants in my area, or even how to approach some microservices architectural problem. No need to go through five links where the author gives you their entire fucking life story to embiggen content for SEO, just to get a recipeEven in it's current primitive state it's replaced search engines for me to a certain extent. Try asking itIf it reliably scrapes the net for relevant info and analyses it for me, that's it - end of search as we know it. I'll hardly ever use search again.replyjdelman 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] This is a very shallow glance at how \"chatbots\" have been used in the customer service space, especially in the past 10 years. If you look at what the term has been referring to in the last decade or so, it's not really the AI assistants like Alexa or Siri. The best ones are primarily a customer service tool that helps people triage problems on their own and reduce the need for a human in the loop. They're not do-it-all human assistant replacements. I agree, generally, with the premise that a better UI > an OK chatbot. And ultimately, there are a whole host of problems that chatbots with complex decision trees or even LLMs can't solve, so a chatbot alone isn't really the solution. The combination of chatbot + escalation path to human agent does work pretty well, though.replyChrisArchitect 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Spare me the paragraphs of 'how did we get here' history and get to the point that's already in your title.Based on what many site operators see anecdotally, people actually do want to talk to the chatbot because they just want answers to their questions and hand holding. How it's implemented/effectiveness is variable -- they will talk to it for a bit if they perceive they are being helped in some way. Chatbots and general site chat interfaces didn't spread everywhere without at least some datareplyu_boredom 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] The paragraphs upon paragraphs of history made me click out of that article. There’s no relevance to the point being made.In regards to ChatBot usage, in my limited interaction with support bots, they are usually quite useless. Each time I use one, it’s a game of ‘get to the actual support agent’.replymarcod 5 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Why else would one chat with a bot?All other functions are self-service anyway, at least I've never interacted with a chatbot that could do anything useful, besides being forced upon me to navigate the \"why do you want to talk to a person, so I connect you with the right one?\"replybreckenedge 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think the point was that novel chatbots will still be created, but they need to be talking to your existing assistant (Siri/Alexa) rather than you going directly to them?reply__loam 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] His point seems to be that assistants like Siri and Alexa will be the entrypoint for LLM type interactions, which is sort of non-sensical considering most people are using chatGPT right now. I think this could have been an interesting article about how interacting with chat bots still kind of sucks but instead we got some unsubstantiated view that assistants that a lot of people have already written off are going to take over the space.replywhitepaint 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Many have written them off because they kinda suck a lot now. But they will be much much better, won't they? 5 years lets say? What kind of LLMs will we have then?

That can be ChatGPT. But no one goes to allstate.com to talk to their chatbot.replyadverbly 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] If I get stuck talking to a chatbot I know I've already lost half the battle. A lot of the times when I call in for support, I need decisions and actions to be made.For safety reasons, I do not expect many companies to allow for fully automated chat bot interactions. So I'm stuck trying to get through to an actual person who can actually do something.replyasdff 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] At least with some websites, you can eventually get through. I managed to get through the one at adobe by complaining incessantly about it and asking for a human for probably 20 minutes, and was routed to an actual human who solved my problem of not finding the download link for an old version of some of their software by giving me a direct download link to this version in about 30 seconds. If the process had merely started with the customer service representative rather than the bot, I'd be raving about the experience of solving my problem in moments.I'm starting to think I should write my own bot who can do the 20 minutes of back and forth with the customer service bot. Then ping me when its time to actually pay attention.replyeskibars 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] I think there are multiple facets to this argument (both for and against). Yeah, a lot of chatbots are so \"stupid\" or at least so obviously non-human that as a user, I have absolutely no desire to interact with them. They waste my time and I end up doing the same thing as I sometimes need to do with automated phone systems: press the virtual equivalent of \"0\" to try to get connected with a real human.But that is starting to change: some chatbots can now start understanding and interacting like humans. As a user, when that's the case, I don't personally care what is powering the thing behind the scenes. In fact, I'd generally prefer a bot if it's as good as a good human: the number of times I've had 45 minute or longer sessions with some human support agent that: 1) Just didn't listen to what I was looking for 2) Had difficulty communicating because I started a chat on an evening/weekend and got routed to someone who had English as a second language 3) Couldn't actually figure out how to solve some problem, so I had to start a new conversation of the same substance the next day 4) Didn't actually log the notes of my chat for the next agent, so I had to repeat myself etcis just completely off the charts and it's anecdotally gotten worse in my experience in the past few years.replyeskibars 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] Also, many times I've had to wait 5 minutes for an agent to respond at all (presumably because they're way oversubscribed) and then had the \"chat with an agent\" thing time out and disconnect me entirely after 10 minutes is so frustrating.. Yeah, I went and grabbed a water/coffee/went for a bio break because your agent hasn't responded to my last message for 7 minutes. But then you disconnect me after 5 minutes of \"inactivity\" and ask me to hop on a new chat with the next agent that will not have any history from the previous chat? I could do with a lot less of that in my life.replyrazemio 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Same experience here. It always depends. 2 month ago I was surprised, that a chatbot was able to solve my somewhat complex problem in no time, with a text by text guide. It was also able to awnser follow up questions.replyHavoc 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] >They will expect these other chat enabled systems to speak to and through their personal virtual assistant.I'd say consumers are going to lose that battle.A bit like nobody wants to be subscribed to half a dozen video streaming services yet here we are.replynerdponx 56 minutes ago | parent | next [–] The uncomfortable truth is that tacit collusion is widespread among large businesses, even in the absence of overt ownership consolidation. There's no free market solution for that, no matter how much you idolize tech entrepreneurs. And it's literally textbook economics / game theory, it should be a surprise to no one.replypotatoman22 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I found maybe the first chatbot I found helpful today. LlamaIndex has a chat bot built into its documentation. Helped me answer some quick questions and gave me a mostly working code snippet for my use case.replycriddell 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] A documentation bot is a great idea. I’d like a man-bot in Linux.I’d like to be able to type “hey tux, restart networking”. Don’t make me dig through /etc and figure out what kind of system this is. Tell me what it’s going to do and if I say “yes”, do it.replys3p 30 minutes ago | prev | next [–] >I am here to tell you, no human wants to talk to your chatbot.Well, I am a human and I most certainly do. I've had great success with Amazon's customer service chatbot, Meta's CS bot, and many others. Sometimes they do help me with what I need and it speeds up my workflow. Sure, chatbots don't always accomplish what I want, but their existence is a net positive for me. I have never once looked at a chatbot and said \"If only I could use Siri instead\". Never.replyversion_five 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Chatbot is fine as a search alternative, and there's stuff I find more convenient asking chatgpt than looking up and synthesizing myself to figure out the answer.Chat is the worst possible interface to a fixed menu system, which is the only way it gets used in public facing customer service.If a company had an optional \"faq chatbot\" you could talk to, nobody would complain. It's using it to block human interaction while pretending to be able to help that infuriates people.replyskmurphy 27 minutes ago | prev | next [–] People are comfortable typing keywords into a search box to find what they need on a website. It seems to me a well structured chatbot can offer at least that much capability and perhaps a little more--especially if it's answers are constrained to a single website or document set and other steps are taken to prevent \"hallucinations.\"replyvoyagerfan5761 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] What's funny is I have yet to encounter anyone IRL who talks to Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant often enough to notice.Maybe building chatbots as a layer beneath the existing virtual assistant platforms would be a viable user experience, and I'm sure there are people who would use them—but how many? I'd be interested in statistics on how many smartphone users actually use the voice assistant for more than a couple simple questions once or twice a month.replytaeric 39 minutes ago | prev | next [–] I wouldn't mind it, at times. I do wish it was less formulaic with it always asking if it got it right. :(Really sucks, as that is a rhetorical style I also like to use. Asking \"does that answer the question\" is a very natural thing to want to know. And it can help keep me from spinning wheels even harder.Constantly asking, \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\" is obnoxious.replydale_glass 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] No one wants to talk to customer service either. Even with humans, I'd much rather not try to explain my problems to a person who may not be a native speaker, who may not understand well the problem domain, and who may not have much power to do anything.But even talking to an actual pro is most of the time something I'd rather avoid -- it's after all best if whatever I need is doable without needing extra help.I think a chat bot is going to be very rarely seen as an actual perk by an end user, except in some specific domains like game NPCs. It's more likely to be used as a first line of support or similar to save costs, as something better than a phone menu system.I can see them also being a perk for users of very large systems like AWS, where reading the docs can get overwhelming, and search may not work well because you may need to know the specific terms you have to search for.replytotallywrong 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] The fastest way to lose my business is forcing me contact you by WhatsApp (already bad enough), and then hitting me with a bot asking for a bunch of info, numbered options, etc. Block and delete follows.replyi_like_apis 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] It really depends.

And that you should just have your web app, doing its thing, and not bolt on an isolated version of a chatbot that is only used for interacting with your specific site. The assumption is that people will want to talk to chatbots, just not your chatbot: they want a one-stop shop with every chatbot in the same app.I see the point, not sure I agree totally.I'm not someone who ever wants to talk to a chatbot, but sometimes I am forced to. I suppose that it is better in such cases to have a single place I go for that. On the other hand, if my confusion begins on your website, I would hope that your website would help me resolve it: if I have to go from yourwebapp.com, to a third party application, then type \"how do I do X on yourwebapp.com?\" that seems convoluted. Perhaps a browser-level integration, or at least replacing the proprietary chatbot with a doorway to that single, unified chatbot.Hmm, I dunno. Sounds like whoever runs such a chatbot would have their hands around the throat of the web, doesn't it?replyAnimats 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] > \"If you have a chatbot, it is for Sir or Alexa to use, not people.\"This raises a group of interesting questions:- Should computers talk to each other in natural languages? In voice? Is that going to work, or just create inter-machine misunderstandings?- Whose agent is it anyway? It would be useful to have a personal agent that works for you, not for someone who's trying to sell you something. We may see that as an expensive paid product, but the free ones work for the man, not for you.- It's worth getting a basic understanding of the law of principal and agent. Who works for whom? What is the authority of an agent? Who takes on risk, the principal or the agent? Who pays when an agent exceeds their authority? The legal system had to get this figured out centuries ago, and the failure cases are well-explored.reply__loam 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] > just create inter-machine misunderstandingsThis obviously.replydingnuts 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Did anybody actually RTFA?The article is not arguing that chatbots are unpopular with users, as the commentators here seem to be assuming.TLDR, didn't RTFA: The author is arguing that most LLMs that are fine-tuned should operate at a layer of abstraction beneath Siri etc, so that end-users can talk to the \"AI Assistant\" that they are used to, and in turn Siri or Google Assistant or whatever interface they're used to can query the LLM.replydelphi4711 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] When I write lengthy emails, I noticed some people only read the first paragraph.

Specifically there is structured data that I want to search (e.g. what move type does 4x damage to pokemon of type1, type2?) using the voice assistant. ChatGPT seems to get it right, so I wonder if/when Siri and Alexa will.I guess someone will sooner or later develop the \"ai.xml\" standard for websites to give their chatbot endpoints to the AI assistants. Or maybe it can just be another opensearch kind of thing.replyitake 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I wish the author would share data instead of their opinion.

I really dislike all these custom chatbots. But it is also fairly easy to measure how good they work. And for the sites I work with at least the chatbots perform better than other options and they do offload work from the support teams.replyrussellbeattie 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] I felt like this before I used - of all things - Bank of America's \"Erica\" chatbot to find an option in their app that was eluding me. I asked how to change the option, and it responded with a link to the exact screen I was looking for. The reason I couldn't find it was because it was called something different than I thought. I never would have found it otherwise.That's when I realized a core use case for these sorts of bots: Navigating complex interfaces. As much as UX designers want to make UIs \"intuitive\", there comes a tipping point of complexity where a UI can only do so much to guide you. Bots are like that kid next door who's \"good at computers\", or a tech support agent on the phone, who can help you do something you just couldn't work out on your own because of terminology or misunderstanding.As much as people are wary of Microsoft's Copilot integration into Windows due to the legacy of Clippy and Cortana, I think it's going to be a huge success and an archetype of future HCI.replyrenewiltord 3 hours ago | prev | next [–] Far prefer chatbot to IVR menu.replyMisterBastahrd 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] My default setting when confronted with a chatbot is to be as belligerent and unhelpful as possible so that it directs me to an actual human being.replygolergka 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] They don't want to talk to chatbots, but they want to talk to a human.

Almost immediately they were using Pi all day everyday as a kind of \"rubber ducky\" to process decisions and just generally brainstorm with - the same way you would with a therapist, close friend or colleague.For example, this person literally has an ongoing chat with Pi to \"help find enjoyment in daily life\" via the voice interface. Not only that but basic help with research etc... instead of googling. That's amazing and staggering. I mean it's literally like the movie Her (without the romantic subtext).[1] https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pi-your-personal-ai/id64458159...replymocko 37 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Holy crap, thanks for sharing this. It's the first time a conversational AI has impressed me. I can just about find the edges (short memory, relentlessly positive) but in the space of an hour it's given reasonably good advice on social situations, answered questions about how it works and even recommended some great niche bands based on my existing tastes. Just as you said, its knowledge seems to be extremely broad.There's a contrast between Pi and the kind of chatbot discussed in the article. When we talk to Pi we don't expect it to do anything for us - it just gives advice and makes suggestions that we can take or leave. The resulting stream of tokens matches our expectations enough to satisfy us.A chatbot on a company's website however, probably we are talking to that because we want something to happen. \"Please fix my account\", \"my last bill was wrong\" etc. As the chatbot isn't integrated with the company's processes it can't actually change the state of the outside world and so talking to it will be a frustrating experience. I wonder if this will improve if/when chatbots get better integrated with systems? Will companies even dare to do this for real?replysharemywin 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This seems like a shill comment.replyAndrewKemendo 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Not sure what to tell you other than it's legitreplytrutic 3 hours ago | prev [–] Hi!

The story of Checkout X.Mar 10, 2023TABLE OF CONTENTSBackstory How Checkout X was born First business plan: Checkout X for payment providers Second try: One page checkout with post-purchase upsells Launching the app The first 100 customers Scaling to 6000 customers Scaling the team First hire Hiring developers Hiring a CDO, CTO, more devs, support, partnerships How Shopify killed our business Checkout was a grey area in the beginning Spring of 2019 - Shopify changed their rules January 2020 - We get locked out of our app April 2020 - Shopify hijacks Upsell X January 2021 - They finally changed their ToS Aftermath Porting Checkout X to WooCommerce What could have we done differently? Fundraising Acquisition Suing Shopify Ignoring the Shopify ToS update Conclusion Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Historically, Shopify has always had a checkout problem. You were always able to customize your storefront UX until the checkout, but after you click checkout, you were locked into an old-school multi-step checkout with no flexibility whatsoever. Shopify finally introduced a one-page checkout 5 years after Checkout X first launched, Shopify is finally stepping up its checkout game and offers: One-page checkout with a minimal number of fields (soon-ish*) Address autofill Customizable sections Post-purchase capabilities Sure, their one-page checkout is only available for Shopify Plus merchants, and their post-purchase upsells only work with credit cards and PayPal (when they work; their API is buggy AF), but let's say they've almost managed to catch up. 5 years ago, I bootstrapped Checkout X, which did all of the following: One-page Shopify checkout with post-purchase upsells. It grew to 6,000 active merchants. It generated €600k in monthly recurring revenue. It processed millions of transactions every year. However, Shopify killed it - just because merchants were choosing our solution over theirs. As I move on to new adventures and Shopify seems to be taking their checkout seriously now, it's a good time to share the full story of Checkout X. Backstory It all started in 2017 when I quit my UI/UX Designer job in order to create & pursue “my own business”.By the time I had started and operated a couple of Shopify dropshipping stores, which did fairly well and gave me the confidence that I can actually create a company myself. The problem was, dropshipping is super competitive and many of my competitors were just better than me. So I thought to myself: When Everybody Is Digging for Gold, It’s Good To Be in the Pick and Shovel Business I had experience with designing and building different web apps so I know exactly what I wanted to do full time - make Shopify apps. ✨✍️ I drew the following plan: Create a small Shopify app and get some customers to get a feel for the market Create a bigger Shopify app that’s successful and generates enough money so I don’t have to be worried about working for a living Create a business that changes the game ( Future me is so proud to see points 1 and 2 completed ✅ 🙏 ) So I got thinking. What app should I build?What apps/add-ons bring the most value ( revenue ) to my dropshipping stores? Was Oberlo ( app for sourcing products / delivery of my orders ) Was some custom javascript I wrote that was offering small upsells before checkout. Jackpot! 🎰 So, that’s how Upsell X was born:   It took me a while to build it - it was the first software I coded myself, but in the Fall of 2017 - Upsell X was launched. And it worked!Over the next couple of months I got a couple of hundred of merchants and I was making $1k-$2k a month from it. Major win for me! 🤘 How Checkout X was born Around that time I decided to move back to my hometown of Sofia, BG 🇧🇬 ( was living in 🇫🇷 France before ) and long-story short: Met with a friend Decided to open an online pharmacy together ( dumb idea 🤦‍♂️ ) Decided the pharmacy will be running on Shopify Had to find a payment provider that works with Shopify Bulgarian entities Companies that sell “legit drugs” on the internet Needles to say - our business plan had a couple of flaws. But the payment aspect was absurd - there was absolutely no way to accept credit card payments.Back in the time Stripe didn’t operate in Bulgaria. The couple of other companies that were allowed on Shopify ran as far as they could when they heard we’re some Bulgarians looking to sell drugs. I was stuck…There were Bulgarian payment providers that would onboard us but they wouldn’t be allowed on Shopify There were Shopify-approved payment providers but they didn’t want to work with us. So I got thinking - can’t I just bypass their checkout and integrate whatever I want? 🤔 Yeah I could! That’s how the first version of Checkout X was born:  Needless to say, our pharmacy idea didn’t go far. But I had solved another problem - I could connect any Payment Provider to Shopify 🤯 First business plan: Checkout X for payment providers My first business plan was simple: Find Payment Providers that are not allowed on Shopify Integrate them with Checkout X Make them promote Checkout X as an integration solution to their customers   Actual slide from my presentation to BlueSnap I spent a couple of months talking to dozen of different payment providers. Most were “interested” but we never really went anywhere. The only company that we made an agreement with was Bluesnap, which brought some customers, but not as many as I was hoping for. Second try: One page checkout with post-purchase upsells One day, while I was working on Checkout X - I got a support ticket from one of the Upsell X customers - Super-prix.fr   Super Prix was one of the pioneers of french dropshipping at the time. While I was dropshipping, I was constantly “copying” what they were doing. They were 🤩 DS Rockstars in my mind. I don’t really remember what the support ticket was about, but one thing went to another and they asked me - “Can you integrate post-purchase upsells?” I paused for a moment… I thought about it… and I told them that I’m making a checkout product and that it should be possible to add post-purchase upsells. They replied:“We need a one-page checkout page with post-purchase upsells. How much will it cost us?” With a little bit back & forth I estimated they would be spending ~€5k/month per month if I managed to get all of their shops on Checkout X. I asked them to prepay €5k, so I’m sure they won’t change their mind later on.They agreed and sent me the €5k via PayPal.I WENT NUTS 🤯🤯🤯 €5k / month was huge for me: It meant I can work full-time on the project without worrying about paying the bills.It meant that Checkout X will be making 3X more than Upsell X from a single customer. I honestly thought - “I made it”. Launching the app One of the first iteration for one of the stores of the Super-prix.fr guys - they wanted a custom design for their store. I know it looked ugly - but it converted well. Those guys are pioneers in making sites convert. When we first talked, I promised the Super Prix guys that their custom one-page checkout with post-purchase upsells will be ready in 2 months and I sticked to it.2 months later I visited them in 🇧🇪 Belgium and prepared to do a test-launch on one of their stores. We launched it together… 🚀 It was a shit show… 💩 They disabled the checkout after 2 hours… 🤦‍♂️ The checkout was working great - I had tested it from end to end. What didn’t work was all of the services that relied on the checkout. Here’s a list of some of the things that didn’t work: Metrics Any pixel tracking ( Facebook Ads / Google Ads / etc ) Abandoned checkout emails SMS abandoned cart FB Messenger abandoned cart ( it was a thing back then ) Refunds   There was no way that they could use the checkout until all of their services worked - I had no idea how I missed all those things. Worse, I had no idea how to fix those problems. I promised to find a solution somehow and had a long trip home.   It took me the whole summer to solve most of the issues.Some things I managed to integrate, some things I had to rebuild myself, but in September of 2018 we finally launched on one of their stores. Then we added more.Finally, the app was live. 🚀The first 100 customers One of the first designs for the mainstream Checkout X product Once the SuperPrix guys onboarded all of their shops and things were stable ( relatively 🙄 ) I started working towards getting more customers. At the time, every customer had to be onboarded manually. I had to explain to them all the weird stuff that the app brought with it ( custom metrics ; integrations; etc ) and I had to add custom code to their shop.Slowly but surely I got to my first 100 customers using the following channels: Bluesnap partnership At the time Bluesnap got kicked out of Shopify ( not sure why ) so they referred us to prospects that were on Shopify.We had a lot of issues in our partnership, merchants were signing up for a payment provider and they were forced to use a custom checkout with all it’s quirks ( and benefits ).The thing was, Bluesnap was selling their benefits, not ours - so the merchants were confused on why they had to use an alternative checkout.It was tough but I got some of my first customer from them - I guess it was worth it. Negative virality For most products - being viral means that your existing users would recommend it to their friends. With Checkout X it was the opposite: Competitors of our customers were copying what our customers were doing.When they saw a custom one-page checkout on their stores - they went nuts.They needed to know how is this possible on Shopify? 🤔 How can they have it on their shop? We left breadcrumbs to Checkout X SuperPrix didn’t allow us to put our logo on their checkout ( which we did later on other stores ) - but they didn’t say anything about the code.So we spammed our page source and console with marketing messages. And it people found it!When you opened the page source or the console you would see that Checkout X is powering a certain checkout Merchants copying the stores of our customers was the main acquisition channel for Checkout X until the end. Scaling to 6000 customersOver the years we eventually reached 6000 customers. Which isn’t a ton, but with €100 average revenue per store, we reached a record of €600k monthly revenue 🤯 We never ran paid ads. We were never listed on the Shopify App Store.All of our customers came from two channels: Virality - Merchants copying each other and merchants recommending us Affiliates - We were paying commissions to whoever brought customers The key to a good affiliate program Our affiliate program was simple. You bring a customer and we pay you 15-25% of the revenue we make from that customer. Forever. Some Youtube videos advertising Checkout X That’s pretty standard. The reason why our affiliate program worked so well ( brought around 40% of our customers ) was because affiliates actually used our product and liked it. All of the affiliates we onboarded approached us first. Later on with Vanga AI, we tried replicating the same strategy and it was much harder, mainly because the influencers that we targeted never used Vanga AI before. ✌️ I’ve worked with hundreds of SaaS influencers over the years and I’ve found success with them on multiple apps. If you need help with employing influencer marketing for your SaaS feel free to reach out. If you want influencers to want to work with you - make sure they use your product and they find it useful. Otherwise it’s an uphill battle. Scaling the team I started Checkout X alone. I tried attracting a co-founder on a couple of occasions but things just didn’t work out. I had to do design, programming, marketing, sales, administration, etc by myself.It was a lot of work and there were a lot of challenges, but there was no one else to do it and I didn’t want to worry about paying someone’s salary without being sure I can afford it. I wanted to wait until the right moment. First hire Around a year after launching, I’d gotten to around 100 customers and onboarding/supporting merchants was starting to become a hassle.I decided it’s finally time to make my first hire - a CS rep 👩‍💻. I hired Karolina. She had the following responsibilities: Onboarding customers ( adding javascript to their code, debugging it, helping them set up their payment methods & design ) Supporting existing customersThe moment I hired her we both realised that: She has no JS knowledge so she can’t onboard merchants There is no admin panel to support the customers - everything was done through the Rails Console ( programmer tool ) We had to do a lot of work before we can do the work.For the first month all she did was learning basic coding skills while I dropped everything else and started implementing an admin panel. Our first ever team retreat in Batumi, Georgia 🇬🇪 Hiring developers As the project kept growing I found myself being overwhelmed with all the 🔥 fires I had to put out while trying to integrate more and more services with the checkout ( every customer has a slightly different stack for payments, marketing tools, etc ). The checkout is a crucial piece of technology - it’s where the actual purchase happen. In order to make everything work flawlessly, we had to build a mini shadow-Shopify that runs on the background. Checkout X handles products, customers, discounts, taxes, payments, analytics, themes, emails, integrations and so on. It’s a huge product.I desperately needed help and I finally had some good cashflow so I decided it’s time to hire some devs. As I wanted flexibility and wanted to hire fast I just went on Upwork and started looking for Rails Devs that had experience with Shopify. Almost instantly I managed to hire Niko & Vlad who were just finishing another Shopify project - it was an instant match. So I just fully booked their calendar. Hiring a CDO, CTO, more devs, support, partnerships Snapshot of some of the team members - our WooCommerce launch party in Sofia, BG 🇧🇬 We were always very conservative with hiring - we never wanted to be a big company. My thinking was - wherever there is a repeatable batch of work that can be allocated to someone - we’d look for such person. Someone needed to do constant iteration over our UX/UI - We hired Stoyan as our CDO Tech complexity increased and we needed someone to scale our technology & dev process - We hired Ventsi as our CTO We needed more dev power - We hired Alexey, Gokhan, Hristo, Valyo, G1, G2, Krum, Svetlin, We needed more support & onboarding agents - we hired Ksenia, Lucian, Daya We needed help with partnerships & marketing - we hired Jindra, Misho, Tina The highest headcount we had a at a particular time was 16 people - all remote 🇧🇬🇬🇪🇷🇺🇵🇱🇬🇧🇺🇦🇷🇴🇨🇿 All those guys & gals were awesome every day and working with them was super enjoyable. I always had the idea I’m goofing around with friends, never felt like boring work.Thank you for all the awesome moments - Checkout X team. You guys were awesome 🙌 How Shopify killed our business Now, let’s be clear on something - Checkout X was born out of wedlock.Control over the checkout is the centerstone of Shopify’s business.It allows them to: Push their payment solution - Shopify Payments Push their fulfillment solution - Shopify Fulfillments Push their “marketplace” app - Shop Pay Collect commissions from other payment providers Collect 0.5%-2% revenue commission on stores that don’t use Shopify Payments I was never so naive to believe that they’ll just let me go around forever, piggyback on their platform and reap most of the benefits. Even though what we were doing was not forbidden - it was clear that Shopify would disapprove of it. My main logic was always - as long as we’re not breaking Shopify’s Terms of Service, we’re not doing any harm to the merchants. Were there ways in which we could co-exist in a non-parasitic relation with Shopify achieving all of their checkout objectives and collecting all their revenue? - yes!We’ve made such proposals to them, but they decided it’s easier for them to get rid of us.Checkout was a grey area in the beginning When I started building Checkout X there were no rules against such solutions and there were already similar products built by other companies - most notably Bold Checkout, so I decided to give it a go.At the same time - as I mentioned, I expected they won’t be happy with the solution so I never bothered applying for the Shopify App store. One crucial mistake I made - I didn’t create a separate partner account so the Checkout X unlisted app was on the same partner account as Upsell X. Spring of 2019 - Shopify changed their rules In the spring of 2019 there was a ToS update that said building public checkout apps is forbidden unless you get a written permission from Shopify.We contacted Shopify ASAP and they connected us to a rep who replied in an email - “you’re allowed to do that for now”. Thank god we fucking did that! 🙏 A week later another Shopify rep sends us an email telling us we have 3 days to tell our customers we’re stopping the service because of breaking the ToS.We had to react lightning fast and show screenshots of our other email communication and thankfully this agent didn’t delete our app - close call.⚠️  Remember: A Shopify app is always a single-click away from being deleted from someone that works there. Even if you got a permission written permission from somebody else. After this communication - came silence. Nobody told us anything. 😴 So in the summer we decided to go to Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦 and meet the Shopify team in person.Me and Karolina @ Shopify Unite 2019 Shopify Unite was a great event.We managed to meet Jason in person and he was pretty cool - he told us not to worry, that they’re thinking of ways to make what we do possible within the checkout and that they’d be communicating with us what’s happening. They also announced they’re working on native Post-purchase upsell APIs while we were there.But in the end - we achieved nothing. There was no communication on what we’re supposed to do or what to expect.We just kept operating in the dark waiting for something bad to happen to us. January 2020 - We get locked out of our appOne day I get this email: I had mixed feelings. I was starstruck ( Harley is an idol for me ) and scared at the same time. I had a call with Harley and he was pretty nice: He told me in plain words they don’t want us to continue operating and that they’re locking our API key for new installs as we speak.He told me to wait for “the new checkout APIs” that will be coming in the future and that if we cooperate we’re going to get early access. And just like that, we could no longer onboard new customers…There was just one thing though… The new Shopify ToS said the following: \"not use an alternative to Shopify Checkout for web checkout or payment processing, or register any transactions through the Shopify API, without Shopify’s express written authorization. This Section 2.3.18 only applies to Public Applications.” So… theoretically we could always make private apps? 😅 ℹ️ Private apps means that each merchant can create their “own APP” just for their shop and send us their API keys. It’s pretty much the same, but it’s designed for shops that need to make something custom just for themselves. In simple words: it’s a loophole. We had a choice: Option A - Stop what we’re doing, downscale the business and wait for the new APIs. ( They eventually launched 1-2 years later ) Option B - Make Checkout X work with Private Apps. Keep onboarding new merchants. Anger Shopify & disappoint Harley 😢 I chose option B.The ToS allowed it and that was the only realistic option to continue operating as a business. We kept onboarding new stores and Checkout X kept growing. April 2020 - Shopify hijacks Upsell X A while later, Shopify saw what we were doing with the private apps and decided to block our partner account - which held Upsell X. Initially they quoted violation of the Partner Program Agreement and Terms of Service, but when pressed further they admitted we’re not breaking their ToS.   As Checkout X was using private apps at this point, the only result was that they locked us out of Upsell X and we couldn’t support it anymore. Even further - they kept charging merchants for Upsell X - but we never received those payouts.January 2021 - They finally changed their ToS At the end of 2020 they finally changed their Terms of Service. No more alternative checkouts, not on Public apps, not on Private apps. It was time to stop: Breaking the ToS meant our merchants can be banned ( and lose their business ) because they’re using our service. We were tired of being treated like parasites 🐛. We invested millions in bringing a top-notch checkout experience to Shopify, which our customers loved (and Shopify copied in some cases ) - at the end all we got was a constant hostility. We talked to Shopify once again - they weren’t interested in any collaboration. So we agreed to stop onboarding new customers, they agreed to let us support current merchants. We announced the news, gave people 14 days heads up and closed installations.For good.Aftermath There were so many people asking us to onboard them after the change, it was heartbreaking. We had to say NO to new customers literally thousands of times. 💔 Some merchants even created multiple Shopify stores, installed Checkout X before the close-off and started selling Checkout X enabled stores after the change. 🤯 Shopify also dedicated some of their employees to pretend to be desperate Checkout X customers and beg our support to let them in. Not sure if I should be proud or annoyed by such pitiful actions. Checkout X is still operating today. We still support Shopify merchants that installed the app before the closing of the installations, but we haven’t onboarded new ones for the past two years. Porting Checkout X to WooCommerce The obvious move to survive the Shopify ban was to open Checkout X for other platforms. We tried. We spent way too much time porting Checkout X to WooCommerce and supporting both Shopify and WooCommerce simultaneously. The project was a disaster. 🤦‍♂️ It took us much more dev resources than we planned initially and at the end we couldn’t really market it well. WooCommerce is a very different platform from Shopify, so Checkout X wasn’t the right product for it. The platform has different needs ( it has one-page checkout & upsells ) and plugins there are expected to work differently. We have some customers on WooCommerce but it’s nothing like Shopify. We were so cocky because of our success on Shopify that we never stopped to think if anyone on Woo needs our product. We haven’t tried other platforms. What could have we done differently? Pain + reflection = progress. Right? Checkout X was ( and still is ) a wild journey 🎢. I know that some choices I made were good, some weren’t.Looking back there were a couple of ♟️ key moves we could’ve played differently. Fundraising We had multiple opportunities to fundraise. I had the chance to speak to some world-class VCs and I had tremendous support from the Bulgarian startup ecosystem. ( Thanks to everyone for the opportunities. 🙏 ) I always saw Checkout X as a limited-time-window opportunity and honestly I couldn’t see a future different to what happened to us. ( Maybe that’s why things turned out this way ) The reasons I didn’t want to take funding were: I didn’t want the investors to lose their money on me I didn’t see how funding would solve any of our problems I didn’t want to be stuck building Checkout X beyond Shopify, just because we have money in the bank I wanted to be able to cash out and leave at any moment Looking back, maybe if we managed to get the right investors, they could’ve helped us lobby our way out of the situation with Shopify. Maybe not. I believe VC funding is an amazing instrument that enables innovation, but I never saw fundraising as an objective to be chased at any cost.Acquisition For some reason everyone asks me if Shopify offered to buy us - no they didn’t.They didn’t want to have anything to do with us. We had one acquisition offer ( from another company ) - I declined it because it was too low.We didn’t talk further. Suing Shopify One advice we got was to file an antitrust case against Shopify in a European Court. Theoretically, we could’ve argued that Shopify uses anti-competitive practices to get rid of their checkout competition. Similar to what Spotify & Epic Games did against Apple. While that might’ve been a viable option, honestly, I don’t have the balls to pick a legal fight with a multi-billion corporation.On top of that, I believe that crying to the regulator is a bitch move. After everything, I still believe that Shopify built their platform and they should be able to do whatever they want with it. Ignoring the Shopify ToS updateOne thing that I probably would’ve done differently is not complying with Shopify’s updates.If they want to harass and ban their own customers for using an alternative checkout - that’s their decision - they should’ve dealt with the consequences. Instead, we helped them by becoming our own gatekeeper and refusing to onboard new merchants. But again, I was this 25 year old, just made some money for the first time founder and I was afraid. Shopify has made numerous legal threats against me along the way and I decided to fold, get my profits and move on.Conclusion It’s been a wild ride. I believe that I’m leaving this adventure as a winner, as I find myself with more experience, contacts, recognition and finances than when I first started. At the same time, it’s sad to see my best work so far slowly dying away and I still can’t get rid of the extreme anxiety I felt with Shopify looming over my head for the past years. If I sound bitter - I’m not. I like Shopify. I own Shopify stock. I believe they’re completely dominating the e-commerce platform space and none of their current competitors stand a chance of catching up. I know they did what’s best for their business and this is the end I expected. Still, I also believe it’s important to share stories that aren’t all 🌈 rainbows and sunshines. At the end - I’m happy.I had some wins, I had some fails - it’s time to move on.It’s time for step 3 of the masterplan 😈 I hope this story brought something to you.

    "commentBody": "Bootstrapping to €600k MRR and getting killed by Shopify: Checkout X (leteyski.com)299 points by ericthegoodking 7 hours ago | hide | past | favorite | 168 commentsrahimnathwani 5 hours ago | next [–] I’m surprised at all the comments focusing on the negative here.I found the story inspiring: they bootstrapped a business, grew revenue, hired some people, and grew revenue further.The founder created value and captured some of that value. The fact that the business can no longer acquire new customers is sad, but it’s only a small part of the story.The founder’s 6 year journey is probably more interesting than what most people did at work over the past 6 years.replydavidw 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Yeah, the story isn't one of those \"THIS IS SO UNFAAAAAAIR\" things. It's just a description of what happened.Depending on the costs, 600,000 euros a month is pretty good even if it doesn't last forever.> If I sound bitter - I’m not. I like Shopify. I own Shopify stock. I believe they’re completely dominating the e-commerce platform space and none of their current competitors stand a chance of catching up. I know they did what’s best for their business and this is the end I expected.replyJ_Shelby_J 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don’t understand how Shopify can maintain market dominance as just a middleman value extractor. Probably why they’re forcing their app. I deleted my account and haven’t used Shopify since they wouldn’t let me get my order tracking any way besides the app. As someone who worked adjacent to logistics it was just the hardest hard “no” of all time for me. Money moves to easily now days to build a monopoly on e-commerce.replyWheatMillington 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Value extractor? I'm a non tech guy so I have a different perspective. I started a side business selling online. I have no idea where I would even start on my own, between setting up a website and handling payments etc. Shopify allowed me to literally stand up an ecommerce platform in an afternoon, and soon enough I was accepting $6k per month. The cost was something like $39/month, which was phenomenal value for money.replylockhouse 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I completely see the value in using something like Shopify. Collecting money from customers online in a safe, trustworthy manner, that is fully in compliance with multiple countries laws, to include charging the proper taxes and duties would take more time than developing the product you’re actually trying to sell.replyhintymad 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Similar to how Alibaba did with Taobao and TMall in China and Southeast Asia? Aggregators do offer values.replynerdponx 1 hour ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If anything, it's quite a success story.replyMagi604 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Same here, it was a great story.replyspamizbad 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'm not a business expert or an entrepreneur, but I've been around this industry long enough to know: Unless your intention is to flip your startup into an acquisition, I would recommend against plays like this.Specifically, tying yourself up to a closed ecosystem by building what amounts to a (albeit very nice and powerful) super-feature.I am saying this because I work for a large-ish company where someone did this to a section of our product that was also mediocre. One of our co-founders reached out to the company and actually offered to buy them for, what I felt, was an insanely high amount for what they were building. They rejected the offer so we threw some devs and an awesome designer at the problem, made something just as good, and then shut them out. They ultimately shut down.replyfy20 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] It can work the other way around too. Early in my career I was working for a company that provided value added services in the telecommunications space. We grew quite large, working with household name brands in Northern Europe. However everything we did went through a single third party provider - we didn't communicate directly with telecommunications companies.This provider did an ok job, however at the volumes we were processing it meant we were paying them a pretty handsome sum - which the owners (we were privately held without any outside investment) wanted to reduce to increase their profit margin. We made an offer to buy this provider, but they knew how much we were depending on them, and made a counter offer much higher, which we refused.We started building out our own platform to connect directly to the telecommunications companies, which if you've ever worked in this space, you will know it's no easy task. Although there are standards, each company does things slightly differently, so each integration is effectively from scratch. To make it even harder, the process of migrating phone numbers etc is effectively turn it off in one place and turn it on in the new place, there is no gradual switch over. After the failed negotiations our provider did not want to cooperate with this (any more than they legally had to) and they gave us a hard deadline after which they would turn off all our services. Any major issues during this migration could take weeks to resolve, and would surely result in large customers leaving which could be the end of our company.But in the end we did it. The migration over to our platform worked without any major issues, and we were even able to build in extra features that our provider didn't have.And the icing on the cake: a year or so later we bought that provider. As we were their biggest customer - by a long way - they lost a big chunk of business. What we paid for them was much lower than the original offer we made.replyspaceman_2020 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] But at the same time, if you are bootstrapped, profitable and can iterate fast, building on top of an existing platform is a fantastic way to get customers. You have a captive audience, you can understand the market easily, and can launch products fast since the tech stack is already well defined.Not every business has to be sold for $100M or be around forever. A well-run bootstrapped startup like the OP’s can make you millions if it survives just 3-4 years.replyketzo 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, seriously -- everyone in this thread seems to be talking about this like a story of failure, and I... don't really get that?There aren't a lot of hard numbers in the post, but it sounds like Checkout X grossed in the high 7-figure to low 8-figure range, in ~four years, while paying (not very many) Eastern European salaries. The founder alone probably came away with a few million dollars!replyaltdataseller 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Exactly, and people are forgetting what's the alternative? Doing absolutely nothing, twiddling your thumbs because you CAN'T find another good market opportunity and earning less?replydasil003 19 minutes ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sure, that's the conventional wisdom, but it seems sort of out of context here. This guy gambled and won, bootstrapping a €600k MRR business which is still printing money to this day (Shopify killed the growth, not the business). This guys already made more money than the majority of European developers do in their entire career. I fail to see the downside.replysjducb 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This guy clearly made several million euros. That’s a massive win.Sure founding a billion euro company is better, but if you don’t have a billion euro idea then starting a million euro company is worthwhile.replynolok 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > Specifically, tying yourself up to a closed ecosystem by building what amounts to a (albeit very nice and powerful) super-feature.Couldn't agree more. It goes something like this :\"What do you offer ?\"\"Feature X on top of Y\"\"What stops Y from doing it themselves ?\"Either A \"Well it's not worth it\" (then why do you do it), or B \"Well, they haven't so far ...\" in which case you have an end date already, you just don't know it yet and it's in the hands of Y.As you said, planning to be aquired is probably the best move, second one being to plan your independence (imgur to reddit like), because otherwise your company has no real future.replywithinboredom 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Usually it's \"C. Because they don't care.\" It's when you start walking away with millions that they could have had, had they cared, that they will suddenly care.replyadamckay 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > otherwise your company has no real futureThat's not necessarily as bad as it sounds, though.If the future where your company can exist is long enough for you to learn some valuable things and make decent money, it's obviously worth it.replyHWR_14 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I feel fairly confident your \"insanely high amount\" wasn't as high as you feel it was.replyspamizbad 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For a product built by 2 people it was enough for both of them to retire (albeit humbly) or seed a more ambitious company.Anyway, their best move was to take the money. They gambled that, even after noticing their work and our customer's feedback, we wouldn't turn around make our product better. They lost that bet.replyHWR_14 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That sounds about where I was thinking. You have to imagine that you're not paying as much for the product as a sign on bonus for the talent that has demonstrated the ability to improve the value of your product quite a bit over the four years of being locked in.replyDylan16807 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Enough money to retire on sounds even more like an \"insanely high amount\" when I think of it as a sign-on bonus.replyHWR_14 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I assume that means that the offer is the company purchased for just under 2 million dollars. Maybe a bit more, maybe some seed investors take a small percentage. Let's assume each founder takes almost a million dollars. I would understanding feeling weird paying almost 2 million for something that I can get done with 6 man-months. That is a lot of money! Enough to retire humbly or seed their next start up. But it's also something they will only get (or only get most of) over a 4-year vesting period.So it's a 250k/year boost. That's again a lot. But that difference might also be what they can make at Google instead of a startup salary-wise.But think about who they are hiring. People who have proven they can find new places to add value.I'm making up numbers. But the point is that if you think about selling the next four years of your life (and not just the time spent on the company already), it is certainly reasonable and might be a good outcome. But it also might be worth turning down.But maybe my guesses are totally off. Maybe he meant \"retire humbly but continue to live in SF\" instead of \"take your money and retire to a ranch somewhere\"replyadwn 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If it was much higher than what they ultimately spent on reproducing the product, then yes, \"insanely high amount\" might actually be an appropriate assessment.replyHWR_14 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Considering the \"for what they were building.\" I assume that was the poster's thinking. On the other hand, there is value in acquihiring people who can see a need in your product you overlook and want to make it better. Sure, that feature was cheaper, but that's not all you buy.replypixl97 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Better than 0 I guessreplyliquidise 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I had the same thought. There is a a lot of value to be created with moves like this, but it is risky and does not have a long shelf life. Not necessarily a bad business play, but should be expected to be a short-lived one either way.replyalberth 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] AgreedApollo fell into this bucket as well (with Reddit).Never understood why more didn’t realize that.replynotJim 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Apollo had a successful app for years that would never have existed without reddit. It's unfortunate it didn't last forever, but it's not like their efforts were wasted.replyDylan16807 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] How I feel about this depends on what exactly you mean by \"shut them out\".replytsunamifury 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What your describe is monopolistic behavior to a TreplynotJim 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] How so? Shopify has many competitors and is clearly not a monopoly.replyvarispeed 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Hacker News is a funny place. Few days ago I pointed out something similar - that first thing investors look at is how easily someone can eat your lunch? and got heavily downvoted.These ideas are only bootstrappable, because nobody is going to put their money into it, apart from founders having a dream, but everyone else seeing that competitor can wipe them by just assigning a team to build that extra feature in their product.Don't get me wrong - it doesn't mean you shouldn't do it. If you don't care much about money and value experience more, that is an extremely exciting journey to take oneself through and also sometimes dreams come true!replybrianwawok 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] Well, I can relate as I just got an email that Shopify changed their partner TOS today because of me.They had demanded that I add a negative keyword \"Shopify\" to all of my Google ads.I declined, because - it wasn't in our partnership agreement and I in fact DID want clients who used Shopify to find my business. (I am in the e-commerce space selling a product that works for many marketplaces including Shopify).Just got an email today about a partnership TOS change. Now I need to put a negative keyword in any Google ad campaign they deem it necessary, despite like I said, Shopify users being great product fits for me.I am just a little dude. What power do I have? Not really anything, the biggies get to tell me what to do. I either follow the rules of the game or get banned from the platform. Rather frustrating to say the least.replywithinboredom 5 hours ago | parent | next [–] Can you hire a few friends of yours to write a blog post and advertise instead of you? Blog-spam is a thing, now I know why.Thanks Shopify.replyed 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Atlassian has this policy for 3rd-party developers too. It feels pretty reasonable, to be honest.

In this case, the author was aware of that, but more fore-thinking would have helped.For instance, I leverage Telegram bots to make some business, but I'm ready for such an scenario where Telegram, decides:- To make its API paid.- To copy the features of my bots into product features.See what happened with Reddit's API. WordPress purchased WooCommerce and it became a happy story, but it could have gone wrong and become a horror story where the purchase could have not happened, and WordPress gone into destroy mode.I tread lightly.--[0]: Do not conflate \"quick\" with \"easy\" in this context.

They received an email that said they wouldn't be shut down right away, which the author took to mean \"carry on!\" Then Shopify's COO called them personally to tell them to knock it off, and they used a technicality in the phrasing of the ToS to keep operating.Shopify shouldn't have to play whack-a-mole with these guys—they made their stance very very clear and the author willfully ignored it.

It is based on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set, which tests the ability of models to follow general user instructions. These responses are then compared to reference Davinci003 responses by the provided GPT-4 or Claude or ChatGPT based auto-annotators, which results in the win rates presented above. AlpacaEval displays a high agreement rate with ground truth human annotations, and leaderboard rankings on AlpacaEval are very correlated with leaderboard rankings based on human annotators. Please see our documentation for more details on our analysis.Adding new modelsWe welcome new model contributions to the leaderboard from the community! To do so, please follow the steps in the contributions section. Specifically, you'll need to run the model on the evaluation set, auto-annotate the outputs, and submit a PR with the model config and leaderboard results. We've also set up a Discord for community support and discussion.Adding new evaluators or eval setsWe also welcome contributions for new evaluators or new eval sets! For making new evaluators, we release our ground-truth human annotations and comparison metrics. We also release a rough guide to follow for making new eval sets. We specifically encourage contributions for harder instructions distributions and for safety testing of LLMs.AlpacaEval limitationsWhile AlpacaEval provides a useful comparison of model capabilities in following instructions, it is not a comprehensive or gold-standard evaluation of model abilities. For one, as detailed in the AlpacaFarm paper, the auto annotator winrates are correlated with length. Though human annotations also display this bias, it is unclear if more verbose answers add utility in downstream tasks. Additionally, the AlpacaFarm eval set, though diverse, consists mainly of simple instructions. We encourage the community to contribute new, more complex eval sets, such as for tool use. Finally, AlpacaEval does not evaluate the safety of any of the models.",

This means GPT-4’s judgments closely align with the majority of humans. We also show that GPT-4’s judgments may help humans make better judgments. During our data collection, when a human’s choice deviated from GPT-4, we presented GPT-4’s judgments to humans and ask if they are reasonable.

The gold-standard is human ratings of audio quality, but it is tough to design good tests (easy to fatigue raters) and the iteration time waiting for results is quite long.Instead, there's now some projects which use neural networks trained on human ratings to predict audio quality, such as ViSQoL: https://github.com/google/visqolThis opens up fast iteration - scores going up generally corresponds to higher quality - followed by human testing at major milestones (eg, releasing a paper/model). VISQOL has a harder time comparing 'unrelated' models, IMO - ends up being not so great for comparison of different techniques, but excellent for measuring incremental improvement or catching regressions.But, in the end, yes - you can use NN's to measure the quality of other NN's, so long as you're careful about it and make use of human raters from time to time as well.The problem of test data getting into the training data seems to be an especially pernicious issue with LLM's, which isn't really arising in the audio synthesis space.replyblackkettle 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’ve started doing this with ASR hypotheses from colloquial spontaneous speech. It tends to have similar issues. Lots of shady human ground truth especially where addresses, alphanumeric sequences, repairs and repetitions and other essentially non read speech are concerned. The very large Whisper models are consistent in their transcription style and highly reliable as long as you pick strongly represented languages. And ChatGPT can do a very good job at comparing the linguistic coherence of hypotheses from multiple recognizers. Together these models can annotate, analyze and ingest far more data more consistently than human annotators at this point (at least in the best covered languages). We haven’t quite realized this as a community yet though, because the standard datasets we use for evaluation contain all these human inconsistencies.

It feels like a distillation of all human knowledge and sentiments. I use it constantly to get advice on plans, architectures, thoughts, etc.. to get an idea of pretty much what the average person would think. It often points out things I've overlooked which I'll improve my design with and go back and forth with ChatGPT until we're both in agreement.I even read a classic book the other day and had a great discussion with ChatGPT about moral relativism, the different schools of thought and how it fit into philosophy as a whole. For students this technology is incredible, I wish I had it for all my classes.Even sometimes comments I'll make on here or Reddit I'll pass through ChatGPT first to see if I made any mistakes in my logic.replyTowerTall 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > to get an idea of pretty much what the average person would thinkThere is no such thing as an average person.https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/when-u-s-air-force-disc...replyFolcon 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Funnily enough I think you both might be right here, there isn't such a thing as an average person, but ChatGPT may be the synthesis of the average opinion.replywahnfrieden 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] what is an average opinion? it is the sum of opinions which disagree with the resultreplyoceanplexian 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It gives you the average opinion of someone on the Internet, particularly places like Reddit, which is FAR from the “average opinion” of most people.

When I was grading philosophy 101, I would have probably given it a passing grade against the overall curve, but that's about it. Philosophy is a discipline of careful, sometimes jargoney, and always very couched assertions that can be easily misunderstood and appropriated. This is probably its greatest weakness, and in many ways this weakness is the progenitor of philosophy itself in the Western world, with Plato at the start (i.e. with the figure of the sophist, the paradox of a false wisdom).- Maybe one reason: there is a huge amount of, lets say, \"armchair philosophy\" on the internet, compared to other disciplines. Many blogposts and tiny manifestos of people really excited by some out of context quote from Spinoza or whatever. And you start to really feel this part of the dataset when you ask about philosophy.

I think its kinda cheeky answering you so literally, giving it an actual place to fit into :).I don't doubt it can do, like, Wikipedia type classification ok, but that's not like really getting to the substance of anything! And, either way, its not like there is one decided-upon hierarchy of concepts like this people consciously work within. This is a fine picture to some, but others might contest, perhaps, that Meta-Ethics is the \"study of moral thought, language, and properties.\" What is \"moral language\" anyway? Why is it meta relative to Moral Philosophy writ-large? Or perhaps one might argue that we need to think of meta-ethics as a sibling rather than child. The whole discipline is a mess of different thoughts and possible rebuttals and grand intellectual overturnings that will not be captured here. Maybe just try pasting that back into the prompt and asking \"what's wrong with this picture?\".But like I said, its fine in that its fairly comparable to Wikipedia for utility, (with IMO a worse interface, but I get why people like it more).replydgroshev 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The reason you feel that way might be that you are familiar enough with philosophy.After all, LLMs and ChatGPT in particular are are indistinguishable from productised Gell-Mann Amnesia.Edit: rewrote to be more neutral, sorryreplylolinder 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] 80% agreement is high, but the margins between models at the top are so low that even that remaining 20% could be enough to alter the final rankings, depending on which direction it errs.replybostonsre 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Is perfect agreement possible?

Could you please share a few words on what type of data you are cleaning using GPT? It is an intriguing idea and I would love to learn more to see if I could use a similar approach.replyTostino 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Youtube transcripts. It only works with single-person channels at the moment, as I haven't worked on disambiguating multiple speakers. They are very messy if they are just an auto transcription from Google. Practically unusable in most cases.So first step in the pipeline is cleaning up the transcripts for incorrectly transcribed words or sentences. Using the context of the rest of the transcript, it is able to fix the vast majority of them. Then we add punctuation and format it with paragraphs. Then I have another check over the whole transcript for any remaining issues.After all of that, I have a relatively clean transcript that represents the original audio very closely. From there, I am doing things like: 1. creating question/answer pairs from the transcript 2. creating a document of additional context that fills in details about what the speaker is talking about but may not have explicitly said 3. creating a summary of the transcript identifying the main purpose 4. creating a knowledge graph from the transcript with nodes and edges 5. creating an annotated version of the transcript using that knowledge graphI plan on putting some of this data into a vector database, and some of it will be used for fine tuning LLaMA2 models on specific tasks (like knowledge graph creation, annotation using a knowledge graph, and writing using a knowledge graph to keep track of events)replydr_kiszonka 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's very informative - thanks so much for the explanation!My only experience with transcripts is in the context of transcribing short interviews. I used Whisper and it was pretty good.

Makes me wonder how many of the responses are just repeating and rephrasing memorized content written by humans, which will of course appear better, while ChatGPT makes more effort to avoid this (and might be able to generalize better to things it hasn’t memorized?).replyuser_7832 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Thanks for the link!At least in my examples, the llama output was more verbose/comprehensive.

For example, here's this discussion: https://huggingface.co/sahil2801/replit-code-instruct-glaive...This was the HumanEval contamination one dev measured: ``` replit_glaive: 56.71% replit: 7.32% wizard: 4.88% ```From the WizardCoder paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08568.pdf you can see that it hits SOTA (for open models) in not just HumanEval and HumanEval+, but also MBPP and DS-1000 as well, so it's not a one off.For those interested in reading more about various considerations for coding models, I highly recommend reading the MSR phi-1 paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11644.pdfLooking forward to if they ever publish code/model/dataset since it has extremely strong performance trained on a very small number of tokens very manageable 1.3B and 350M parameter models.replyriku_iki 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > in not just HumanEval and HumanEval+, but also MBPP and DS-1000 as well, so it's not a one off.and how do you know all these benchmarks not leaked? I think they all scrapped from web sites, the same as training data for LLM, so risk of contamination is extremely high.The best way to measure this is through synthetic datasets, which generate new tasks every time and model can't memorize them during training. One example is BigBench has multiple such tasks, but researchers usually(always) not regenerating those datasets.replymarcosdumay 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I imagine that if you take the time to specialize it, you suddenly have a model that is better than anything from the large players on all the cases that you care about.But, well, I am currently not hyped enough about it to actually try.replyZambyte 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] When you say \"coding questions\" do you mean questions that should be answered by producing code, or questions about code (\"explain this\")?

Might need to be further optimized in size and 4-bit quantisation, perhaps and then you have a scaleable and fast self-hosted AI model.Lets just hope that there won’t be any embarrassing vulnerabilities coming out of this when someone could prompt the model to reveal its own environment variables or API keys or the internal prompt that it is using.But it seems the $0 free AI models are eating OpenAI’s lunch and Meta so far is winning the race to zero.replythewataccount 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] The fact Guanaco 33B is at 65% with Vicuna 13B at 70.43% immediately makes these results non-sensical from my own experience with them.
