The automaker last year became so inundated with driving-range complaints that it created a special team to cancel owners’ service appointments.By STEVE STECKLOW and NORIHIKO SHIROUZU Filed July 27, 2023, 10 a.m. GMTAUSTIN, TexasIn March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan’s advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather – such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.“We’re looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,” he said of his dashboard range meter.Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that “remote diagnostics” had determined his battery was fine, and then: “We would like to cancel your visit.”What Ponsin didn’t know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a “Diversion Team” in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company’s advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter. A Tesla logo shown outside a Beijing showroom. The automaker’s estimates of its electric vehicles’ driving range have been among the most aggressive in the industry. It has faced thousands of complaints from customers disappointed by the vehicles’ real-world performance. REUTERS/Thomas PeterInside the Nevada team’s office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.In most cases, the complaining customers’ cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way – by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars’ own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company’s vehicles.Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years.Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles’ potential driving distance – by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers “rosy” projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a “safety buffer,” allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.“Elon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,” the person said, adding: “When you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.”Tesla’s intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety – the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger – has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales. An image from a statement by South Korean regulators, who cited Tesla for false advertising this year. The agency said the company failed to disclose that cold weather could greatly reduce its vehicles’ driving range. Regulators also required Tesla to change certain wording on its local website.At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a “Cybertruck” pickup.Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars’ dashboard range meters didn’t change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.Recurrent found that Tesla’s four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent’s chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla’s range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars — but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver’s lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a “Range Tips” section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that’s always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system’s range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are “more realistic,” they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.Recurrent tested other automakers’ in-dash range meters –  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona – and found them to be more accurate. The Kona’s range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: “That’s where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.”Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, shown here in Beijing this year, gave the directive about a decade ago to write software for vehicles that gave drivers “rosy” estimates of driving range, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. REUTERS/Tingshu WangFailed tests and false advertisingTesla isn’t the only automaker with cars that don’t regularly achieve their advertised ranges.One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.”Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director of Edmunds.com, on how Tesla approaches estimating its vehicles’ driving rangeEV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model’s range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA’s formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA’s formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. “We follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,” the German carmaker said in a statement.Ford and Porsche didn’t respond to requests for comment. A screengrab from Tesla’s website advertising the Model S sport sedan. Driving range is among the most important factors considered by electric vehicle buyers.Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars’ estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla’s range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.The EPA said it has seen “everything” in its audits of EV manufacturers’ range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. “That is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes” auditing them, the agency said.The EPA cautioned that individuals’ actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.Pannone called Tesla “the most aggressive” electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.“I’m not suggesting they’re cheating,” Pannone said of Tesla. “What they’re doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.”Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla’s in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.“They've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,” Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can “misrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.”South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars’ range. It cited tests by the country’s environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company’s claimed ranges in cold weather.The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla’s website, including one that claimed about a particular model: “You can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.” Regulators required Tesla to remove the “or longer” phrase.Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”So-called range anxiety - the fear of getting stranded in an electric car before reaching a charger - has been a major obstacle to increasing electric vehicle sales. REUTERS/Albert GeaCreating a diversionBy last year, sales of Tesla’s electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team’s operations.Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its “virtual” service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla “Virtual Service Advisor” described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: “Divert customers who do not require in person service.”RELATED CONTENTSpecial Report: Tesla workers shared sensitive images recorded by customer carsTesla resumes US orders for a Model 3 version at lower price, rangeSouth Korea fines Tesla $2.2 mln for exaggerating driving range of EVsFor EV batteries, lithium iron phosphate narrows the gap with nickel, cobaltSuch advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas “Diversion Team” to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone – a xylophone with metal keys – that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office’s operations.Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers’ cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a “Diversion Team” tasked with preventing service-center visits.The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team’s operations.“Thousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car” by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates. The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency’s own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles.On the roadBy the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3’s battery about a dozen times.Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara – about two weeks away – but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery “is in good health.”“We would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,” the text read.“Of course I still have concerns,” Ponsin shot back. “I have 150 miles of range on a full charge!”The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. “I am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,” he replied.Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. “It lasted 10 minutes,” Ponsin said, “and they didn’t even look at the car physically.”After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla “should be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,” especially in very cold weather.“I do love my Tesla,” the engineer said. “But I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.”REUTERS INVESTIGATESMore Reuters investigations and long-form narrativesGot a confidential news tip?

I hate almost everything about it. But most germane, The \"Battery meter\" at the top of the display is total bunk. That's got to be \"rosy\" numbers. It'll display a the battery in miles, but it's at least 25% inflated.However if you punch in a destination, you'll get exact numbers, and those are insanely reliable. It claims (and I don't believe any claims coming from tesla) that it'll factor wind, elevation, temperature, etc. But regardless of what it factors in, it's on the money.replymalwrar 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] I actually got stranded once for some hours because of the mileage indicator!Was driving back from a campsite that I turned out to not have charging compatibility with, but thought I had plenty of margin to get to the nearest charger. As I drove through the mountains however, I began noticing that a.) my battery was depleting much faster than expected and b.) I wasn’t seeing any houses and very few motorists. I watched with increasing dread as the trip miles began converging with the battery miles, as my friends in the car got more and more quiet. We reached the inflection point, and the best I could do was hope we’d encounter somewhere with a plug that might be able to get us the rest of the way. Eventually though the milage indicator reached zero, and I pulled off the road to what I thought was a campsite but turned out to be a sort of rest stop with no power plugs in sight. To make matters worse I was in a mountain valley and had no phone signal, and hiking wasn’t an option as it was pretty hot and we had no water. We were there for hours until I was able to flag down a nice older couple and get a ride to a place with cell signal, where I was able to get a tow truck capable of transporting my car (turns out you need one that has a full bed because of the regenerative breaking, and tesla’s service doesn’t have infinite coverage) to the charger I was trying to get to.Ironically that last part was probably the most frustrating. The charging spot was full save one spot in the back, which my tow truck guy Mel couldn’t get back to. No sweat I thought, I’ll just try asking someone to swap, but people in their cars pretended to ignore me, and one couple leaving theirs just walked away, as I asked if they could move so we could unload my dead car. Had a sudden wave of empathy for the people I usually walk away from who ask me for spare change lol. Eventually someone left and I was able to charge and resume the 6 hour road trip home. Biggest lesson learned was that slow is fast, keep it at 60 if you want the milage meter to not die as quick.replyjohntiger1 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a very humbling experience to be ignored by so many folks, glad you reflected on that. The story about the couple just flat out walking away strikes me as obtusely anti-social, but sadly not unexpected in our day and age.Just out of curiosity, where was this?replymalwrar 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I went camping somewhere at/near Sequoia National Forest (forgot where) and was traveling to the charger at Inyokern. I think we got stuck on highway 178, about 3/4 of the way there.replyhot_gril 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Crown Vic owners to other Vic owners: Wave and smile, leave friendly notes in parking lots.Tesla owners to other Tesla owners:> people in their cars pretended to ignore mereplycyanydeez 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Also, normal people don't buy teslareplyyafbum 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tbh though, going up a mountain is insanely more energy consuming than regular driving, so the range indicator can't possibly take this into consideration ahead of time unless you chart a specific trip. In the other direction, I've had the experience of the battery charge level continuously increasing while going down a long mountain road - infinite range!replybumby 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] According to TSLA, it takes into account elevation though...replyfrumper 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If you tell it where you're going it will.replyfoogazi 47 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Doesn’t it know where it is ?This goes to the optimistic/ exagerated calculationreplyfrumper 42 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah. I’ve never had the car not know where it is.replyleemelone 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] and that should be obvious right? Let's say you're familiar with how fast your car eats gas and you drive around on flats all the time.When you take it into the mountains, it's not surprising that your gas gauge goes down a bit faster when you're pushing that gas pedal a little further than usual.Perhaps the takeaway is that EVs shouldn't so prominently display the range as part of the \"gas\" gauge the way they tend to do.replyfrumper 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have it show percent, not range. Tesla defaults to percent on the main display. I'm not sure about other cars. When you use navigation then Tesla will show you the expected charge at your destination and it's been pretty accurate.replyabustamam 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I drove my wife's Model 3 on a short trip from Sacramento, CA to Santa Cruz. 3.5hrs if you factor in traffic (2.5hrs without).When we left, estimated range was 45% on arrival. We arrived with 27% range. Granted, we did encounter a crapload of traffic, but the Nav system took that into account because the time was accurate.I don't fully fault Tesla for the range inaccuracy; an ICE car would probably have had a similar issue. But it's not as smart as I thought it was, which is a shame.replyfrumper 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] I obviously don’t have a reason why it was so off. We regularly drive from near sac to Santa Cruz and it’s within a few percent with plenty of speeding. I commute 100 miles a day on the freeway, so maybe it knows my freeway driving habits very well.replyjodrellblank 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"unless you chart a specific trip\"replybumby 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So the implication is it's getting it's data from local weather stations and not from the vehicle itself, no?If anyone know, I'd be interested in the more details and what led to that decision.replypests 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] He did chart a trip.replylowbloodsugar 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Using the trip counter isn't the same as entering the destination in navigation. If you tell navigation your destination it will tell you if you're going to make it or not. If you start driving like a madman halfway through it will reevaluate and start navigating you to a charger. I rented one for a week and took it up into the mountains, far from a charger. It was scary, but we made it back with 17% charge once I stopped passing everyone every time there was a dotted line.replypests 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm aware - pretty sure they did chart the trip in autopilot though from my reading. Telling the autopilot system you are headed to a supercharger also starts pre-warming the battery.replyabustamam 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] That's a bit annoying to me to be honest. It's a cool feature, but sometimes I want to plan out a trip without having to prewarm, or I want to prewarm without having to navigate. I can imagine why it's automatic instead of manual (imagine if someone prewarmed their battery but forgot to charge or something) but it'd be a nice \"advanced\" thing to have.replymalwrar 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] To be clear, I meant me hiking up a mountain. I thought I might have gotten signal up there (wasn’t too high up, just a fairly far walk), but I was also thinking of stories about people dying when they leave their cars to go for help and figured it’d be smarter to wait for someone to pass by.reply7thaccount 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] On a highway my hood latch broke (old car) and it flew up at 50 mph and crushed my windshield. I had no service (but knew the other carrier would have full bars) and spent over an hour waving at every car trying to get someone to stop to let me call my parents (I was 18 and not exactly intimidating). It was a crazy experience as I'd obviously had an accident. Nobody would help. Finally I just stood in the road like a crazy person and a nice family stopped and one of their kids was on the carrier I needed. It was far enough from a nearby town to be at least a few hours walk and not before nightfall.replyNLPaep 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] In the US and probably elsewhere, 911 works if any carrier has servicereplywillcipriano 4 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I know what gender you are.replyIncipient 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Apache helicopter?

After he got back he said to his brother, \"the car just seemed to top out at a certain point\" and his brother said \"yeah, that's about 85 mph\" (the national speed limit was 55 mph at that time). So at 85 mph the air resistance equaled the force the engine could apply and the car wouldn't go any faster.replyklaff 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Force is proportional to square of speed but power = force*speed so proportional to speed^3.replyAnimalMuppet 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's not how this works.First, the force that is proportional to the square of the speed is the drag force, which means it's the force you need to supply just to keep the speed from dropping. Power = force * speed is a different \"force\" - it's the force produced by the engine.Second, power output of an engine typically has an RPM where it peaks. Past that point, more speed means less power output, which means much less force output, because the force is the power divided by the speed. But force needed still increases as the square of speed.replysyndicatedjelly 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] That's how top speed works.replymcronce 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Either that or you're limited by revs - in other words, there's enough net torque that, in the highest gear, the engine is running at redline before wind resistance stops you accelerating.You don't see that much these days, though, as having your highest gear that short is just leaving fuel economy on the table on the highway.

But modern engines are more efficient and take a while to warm up (especially diesels, but small turbos like Honda 1.5 too) so cars sometimes implement resistive heating to heat the cabin quicker.Also some cars have independent heating that can be used to heat up the car up without running an engine.

E.g. my moldy old Subaru requires flatbed towing, because spinning the rear wheels while the fronts are immobile will destroy the limited-slip center diff, but it's totally possible to push it along with all four wheels on the ground.I think AWD Teslas have an independent motor and drivetrain for the rear wheels. Naively, one would expect that if you unload the rear axle motor/generator you could just tow the car with little resistance and no damage, but in practice the picture is probably more complicated. I would love to hear from an expert.replypurpleidea 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Tesla cars are way heavier. Nobody is pushing one with their friend. Unless it's downhill.replygiobox 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can push a tesla in most typical push situations. Sure its heavy, but its in the ballpark of pushing any large sedan or SUV, not just electric ones. You can enable free-rolling wheels in the car and push away, especially if you have luxury of two people pushing.The weight of a Tesla is not some unprecedented figure for a passenger car - a model 3 is no heavier than many BMW 5 series configurations etc.The far bigger problem for pushing EVs in my experience is blown pyro-fuses that lock the axle after crashes preventing the wheels from turning - a common issue after an EV shunt. This is why you will often see EVs \"dragged\" out of shunts by the recovery vehicle until they can get the locked wheels onto dollies. This is only an issue if the EV being pushed has been in an impact generally, but the bar for a pyrofuse blow seems to be low too - it will trip even if airbags haven't deployed. The wheels on many EV motor axles wont turn again until the pyrofuse is replaced.I think the earlier example that required a full recovery truck - that sounds exactly like a blown pyrofuse, which is by far the most common reason an EV ends up requiring a full lift/dollies rather than a simple tow on its own axles.This is also why you generally always smell burning in the cabin after a tesla shunt too - nothing to do with a battery fire, its the smell of the pyrofuse burning out under the rear passenger seat.> https://www.wired.com/story/evs-fire-pyroswitches-cut-risk-s...replypests 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > You can enable free-roling wheels in the car and push awayIs that possible when the car is persumed dead?

Every Tesla model except the original roadster is locked in a single gear transmission that never disconnects - one of the big reasons EV drivetrains can be built so reliable with virtually no maintenance requirements (there is no service items on most EV drivetrains until a quick coolant flush in ~10th year of car's life span).The Model 3/Y just dump the output of the rotor into a permanently locked 9:1 trans. There is no need for a reverse gear either as unlike a gas engine the electric motor can easily rotate in both directions.An electric motor cant \"stall\" like a gas engine and generally never has to change gear, so there is usually no real benefit to fitting the cost and complexity of clutching driveshafts you typically need when you have a gearbox or gas engine.Someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but to best of my memory the only \"mainstream\" EV with a gearbox on sale today is the Porche Taycan/Audi E-Tron GT (they are both the same chasis/drivetrain underneath) with its pretty unusual 2-speed setup. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the next generation of that car eliminates the gearbox.replycolejohnson66 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] If the drivetrain never disengages, how does “freewheeling mode” (neutral) work?

In other words, I don't see new internal combustion cars renaming neutral to be \"car wash mode\"... lol.Cars should have neutral. And, if yours does then it should be named as such.Making sure I've got \"car was mode\" is not what I want to do when I'm in the market for a new car.

After all, a single strongman can pull a passenger airliner, and any car is nearly impossible to push uphill -- you have to really get some momentum built up first to let them coast up driveways/etc.replyReubachi 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not about weight or incline, it's the mechanical gearing in the \"transmission\" that can't turn the wheels without 100 percent power from the engine. You'll be able to push it and think it's really heavy, but it's just the transmission fighting you.standards and automatic trans have neutral that disconnects driveshaft from engine, removing any resistance from the engaged gear.

There's no mechanical disconnect between the wheels and the motor (i.e. a clutch) so pushing the car essentially turns it into a generator.replymannykannot 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Your second sentence is correct, but it takes a lot more torque to turn a generator at a given speed when it is driving current through a load, than it does when it is open-circuit.Inside the motor/generator, what happens is that if there's current flowing in the windings as a result of the EMF induced by turning the rotor, then, loosely speaking, it creates a magnetic field which opposes the rotation - but if it is not connected to some load (or a short-circuit) there's no current, even though there is still an induced EMF.It's a standard case of the conservation of energy - if it were not the case, you could put an arbitrary number of generators on the same shaft, all supplying power to external loads, and then use the output of a couple of them to power a motor spinning the assembly...If you are turning a motor/generator slowly, then the difference in torque is not much, but I am responding to the implication that the motor would have to be mechanically disengaged in order to disable the braking effect.replydinom 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Correct me if I'm wrong but, if I understand things correctly... at this point we're wondering if manual locking hubs are a better (or worse) solution than electrically isolating the motor(s). Right?And, off the top of my head I'm going to say the manual locking hubs will be better overall. Better from an energy efficiency perspective as well as overall convenience and simplicity of design. They might be worse for Tesla's P&L though since anyone with a tire jack and a standard parts dealer nearby could work on the car.Then again, besides the fact that I'm a cynic... what the heck do I really know!??!replyzh3 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yes and no. Spinning the motor will generate a voltage but if it's not connected to anything there's no current flow and so the only resistance is friction. For it to act as a brake, something has to use the current - for example, charging the battery or more simply just shorting the motor (try turning an efficient DC motor with the wires open and the wires shorted - even with a stepper motor, you'll find a huge difference).replynot2b 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] \"a scenario that will not occur for the majority of cars\" isn't the standard, otherwise there would be no need to require most safety features, as the majority of cars never get into a major crash.If a car runs out of charge or malfunctions, it would help everyone if it is easier to move it so it doesn't block traffic. It might be wise to make this a requirement. Seems to me that a clutch that simply switches between connected and neutral and that only operates when the car isn't moving would be far simpler and cheaper than a clutch that handles shifting between different gears while the engine is turning.replydinom 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > don't have any clutches in the drivetrainWouldn't a clutch be unnecessary in this case... a complete disconnect from the drive train should suffice, no?replycaconym_ 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's exactly what a clutch does.

Most people don't need massive EV range all of the time, just when going on long trips. Being able to buy or rent an extra battery pack and throw it in the trunk, frunk, or back seats to add more range seems ideal for those cases.replyBizarroLand 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I've thought it would be great if there were rentable battery trailers that had an extra full charge or two built in, plus maybe some extra storage.uHaul could make a killing off of them for people who want to take their EV on a road trip. If you could get 600 miles off of a single combined full charge you would be in the range of reasonable American road trip distance, and you could make the choice to stop and eat and occupy two chargers to get another 480 miles or so out of a 30 minute stop.I usually clock about 900-1100 miles a day when I'm doing a destination road trip, so I would still chafe at that limit, but it would beat the heck out of sub-300 mile limits between long breaks for me.replykrisoft 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] But of course uHaul can’t do this without the full cooperation of the electric vehicle manufacturers. As a first order approximation of course there is nothing tricky about suplementing the power of a running EV, but on a practical level I would expect the firmware to throw a hissy fit if it does not expects this.Also, why a battery trailer? Why not a gas tank plus generator trailer?replymlyle 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Even with a smaller trailer, though, I'd expect a 33% or so range penalty-- it's just not too much of a win. You don't make it anywhere near twice as far.replyBizarroLand 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Even so, assuming there were a nationwide network of them, you could pull in, swap trailers, and be on your way in 15 minutes.Of course, this is in an ideal world where everything goes my way. I wonder if the penalty would be as high as 33%. Seems like it would be simple to make a maximally aerodynamic battery trailer since human comfort doesn't have to be considered. Then you're only adding the weight and drag of a few hundred lbs of trailer and battery.I would think the penalty would be in the high single digits or at most in the very low double digits which could be offset by having 1.5x or 2x normal battery capacity in the trailer.*Ninja edit, I decided to look this up. The Model Y's battery is 1700 lbs, so you are absolutely right that there would be a significant distance penalty adding that much weight to the vehicle plus the trailer weight and the battery armor as well if that isn't included in the weight.https://www.carparts.com/blog/how-heavy-is-a-tesla-battery/Curb weight of the Model Y is also 4400 lbs, so having to tow a 2500 lb trailer would be a significant hassle.Perhaps that could be offset by making the trailer smart and adding motors to it that the main brain could control through the power link. If it could push its own weight and it had a 1.5x battery, and if it also had regenerative braking, then it could get close to doubling the distance.Then again, each trailer would cost right about the same as a full vehicle, and would require an entire factory to be spun up to make them, and it would be an incredibly valuable product and therefore ripe for theft.Lots of negatives, not a lot of positives.It would be better all in all to be able to hot swap the batteries then. With standardized batteries put onto an integrated sled system, a robot at the fuel pump could pull the discharged battery and put it on a battery tester/charger and insert a fresh charged battery in its place.I guess that would be more like an oil change or system flush, but the advantages would be manifold. Batteries wouldn't be the weak spot in the system any longer. The likelihood of people keeping batteries until they degraded would be significantly reduced, problematic batteries could be identified and repaired or recycled before they erupted, and assuming that the system was in wide usage it could enable road trippers to stay on the road longer quicker and waste less daylight.Plus, for manufacturers, fuel stations, and mechanics, it would be an opportunity to make more money off of vehicle owners while providing safer, longer lasting vehicles to customers.It's probably still a post-scarcity pipe dream though.replymlyle 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > It would be better all in all to be able to hot swap the batteries then.

That was a US only implementation and as you know there is a work around. The other European feature that should be available in the USA is the ability to set when the REX starts to kick in.The USA requires the REX to kick in at 6% charge. The problem at that level is that the battery can't compensate during short high power drawls. There is a cheat code that enables the REX to kick in a 25% charge remaining. This seems to provide more on demand amperage but I'm not sure what is happening. Hills and wind have a larger effect on speed when off the REX. The REX is just a tiny motor that maintains the battery level but doesn't connect directly to the electric drive train.replybumby 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I'm curious if they recommend purging the tank (or using the gas) periodically?

Your last 10 drives consumption rate was 0.400 kWh/mi because its cold out.There's A LOT of smarter things the car can do than use its factory set 0.250 kWh/mi consumption to spit out the range on dashboard.Erring on the side of caution would also always be better, whereas it is erring on the side of showing the absolute best state that I as an individual never experienced in 4 years of ownership.replymoduspol 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's not erring on the side of the absolute best state. The EPA-rated miles represent a standardized mix of highway and city miles.The best state would be over 600 miles [1].It's erring on the side of consistency, as it's also representing the battery's state of charge. It would only serve to confuse users to try and guess whether the current trip is a highway or city drive, will end in the next minute or two hours from now, which way the wind will be blowing and whether or not you're driving uphill, etc. It'd just be a useless guess, instead of an at least consistent one.If you tell it where you're going, it already gives you a great estimate, as it doe stake into account all of those factors.[1] https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17405906/tesla-model-3-hy...replysteveBK123 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Look, I get it, some people love these cars and will stand no criticism, fine.

We are allowed to evaluate suggestions critically.The other places in the UI are either based on either the destination you've entered or the last 5, 15, or X miles driven. They only make sense in that context: Just using one of those numbers on the dashboard would be misleading and inconsistent.Guessing based on the Wh/m of your last ten drives might be a closer estimate, but would be wrong if your next drive isn't like your last ten. It might even be more accurate when guessing your last nine drives, so then you learn to trust it, but those were city miles, and for the next drive, it's highway miles. And now the estimate is way off.It's just meaningless. We'd quickly learn that the number given is a bad estimate that can't be trusted and needs to be adjusted based on the way you'll actually be driving and other real world conditions... and that's where we already are.

The range you got going to the store yesterday is not the range you will get driving to your friend’s house tomorrow.The car doesn’t know where you are going, whether it is city or highway driving, whether or not there is an elevation change, unless you tell it by navigating somewhere.It could take a guess, but that guess still has plenty of chances to be wrong if your next X miles of driving is not going to be similar to your previous X miles of driving.replysteveBK123 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Why should the car use an average .250 kWh/mi hardcoded rate on a car I have owned for 4 years when it knows my lifetime average is 0.300 kWh/mi?There's plenty of smarter things it can do by default other than \"its hard, meh\".They are gonna figure out how to do coast to coast self driving this year but can't project a reasonable battery range estimate given temperature/driver history/weather?

I just don’t think that’s clearly the “most accurate” option. Most accurate requires knowing where you are going.replysteveBK123 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So make it a menu option - range estimator: best/worst/spec.It feels like one of those Muskisms where one bending of the truth requires more and more stuff down the line.If they weren't over optimizing for the EPA test to give almost unachievable range, then they wouldn't need to have the car range meter lie as well.

It could show kWh, but that isn't good, either. What consumers actually care about is range, and whether that comes from more kWh, better aerodynamics, or a lighter car, the range is the bottom-line number. We wouldn't want consumers buying a car with a bigger battery just because it has more kWh if it doesn't get better range.I think EPA-rated miles is the best of available options--it just needs to be understood by consumers. And I think cases where it isn't are a bit overstated. I suspect very few consumers genuinely believe they'll get the same range in miles regardless of their driving speed, headwinds, or whether they're going uphill or downhill.replyblake929 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The article says it was a mandate from Elon Musk.

So if it's winter, it shows you less range because your last few drives had less efficiency. It's not always accurate (if there's, say, major temp fluctuations), but it's way more useful than what you're describing.To me, what you're describing is borderline dishonest marketing, and technically unnecessary.What I'd like to see is two numbers: estimated range as I've described, and beside it a kWh # (which I can guesstimate from the battery % gauge visual, but not precise).EDIT: Not sure why car manufacturers in general hide the kWh remaining-capacity of the battery so much. They seem to think consumers are too stupid to understand such technical terms?

How did you arrive at that conclusion. Even if the laws of thermodynamics and entropy took a holiday, and you recovered 100% of the energy when you brake, at best you would break even and not hurt your range (vs not braking aggressively).Regen breaking increases range over no regen braking, but braking aggressively will always be worse than not braking aggressively.replytialaramex 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No? Accelerating and decelerating are both lossy, and for the brief intervals when you're going faster you're also taking additional wind friction loss.Most EVs (including Tesla) do have regenerative braking, so some of your energy is converted back into electricity when you brake, but nowhere close to all of it, so people who have a smoother, less aggressive profile will get more range.Also if you brake really aggressively, you're dissipating more energy than can be successfully harvested and the rest is converted to heat, losing the energy you paid for and also increasing maintenance costs.replylotsofpulp 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I see, thanks for explaining!reply_jal 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Yep.

My PHEV works the same way, but that fact isn’t really relevant.The meter is presenting you the regeneration “rate” but what you’re thinking of is the regen rate integrated over time, I.e the amount of charge recovered during the process of stopping, which the meter is not showing you.replymartin8412 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Maybe, I don't really care about regenerative rate, I just notice my meter going to max when braking hard.

Kinetic energy is velocity^2, which means moving twice the speed takes 4X the energy. They probably can get the right estimate for a destination because it knows the speed limit for the route and using that as your velocity can give you a better answer.replytroymc 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] \"...moving twice the speed takes 4X the energy...\"That's not quite right. The power required to maintain a constant velocity v against a constant drag force of F is P = Fv. With air drag on a car moving at highway speeds, the drag force F actually depends on v: it's proportional to the square of v, i.e. F ~ v^2. All together then:P ~ v^3So doubling the speed will increase the required power by a factor of eight.replyooterness 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Power is energy power unit time.You are correct that power lost to aerodynamic drag increases with the cube of velocity. However, if you increase speed, the time spent is reduced. As a result, the total energy grows with velocity squared.replysebzim4500 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Aren't you agreeing with him?If the power is 8x higher and the speed is 2x higher then the energy per mile must be 4x higher, as he says.replybumby 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >They probably can get the right estimate for a destination because it knows the speed limitEven this is a massive over-simplification. Driving the same speed with a 20 mph headwind is going to take lot more energy than with a 20 mph tailwind for example. There's lots of other variables and they may be certainly tracking some (like A/C current draw) but I doubt they track others (like rolling friction or road conditions).Edit: I found this article [1] and it claims they track an impressive amount of weather and traffic data for the calculation.

Still seems like false advertising..replysteveBK123 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Having owned a Tesla and non-Tesla EV the approach to range is entirely different.Tesla - I literally never achieved the advertised range once. BMW - I exceed the advertised range during low-speed highway cruises in ideal summer conditions.Tesla - the range it shows me in car (not in nav) is the never-achievable EPA range. BMW - the range it shows me in car (not in nav) adjusts ride to ride based on efficiency on most recent trips. So in the depths of winter it's showing me something 20% lower than in the peak of summer. This means it's factoring in driver behavior, drive mode used, speed, and temperature effectively.It is reasonable to assume that your range on a trip is most similar to the range in your recent trips.I can get in my BMW, look at the range meter, guesstimate the range on arrival and be correct to within 1% 9 times out of 10.In my Tesla, I would constantly be doing mental math to discount the range it was showing me, to what I typically got, the weather, to see how big a delta it would be.Sure, the nav range in Tesla got smarter over time and factored things in.. but this doesn't help on long round trips. It might tell me that I'm going to reach my destination with X% left, but I now have to do mental math to figure out if I am going to make it back or not.With Tesla, I can't simply get in the car, see 300mi range on dash.. know I am making a trip 100mi each way so I'll be fine. Instead it's like - 300mi range, NAV says I'll have 58% remaining at destination.. OK so that means it's estimating X burn rate, which means I will make it home with... 17% instead of 33%.replycevn 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Exactly.

It may not accurately convey the distance available at the start of a trip but you're going to know well ahead of time if you're burn rate is too high. If the non-navigation distance estimate in a Tesla is always padded you could find out well after it's too late to make it to your destination or a charging station.replytshaddox 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I wonder if anyone has actually objectively measured accuracy of various car models under various driving patterns.

Funnily enough, the Tesla showed a large increase in energy use due to going up a slop, but otherwise is not affected by the drop in air density.replycrypot 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It is false advertising.FTA: Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging “false/exaggerated advertising.”replytekla 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Linkreplycrypot 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You just have to click the title of the thread and it will take you to the Reuters article and you will be able to read the entire story.replyrtkwe 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] KE is not 4x the energy continuously used though that's 4x the energy spent getting to that speed.

Every time I fill it up, it says I have 400 miles of range, then by the time I've driven about 300 miles, I've only got a few miles of range left.Interestingly the accuracy seems to get a lot better by the time I'm down to half a tank. I don't know if it's a sensor issue, or maybe my driving habits just change a lot when I have a full tank versus when I'm running low.The type of driving and time I'm driving can also make a huge difference to my trip MPG - some trips I average about 10MPG, others closer to 40MPG. Generally speaking, low speed but clear rural roads get the best, followed by motorway, followed by pootering around the city. The absolute worst mileage is during the winter, when I might only be driving lots of short trips around town on a very cold engine, with the headlights on, in the rain. In that case, I might only get around 200 miles out of a tank.Anyway, my point is that knowing the specifics of this trip's fuel consumption is a much easier problem than knowing how many miles it'll be until you next need to refuel.replywnissen 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yes, my Mazda does the same. It will happily report a 450 mile (725 km) range on my 13.2 gallon / 50 L tank, when I have never gotten more than 380 miles. Sometimes much less. To be fair, if you cruised slightly above the speed limit on the highway in fair conditions and drove it to truly empty, I think you would actually get that. But the gauge reads empty when there is easily 1.5 gal / 5.7 L in the tank, so in practice there is no way you're going to get the stated range.However, the key difference is that my gas car can be filled up anywhere, and worst case I'd need to get a gas can.

I drove a RWD Long Range Model 3 for 4.5 years. Absolutely loved everything about it. But the range was no where near 310 miles like stated. But I couldn’t have really cared less once I knew that fact. The few times a year I needed more than 200 miles, I used superchargers on my route just like I would if I had 250-300 and had to wait an extra 2 minutes at the charger. I averaged ~300-325 wh/m going 80-90mph on the highway (wind speed/direction obviously makes a big difference). 75kwh battery. 230 mile range. Every other day was charge to 80%, incredibly convenient to never think about it or gas and have more torque, speed than any other car you’re around. And low to no maintenance.I now own a Long Range Model X. It is MUCH closer to the EPA mileage. I average ~330wh/m but I have a 100kwh battery, so much closer to a legitimate 300 mile range.

It's misleading because miles don't map directly onto battery charge. The range that that indicates is miles on flat level ground with no wind at 55mph which you will never experience in real life. At 80mph you're going to get 2/3 of that range every time. At 35mph you can get significantly higher range, but no one is ever going to drive 300+ miles at 35mph. If you just tap on the range icon it will change to percent, which is less misleading.

We live in Ohio and so I have actually done long drives like that to go to remote places to go camping. (There are, surprisingly, both L2 and fast chargers around in rural Ohio but you definitely need an app and need to check ahead of time.)Speed matters because air resistance increases exponentially with speed, not linearly.

It is undesirable and illegal to drive down the mountain at 200mph, so you must reduce your speed.Mechanical brakes do this by converting that energy to heat and brake dust.Regen brakes do that by converting around 70% of that energy into battery storage to be used later.Your sack likely does not roll down the hill with zero losses to friction along the way. The sack has the same energy as it did before you moved it, but it does not mean the journey consumed net zero energy.replyCorrectHorseBat 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Without any resistance or breaking you are correct, but in real life you do have to break.

It totally sucks and is definitely the worst $10K I've ever spent on anything. That money could have gone to a nice vacation somewhere and I would be happy about that. But no, every time I try out the FSD, I come away disappointed.replypilingual 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] What was your thought process when you spent $10,000 on \"FSD?\"replyLendal 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I thought it would be cool. I didn't consider the fact I don't actually like it when someone else is driving. I don't like being a passenger even if a person I trust is driving, so why would an AI be different? Apparently I like to drive more than I thought I did.Also, I didn't realize how many restrictions there would be. You have to keep your hands applying constant tension on the steering wheel, and there's actually a camera that watches your eyes now. So you can't even eat a sandwich without the car freaking out and punishing you for looking at your food too long.replyaydyn 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can just play games on your phone, or take a quick power nap (don't forget to set a timer!)It's awesome!replybsagdiyev 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Get the fuck off the road with that attitude.

The range was a total fabrication - actual range for city driving was closer to 180 miles, not the claimed 300+. Complete sham.replysamwillis 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The solution is to not show miles on the basic battery meter, just percentage. Maybe show a rage next to it - 130-160 miles. But that too honest.ICE cars all show a percentage, and maybe additionally a mileage on newer cars. The fact that they threw that away is a little silly.replyjotux 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >The fact that they threw that away is a little silly.You state this as a fact, but it's completely incorrect. It has been an option since at least 2018 to change the indicator to percentage.replytshaddox 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I also prefer the battery meter to show percentage simply to reduce range anxiety. Even if the mileage estimate was accurate, I’d rather not constantly be calculating how many miles I think I might need to drive before the next charge.replysib 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If you tap the miles indicator, it changes to percent.replyKingOfCoders 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] \"I hate almost everything about it.\"Not owning a car only using rentals, I still think Tesla has the best and most intuitive UI. I can find everything easily, whereas in a SUVs from Skoda/VW/Audi/BMW/Renault/... it's hard to find things - at least for me.What I do hate about the Model Ys we rented is the noise! Wind/wheel noise is as loud at 100km/h as a BMW at 150km/h - I guess they do this to safe weight and increase range, but it makes the trips very unpleasant.Also how it randomly breaks in self driving (at least on a German Autobahn).replycroes 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] >the best and most intuitive UII think the best UI was before all the computer displays in cars. Everything operable without visual contact.replyrurp 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Plus consistency. The last time I drove a friend's tesla we spent a stupid amount of time sitting in the driveway trying to make a simple adjustment. The UX had changed and neither of us could find the option in the touchscreen menus. Even pulling out my phone and searching Tesla's documentation didn't work because it was out of date and wrong.replyKingOfCoders 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I disagree. Because we seldom have the same car twice, I always need to decipher some strange icons to find out what something does. Or how to operate the wipers. It might work better if you know it b/c of tactile feedback, but it's in no way intuitive.replycroes 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The icons problem isn't any different now, but now the icons are hidden in different sub menus.All that without the benefit of tactile feedback of knobs and switches.replyethanbond 13 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I guess they to this to safe weight and increase range, but it makes the trips very unpleasant.Or, you know, margins.replywaffletower 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I find the range numbers on my Model Y to be fairly accurate, when I choose and am able to drive at optimal speeds on level ground (which is the situation on some trips). 60-65 MPH is the commonly sighted range for the dual motor Model Y. The range does attempt to factor in heat pump usage, and I am unclear how accurate those adjustments are.replybreakyerself 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think the range is inflated, but I can get close to it by driving like an absolute grandpa. I think it's possible, but not realistic.replymmustapic 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It is true that it's very accurate. I was on a trip that predicted 22% battery on arrival, and I had 21%. The last 5-10km were mostly descending down a valley, so lot of regeneration. Thus, when I arrived, 22%, as predicted.replynunez 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] It's the same problem as displaying the battery percentage on your phone. you're more inclined to look at it, and will be more anxious when that number drops.I wish Tesla would allow you to hide the battery percentage entirely (unless it drops below a threshold).reply14u2c 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Huh? Do you constantly stare at a car gas gauge too? Battery level is important information for planning your usage, with both phones and cars.replywilg 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I recommend tapping the battery meter to put it into percent instead of EPA miles (useless, misleading) and only estimate range using the trip planner, which is usually quite good.replyyayitswei 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This has been my experience as well. When there's a disparity, the Energy app gives additional details why the estimate was wrong (driving speed, climate control, etc).replyhuijzer 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > I have a model Y.

Don't waste your money on the FSD option, and you're fine. It's an expensive car that's super cheap to drive. The motors are basically zero maintenance. The battery will likely last the rest of my life. The interior is not too luxurious but decent. The seats are surprisingly durable and comfortable.

This is similar to how we ended up with strict rules on MPG when purchasing.replyconcordDance 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > It'll display a the battery in miles, but it's at least 25% inflated.Worth noting this is also common in ICE cars. Mine has it.replykoolba 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] What does the regular display claim to represent?Coasting on a flat surface at 35mph with a positive tailwind?replynewZWhoDis 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This is not a hard concept, and it’s rather surprising that this of all things is what you have issue with.The battery icon is Miles of rated range, where “rated” means flat windless road at 60MPH and 70 degrees. Call it “standard” range if you will. The car has no idea where you’re going so it uses the standard calculation.When you set a destination it can now (and does) factor in elevation change, speed on given roads, wind speed, wind direction, temperature along the route, etc etc etc and is more accurate.So your least favorite feature is one you openly admit to not using properly? If you want laser precise range estimation set a destination ffs. Or, if you’re like most drivers you start every day with 200-300mi of range and unless you’re going out of state you don’t even think about range.replydubeye 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] The obvious question is why don't you sell the car if you hate everything about it.Sunk cost and all thatreply01100011 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Rented a MY a couple months ago and was surprised how much I, and more surprisingly, my wife, hated it. Now, I despise Elon and the risky safety decisions of Tesla engineers, so I'm biased, but I wanted to give them a shot.Range was horrible. We drove about 100 miles and spent a couple hours over several sessions at superchargers. The handling and turning radius sucked. The controls were frighteningly distracting and confusing. Sound in the cabin seemed very weird, probably due to the glass roof and noise cancelling system. Finally, for a dual motor, I expected a lot more acceleration. I drove a Chevy Bolt for a year and was surprised how heavy and sluggish the MY felt.replyconcordDance 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > We drove about 100 miles and spent a couple hours over several sessions at superchargersHonestly I don't believe this. Requiring two hours sessions in 100 miles is an absolutely extraordinary claim, requiring something to be extremely wrong with the car in some way that didnt brick it entirely.replyjayd16 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You drive 100 miles and spent hours charging? That makes no sense. We're you towing something?reply01100011 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Exactly. Nope, no towing. Drove about half those miles and spent about 45 minutes at a supercharger, then drove another 35 or so and spent a little over an hour at another one. In the second case I was trying to get to 90% so I could return the car above the 72% I picked it up at.We ran the A/C most of the time. I was driving pretty conservatively with about 50/50 highway/city streets. I did try to show off the acceleration abilities once but didn't fully floor it. It's possible that, being a rental(although fairly new) the battery had taken some charging abuse.replydzhiurgis 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] 1h45m at supercharger, depending on charging curve, should result in 200-300 miles. So maybe you were just queueing at supercharger or something else doesn't check out at all.reply01100011 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Queueing? Would the supercharger limit my charging time for some reason? I drove right up to an open charger every time, so I wasn't waiting in line.replydzhiurgis 1 hour ago | root | parent | next [–] Assuming rather low 50kW charge rate thats at least 87.5kWh of energy. Thats 500km of highway range. Assuming more average 75kW rate - 130kwh or almost 900kms. And you are claiming you done this in one day?reply 311 more comments...",

Is it mostly because of synchronous/asynchronous needs or there is something else such as latency or even ease of implementation?replyozarker 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] Depends on your use case. Queueing messages enables the competing consumer flow which implicitly allows load-leveling which is great if your traffic is spiky and you need a little time to auto-scale or other scenarios like that. If you’re just looking to blast out data to all consumers or just load-balancing is fine, approaches like yours are probably better.replypravus 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] If your workers can hop onto the next task without having to reach out for any additional state or report back to anything synchronously a distributed log/spool/queue/broker works well.If you need light-weight reporting like a status code you can use RPC/reply mechanisms if the broker supports it (e.g. rabbitmq), build your own (custom headers), or use an API/gRPC call.Everything else starts needing some sort of more sophisticated coordination mechanism and gRPC will look attractive for that although there are usually other options as well.replyimachine1980_ 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] grpc client a -> grpc server a for client a grpc client b -> grpc server a for client bgrpc client a -> message broker(implemen a) -->grpc client b -> message broker(implemen b) -->message broker-> your app for the broker this make sense if dont make sense manage the quque in your app if ypu want to abstract the implementations is worth if you have n to 1 or n to n and all works differentreplyinsanitybit 10 hours ago | prev | next [–] > Supports a unique multi-hop network topology leading to a distribution tree for each queue, thereby leading to network bandwidth savings for certain use cases.This is very interesting. One of the benefits of Kafka is partition routing so I'm curious to learn how this may compare.replySparkyte 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] No idea, but I am interested too. One of the reasons this was probably created was because of a network constrained environment where data is expensive in more than one way.Cloud Providers can be expensive.replyWJW 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Bloomberg (who built this) operate a system that makes money by transmitting the same data to a huge amount of clients. Having one server transmit the same piece of information to a million client is approximately 500 times slower than having one server transmit it to 1000 proxies who each pass it on to 1000 end users.replypclmulqdq 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] The actual architecture of most of these systems in finance relies heavily on UDP multicast, which is a technology that big tech has basically forgotten because it can be tough to administer at large scale.Multicast puts the entire load of distributing the data in its natural place: the network. The pub/sub queues that the rest of the world uses are more complicated and a lot worse.This appears to be the beginning of a \"cloud-native\" bloomberg that can't lean on multicast.replyTurskarama 26 minutes ago | root | parent | next [–] UDP Multicast relies on constantly throwing out the entire state of your system in order to be reliable, whereas with TCP you only need to throw out changes. This is fine in finance because the state is changing constantly anyway so you might as well just continually throw out the multicast traffic.Message queuing is a more complicated system, but it allows you to push the bulk of your work out to the distributed network instead of concentrating it on the producer.replycgio 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Keep in mind Bloomberg works with a few “cloud native “ consumers. In that context it may make more sense.replyeric-hu 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > Cloud Providers can be expensive.Do you have a story around this? If so, would love to hear more about it.replylelandbatey 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Specifically, egress from Cloud Providers (transmitting data from inside the cloud to a computer outside the cloud) is the usual culprit for being \"very expensive\". It's part of a pricing strategy by cloud providers that encourages folks to put all their infrastructure inside of the cloud and to have none of it outside the cloud. As one example of the ink spilled over this topic, see this discussion from 2 years ago about AWS's very high egress fees:Article \"AWS’s Egregious Egress\" (2021) https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27930151replybeyonddream 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ingress can also be costly especially if there is a steady state of high load traffic sent from on-prem machines to machines inside cloud (not sure about aws but have experienced this with azure where we had to resort to buy their expressroute which was very costly and ultimately unsustainable for us)replyitscodingtime 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Can anyone give an example in which there would be less network bandwidth?

Build the visual content in an SVG with Inkscape. It should be easy for you to build the layout with assets/item to animate. Don't forget to group items and set names so you can reference them later.2. Once exported, insert the SVG in an HTML page and add anime.js. This library will let you animate the content you just created (you should be able to reference your named items from Inkscape and animate them).

Looking at it the other way, you go from having problems when 2/3 are slow/broken to having problems when 2/4 are slow/broken. (also note slow doesn't even mean the machine is having problems; in geographically distributed setups it may just be due to physical distance from the leader.)Yes, 4 servers might handle more load than 3 servers [1], but so would 5 servers. I'd guess that if you've got enough message queue traffic that 3 servers can't handle the load, those servers aren't a significant fraction of your total cost. You might as well go to 5. Likewise, if 5 aren't enough, I'd skip over 6 and go to 7. If 7 aren't enough...I'd probably rethink my design entirely...but I'd prefer 9 to 8.Alternatively, quorum systems can support \"zero-weight replicas\" which effectively don't vote but still can be useful for eventually consistent reads. Then you have this server that helps handle the load but doesn't increase the number of servers that have to participate in a round.[1] if the load is overwhelmingly eventually consistent read operations and their multi-hop topology with proxies doesn't sufficiently reduce the load on the replicas. It's not obvious to me if this scenario is plausible or not.replynine_zeros 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Agreed.

What a treat.replyfavflam 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] From the \"leadership election\" snippet, this setup looks perilously close to the peer to peer propagation of transactions and blocks in a blockchain system such as Solana. I suppose the latency requirements are much tighter than 400ms though.I know Solana does mutual TLS over QUIC authentication between peers and does bandwidth rate limiting via stake. Also, the topology is self organizing. Is it worth copying this tech into a message queue system?replymkl95 10 hours ago | prev | next [–] How does it compare to NATS.io?replyleetharris 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] It is amazing to me that NATS.io is not more popular. It is so much better than Kafka, extremely simple, and extremely light.replyklabb3 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Same here! I don’t get it. It’s much more lightweight, fully FOSS and their custodian company (Synadia) is very friendly and open to self-hosting. Basically, they run a global super-cluster of Nats which is pretty much vanilla afaik.My main gripe is lack of “best practices”. You’re pretty much on your own when it comes to important decisions like subject namespacing and some operational stuff can be a bit tricky, like changing options and migrating. They had “nats by example” but that seems to be quite out of date and not super helpful. They have started doing more videos which are great but not that much content overall.Their auth story is very sophisticated but perhaps a bit over-engineered. Some use cases like having anonymous “self-signed” client keys are tricky to work with.Other than that, it’s an amazing piece of tech. One that is scalable in a way that just makes sense and gets out of the way when multiple machines are involved.replyslantedview 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Nats is simple because it doesn't bother addressing some of the scalability problems that Kafka was designed to address, like clustering with partitions:https://docs.nats.io/legacy/stan/intro/partitioningreplycoder543 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You linked to NATS Streaming, which has been deprecated for years. It’s not relevant. It can still be used for legacy code that still needs it, as the URL even shows, but it is not recommended for new applications.The current standard is NATS JetStream, which absolutely addresses scalability, arguably to an even larger degree than Kafka, since it can be used to create a globally interconnected supercluster of clusters where messages can be configured to flow between regions as needed. I doubt anyone would run a Kafka cluster that spans multiple regions.replyeska 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] I checked the docs, but couldn’t find anything about mqtt compat?replym00x 2 hours ago | parent | next [–] I don't think this is an MQTT broker.replyglonq 9 hours ago | prev | next [–] Are they working on other API's besides Java and C++?replycallbacker 8 hours ago | parent | next [–] Hi, one of the authors here.

Shops that have embrace this philosophy have been some of the most inefficient ones I've ever encountered. Screens of yaml code was written to implement tasks that could have been performed with lines of programming code; and many man-years were spent implementing functions that copied fields from one object to another nearly but not quite identical object.It's a big driver of both complex and slow software. Often the adaptation layer necessary to get it to actually satisfy your needs rivals the size and complexity of the piece of existing solution code you're trying to leverage.Software that is built from the ground-up to your exact needs is often both faster and slimmer and more maintainable and suffers from far less dependency churn.replyecshafer 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There is a balance to Not In House syndrome where you build everything yourself, and the opposite: everything should be vendored in.

Things like writing another queue system will have zero impact on the industry unless it's adopted widely (and cargo culted) and later made worse.Maybe I'm about to eat my shoe, but if a capable of team at Bloomberg wanted to reinvent something considered unnecessary in terms of industry need, they probably could if for no other reason that management allowing some indulgence in exchange for keeping talented people around is Worth It™.replyScubabear68 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Bloomberg had a history of inventing their own stuff going back to the first terminals.

At any rate, it is absolutely more fun to build from scratch.I've polled developers about what part of software development they hate, and in general, it's deployment and maintenance (ie: devops).

It is by no means exhaustive and deliberately avoids any formal specification or proof. Readers looking for an exhaustive explanation should refer to the Raft paper, which acts as a strong inspiration for BlazingMQ’s leader election algorithm.So their own homegrown leader election algorithm?> BlazingMQ’s leader election and state machine replication differs from that of Raft in one way: in Rafts leader election, only the node having the most up-to-date log can become the leader. If a follower receives an election proposal from a node with stale view of the log, it will not support it. This ensures that the elected leader has up-to-date messages in the replicated stream, and simply needs to sync up any followers which are not up to date. A good thing about this choice is that messages always flow from leader to follower nodes.> BlazingMQ’s elector implementation relaxes this requirement. Any node in the cluster can become a leader, irrespective of its position in the log. This adds additional complexity in that a new leader needs to synchronize its state with the followers and that a follower node may need to send messages to the new leader if the latter is not up to date. However, this deviation from Raft and the custom synchronization protocol comes in handy because it allows BlazingMQ to avoid flushing (fsync) every message to disk. Readers familiar with Apache Kafka internals will see similarities between the two systems here.\"a new leader needs to synchronize its state with the followers and that a follower node may need to send messages to the new leader if the latter is not up to date\". I thought a hallmark of HA systems was fast failover?

I'm a little embarassed I didn't remember it until now, but I think the general term is \"application security.\"I'm concerned that I don't see any hints of either in the project.

That is the sort of stuff I was asking about.It looks like it's an after thought but at least on their mind now, which is very fair with respect to Bloomberg's wants/needs. It'd be nice if they had a bit of a warning about using this until it has some basic auth(n) and TLS since they're releasing it to the public.

Systems of this sort are best secured at the network level, i.e. only trusted hosts should be able to connect to it. Redis is a good example of where this has been tried: it does support password based log in, but the password is stored and transmitted in plaintext, and a redis server will happily accept thousands of auth attempts per second making brute forcing a viable attack. Rather than improve the auth system Redis has instead doubled down on encouraging appropriate network level security by defaulting to only being accessible to the local host, so admins have to go through an explicit step (with warnings) before they can just expose it to the internet.replyljm 3 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > I think it is, relativley speaking, rude to release insecure networked softwareAnd if you believe that, you're wrongreplyrewmie 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > Is this implemented with any sort of thought to security?There's a hefty load of cargo cult mentality revolving the topic of security.

It's not even that hard to achieve, compared to the learning curve of the borrow checker.Once rust gets plugged into Why3 and gets some industrial-grade proof capacity, the question of 'is it written in rust?' will be automatic (as in 'why would you do it any other way?').replymikepurvis 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rust's guarantees are all about what's happening inside your own process with memory ownership. \"Security\" in the context of a middleware like this is almost certainly more about external validation/auth— what prevents some random node from injecting messages into the queue, or adding itself as a subscriber to the output?Also, it's a super bad-faith argument to talk about an entire program being in an unsafe block. Rust's unsafe is about specifically and intentionally opting out of certain guardrails in a limited scope of code where it should be fairly easy for a human reviewer to understand and validate the more complex invariants that aren't enforceable by the compiler itself.replytetrep 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I care more about methodology than specific methods.

But that hasn’t been the case for a long time (arguably we have the opposite problem - there are so many ways of doing it: Conan, vcpkg, bazel, spack, raw cmake, nix, etc)So what would the pros and cons be today and why is it a selling point?For instance, a pro is that everything is bespoke to the task at hand, no hammering square pegs into round holes designed for a slightly different use case.A con is that the entire attack surface is managed by one team. CVEs identified and solved on another project is a pretty good thing when you depend on that project.The main reason I’m surprised, though, is that there are some no-brainer dependencies these days. Fmt, catch2/gtest, metaprogramming libraries, etc.replycallbacker 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] Hi, one of the authors here. BlazingMQ depends on two other open source C++ libraries: https://github.com/bloomberg/bde and https://github.com/bloomberg/ntf-core.

I'm thinking about framework from the wrong angle.I can definitely see why that's a bonus. So many data pipeline tools, but so many written in Java.

Perhaps I'll check this out...replypravus 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > So what would the pros and cons be today and why is it a selling point?I'm not saying they pulled it off because I would need to evaluate it, but having your own dependency stack can result in a much more streamlined solution for extra performance since you don't have to compromise to someone else's data model. As this is a high speed message bus, it's entirely appropriate.These are also basically application-level network routers which really don't need huge levels of dependencies so to be honest I'd be running away from anything that claims it's written using 1000s of the newest, latest and greatest whatevers. Churning out a faster string grinder is what I'm looking for.replyomeid2 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sending patches to fix a project is hard work, sending patches to fix issues in a projects' upstream projects is even harder.This alone is an important point to avoid dependencies, specially if you're anything like Bloomberg.replyi-use-nixos-btw 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I run into that problem a lot, to be fair.Though my approach is to fork and maintain the fork until my PR is accepted, merged, and in a tagged release.Another is to apply a diff to the dependency within the build system, which is what I do a lot in Nix (mainly to solve cmake issues on hermetic builds).Either way, it isn't unsurmountable. It doesn't really matter so much if it's used as an executable rather than as a library, though in the case of the latter it's really handy to be able to e.g. pass a custom spdlog sink for logging.replydavidkunz 10 hours ago | prev | next [–] It's called BlazingMQ but not written in Rust?!replygabereiser 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] I’ll admit, I went into their repo expecting to find Rust, or at the very least go.

Queueing things is literally the opposite of making things fast.You likely need to read about message queues, why they are used, and why they have performance constraints. Message queues are a system, and the system to maintain those queues and content has an overhead. The project is building a solution that is higher performing than comparable systems.Queuing things often makes things faster (!) as you are usually dealing with limited resources (ex: web and job workers) and need to operate on other systems (ex: payments) that have their own distinct capacity.If you have 1000 web workers, and your upstream payment provider supports 10 payments per minute, you'll quickly have timeouts and other issues with 1000 web workers trying to process payments. Your site won't process anything else while waiting for the payment provider if all web workers are doing this task.A queue will let you process 1000 web requests, and trickle 10 requests to your payment provider. At some point that queue will fill, but that's a separate issue.Meanwhile, your 1000 web workers are free to process the next requests (ex: your homepage news feed).replygdy 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] \"At some point that queue will fill, but that's a separate issue\"Would you recommend something to read about that?replymasom 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a bit difficult to cover as it is highly dependent on the queue system you use.You'd usually want your queue system to fail the enqueue if it is full, and you'd want monitoring to ensure the queue isn't growing at an unsustainable rate.It also forces you to think a bit about your message payload (rich data or foreign keys the worker loads).RabbitMQ, Redis-based queues (ex: ActiveJob or sidekiq), Gearman, and others will all offer different mechanisms to tackle full queues.replyinsanitybit 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think there's two really obvious points.1. They're referring to the queueing itself. They're not saying \"this will make some other thing fast\" they're saying \"this is fast at queueing\".2. Queuing is not the opposite of making things fast.replytherealdrag0 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You’re misunderstanding the discussion. If you think of queuing as “waiting to process” then yes it’s slower than not waiting. But that’s not at all the necessary implication of these components. In fact “synchronous” requests are buffered (queued?) internally and can be delayed before processing. So the distinction is irrelevant to performance. And the implementation is what matters.replyLoganDark 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Queueing things can result in better throughput because you don't have to wait for the other side to process your last message before you can begin work on the next one.replyjeffbee 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's just buffering. A lot of people use Kafka this way, as an impedance adapter for a producer with an internal architecture that can't tolerate blocking on production. Of course this requires you to unrealistically assume that Kafka is a zero-impedance message sink.But what I think the other post is alluding to is the fact that in-order delivery is often not a requirement, and can be an anti-feature. I know that in every use of Kafka I have personally encountered the relative order of messages was quite irrelevant but the in-order implementation of Kafka converts the inability to process a single record into an emergency.replytherealdrag0 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There’s a lot of brokers without ordering guarantees.

Popularized in England, these wavy walls actually use less bricks than a straight wall because they can be made just one brick thin, while a straight wall—without buttresses—would easily topple over.According to Wikipedia, these wavy walls are also known as: crinkle crankle walls, crinkum crankum walls, serpentine walls, or ribbon walls. The alternate convex and concave curves in the wall provide stability and help it to resist lateral forces. [source]The county of Suffolk seems to be home to countless examples of these crinkle crankle walls. On freston.net you can find 100 wavy walls that have been documented and photographed. In the United States, the best known serpentine wall can be found at the University of Virginia where Thomas Jefferson incorporated the wavy walls into the architecture. Although some authorities claim that Jefferson invented this design, he was merely adapting a well-established English style of construction. [source]As for the mathematics behind these serpentine walls and why the waves make them more resistant to horizontal forces like wind vs straight walls, check out this post by John D.

You can also use smaller logs you’d otherwise ignore or use for firewood due to low yield when sawing.For that matter, you don’t have to worry about milling, joinery, or bringing enough nails to fasten boards. You can also use green wood without any worries. All you have to do is stack.In a world without power tools, the split-rail fence really was an ingenious design.

That's a significant feature of a wall to some people, so I don't think it's fair to dismiss the utility of that by suggesting that it's simply \"less bricks for comparable strength,\" it's \"less bricks for a freestanding wall.\"If you want a freestanding brick wall, this seems to be the \"ideal\" way to do it, assuming you have the space required for the wave.

Or is it just stronger than the single layer wall?Without knowing anything about the subject matter, I’d assume that the strength goes in order of single-layer straight, wavy, double-layer straight. No? Seems like needing just the amount of strength the wavy wall provides, and no more, would be a fairly rare use case. Leading to double-layer straights most of the time anyway.replyhorsawlarway 13 hours ago | parent | next [–] The wavy design is probably just as strong as the double layer (possibly stronger depending on the direction of force).The issue with a single layer wall isn't really the strength between bricks, or the bricks themselves - it's that a single layer wall has a very narrow base and is subject to tipping over.The wave in the design makes the base of the wall act is if it were MUCH wider, preventing the tipping action of a single layer.So the wavy design is only as strong as single layer of bricks, but it has a base 2 to 3 times the width of even the double layer wall designs. It will be much more resistant to tipping forces, but less resistant to impact forces.The thing about most walls is they aren't really load bearing - they just delineate owned space - so the wavy design is great for large properties. Much less great if it's a tiny space and you're losing a good chunk of sqft to the wave.replyke88y 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Additionally: you need the wall to be \"stable enough\", not \"equally as stable as a double-layer base\".

Thinking of it as a point moving along the path through time, it will dwell and the peaks, and cruise through he centre. The contribution of each brick to wall stiffness will be related to the cube of the distance from the centre line (neutral axis), so more 'time' spent at the peaks is best. This holds true on the macro scale, but could vary on the scale of a half 'wavelength' as the lack of inversion of curvature could be beneficial there.Everything moderately reasonable seems to be better than a straight line in this instance. In the limit, two much thinner walls, far apart, is the optimal solution, but that becomes unreasonable as those walls must be coupled together to provide strength.replybadcppdev 7 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think you're asking if a series of arcs is stronger than a wavy line. It's a great question and I think the answer to that would require a full model of the two walls to calculate all the stresses, etc. But I think it would also depend on the question of \"stronger against what?\" A pushing force but at what point and at what angle.

If you save on bricks, you save on labor.If that was your point, sorry for misreading you.In the era in which these were commonly used, bricks were largely made on-site or very nearby. So you saved on labor twice - once to make the bricks, and again to place them.replypfdietz 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I was thinking of a comment in the John Cook link, where someone was saying these are fiddly to build compared to a conventional brick wall.replydevilbunny 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They're certainly fiddly to plan out compared to a straight wall (where all you need is a long piece of twine anchored at each end), but I assume that those building them use some kind of forms to help keep the angles correct.replyetskinner 13 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] There's actually a similar concept in 3D printing called gyroid infill, it's essentially a 3D version of the wavy wall:https://www.wevolver.com/article/understanding-the-gyroid-in...replyjolt42 13 hours ago | prev | next [–] Has someone figured out the ideal frequency / amplitude of the wave?

Then to make a wall of length L with bricks of l length, we need piL/l number of bricks.

At no point does the wall have an angle over 45 degrees, so a semi-circle which would be at a 90 degree angle for every inflection point seems way too wavy.A sine wave is probably closer, which would give an arc length of sqrt(1+cos(2pix/L)^2).

Since the wave exists to prevent the wall from toppling, a pure sine is probably overkill.So I guess a factor then will be how tall your wall is.

all I can say is that since I haven't seen reports of any widespread EC2 issues at the same time, it was most likely just an isolated hardware fault.Tarsnap's monitoring systems detected the failure at 2023-07-02 13:10 UTC (I have monitoring writing/reading/deleting archives every 5 minutes from a different EC2 region) and alerted me.(The text message at 13:10 UTC didn't wake me up, but the phone call at 13:15 UTC did.)My initial investigation didn't reveal any clearly transient errors so I assumed the system was dead and started spinning up a replacement EC2 instance.At approximately 2023-07-02 13:52 UTC (45 minutes after the initial outage) Amazon restarted the failed server on a new EC2 instance; this brought up the operating system (FreeBSD) but did not restart the Tarsnap server code since I don't have the system configured to start that automatically -- if anything causes the system to unexpectedly reboot, I want to check things over before any tarsnap traffic gets handled, since \"preventing data loss if something breaks\" is far more important than \"maximize service availability\".The server logs after rebooting showed filesystem corruption; it's clear that whatever took the system offline either killed the hardware or severed it from the Elastic Block Store which holds its filesystems.I decided to continue with setting up a new server rather than attempting to recover the old one.The Tarsnap service stores data in Amazon S3 as a log-structured filesystem with each S3 object consisting of a header with metadata for all of the log entries, followed by (optionally) data for the log entries.For example, a \"start write transaction\" log entry has a header identifying the machine and transaction nonce but has no log data, while a \"store data block\" log entry has a header identifying the machine and block name, along with the block data.Under normal conditions, the log entry metadata is also cached in EC2 and is never read from Amazon S3; the only reads from Amazon S3 are to read block data in response to requests from the tarsnap client.The process of recovering the EC2 instance state consists of two steps: First, reading all of the metadata headers from S3; and second, \"replaying\" all of those operations locally.(These cannot be performed at the same time, since the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are \"rewritten\" to free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)The first step proceeded without incident, completing at 2023-07-03 01:49:49 UTC.In hindsight it probably could have been faster: I had the recovery process configured to make 250 simultaneous requests to Amazon S3 because that is what Amazon S3 could sustain a decade ago, but I suspect that this could be significantly increased now.The second step failed almost immediately, with an error telling me that a replayed log entry was recording data belonging to a machine which didn't exist.This provoked some head-scratching until I realized that this was introduced by some code I wrote in 2014: Occasionally Tarsnap users need to move a machine between accounts, and I handle this storing a new \"machine registration\" log entry and deleting the previous one.Unfortunately while I had tests for this, I never tested regenerating the server state after a machine is \"re-owned\" *while having data stored* -- and since the new machine \"registration\" log entry has a higher sequence number, the server was quite right in objecting that data was stored belonging to a machine which didn't exist... yet.Once I figured out what was going on, I disabled that \"seatbelt\" and resumed the state reconstruction process.It then failed again almost immediately complaining that it couldn't find data in Amazon S3, because my attempt at \"resuming\" the process involved skipping the downloading-data-from-S3 step and thereby left a \"maximum log entry sequence number\" value uninitialized (and therefore set to zero).A short time later I had that fixed and the state reconstruction process continued properly.This process was also somewhat slower than it should have been; had I realized that it was disk throughput bound I would have configured the relevant EBS volume for higher throughput.Unfortunately by this point I was quite sleep deprived so I wasn't monitoring the process closely -- otherwise I would have noticed this (in both gstat(8) and Amazon CloudWatch) and reconfigured the EBS volume.By about 2023-07-03 15:10 UTC (I didn't record the exact time) the state reconstruction process had completed.I ran some quick tests with the server in read-only mode and compared against the old server state (to make sure that things matched up aside from the old server's filesystem having lost the last few seconds of data when the server failed), and then I brought it online. The first live post-outage traffic was at 2023-07-03 15:25:58 UTC, roughly 26 hours and 16 minutes after the outage started.Following my ill-defined \"Tarsnap doesn't have an SLA but I'll give people credits for outages when it seems fair\" policy, on 2023-07-13 (after some dust settled and I caught up on some sleep) I credited everyone's Tarsnap accounts with 50% of a month's storage costs.As always, feel free to email me if you have any questions.-- Colin Percival FreeBSD Deputy Release Engineer & EC2 platform maintainer Founder, Tarsnap | www.tarsnap.com | Online backups for the truly paranoid Attachment: OpenPGP_signature Description: OpenPGP digital signaturePrev by Date: Tarsnap is back online Previous by thread: Tarsnap outage 2023-07-02 Index(es): Date Thread",

I'm glad you're clear about no SLA, but this seems like a big liability between me and my backups.replyivanhoe 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's a pretty well-known fact for years that tarsnap is basically a one-man show, and yet Colin has managed to provide fantastic service so far. Sometimes having ppl who built the service also managing it is actually a big plus, compared to other services where you first have to fight through outsourced & underpaid support that's limited to template answers, only to finally get some \"engineer\" who got that job 2 months ago and is more clueless on their system than myself...replystouset 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] And to be frank, I've seen plenty of mission-critical services at $bigco which may have had a team of engineers working on them, but the core functionality was maintained, understood, and supported by effectively one senior engineer.

If Colin is physically unable to continue maintaining the service and something like this happens again, how will anyone be able to get their data out?

Things happen... your hard drive can die suddenly, and a data center bursts into flames all on the same day.replydryrun 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I feel like ovh will never stop earing about this.

Often it is easier to just back up an entire folder than go through sub/sub folders separating stuff into: important, not very important. Storage costs are low enough to just backup everything (almost). Also, one often doesn't know what may be important/useful in future. For example a couple of years ago I had this huge buildroot system (600gb) to build firmware images for a single board computer I spent quite a while to put together. The project I was doing it for got cancelled so I had no need to keep it. Still I wish I did, as I'd love to be able to tinker with it now, but 600gb is not a trivial amount to store so it got deleted. Most of this data was pulled from various online resources that don't exist anymore too.What's the morale of my story? If you have a fast internet connection (I don't) backup \"everything\" to cloud. Then find \"really important stuff\" like the pictures of your children etc and back it up again to a different cloud.If you're in a middle of nowhere on a slow LTE connection like me, building a nas box is not a bad idea for backups.replylanstin 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I have stuff like that on a hard drive in my home, on a persistent storage volume from Linode, and on Dropbox.replyivanhoe 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Anything that you stashed just for convenience, but you could re-download or re-generate it if really needed, or simply live without it... frankly, like 90% of stuff on my disks fall in the category \"I'll read/view it one day\", which in reality I'll probably never have time or patience to open ever again.replynixpulvis 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Strange, 90% of the things trapped in my flash memory are system files.replyilyt 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The stuff I don't want to fuck around searching re-downloading from torrent for example.replynixpulvis 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I really used to enjoy formatting my machines about every 6 months.Well I used to until macOS kinda went off the rails a bit.

You can’t do that with Wasabi et al.Also it’s really simple and does what it says it does, nothing more, nothing less. In today’s everything convoluted and bloated world this is a luxury imho. The GUI app is also quite good and functional. Support is prompt (that is if you need it).You don’t have to worry about file being deleted just because your machine didn’t connect or backup for some time even if you keep paying (hello Backblaze) etc. I mean there’s no circus, melodrama , and cliffhangers involved.I personally would never use it backup my entire laptop, due to price alone.

Of course, backups have different uptime requirements, but as for everything, it's a tradeoff between features, of which an SLA is one.Tarsnap's features are granularity of cost, reliability of storage, and encryption, but not 99.999% uptime.replymrweasel 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > It's not about suing, but defining expectations about how you can rely on a service.Meeeeh, my ISP cut of around 100+ fiber connections in my town and spend three weeks fixing it. My neighbor have business line, there's an SLA on those that among other things, require them if reestablish his connection within 3 - 5 hours. It took them over 500 hours, so that SLA is useless for anything but forcing compensations.The problem is that the SLA should give an indication of available resources, but in reality it's mostly a contractual thing for most companies, they'll pay the \"fine\" or refund a customer if they fail to hit their SLA and that's about it. Tarsnap most likely have better availability than many midsize competitors simply because it's just one person who really cares about it. Doesn't help if he's hit by a bus though.replybluGill 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] SLAs can be meaningless like that. However the better ISPs have in place a backup system that doesn't use the same fiber/wires. Sure the backup might be a radio or satellite feed and so be slower, but it will get/keep you online. This costs are lot more per month though, so if you are not paying for that service your SLA will probably just be we give you a free month (which hurts them enough that they will do some things to prevent downtime, but not enough that they put redundant fiber paths in the ground)replyilyt 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The \"problem\" is that no sane company will sign for any damage compensation on some cheapo few dollars a month service.replythrowaway290 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] A company could... if you have N users and you pay M for storage per user and downtime cost you X then it could be that a discount of Y means (M - Y) * N = Xreplyplayingalong 21 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Then SLO (service level objectives) should be enough.replyAceJohnny2 20 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] huh, never heard of SLO before.replytoong 19 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] and now also go google what SLI means ;-)replylifeisstillgood 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Very roughly:SLI - Service Level Indicators - Metrics ie Latency of each request / response cycleSLO - Service Level Objective - What threshold we are aiming for - 10 ms from request to response averaged over 1 hour period.SLA - SL agreement - contract with custom yet what happens if we breach (credits given, put the CTO in stocks and throw eggs at him etc)replyjustin_oaks 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I know it's a joke, but I think if an SLA involved putting a CTO in stocks and throwing eggs at him then that'd encourage me to sign up for the service.

The only remark I would offer is with respect to sleep deprivation—when you're the only person who can fix a problem, there's no shame in trading some additional outage time for a fresh mind.

As they say, the only backups are the ones you have tested.replybaz00 21 hours ago | parent | next [–] As someone who just discovered my DR process does not work by testing it, 100% this. The only plan that is likely to work is a repeatable tested one.replytialaramex 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ideally, the thing you do in an emergency is largely routine, so that it happens by instinct rather than being a special case you need to remember. It should not be different in arbitrary ways.For example in both trains and cars, thanks to anti-lock braking, the correct way to stop the vehicle ASAP is to brake just like normal but as hard as you can, the computers will automatically solve the much trickier problem of turning your input into maximum deliverable braking force by periodically releasing brakes on sticking wheels.If you run a fire drill, it's surprisingly difficult to get employees to use fire doors that they're used to finding alarmed and unusable. Even though intellectually they know that, say, the door at the bottom of the stairwell is a fire door, with crash bars and leads directly to the outside world, and this is a fire drill, they are likely to (for example) exit on a higher floor and go through a chokepoint lobby, as they would normally, instead of following this safer path that is emergency only. Sadly it is hard to fix buildings after construction if they were designed with such \"unused\" emergency exits.For a backup process, having restoring machine images be a service that is sometimes, though not constantly, used anyway for some other reason, is a good way to be comfortable with how it works, that it works, etc. At work for example we routinely test upgrades on test servers restored from a recent backup. Restore serviceA to testA, apply upgrade, discover upgrade completely ruins the service, throw testA away and report this upgrade is garbage. But in the process we gained confidence in the restore process, infrastructure people instead of trying to recall something they only ever did in a drill, when things go badly wrong are very used to this procedure because they do it \"all the time\".replybaz00 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] This is terrible. Instinct cannot be trusted. Write it down.replybombcar 15 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] There are two types of emergencies - checklist ones, and panic ones. You need to have both, but realize that in the panic ones people do NOT operate rationally.This is why house doors open in but business doors have to open out - if there’s a crush against a fire door it opens.You even see this in aviation, where everything is checkisted; the pilots will first stabilize the plane in an emergency and then run the checklist. And small plane that operate unexpectedly are always higher in crash rates.replyjpgvm 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Pilots are a little special, their panic mode is also a checklist, known as the memory items.This doesn't work for normal people because normal people don't drill non-normal events until the response is instinctive.replybombcar 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Normal people should drill certain non-normal events (for example, all drivers should know how to deaccelerate and get off the road quickly).But you should NEVER design a system that requires normal people to drill non-normal events; even planes have been redesigned to \"fix\" problems where the pilot had to do something unintuitive or unexpected, because eventually it WILL catch up to you.replybluGill 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Note that in airplanes (unlike cars) you normally cannot just get in a new one and fly. You first get training on that particular plane. If everything goes perfect any pilot can get in any plane and fly it, but if any little thing goes wrong they better know how the plane flys very well so they can get it stable enough to run the checklist.replytialaramex 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You probably shouldn't just get in a new car and drive it, but people do. I remember at a hire car place once the team I worked with were given an automatic, the guy driving has never driven an automatic transmission before, but his license authorises it (UK licenses allow everybody to drive an automatic, but you need to test in a manual to drive manual), and so they just lent him a car with a completely different driving style. He had to get them to show him how to even drive it away out of their car park.I learned in the small car from the same brand as my father's larger car, so that the controls are in the same place, the symbols on stuff are identical, all that was different once I have a license and borrow dad's car is it's longer and has more power.It also probably shouldn't be legal for me to drive today, but it is. I learned 25 years ago, and I haven't driven anything in over a decade, so a rational system would say nah, you're too rusty, get a refresher course, but there's no mandate for that.replybombcar 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It is kind of mind-boggling insane that you can be 25 years or (younger in some states/places), having only ever driven a smart car (so you have your license) and you can walk into U-Haul and rent a 26 foot box truck with a trailer, and the most they do is tell you not to go under low overpasses or into drive-thrus.replycperciva 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Yep!

Create a full fledged separate staging system which you can bring down and recreate and periodically test various failure modes + document all detailed steps of system restore etc.Also I would suggest to think about the business long term and seeing if you can increase the revenue enough to enable you to hire a part-timer who can be of great help in case a similar event happens.We are also a small cloud solution provider (we focus on ML API's) and over the years it has become clear to us that when you use cloud hardware (either dedicated or virtual), from time to time the outages periodically happen. RAM, HDD or other parts of the hardware just can malfunction anytime. So this is something which 100% needs to be taken into consideration when running any high availability online service over long-term.replyverytrivial 20 hours ago | prev | next [–] (caveat: I may be running on old tarsnap company info but) I must say, the ONLY thing that has ever made me shy away from seriously using tarsnap was the prospect of an unexpected Colin Percival outage. i.e. key person risk. I'm guessing I'm not alone in this.replyjacquesm 14 hours ago | parent | next [–] It's an MTBF like calculation: do you trust the well engineered one person company that has a well engineered solution with few moving parts over the much larger company that has far more moving parts and their probably less well engineered solution with far more moving parts?I personally would go with the simpler solution because in my experience you need an awful lot of extra complexity before you get to the same level of reliability that you have with the simpler system. Most complexity is just making things worse.You can see this clearly when it comes to clustering servers. A single server with a solid power supply and network hookup will be more reliable than any attempt at making that service redundant until you get to something like 5x more costly and complex. Then maybe you'll have the same MTBF as you had with the single server. Beyond that you can have actualy improvements. YMMV and you may be able to get better reliability at the same level of performance in some cases but on average it always first gets far more complex, costly and fragile before you see any real improvements.I strongly believe that the best path to real reliability is simplicity (which is: as simple as possible) and good backups. For stuff that needs to be available 24x7 and 365 days per year this limits your choices in available technologies considerably.replydeltarholamda 15 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] While I get this as a risk, I'm not convinced it's any more risky than a larger corporate entity.This is Colin's job.

Their employees are replaceable, their management is replaceable, and to be honest, you as a customer are replaceable, if they decide to move in a different direction and become BigFlowerArrangementShippingCorp.The neat thing about a small business is that it runs entirely on its own profits. There are no stock price games or VC jiggery-pokery or anything like that.

But if someone has a tutorial, I am all ears.replyufmace 4 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] IMO AWS S3 works fine for this:* Create a S3 bucket and enable versioning * Create a new user and give it only s3:PutObject on your new bucket * Create an auth keypair for that user and put it on your serverNow any server compromise that gets those keys can only add new data to your backup bucket, and can't read, overwrite, or delete any previous backup.There's no dedup, so that could be a deal-breaker.There's also no real encryption (though that shouldn't be too hard to add I guess). I don't really see the gain though. Anyone who compromises the server keys is blocked from reading by AWS permissions. Granted, that's not quite as reliable as good crypto for blocking reading, but on the deleting side, there's never going to be anything but the auth system of whatever solution you're using to block that.I get that there's some applications out there where preventing data exfiltration is important enough to need strong crypto (though is that really important when we're talking about full compromise of your server, which gets the attacker direct access to the data anyways?), but I decided that the risk of failing to implement properly or full data loss due to losing the keys or them being corrupted wasn't worth the risk of blocking somebody who somehow compromised the AWS account security from being able to read backup data.replyrssoconnor 2 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Deduplication isn't necessarily a deal breaker. Let's see.My main machine is currently storing 1.6 TB (compressed) of total archives with tarsnap, but only 33 GB (compressed) of unique data within those archives. So if S3 is 50x cheaper, then not having deduplication would be a wash.However other comments here suggest that S3 is only 10x cheaper.replyrssoconnor 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Replying to myself:I've been musing on this subject all afternoon. I'm a user of Tarsnap, and I do find it expensive, in the sense that I would prefer to backup larger amounts of data for less amount of money. At the moment I backup photos separately from Tarsnap and in an adhoc way.But I still cannot figure out a way to get all the benefits I get from Tarsnap from any other software solution.* Must be usable under Nixos.* Backups must be asymmetrically encrypted so that backups can be automated, yet a compromise of the system cannot immediately gain read authorization to arcived data.* Backups must be append-only without further credentials, or otherwise prevent a compromised system from being able to delete existing archives.* Deduplication between archives while still allowing archives to independently be deleted.Using the ZFS snapshot functionality with rsync.net, for example, with Duplicity comes close. However, as I recall, duplicity wants to regular (typically monthly) full backups and then incremental backups from there. You cannot remove these full backups without deleting the entire month's worth of backups, and because the full backups are independently encrypted, there is (of course) no deduplication between full snapshots, even though the data is still likely largely the same. And because the snapshots are encrypted, it is impossible for the rsync.net storage to see or even know that large parts of the encrypted data is identical.AFAICT there is really nothing else that does what Tarsnap does.replyrcxdude 14 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Rsync.net can do similar, because of their snapshot system. By default there's no way to delete a snapshot except through the schedule set up (you can write to them and ask if it's necessary for some reason). It doesn't use asymmetric crypto to do this but it's neither necessary not sufficient for the purpose of preventing accidental or malicious deletion of backupshttps://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/snapshots.htmlreplyrssoconnor 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Right I've considered that. It is however limited to like 7 snapshots.The thing is that tarsnap deduplicates over arbitrarily long time periods, letting me make arbitrarily long staggered sequences of retained archives.Perhaps I should really reconsider if I really need such long lived archives, but it is hard to bring myself to drop them.replyrcxdude 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] You can do the same with rsync, they just charge you for the extra space (the differential space, like with tarsnap) instead of providing them for free (from what I can see the limits in the web UI are like 1000 daily and weekly snapshots, 200 monthy snapshots, 100 quarterly snapshows, and 10 yearly snapshots, which I suspect are arbitrary 'good enough for most' numbers, not some hard limit based on what they can profitably provide). I personally use the direct ZFS option so I can set up the snapshots exactly how I want, but it is extra effort and doesn't provide quite as good a guarantee that they won't be overwritten (it's resilient against a compromise of the server uploading the backups because I've set up scripts that way, but it doesn't protect against compromise of the logic credentials for the VM in the same way).replyrssoconnor 13 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Oh thanks. I did not know that. That does seem good enough.I just now need a deduplicating asymmetrically encrypted backup program.I've tried duplicity in the past, and maybe I should try it again. But my recollection is that duplicity will just fail to do backups at the slightest hint of any problem. Like maybe if the last backup was interrupted then no more backups for you until you attend to it.Edit: More memories returning of having to dig out my decryption key to resync the metadata when duplicity gets unhappy, and then since my target server was append-only, duplicity was upset when it wasn't allowed overwrite any of it's incomplete metadata files. I guess the ZFS snapshot technique would alleviate the latter issue.To be fair, if tarsnap gets confused it needs the keys to do its fsck command, but I recall this sort of thing happening regularly with duplicity and almost never with tarsnap.replyrsync 12 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] No, not limited.An rsync.net account can have any arbitrary schedule of snapshots - including days, weeks, months, quarters and years.replygnfargbl 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] My post was specifically addressing the comments around cost.replypatrec 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] No, you specifically claimed that \"tarsnap makes a lot of sense\" in certain situations.

It's actual _functionality_ to me - getting from raw object storage to a fully working, attack-resistant backup strategy, is not trivial; hence, comparing tarsnap (or rsync.net, or borgbase, or whatever) to B2 or S3 makes little to no sense.You _could_ compare it to crashplan or backblaze personal backup if you like, but IIRC those don't work for *nix systems, only for Win and Mac.replyilyt 15 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] How tarsnap keeps backups readonly ?

(These cannot be performed at the same time, since the use of log-structured storage means that log entries are \"rewritten\" to free up storage when data is deleted; log entries contain sequence numbers to allow them to be replayed in the correct order, but they must be sorted into the correct order after being retrieved before they can be replayed.)Far be it from me to tell anyone how to write software, but why build a database on top of S3 when you can just chuck the metadata into RDS with however much replication you want?The backups themselves should be in S3, but using S3 as a NoSQL append-only database seems unwise.This would benefit from being further from the metal.replythrowawaaarrgh 15 hours ago | parent | next [–] Forget about software or data architecture. S3 is the most reliable data storage mechanism in the world, and insanely simpler than a relational database. There is no operational failure mode to S3, other than \"region went down\". There is no instance to go down, no replication to fail, no worry about whether there's enough capacity for writes or too many connections, no thought to a schema, no migrations to manage, no storage to grow, no logs to rotate, no software to upgrade on a maintenance window. Plus S3 is versioned, has multiple kinds of access control built in, is a protocol supported by many vendors and open source projects, and is (on AWS) strongly read-after-write consistent. I would also argue (though I don't have figures) that it's faster than RDS. Almost guaranteed it's cheaper. And it's integrated into many services in AWS making it easier to build more functionality into the system without programming.On a less technical note: Always avoid the fancy option when it makes sense.

How on Earth, by what sane standard, is a Postgres instance too complex? If you're `fopen`ing files as a \"database\" you are wasting your time and lowering the world's economic productivity.Complex is Greenspunning a database and having it blow up in your face and cause a twenty-six hour outage. You never hear about such things with Postgres because Postgres is rock-solid.replybastawhiz 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm not defending the choice to use S3. I probably wouldn't have made the same choice. But I am pointing out that it's empirically wrong to say that storing data in flat files necessitates the considerations of an ACID-capable RDBMS.But to your point, if your system requires less than a thousand lines of code to open a file, do basic parsing and processing (which no data storage system is going to do anyway), and write the output to another file, I personally can't say that Postgres or MySQL or any other solution is really worth the effort/cost to build and maintain. In the system being discussed, the benefits of an RDBMS simply don't matter: any strongly consistent key-value store would work.> Complex is Greenspunning a database and having it blow up in your face and cause a twenty-six hour outage.S3 didn't cause the outage, and from the look of it, neither did the code that processes the files. It was an application logic problem which caused issues during the restore process, and this would have been an issue regardless.You could make an argument that the recovery being slower than it could have been was a problem, but it's wild to say that and imply that traditional databases have no performance cliffs. Especially when dealing with corruption or data recovery. Raw file storage will never have a Postgres transaction id wraparound incident (see: Sentry outage for most of a day in 2015, MailChimp/Mandrill for over a day in 2019) or have to rebuild a critical index.In this case there was a hard coded concurrency limit with S3 of 250 outstanding requests. Bumping that up to 3000 would have been easy and reasonable (S3 rate limits at 5000). How confident would you be that your database can performantly handle a backfill during recovery? Have you provisioned enough iops? Are you running an RDS instance with only a burstable vCPU limit? To say Postgres is \"rock-solid\" (and make no mistake, I am a Postgres fanboy) dismisses the many and varying ways that it can fail in unusual and surprising ways.replykhiqxj 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] ok boomerreplynemothekid 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >Cheaper than a 26-hour outage?AFAICT, using HN theres been roughly 30 hours of non-availability over 15 years.

ARTICLES @WERNER Building and operating a pretty big storage system called S3July 27, 2023 • 6277 wordsToday, I am publishing a guest post from Andy Warfield, VP and distinguished engineer over at S3. I asked him to write this based on the Keynote address he gave at USENIX FAST ‘23 that covers three distinct perspectives on scale that come along with building and operating a storage system the size of S3.In today’s world of short-form snackable content, we’re very fortunate to get an excellent in-depth exposé. It’s one that I find particularly fascinating, and it provides some really unique insights into why people like Andy and I joined Amazon in the first place. The full recording of Andy presenting this paper at fast is embedded at the end of this post.–WBuilding and operating a pretty big storage system called S3I’ve worked in computer systems software — operating systems, virtualization, storage, networks, and security — for my entire career. However, the last six years working with Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) have forced me to think about systems in broader terms than I ever have before. In a given week, I get to be involved in everything from hard disk mechanics, firmware, and the physical properties of storage media at one end, to customer-facing performance experience and API expressiveness at the other. And the boundaries of the system are not just technical ones: I’ve had the opportunity to help engineering teams move faster, worked with finance and hardware teams to build cost-following services, and worked with customers to create gob-smackingly cool applications in areas like video streaming, genomics, and generative AI.What I’d really like to share with you more than anything else is my sense of wonder at the storage systems that are all collectively being built at this point in time, because they are pretty amazing. In this post, I want to cover a few of the interesting nuances of building something like S3, and the lessons learned and sometimes surprising observations from my time in S3.17 years ago, on a university campus far, far away…S3 launched on March 14th, 2006, which means it turned 17 this year. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that for engineers starting their careers today, S3 has simply existed as an internet storage service for as long as you’ve been working with computers. Seventeen years ago, I was just finishing my PhD at the University of Cambridge. I was working in the lab that developed Xen, an open-source hypervisor that a few companies, including Amazon, were using to build the first public clouds. A group of us moved on from the Xen project at Cambridge to create a startup called XenSource that, instead of using Xen to build a public cloud, aimed to commercialize it by selling it as enterprise software. You might say that we missed a bit of an opportunity there. XenSource grew and was eventually acquired by Citrix, and I wound up learning a whole lot about growing teams and growing a business (and negotiating commercial leases, and fixing small server room HVAC systems, and so on) – things that I wasn’t exposed to in grad school.But at the time, what I was convinced I really wanted to do was to be a university professor. I applied for a bunch of faculty jobs and wound up finding one at UBC (which worked out really well, because my wife already had a job in Vancouver and we love the city). I threw myself into the faculty role and foolishly grew my lab to 18 students, which is something that I’d encourage anyone that’s starting out as an assistant professor to never, ever do. It was thrilling to have such a large lab full of amazing people and it was absolutely exhausting to try to supervise that many graduate students all at once, but, I’m pretty sure I did a horrible job of it. That said, our research lab was an incredible community of people and we built things that I’m still really proud of today, and we wrote all sorts of really fun papers on security, storage, virtualization, and networking.A little over two years into my professor job at UBC, a few of my students and I decided to do another startup. We started a company called Coho Data that took advantage of two really early technologies at the time: NVMe SSDs and programmable ethernet switches, to build a high-performance scale-out storage appliance. We grew Coho to about 150 people with offices in four countries, and once again it was an opportunity to learn things about stuff like the load bearing strength of second-floor server room floors, and analytics workflows in Wall Street hedge funds – both of which were well outside my training as a CS researcher and teacher. Coho was a wonderful and deeply educational experience, but in the end, the company didn’t work out and we had to wind it down.And so, I found myself sitting back in my mostly empty office at UBC. I realized that I’d graduated my last PhD student, and I wasn’t sure that I had the strength to start building a research lab from scratch all over again. I also felt like if I was going to be in a professor job where I was expected to teach students about the cloud, that I might do well to get some first-hand experience with how it actually works.I interviewed at some cloud providers, and had an especially fun time talking to the folks at Amazon and decided to join. And that’s where I work now. I’m based in Vancouver, and I’m an engineer that gets to work across all of Amazon’s storage products. So far, a whole lot of my time has been spent on S3.How S3 worksWhen I joined Amazon in 2017, I arranged to spend most of my first day at work with Seth Markle. Seth is one of S3’s early engineers, and he took me into a little room with a whiteboard and then spent six hours explaining how S3 worked.It was awesome. We drew pictures, and I asked question after question non-stop and I couldn’t stump Seth. It was exhausting, but in the best kind of way. Even then S3 was a very large system, but in broad strokes — which was what we started with on the whiteboard — it probably looks like most other storage systems that you’ve seen.Amazon Simple Storage Service - Simple, right?S3 is an object storage service with an HTTP REST API. There is a frontend fleet with a REST API, a namespace service, a storage fleet that’s full of hard disks, and a fleet that does background operations. In an enterprise context we might call these background tasks “data services,” like replication and tiering. What’s interesting here, when you look at the highest-level block diagram of S3’s technical design, is the fact that AWS tends to ship its org chart. This is a phrase that’s often used in a pretty disparaging way, but in this case it’s absolutely fascinating. Each of these broad components is a part of the S3 organization. Each has a leader, and a bunch of teams that work on it. And if we went into the next level of detail in the diagram, expanding one of these boxes out into the individual components that are inside it, what we’d find is that all the nested components are their own teams, have their own fleets, and, in many ways, operate like independent businesses.All in, S3 today is composed of hundreds of microservices that are structured this way. Interactions between these teams are literally API-level contracts, and, just like the code that we all write, sometimes we get modularity wrong and those team-level interactions are kind of inefficient and clunky, and it’s a bunch of work to go and fix it, but that’s part of building software, and it turns out, part of building software teams too.Two early observationsBefore Amazon, I’d worked on research software, I’d worked on pretty widely adopted open-source software, and I’d worked on enterprise software and hardware appliances that were used in production inside some really large businesses. But by and large, that software was a thing we designed, built, tested, and shipped. It was the software that we packaged and the software that we delivered. Sure, we had escalations and support cases and we fixed bugs and shipped patches and updates, but we ultimately delivered software. Working on a global storage service like S3 was completely different: S3 is effectively a living, breathing organism. Everything, from developers writing code running next to the hard disks at the bottom of the software stack, to technicians installing new racks of storage capacity in our data centers, to customers tuning applications for performance, everything is one single, continuously evolving system. S3’s customers aren’t buying software, they are buying a service and they expect the experience of using that service to be continuously, predictably fantastic.The first observation was that I was going to have to change, and really broaden how I thought about software systems and how they behave. This didn’t just mean broadening thinking about software to include those hundreds of microservices that make up S3, it meant broadening to also include all the people who design, build, deploy, and operate all that code. It’s all one thing, and you can’t really think about it just as software. It’s software, hardware, and people, and it’s always growing and constantly evolving.The second observation was that despite the fact that this whiteboard diagram sketched the broad strokes of the organization and the software, it was also wildly misleading, because it completely obscured the scale of the system. Each one of the boxes represents its own collection of scaled out software services, often themselves built from collections of services. It would literally take me years to come to terms with the scale of the system that I was working with, and even today I often find myself surprised at the consequences of that scale.S3 by the numbers (as of publishing this post).Technical Scale: Scale and the physics of storageIt probably isn’t very surprising for me to mention that S3 is a really big system, and it is built using a LOT of hard disks. Millions of them. And if we’re talking about S3, it’s worth spending a little bit of time talking about hard drives themselves. Hard drives are amazing, and they’ve kind of always been amazing.The first hard drive was built by Jacob Rabinow, who was a researcher for the predecessor of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Rabinow was an expert in magnets and mechanical engineering, and he’d been asked to build a machine to do magnetic storage on flat sheets of media, almost like pages in a book. He decided that idea was too complex and inefficient, so, stealing the idea of a spinning disk from record players, he built an array of spinning magnetic disks that could be read by a single head. To make that work, he cut a pizza slice-style notch out of each disk that the head could move through to reach the appropriate platter. Rabinow described this as being like “like reading a book without opening it.” The first commercially available hard disk appeared 7 years later in 1956, when IBM introduced the 350 disk storage unit, as part of the 305 RAMAC computer system. We’ll come back to the RAMAC in a bit.The first magnetic memory device. Credit: https://www.computerhistory.org/storageengine/rabinow-patents-magnetic-disk-data-storage/Today, 67 years after that first commercial drive was introduced, the world uses lots of hard drives. Globally, the number of bytes stored on hard disks continues to grow every year, but the applications of hard drives are clearly diminishing. We just seem to be using hard drives for fewer and fewer things. Today, consumer devices are effectively all solid-state, and a large amount of enterprise storage is similarly switching to SSDs. Jim Gray predicted this direction in 2006, when he very presciently said: “Tape is Dead. Disk is Tape. Flash is Disk. RAM Locality is King.“ This quote has been used a lot over the past couple of decades to motivate flash storage, but the thing it observes about disks is just as interesting.Hard disks don’t fill the role of general storage media that they used to because they are big (physically and in terms of bytes), slower, and relatively fragile pieces of media. For almost every common storage application, flash is superior. But hard drives are absolute marvels of technology and innovation, and for the things they are good at, they are absolutely amazing. One of these strengths is cost efficiency, and in a large-scale system like S3, there are some unique opportunities to design around some of the constraints of individual hard disks.The anatomy of a hard disk. Credit: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mechanical-components-of-a-typical-hard-disk-drive_fig8_224323123As I was preparing for my talk at FAST, I asked Tim Rausch if he could help me revisit the old plane flying over blades of grass hard drive example. Tim did his PhD at CMU and was one of the early researchers on heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) drives. Tim has worked on hard drives generally, and HAMR specifically for most of his career, and we both agreed that the plane analogy – where we scale up the head of a hard drive to be a jumbo jet and talk about the relative scale of all the other components of the drive – is a great way to illustrate the complexity and mechanical precision that’s inside an HDD. So, here’s our version for 2023.Imagine a hard drive head as a 747 flying over a grassy field at 75 miles per hour. The air gap between the bottom of the plane and the top of the grass is two sheets of paper. Now, if we measure bits on the disk as blades of grass, the track width would be 4.6 blades of grass wide and the bit length would be one blade of grass. As the plane flew over the grass it would count blades of grass and only miss one blade for every 25 thousand times the plane circled the Earth.That’s a bit error rate of 1 in 10^15 requests. In the real world, we see that blade of grass get missed pretty frequently – and it’s actually something we need to account for in S3.Now, let’s go back to that first hard drive, the IBM RAMAC from 1956. Here are some specs on that thing:Now let’s compare it to the largest HDD that you can buy as of publishing this, which is a Western Digital Ultrastar DC HC670 26TB. Since the RAMAC, capacity has improved 7.2M times over, while the physical drive has gotten 5,000x smaller. It’s 6 billion times cheaper per byte in inflation-adjusted dollars. But despite all that, seek times – the time it takes to perform a random access to a specific piece of data on the drive – have only gotten 150x better. Why? Because they’re mechanical. We have to wait for an arm to move, for the platter to spin, and those mechanical aspects haven’t really improved at the same rate. If you are doing random reads and writes to a drive as fast as you possibly can, you can expect about 120 operations per second. The number was about the same in 2006 when S3 launched, and it was about the same even a decade before that.This tension between HDDs growing in capacity but staying flat for performance is a central influence in S3’s design. We need to scale the number of bytes we store by moving to the largest drives we can as aggressively as we can. Today’s largest drives are 26TB, and industry roadmaps are pointing at a path to 200TB (200TB drives!) in the next decade. At that point, if we divide up our random accesses fairly across all our data, we will be allowed to do 1 I/O per second per 2TB of data on disk.S3 doesn’t have 200TB drives yet, but I can tell you that we anticipate using them when they’re available. And all the drive sizes between here and there.Managing heat: data placement and performanceSo, with all this in mind, one of the biggest and most interesting technical scale problems that I’ve encountered is in managing and balancing I/O demand across a really large set of hard drives. In S3, we refer to that problem as heat management.By heat, I mean the number of requests that hit a given disk at any point in time. If we do a bad job of managing heat, then we end up focusing a disproportionate number of requests on a single drive, and we create hotspots because of the limited I/O that’s available from that single disk. For us, this becomes an optimization challenge of figuring out how we can place data across our disks in a way that minimizes the number of hotspots.Hotspots are small numbers of overloaded drives in a system that ends up getting bogged down, and results in poor overall performance for requests dependent on those drives. When you get a hot spot, things don’t fall over, but you queue up requests and the customer experience is poor. Unbalanced load stalls requests that are waiting on busy drives, those stalls amplify up through layers of the software storage stack, they get amplified by dependent I/Os for metadata lookups or erasure coding, and they result in a very small proportion of higher latency requests — or “stragglers”. In other words, hotspots at individual hard disks create tail latency, and ultimately, if you don’t stay on top of them, they grow to eventually impact all request latency.As S3 scales, we want to be able to spread heat as evenly as possible, and let individual users benefit from as much of the HDD fleet as possible. This is tricky, because we don’t know when or how data is going to be accessed at the time that it’s written, and that’s when we need to decide where to place it. Before joining Amazon, I spent time doing research and building systems that tried to predict and manage this I/O heat at much smaller scales – like local hard drives or enterprise storage arrays and it was basically impossible to do a good job of. But this is a case where the sheer scale, and the multitenancy of S3 result in a system that is fundamentally different.The more workloads we run on S3, the more that individual requests to objects become decorrelated with one another. Individual storage workloads tend to be really bursty, in fact, most storage workloads are completely idle most of the time and then experience sudden load peaks when data is accessed. That peak demand is much higher than the mean. But as we aggregate millions of workloads a really, really cool thing happens: the aggregate demand smooths and it becomes way more predictable. In fact, and I found this to be a really intuitive observation once I saw it at scale, once you aggregate to a certain scale you hit a point where it is difficult or impossible for any given workload to really influence the aggregate peak at all! So, with aggregation flattening the overall demand distribution, we need to take this relatively smooth demand rate and translate it into a similarly smooth level of demand across all of our disks, balancing the heat of each workload.Replication: data placement and durabilityIn storage systems, redundancy schemes are commonly used to protect data from hardware failures, but redundancy also helps manage heat. They spread load out and give you an opportunity to steer request traffic away from hotspots. As an example, consider replication as a simple approach to encoding and protecting data. Replication protects data if disks fail by just having multiple copies on different disks. But it also gives you the freedom to read from any of the disks. When we think about replication from a capacity perspective it’s expensive. However, from an I/O perspective – at least for reading data – replication is very efficient.We obviously don’t want to pay a replication overhead for all of the data that we store, so in S3 we also make use of erasure coding. For example, we use an algorithm, such as Reed-Solomon, and split our object into a set of k “identity” shards. Then we generate an additional set of m parity shards. As long as k of the (k+m) total shards remain available, we can read the object. This approach lets us reduce capacity overhead while surviving the same number of failures.The impact of scale on data placement strategySo, redundancy schemes let us divide our data into more pieces than we need to read in order to access it, and that in turn provides us with the flexibility to avoid sending requests to overloaded disks, but there’s more we can do to avoid heat. The next step is to spread the placement of new objects broadly across our disk fleet. While individual objects may be encoded across tens of drives, we intentionally put different objects onto different sets of drives, so that each customer’s accesses are spread over a very large number of disks.There are two big benefits to spreading the objects within each bucket across lots and lots of disks:A customer’s data only occupies a very small amount of any given disk, which helps achieve workload isolation, because individual workloads can’t generate a hotspot on any one disk. Individual workloads can burst up to a scale of disks that would be really difficult and really expensive to build as a stand-alone system.Here's a spiky workloadFor instance, look at the graph above. Think about that burst, which might be a genomics customer doing parallel analysis from thousands of Lambda functions at once. That burst of requests can be served by over a million individual disks. That’s not an exaggeration. Today, we have tens of thousands of customers with S3 buckets that are spread across millions of drives. When I first started working on S3, I was really excited (and humbled!) by the systems work to build storage at this scale, but as I really started to understand the system I realized that it was the scale of customers and workloads using the system in aggregate that really allow it to be built differently, and building at this scale means that any one of those individual workloads is able to burst to a level of performance that just wouldn’t be practical to build if they were building without this scale.The human factorsBeyond the technology itself, there are human factors that make S3 - or any complex system - what it is. One of the core tenets at Amazon is that we want engineers and teams to fail fast, and safely. We want them to always have the confidence to move quickly as builders, while still remaining completely obsessed with delivering highly durable storage. One strategy we use to help with this in S3 is a process called “durability reviews.” It’s a human mechanism that’s not in the statistical 11 9s model, but it’s every bit as important.When an engineer makes changes that can result in a change to our durability posture, we do a durability review. The process borrows an idea from security research: the threat model. The goal is to provide a summary of the change, a comprehensive list of threats, then describe how the change is resilient to those threats. In security, writing down a threat model encourages you to think like an adversary and imagine all the nasty things that they might try to do to your system. In a durability review, we encourage the same “what are all the things that might go wrong” thinking, and really encourage engineers to be creatively critical of their own code. The process does two things very well:It encourages authors and reviewers to really think critically about the risks we should be protecting against. It separates risk from countermeasures, and lets us have separate discussions about the two sides.When working through durability reviews we take the durability threat model, and then we evaluate whether we have the right countermeasures and protections in place. When we are identifying those protections, we really focus on identifying coarse-grained “guardrails”. These are simple mechanisms that protect you from a large class of risks. Rather than nitpicking through each risk and identifying individual mitigations, we like simple and broad strategies that protect against a lot of stuff.Another example of a broad strategy is demonstrated in a project we kicked off a few years back to rewrite the bottom-most layer of S3’s storage stack – the part that manages the data on each individual disk. The new storage layer is called ShardStore, and when we decided to rebuild that layer from scratch, one guardrail we put in place was to adopt a really exciting set of techniques called “lightweight formal verification”. Our team decided to shift the implementation to Rust in order to get type safety and structured language support to help identify bugs sooner, and even wrote libraries that extend that type safety to apply to on-disk structures. From a verification perspective, we built a simplified model of ShardStore’s logic, (also in Rust), and checked into the same repository alongside the real production ShardStore implementation. This model dropped all the complexity of the actual on-disk storage layers and hard drives, and instead acted as a compact but executable specification. It wound up being about 1% of the size of the real system, but allowed us to perform testing at a level that would have been completely impractical to do against a hard drive with 120 available IOPS. We even managed to publish a paper about this work at SOSP.From here, we’ve been able to build tools and use existing techniques, like property-based testing, to generate test cases that verify that the behaviour of the implementation matches that of the specification. The really cool bit of this work wasn’t anything to do with either designing ShardStore or using formal verification tricks. It was that we managed to kind of “industrialize” verification, taking really cool, but kind of research-y techniques for program correctness, and get them into code where normal engineers who don’t have PhDs in formal verification can contribute to maintaining the specification, and that we could continue to apply our tools with every single commit to the software. Using verification as a guardrail has given the team confidence to develop faster, and it has endured even as new engineers joined the team.Durability reviews and lightweight formal verification are two examples of how we take a really human, and organizational view of scale in S3. The lightweight formal verification tools that we built and integrated are really technical work, but they were motivated by a desire to let our engineers move faster and be confident even as the system becomes larger and more complex over time. Durability reviews, similarly, are a way to help the team think about durability in a structured way, but also to make sure that we are always holding ourselves accountable for a high bar for durability as a team. There are many other examples of how we treat the organization as part of the system, and it’s been interesting to see how once you make this shift, you experiment and innovate with how the team builds and operates just as much as you do with what they are building and operating.Scaling myself: Solving hard problems starts and ends with “Ownership”The last example of scale that I’d like to tell you about is an individual one. I joined Amazon as an entrepreneur and a university professor. I’d had tens of grad students and built an engineering team of about 150 people at Coho. In the roles I’d had in the university and in startups, I loved having the opportunity to be technically creative, to build really cool systems and incredible teams, and to always be learning. But I’d never had to do that kind of role at the scale of software, people, or business that I suddenly faced at Amazon.One of my favourite parts of being a CS professor was teaching the systems seminar course to graduate students. This was a course where we’d read and generally have pretty lively discussions about a collection of “classic” systems research papers. One of my favourite parts of teaching that course was that about half way through it we’d read the SOSP Dynamo paper. I looked forward to a lot of the papers that we read in the course, but I really looked forward to the class where we read the Dynamo paper, because it was from a real production system that the students could relate to. It was Amazon, and there was a shopping cart, and that was what Dynamo was for. It’s always fun to talk about research work when people can map it to real things in their own experience.But also, technically, it was fun to discuss Dynamo, because Dynamo was eventually consistent, so it was possible for your shopping cart to be wrong.I loved this, because it was where we’d discuss what you do, practically, in production, when Dynamo was wrong. When a customer was able to place an order only to later realize that the last item had already been sold. You detected the conflict but what could you do? The customer was expecting a delivery.This example may have stretched the Dynamo paper’s story a little bit, but it drove to a great punchline. Because the students would often spend a bunch of discussion trying to come up with technical software solutions. Then someone would point out that this wasn’t it at all. That ultimately, these conflicts were rare, and you could resolve them by getting support staff involved and making a human decision. It was a moment where, if it worked well, you could take the class from being critical and engaged in thinking about tradeoffs and design of software systems, and you could get them to realize that the system might be bigger than that. It might be a whole organization, or a business, and maybe some of the same thinking still applied.Now that I’ve worked at Amazon for a while, I’ve come to realize that my interpretation wasn’t all that far from the truth — in terms of how the services that we run are hardly “just” the software. I’ve also realized that there’s a bit more to it than what I’d gotten out of the paper when teaching it. Amazon spends a lot of time really focused on the idea of “ownership.” The term comes up in a lot of conversations — like “does this action item have an owner?” — meaning who is the single person that is on the hook to really drive this thing to completion and make it successful.The focus on ownership actually helps understand a lot of the organizational structure and engineering approaches that exist within Amazon, and especially in S3. To move fast, to keep a really high bar for quality, teams need to be owners. They need to own the API contracts with other systems their service interacts with, they need to be completely on the hook for durability and performance and availability, and ultimately, they need to step in and fix stuff at three in the morning when an unexpected bug hurts availability. But they also need to be empowered to reflect on that bug fix and improve the system so that it doesn’t happen again. Ownership carries a lot of responsibility, but it also carries a lot of trust – because to let an individual or a team own a service, you have to give them the leeway to make their own decisions about how they are going to deliver it. It’s been a great lesson for me to realize how much allowing individuals and teams to directly own software, and more generally own a portion of the business, allows them to be passionate about what they do and really push on it. It’s also remarkable how much getting ownership wrong can have the opposite result.Encouraging ownership in othersI’ve spent a lot of time at Amazon thinking about how important and effective the focus on ownership is to the business, but also about how effective an individual tool it is when I work with engineers and teams. I realized that the idea of recognizing and encouraging ownership had actually been a really effective tool for me in other roles. Here’s an example: In my early days as a professor at UBC, I was working with my first set of graduate students and trying to figure out how to choose great research problems for my lab. I vividly remember a conversation I had with a colleague that was also a pretty new professor at another school. When I asked them how they choose research problems with their students, they flipped. They had a surprisingly frustrated reaction. “I can’t figure this out at all. I have like 5 projects I want students to do. I’ve written them up. They hum and haw and pick one up but it never works out. I could do the projects faster myself than I can teach them to do it.”And ultimately, that’s actually what this person did — they were amazing, they did a bunch of really cool stuff, and wrote some great papers, and then went and joined a company and did even more cool stuff. But when I talked to grad students that worked with them what I heard was, “I just couldn’t get invested in that thing. It wasn’t my idea.”As a professor, that was a pivotal moment for me. From that point forward, when I worked with students, I tried really hard to ask questions, and listen, and be excited and enthusiastic. But ultimately, my most successful research projects were never mine. They were my students and I was lucky to be involved. The thing that I don’t think I really internalized until much later, working with teams at Amazon, was that one big contribution to those projects being successful was that the students really did own them. Once students really felt like they were working on their own ideas, and that they could personally evolve it and drive it to a new result or insight, it was never difficult to get them to really invest in the work and the thinking to develop and deliver it. They just had to own it.And this is probably one area of my role at Amazon that I’ve thought about and tried to develop and be more intentional about than anything else I do. As a really senior engineer in the company, of course I have strong opinions and I absolutely have a technical agenda. But If I interact with engineers by just trying to dispense ideas, it’s really hard for any of us to be successful. It’s a lot harder to get invested in an idea that you don’t own. So, when I work with teams, I’ve kind of taken the strategy that my best ideas are the ones that other people have instead of me. I consciously spend a lot more time trying to develop problems, and to do a really good job of articulating them, rather than trying to pitch solutions. There are often multiple ways to solve a problem, and picking the right one is letting someone own the solution. And I spend a lot of time being enthusiastic about how those solutions are developing (which is pretty easy) and encouraging folks to figure out how to have urgency and go faster (which is often a little more complex). But it has, very sincerely, been one of the most rewarding parts of my role at Amazon to approach scaling myself as an engineer being measured by making other engineers and teams successful, helping them own problems, and celebrating the wins that they achieve.Closing thoughtI came to Amazon expecting to work on a really big and complex piece of storage software. What I learned was that every aspect of my role was unbelievably bigger than that expectation. I’ve learned that the technical scale of the system is so enormous, that its workload, structure, and operations are not just bigger, but foundationally different from the smaller systems that I’d worked on in the past. I learned that it wasn’t enough to think about the software, that “the system” was also the software’s operation as a service, the organization that ran it, and the customer code that worked with it. I learned that the organization itself, as part of the system, had its own scaling challenges and provided just as many problems to solve and opportunities to innovate. And finally, I learned that to really be successful in my own role, I needed to focus on articulating the problems and not the solutions, and to find ways to support strong engineering teams in really owning those solutions.I’m hardly done figuring any of this stuff out, but I sure feel like I’ve learned a bunch so far.

I hadn't heard the term \"heat\" as it's used in the article but it's incredibly hard to mitigate on single system. For our co-located hardware clusters, we would have to customize the batch systems to treat IO as an allocatable resource the same as RAM or CPU in order to manage it correctly across large jobs.

The best possible customer, from a cloud storage perspective, stores a whole lot of data but reads almost none of it. That's kind of like renting hard drives, except if you only fill some of each hard drive with the \"cold\" data, you can still use the hard drive's full I/O capacity to handle the hot work. So, if you very carefully balance what sort of data is on which drive, you can keep all of the drives in use despite most of your data not being used.

This includes random access. after all, the storage system is just a bunch of drives attached to machines connected by networks.When I worked at Google I wrote a mapreduce that converted BAM files to sstables which are sorted, sharded by key, and sit in an object store like S3.

And of course BAM itself dates back to before standardized serialization formats were brought out of Google.Even with potential optimizations, initiating a seek on GCS or S3 is far far slower than on a local SSD, so even if Google exposes fast cross-network seeks on objects inside an internal object store system, it is not readily accessible to the plebes like me and 99.9% of genomicists that use cloud systems or their own hardware.replyseized 2 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The latency is higher so the key is parallelism...

It's such a shit comment to make.I interpret it as if they are saying \"You plebe! I don't have time for your issues. I can't get promoted from your work if you only bring problems.\"Being able to solve the problem is being able to understand the problem and admit it exists first. replyforrestthewoods 2 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] That section really stood out to be as well.If Andy Warfield is reading, and I bet he is, I have a question. When developing a problem how valuable is it to sketch possible solutions? If you articulate the problem that probably springs to mind a few possible solutions. Is it worth sharing those possible solutions to help kickstart the gears for potential owners? Or is it better to focus only on the problem and let the solution space be fully green?Additionally, anyone have further reading for this type of “very senior IC” operation?replyniscocity35 1 hour ago | parent | prev | next [–] this only works if your team are made up of smart competent people.replydeathanatos 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] > Now, let’s go back to that first hard drive, the IBM RAMAC from 1956.

If you multiply the cost by the storage, the cost of the drive works out to 3¢.This site[1] states,> It stored about 2,000 bits of data per square inch and had a purchase price of about $10,000 per megabyteSo perhaps the specs should read $9,200 / megabyte?

It was explained to me you basically license a certain amount of compute even though the hardware is in your data center and you pay overages if you exceed your licensed throughput.Since you license a fixed amount, there were projects at the company looking at running batch/non time sensitive jobs on the mainframe since it was effectively free off peak (I guess power cost was trivially compared to licensing).replybirdyrooster 5 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Must've put a decimal point in the wrong place or something.

The world needs an HTTP-based protocol for apps to access data on the user's behalf. Google Drive is the closest to this but it only has a single provider and other issues[0]. I'm sad remoteStorage never caught on. I really hope Solid does well but it feels too complex to me. My own take on the problem is https://gemdrive.io/, but it's mostly on hold while I'm focused on other parts of the self-hosting stack.[0]: https://gdrivemusic.com/helpreplysimonw 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] Absolutely this. I would LOVE to be able to build apps that store people's data in their own S3 bucket, billed to their own account.Doing that right now is monumentally difficult. I built an entire CLI app just for solving the \"issue AWS credentials that can only access this specific bucket\" problem, but I really don't want to have to talk my users through installing and running something like that: https://s3-credentials.readthedocs.io/en/stable/replygusmd 3 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] You can get close with a Cognito Identity Pool that exchanges your user's keys for AWS credentials associated with an IAM role that has access to the resources you want to read/write on their behalf. Pretty standard pattern.https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/co...edit: I think I misread your comment.

It would really force companies whose products are UIs on top of S3 to compete hard because adversarial interoperability would be an ever present threat from your competitors.It really is such a shame that all the projects that tried/are trying to create data sovereignty for users became weird crypto.replyttymck 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I agree with both halves of your comment, but I realized I can't identify the connection between S3 oauth and data sovereignty. Could you elaborate?replySpivak 3 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So the idea would be that you have an account with AWS (or realistically a more consumer friendly service that's Amazon branded) where all your data lives. Then when you use say Dropbox you can pick \"Use my own storage\" and grant Dropbox via OAuth the ability to write to /dropbox in your bucket and all your files would live there instead of Dropbox's servers. Lots of the data sovereignty solutions also include a database like interface you can grant apps the ability to use but I can't imagine that catching on initially.Apple actually already does this with iCloud storage but hides it really well so it feels seamless.replymannyv 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] What most people don't realize is that the magic isn't in handling the system itself; the magic is making authorization appear to be zero-cost.In distributed systems authorization is incredibly difficult. At the scale of AWS it might as well be magic. AWS has a rich permissions model with changes to authorization bubbling through the infrastructure at sub-millisecond speed - while handling probably trillions of requests.This and logging/accounting for billing are the two magic pieces of AWS that I'd love to see an article about.Note that S3 does AA differently than other services, because the permissions are on the resource. I suspect that's for speed?replyawithrow 5 minutes ago | parent | next [–] Keep in mind that S3 predates IAM by several years. So part of the reason that access to buckets/keys is special is because it was already in place by the time IAM came around.Its likely persisted since than largely since removing the old model would be a difficult taks without potentially breaking a lot of customer's setupreplyjl6 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] Great to see Amazon employees being allowed to talk openly about how S3 works behind the scenes. I would love to hear more about how Glacier works. As far as I know, they have never revealed what the underlying storage medium is, leading to a lot of wild speculation (tape? offline HDDs? custom HDDs?).replyblindhippo 4 hours ago | parent | next [–] Amazon engineer here - can confirm that Glacier transcodes all data on to the backs of the shells of the turtles that hold up the universe.

Bu then climate change happened so they quickly shifted to tiered storage of tape and hard drives.replyjakupovic 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] The part about distributing loads takes me back to S3 KeyMap days and me trying to migrate to it, from initial implementation. What I learned is that even after you identify the hottest objects/partitions/buckets you cannot simply move them and be done. Everything had to be sorted. The actual solution was to sort and then divide the host's partition load into quartiles and move the second quartile partitions onto the least loaded hosts. If one tried to move the hottest buckets, 1st quartile, it would put even more load on the remaining members which would fail, over and over again.Another side effect was that the error rate went from steady ~1% to days without any errors. Consequently we updated the alerts to be much stricter. This was around 2009 or so.Also came from academic background, UM, but instead of getting my PhD I joined S3.

    "originBody": "WriteSign upSign InNo One Wants To Talk To Your ChatbotLucas McGregor·Follow5 min read · Jul 1666Dearly beloved, we are gather here today to talk about this thing called chat. Electric word, “chatbot”. It means automation of human interactions and that’s a mighty cost effective thing. But I am here to tell you, no one wants to talk to your chatbot.So before you call up your programmers, and ask them about ChatGPT. Before you launch yet another automated calling system or virtual assistant, put down the Large Language Model. Don’t go crazy. It’s all be done before…Party Like It’s 1999In the late 90’s, it was a race to build commercial websites. We imagined that users would create direct relationships with our URLs. We imagined there would be brand loyalty. We scrambled to buy meaningful domain names. (My company sold start.com to Microsoft. We were very excited!).In our glorious future, websites would be the next generation of applications. Just like millions of users clicked on an Excel or Word icon on their desktops, millions would launch our websites from their bookmark bars. We were the apps and the browser was the new OS.But of course, that isn’t how it worked out. It was the search engines that became to the entry point for users. We watched most users launch their browsers to Google and then search for us.We tried everything to get them to come to us directly. We added buttons to our sites that would automatically bookmark us. We worked with browser and computer manufacturers to pre-install our links. There is a still a host of shady browser toolbars and plugins that try to get their sites directly in front of users.But the users have spoken. In response, we have created SEO, a whole new field of marketing to search engine algorithms in hopes that down the line they will market us to humans.We are the apps. The browser is the new OS. But the search engine turned out to be the main interface. It is the shell that wraps all the apps.Rise of the AppsIn 2007, 14 years after the launch of the web, 9 years after Google introduced their search; the iPhone launched. There had been other mobile platforms that came earlier, but none that reached the scale of the iTunes App Store (Now just the App Store).All of a sudden, our dreams were coming true. We had our icons on the screen. Users launched us directly. Once installed, we didn’t have to continually re-invest in SEO for users to find our app versus others. Our websites became apps and we had full relationships with our users. Or, so we thought.Apps were the new applications and iOS/Android was the new OS.Apps are not Applications.Apps are limited. They fit on smaller screens and can be used with only a few finger swipes and clicks. They don’t have mice, right-clicks, and sub-menus. Users don’t save and open files. Apps, and users, rely on their host OS for most advanced functions.The OS handles payments, security, sharing, etc. As more features get handled by the OS, the more they become first point of contact with the user. The more the user has a relationship with their device and less with their apps.Rise of the AssistantsIn 2010, Apple launched Siri on MacOS (OS X back then) and added it to their iPhones in 2011. MicroSoft and Amazon followed suite in 2014 and Google’s assistant joined in 2016. Microsoft shutdown their assistant, Cortana, in 2020, but their voice assistant has merged with their search as part of Bing. (MicroSoft has been trying to crack the virtual assistant market since 1997 with Clippy!)Up until now these voice powered personal assistants have been mostly curiosities, used for simple tasks like checking the weather, turning on or off lights, or playing music.But if you look at the OS APIs, each company has been creating deeper integrations with their virtual personal assistants and their hosted Apps. iPhone and Android allow apps to chat through their assistance, expose functionality, and offer input. Siri can pull weather from one app, your calendar from another, and check traffic and directions from a third to offer you a complex and well informed dialogue.Amazon’s Alexa is more direct. In addition to accessing your apps, developers can create Amazon Alexa Skills, programs which expand your Alexa virtual assistant with new capabilities. Skills can only be accessed via Alexa. Users talk to Alexa and skills respond back through her and in her voice.Language Has Been the LogjamUp until now, all of these virtual assistants have been held back by their lack of language skills. Anything beyond simple tasks become either comical and/or frustrating. You can get stonewalled by a benign “I don’t understand” to sidetracked by your assistant totally misunderstanding your request and launching the wrong thing.Suddenly with Large Language Models (LLM) and each of these companies running their own LLM as a Service, these virtual assistants will see massive upgrades. Now they will understand not just you, but also the output of of your apps and skills.The Relationship Is With The AssistantApple and Amazon sell hardware. They are less interested in trying to monetize free users. Google and MicroSoft do both, but still want to own your device and assistant. They sell the operating system (and bundled assistant) that powers much of our hardware.Their devices are in our pockets and our houses. We trust these companies with our personal clouds: our payments, our histories, our contacts, our logins, etc. They are the first devices we interact with when we wakeup and the last screens we stare at before going to sleep. We know their names and voices.We have been trained to call on them personally and we don’t switch easily. We have all seen a frustrated friend trying to talk to our Alexa by asking it “Hey Siri,” and trying to figure out why she won’t respond.With LLM, these personal virtual assistants are the new starting point. They will be to apps what Google and Bing are to the web.Few people will be willing to interact with an army of different chatbots and online assistants. They will expect these other chat enabled systems to speak to and through their personal virtual assistant. They will log into their smart phone and expect all the other apps and skills to integrate with their personal clouds, arbitrated by their trusted personal virtual assistant.When they do come directly to your site or app, they are not looking for a chatbot. They are looking for a UI that works. They know why they came to you. They expect your UI to do what it should do.If you have a chatbot, it is for Sir or Alexa to use, not people. I am here to tell you, no human wants to talk to your chatbot.Support independent authors and access the best of Medium. Authors earn when you read member-only stories.

The dream it seems to tap into is \"You don't need to deal with the arbitrary whims of 5 different groups of web designers, just talk to one thing and get a single response.\" When faced with the state of the modern web chatbots actually are preferable, sorry.A great problematic side effect of the web being so ad-driven is it leads to confusing the user interface, which can host ads, with the information. We need publishers to be able to make money from content without ads, and to be able to make money from providing it in raw form via APIs to third parties. It's that or the chatbot intermediaries are going to take over.replydvngnt_ 7 hours ago | parent | next [–] I can't wait for the major llm to place ads in the responses to extract more moneyCertainly!

Of course it will. I see no reason to believe AI will change the fundamental power structures, incentives and disrespect for human beings. New tech often has a little honeymoon phase where you get a few breadcrumbs more in order to try the new thing.Anyway, it’s not like the different actors desperately trying to steal your attention today will go away because the UI is different. So if the issue with todays tech is ads, upselling, cookie forms etc then hoping that it will “go away” with LLMs is hilariously hopeful.replygumby 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] You know this is coming with Uber: you book an Uber to a fancy restaurant and get Macdonald’s ads in the app, and then the driver’s app picks a route that drives past Macdonald’s and tells them to offer you a $5 off coupon on any order in the next 10 minutes.replyportmanteur 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Who chooses to stop at McDonald's instead of a fancy restaurant, just to save $5?replyNegativeK 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I assume that contrast is to point out how completely off the mark ads often are.replyjrflowers 6 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sometimes you just want nuggetsreplymudlus 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Doesn't matter, we're all talking about McDonalds now.replyjwie 6 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] It’s a segmentation issue.

I'm willing to bet they'll be wrong about this one as well.I'll note that just because websites ended up needing SEO it doesn't mean creating websites was a mistake. Early on in internet history there were two important fights: the first was about whether we needed websites at all. One view held that the _internet_ was valuable but websites were a novelty. Applications on your computer that you install would leverage your internet connection to transmit data. The second view held that you'd eventually only have a single application on your computer: your web browser (essentially every computer would be a chromebook). Obviously we ended up much closer to view 2 but it's not hard to imagine a world where view 1 won - just look at the way people install apps on phones.The other important fight was whether the web should be more like broadcast or cable. One view held the web would be agnostic of your provider - you pay for access to the internet and then you can access whatever you want. The other view held that each provider would have its own unique set of websites that subscribers would get access to. If you are old enough to remember AOL keywords you might be able to see how this vision was in the works.It seems like the author was upset the open internet (first view) won.The author and I agree about one thing: the first time ever I feel like voice can be a first order input mechanism. I know that we've had Siri and Alexa for a while but they've been a chore to use as perfectly articulated in the author's section \"Language Has Been the Logjam\".Now it seems their world view is that we'll all be writing plugins for Siri or Alexa or whatever voice platform is dominate. That sounds to me like saying \"don't bother making websites or apps - just make APIs\" (by the way that was another real worldview that got some traction about 15 years ago). So let me present two alternative scenarios that could play out:First - we could end up with a proliferation of bots each bespoke. I know many different people. I wouldn't ask my friend from IT about organic chemistry and I wouldn't ask my biology professor buddy about directions around my town he's never visited. If our programs become more lifelike it's possible that same circuitry in our brains that allows us to remember people can be coopted to remember programs and they'll want each one to be distinct.Second - maybe there will be a common voice interface but each bot will still generate its own text. Just like not every company builds a web browser but everyone still makes their own websites. Like the SEO and app stores mentioned in the article you might have to play by the rules of the platform you're on but ultimately you're still running your own LLM for your application.replymaximinus_thrax 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] I don't use this expression often, but I think it fits in this context.

If you look at what the term has been referring to in the last decade or so, it's not really the AI assistants like Alexa or Siri. The best ones are primarily a customer service tool that helps people triage problems on their own and reduce the need for a human in the loop. They're not do-it-all human assistant replacements. I agree, generally, with the premise that a better UI > an OK chatbot. And ultimately, there are a whole host of problems that chatbots with complex decision trees or even LLMs can't solve, so a chatbot alone isn't really the solution. The combination of chatbot + escalation path to human agent does work pretty well, though.replyeskibars 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] I think there are multiple facets to this argument (both for and against). Yeah, a lot of chatbots are so \"stupid\" or at least so obviously non-human that as a user, I have absolutely no desire to interact with them. They waste my time and I end up doing the same thing as I sometimes need to do with automated phone systems: press the virtual equivalent of \"0\" to try to get connected with a real human.But that is starting to change: some chatbots can now start understanding and interacting like humans. As a user, when that's the case, I don't personally care what is powering the thing behind the scenes. In fact, I'd generally prefer a bot if it's as good as a good human: the number of times I've had 45 minute or longer sessions with some human support agent that: 1) Just didn't listen to what I was looking for 2) Had difficulty communicating because I started a chat on an evening/weekend and got routed to someone who had English as a second language 3) Couldn't actually figure out how to solve some problem, so I had to start a new conversation of the same substance the next day 4) Didn't actually log the notes of my chat for the next agent, so I had to repeat myself etcis just completely off the charts and it's anecdotally gotten worse in my experience in the past few years.replyeskibars 6 hours ago | parent | next [–] Also, many times I've had to wait 5 minutes for an agent to respond at all (presumably because they're way oversubscribed) and then had the \"chat with an agent\" thing time out and disconnect me entirely after 10 minutes is so frustrating.. Yeah, I went and grabbed a water/coffee/went for a bio break because your agent hasn't responded to my last message for 7 minutes. But then you disconnect me after 5 minutes of \"inactivity\" and ask me to hop on a new chat with the next agent that will not have any history from the previous chat? I could do with a lot less of that in my life.replyrazemio 6 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Same experience here. It always depends. 2 month ago I was surprised, that a chatbot was able to solve my somewhat complex problem in no time, with a text by text guide. It was also able to awnser follow up questions.replyasdff 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] At least with some websites, you can eventually get through. I managed to get through the one at adobe by complaining incessantly about it and asking for a human for probably 20 minutes, and was routed to an actual human who solved my problem of not finding the download link for an old version of some of their software by giving me a direct download link to this version in about 30 seconds. If the process had merely started with the customer service representative rather than the bot, I'd be raving about the experience of solving my problem in moments.I'm starting to think I should write my own bot who can do the 20 minutes of back and forth with the customer service bot. Then ping me when its time to actually pay attention.replyversion_five 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] Chatbot is fine as a search alternative, and there's stuff I find more convenient asking chatgpt than looking up and synthesizing myself to figure out the answer.Chat is the worst possible interface to a fixed menu system, which is the only way it gets used in public facing customer service.If a company had an optional \"faq chatbot\" you could talk to, nobody would complain. It's using it to block human interaction while pretending to be able to help that infuriates people.replydools 1 hour ago | prev | next [–] I would gladly use a chat bot if they were even remotely useful. But the thing everyone seems to do which is to present you a bunch of buttons anyway is no different from a web based menu and the only thing I use them for is to get connected to a human who can actually do something.I would LOVE if I could go to a website, click chat, and actually chat, and have my issue resolved, by a bot.replypotatoman22 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] I found maybe the first chatbot I found helpful today.

What I object to is the fact that they're used to BS people rather than address problems, and that often they're actively trying to fake out users.The thing is that some corporations have a policy of lying to their customers. I once sat in a bank arguing for an hour with a branch and regional district manager about specious overdraft charges, until it reached a point where I itemized details of the charges and their increasingly contradictory/counterfactual statements on a sheet of paper and invited them to try out their act in a courtroom. At that point I received a large refund.IF you build a chatbot that's designed to only ever say and do things that benefit the bot's owner, of course people are going to hate it and demand to be connected to a human or give up in frustration. If you make a bullshit-free one that is designed to resolve problems in a manner consistent with the UCC or clear corporate commitments (not a sub-sub-sub-clause on page 73 of a densely written TOS agreement that not even the CEO has ever read), then you might find customers like it.replyHavoc 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] >They will expect these other chat enabled systems to speak to and through their personal virtual assistant.I'd say consumers are going to lose that battle.A bit like nobody wants to be subscribed to half a dozen video streaming services yet here we are.replyharry8 3 hours ago | parent | next [–] >A bit like nobody wants to be subscribed to half a dozen video streaming services yet here we are.Are we?

I'd be interested in statistics on how many smartphone users actually use the voice assistant for more than a couple simple questions once or twice a month.replythrowanem 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] No one wants to talk to a chatbot that's useless.Up to now, \"useless\" was implicit in \"chatbot\".

I've had great success with Amazon's customer service chatbot, Meta's CS bot, and many others. Sometimes they do help me with what I need and it speeds up my workflow.

Even with humans, I'd much rather not try to explain my problems to a person who may not be a native speaker, who may not understand well the problem domain, and who may not have much power to do anything.But even talking to an actual pro is most of the time something I'd rather avoid -- it's after all best if whatever I need is doable without needing extra help.I think a chat bot is going to be very rarely seen as an actual perk by an end user, except in some specific domains like game NPCs. It's more likely to be used as a first line of support or similar to save costs, as something better than a phone menu system.I can see them also being a perk for users of very large systems like AWS, where reading the docs can get overwhelming, and search may not work well because you may need to know the specific terms you have to search for.replykaraterobot 6 hours ago | prev | next [–] Looking past a lot of unnecessary verbiage, I think he's saying that everything that you might want a chatbot on your website to handle should instead be integrated with ChatGPT (or its replacement) in the future. And that you should just have your web app, doing its thing, and not bolt on an isolated version of a chatbot that is only used for interacting with your specific site. The assumption is that people will want to talk to chatbots, just not your chatbot: they want a one-stop shop with every chatbot in the same app.I see the point, not sure I agree totally.I'm not someone who ever wants to talk to a chatbot, but sometimes I am forced to. I suppose that it is better in such cases to have a single place I go for that. On the other hand, if my confusion begins on your website, I would hope that your website would help me resolve it: if I have to go from yourwebapp.com, to a third party application, then type \"how do I do X on yourwebapp.com?\" that seems convoluted. Perhaps a browser-level integration, or at least replacing the proprietary chatbot with a doorway to that single, unified chatbot.Hmm, I dunno. Sounds like whoever runs such a chatbot would have their hands around the throat of the web, doesn't it?replyquantified 2 hours ago | prev | next [–] Expedia has only a chatbot that requires an itinerary to get you to a human, and yet for some of us the login system itself is broken so good luck finding any help.

In voice? Is that going to work, or just create inter-machine misunderstandings?- Whose agent is it anyway? It would be useful to have a personal agent that works for you, not for someone who's trying to sell you something. We may see that as an expensive paid product, but the free ones work for the man, not for you.- It's worth getting a basic understanding of the law of principal and agent. Who works for whom? What is the authority of an agent? Who takes on risk, the principal or the agent? Who pays when an agent exceeds their authority?

Specifically there is structured data that I want to search (e.g. what move type does 4x damage to pokemon of type1, type2?) using the voice assistant.

I asked how to change the option, and it responded with a link to the exact screen I was looking for. The reason I couldn't find it was because it was called something different than I thought. I never would have found it otherwise.That's when I realized a core use case for these sorts of bots: Navigating complex interfaces. As much as UX designers want to make UIs \"intuitive\", there comes a tipping point of complexity where a UI can only do so much to guide you. Bots are like that kid next door who's \"good at computers\", or a tech support agent on the phone, who can help you do something you just couldn't work out on your own because of terminology or misunderstanding.As much as people are wary of Microsoft's Copilot integration into Windows due to the legacy of Clippy and Cortana, I think it's going to be a huge success and an archetype of future HCI.replyrenewiltord 7 hours ago | prev | next [–] Far prefer chatbot to IVR menu.replyAtNightWeCode 5 hours ago | prev | next [–] I think the article is somewhat incorrect.

Not only that but basic help with research etc... instead of googling. That's amazing and staggering.

It's the first time a conversational AI has impressed me. I can just about find the edges (short memory, relentlessly positive) but in the space of an hour it's given reasonably good advice on social situations, answered questions about how it works and even recommended some great niche bands based on my existing tastes. Just as you said, its knowledge seems to be extremely broad.There's a contrast between Pi and the kind of chatbot discussed in the article. When we talk to Pi we don't expect it to do anything for us - it just gives advice and makes suggestions that we can take or leave. The resulting stream of tokens matches our expectations enough to satisfy us.A chatbot on a company's website however, probably we are talking to that because we want something to happen. \"Please fix my account\", \"my last bill was wrong\" etc. As the chatbot isn't integrated with the company's processes it can't actually change the state of the outside world and so talking to it will be a frustrating experience.

Fundraising Acquisition Suing Shopify Ignoring the Shopify ToS update Conclusion Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Historically, Shopify has always had a checkout problem. You were always able to customize your storefront UX until the checkout, but after you click checkout, you were locked into an old-school multi-step checkout with no flexibility whatsoever. Shopify finally introduced a one-page checkout 5 years after Checkout X first launched, Shopify is finally stepping up its checkout game and offers: One-page checkout with a minimal number of fields (soon-ish*) Address autofill Customizable sections Post-purchase capabilities Sure, their one-page checkout is only available for Shopify Plus merchants, and their post-purchase upsells only work with credit cards and PayPal (when they work; their API is buggy AF), but let's say they've almost managed to catch up. 5 years ago, I bootstrapped Checkout X, which did all of the following: One-page Shopify checkout with post-purchase upsells. It grew to 6,000 active merchants. It generated €600k in monthly recurring revenue. It processed millions of transactions every year. However, Shopify killed it - just because merchants were choosing our solution over theirs. As I move on to new adventures and Shopify seems to be taking their checkout seriously now, it's a good time to share the full story of Checkout X. Backstory It all started in 2017 when I quit my UI/UX Designer job in order to create & pursue “my own business”.By the time I had started and operated a couple of Shopify dropshipping stores, which did fairly well and gave me the confidence that I can actually create a company myself. The problem was, dropshipping is super competitive and many of my competitors were just better than me. So I thought to myself: When Everybody Is Digging for Gold, It’s Good To Be in the Pick and Shovel Business I had experience with designing and building different web apps so I know exactly what I wanted to do full time - make Shopify apps. ✨✍️ I drew the following plan: Create a small Shopify app and get some customers to get a feel for the market Create a bigger Shopify app that’s successful and generates enough money so I don’t have to be worried about working for a living Create a business that changes the game ( Future me is so proud to see points 1 and 2 completed ✅ 🙏 ) So I got thinking. What app should I build?What apps/add-ons bring the most value ( revenue ) to my dropshipping stores? Was Oberlo ( app for sourcing products / delivery of my orders ) Was some custom javascript I wrote that was offering small upsells before checkout. Jackpot! 🎰 So, that’s how Upsell X was born:   It took me a while to build it - it was the first software I coded myself, but in the Fall of 2017 - Upsell X was launched. And it worked!Over the next couple of months I got a couple of hundred of merchants and I was making $1k-$2k a month from it. Major win for me! 🤘 How Checkout X was born Around that time I decided to move back to my hometown of Sofia, BG 🇧🇬 ( was living in 🇫🇷 France before ) and long-story short: Met with a friend Decided to open an online pharmacy together ( dumb idea 🤦‍♂️ ) Decided the pharmacy will be running on Shopify Had to find a payment provider that works with Shopify Bulgarian entities Companies that sell “legit drugs” on the internet Needles to say - our business plan had a couple of flaws. But the payment aspect was absurd - there was absolutely no way to accept credit card payments.Back in the time Stripe didn’t operate in Bulgaria. The couple of other companies that were allowed on Shopify ran as far as they could when they heard we’re some Bulgarians looking to sell drugs. I was stuck…There were Bulgarian payment providers that would onboard us but they wouldn’t be allowed on Shopify There were Shopify-approved payment providers but they didn’t want to work with us. So I got thinking - can’t I just bypass their checkout and integrate whatever I want? 🤔 Yeah I could! That’s how the first version of Checkout X was born:  Needless to say, our pharmacy idea didn’t go far. But I had solved another problem - I could connect any Payment Provider to Shopify 🤯 First business plan: Checkout X for payment providers My first business plan was simple: Find Payment Providers that are not allowed on Shopify Integrate them with Checkout X Make them promote Checkout X as an integration solution to their customers   Actual slide from my presentation to BlueSnap I spent a couple of months talking to dozen of different payment providers. Most were “interested” but we never really went anywhere. The only company that we made an agreement with was Bluesnap, which brought some customers, but not as many as I was hoping for. Second try: One page checkout with post-purchase upsells One day, while I was working on Checkout X - I got a support ticket from one of the Upsell X customers - Super-prix.fr   Super Prix was one of the pioneers of french dropshipping at the time. While I was dropshipping, I was constantly “copying” what they were doing. They were 🤩 DS Rockstars in my mind. I don’t really remember what the support ticket was about, but one thing went to another and they asked me - “Can you integrate post-purchase upsells?” I paused for a moment… I thought about it… and I told them that I’m making a checkout product and that it should be possible to add post-purchase upsells. They replied:“We need a one-page checkout page with post-purchase upsells. How much will it cost us?” With a little bit back & forth I estimated they would be spending ~€5k/month per month if I managed to get all of their shops on Checkout X. I asked them to prepay €5k, so I’m sure they won’t change their mind later on.They agreed and sent me the €5k via PayPal.I WENT NUTS 🤯🤯🤯 €5k / month was huge for me: It meant I can work full-time on the project without worrying about paying the bills.It meant that Checkout X will be making 3X more than Upsell X from a single customer. I honestly thought - “I made it”. Launching the app One of the first iteration for one of the stores of the Super-prix.fr guys - they wanted a custom design for their store. I know it looked ugly - but it converted well. Those guys are pioneers in making sites convert. When we first talked, I promised the Super Prix guys that their custom one-page checkout with post-purchase upsells will be ready in 2 months and I sticked to it.2 months later I visited them in 🇧🇪 Belgium and prepared to do a test-launch on one of their stores. We launched it together… 🚀 It was a shit show… 💩 They disabled the checkout after 2 hours… 🤦‍♂️ The checkout was working great - I had tested it from end to end. What didn’t work was all of the services that relied on the checkout. Here’s a list of some of the things that didn’t work: Metrics Any pixel tracking ( Facebook Ads / Google Ads / etc ) Abandoned checkout emails SMS abandoned cart FB Messenger abandoned cart ( it was a thing back then ) Refunds   There was no way that they could use the checkout until all of their services worked - I had no idea how I missed all those things. Worse, I had no idea how to fix those problems. I promised to find a solution somehow and had a long trip home.   It took me the whole summer to solve most of the issues.Some things I managed to integrate, some things I had to rebuild myself, but in September of 2018 we finally launched on one of their stores. Then we added more.Finally, the app was live. 🚀The first 100 customers One of the first designs for the mainstream Checkout X product Once the SuperPrix guys onboarded all of their shops and things were stable ( relatively 🙄 ) I started working towards getting more customers. At the time, every customer had to be onboarded manually. I had to explain to them all the weird stuff that the app brought with it ( custom metrics ; integrations; etc ) and I had to add custom code to their shop.Slowly but surely I got to my first 100 customers using the following channels: Bluesnap partnership At the time Bluesnap got kicked out of Shopify ( not sure why ) so they referred us to prospects that were on Shopify.We had a lot of issues in our partnership, merchants were signing up for a payment provider and they were forced to use a custom checkout with all it’s quirks ( and benefits ).The thing was, Bluesnap was selling their benefits, not ours - so the merchants were confused on why they had to use an alternative checkout.It was tough but I got some of my first customer from them - I guess it was worth it. Negative virality For most products - being viral means that your existing users would recommend it to their friends. With Checkout X it was the opposite: Competitors of our customers were copying what our customers were doing.When they saw a custom one-page checkout on their stores - they went nuts.They needed to know how is this possible on Shopify? 🤔 How can they have it on their shop? We left breadcrumbs to Checkout X SuperPrix didn’t allow us to put our logo on their checkout ( which we did later on other stores ) - but they didn’t say anything about the code.So we spammed our page source and console with marketing messages. And it people found it!When you opened the page source or the console you would see that Checkout X is powering a certain checkout Merchants copying the stores of our customers was the main acquisition channel for Checkout X until the end. Scaling to 6000 customersOver the years we eventually reached 6000 customers. Which isn’t a ton, but with €100 average revenue per store, we reached a record of €600k monthly revenue 🤯 We never ran paid ads. We were never listed on the Shopify App Store.All of our customers came from two channels: Virality - Merchants copying each other and merchants recommending us Affiliates - We were paying commissions to whoever brought customers The key to a good affiliate program Our affiliate program was simple. You bring a customer and we pay you 15-25% of the revenue we make from that customer. Forever. Some Youtube videos advertising Checkout X That’s pretty standard. The reason why our affiliate program worked so well ( brought around 40% of our customers ) was because affiliates actually used our product and liked it. All of the affiliates we onboarded approached us first. Later on with Vanga AI, we tried replicating the same strategy and it was much harder, mainly because the influencers that we targeted never used Vanga AI before. ✌️ I’ve worked with hundreds of SaaS influencers over the years and I’ve found success with them on multiple apps. If you need help with employing influencer marketing for your SaaS feel free to reach out. If you want influencers to want to work with you - make sure they use your product and they find it useful. Otherwise it’s an uphill battle. Scaling the team I started Checkout X alone. I tried attracting a co-founder on a couple of occasions but things just didn’t work out. I had to do design, programming, marketing, sales, administration, etc by myself.It was a lot of work and there were a lot of challenges, but there was no one else to do it and I didn’t want to worry about paying someone’s salary without being sure I can afford it. I wanted to wait until the right moment. First hire Around a year after launching, I’d gotten to around 100 customers and onboarding/supporting merchants was starting to become a hassle.I decided it’s finally time to make my first hire - a CS rep 👩‍💻. I hired Karolina. She had the following responsibilities: Onboarding customers ( adding javascript to their code, debugging it, helping them set up their payment methods & design ) Supporting existing customersThe moment I hired her we both realised that: She has no JS knowledge so she can’t onboard merchants There is no admin panel to support the customers - everything was done through the Rails Console ( programmer tool ) We had to do a lot of work before we can do the work.For the first month all she did was learning basic coding skills while I dropped everything else and started implementing an admin panel. Our first ever team retreat in Batumi, Georgia 🇬🇪 Hiring developers As the project kept growing I found myself being overwhelmed with all the 🔥 fires I had to put out while trying to integrate more and more services with the checkout ( every customer has a slightly different stack for payments, marketing tools, etc ). The checkout is a crucial piece of technology - it’s where the actual purchase happen. In order to make everything work flawlessly, we had to build a mini shadow-Shopify that runs on the background. Checkout X handles products, customers, discounts, taxes, payments, analytics, themes, emails, integrations and so on. It’s a huge product.I desperately needed help and I finally had some good cashflow so I decided it’s time to hire some devs. As I wanted flexibility and wanted to hire fast I just went on Upwork and started looking for Rails Devs that had experience with Shopify. Almost instantly I managed to hire Niko & Vlad who were just finishing another Shopify project - it was an instant match. So I just fully booked their calendar. Hiring a CDO, CTO, more devs, support, partnerships Snapshot of some of the team members - our WooCommerce launch party in Sofia, BG 🇧🇬 We were always very conservative with hiring - we never wanted to be a big company. My thinking was - wherever there is a repeatable batch of work that can be allocated to someone - we’d look for such person. Someone needed to do constant iteration over our UX/UI - We hired Stoyan as our CDO Tech complexity increased and we needed someone to scale our technology & dev process - We hired Ventsi as our CTO We needed more dev power - We hired Alexey, Gokhan, Hristo, Valyo, G1, G2, Krum, Svetlin, We needed more support & onboarding agents - we hired Ksenia, Lucian, Daya We needed help with partnerships & marketing - we hired Jindra, Misho, Tina The highest headcount we had a at a particular time was 16 people - all remote 🇧🇬🇬🇪🇷🇺🇵🇱🇬🇧🇺🇦🇷🇴🇨🇿 All those guys & gals were awesome every day and working with them was super enjoyable. I always had the idea I’m goofing around with friends, never felt like boring work.Thank you for all the awesome moments - Checkout X team. You guys were awesome 🙌 How Shopify killed our business Now, let’s be clear on something - Checkout X was born out of wedlock.Control over the checkout is the centerstone of Shopify’s business.It allows them to: Push their payment solution - Shopify Payments Push their fulfillment solution - Shopify Fulfillments Push their “marketplace” app - Shop Pay Collect commissions from other payment providers Collect 0.5%-2% revenue commission on stores that don’t use Shopify Payments I was never so naive to believe that they’ll just let me go around forever, piggyback on their platform and reap most of the benefits. Even though what we were doing was not forbidden - it was clear that Shopify would disapprove of it. My main logic was always - as long as we’re not breaking Shopify’s Terms of Service, we’re not doing any harm to the merchants. Were there ways in which we could co-exist in a non-parasitic relation with Shopify achieving all of their checkout objectives and collecting all their revenue? - yes!We’ve made such proposals to them, but they decided it’s easier for them to get rid of us.Checkout was a grey area in the beginning When I started building Checkout X there were no rules against such solutions and there were already similar products built by other companies - most notably Bold Checkout, so I decided to give it a go.At the same time - as I mentioned, I expected they won’t be happy with the solution so I never bothered applying for the Shopify App store. One crucial mistake I made - I didn’t create a separate partner account so the Checkout X unlisted app was on the same partner account as Upsell X. Spring of 2019 - Shopify changed their rules In the spring of 2019 there was a ToS update that said building public checkout apps is forbidden unless you get a written permission from Shopify.We contacted Shopify ASAP and they connected us to a rep who replied in an email - “you’re allowed to do that for now”. Thank god we fucking did that! 🙏 A week later another Shopify rep sends us an email telling us we have 3 days to tell our customers we’re stopping the service because of breaking the ToS.We had to react lightning fast and show screenshots of our other email communication and thankfully this agent didn’t delete our app - close call.⚠️  Remember: A Shopify app is always a single-click away from being deleted from someone that works there. Even if you got a permission written permission from somebody else. After this communication - came silence. Nobody told us anything. 😴 So in the summer we decided to go to Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦 and meet the Shopify team in person.Me and Karolina @ Shopify Unite 2019 Shopify Unite was a great event.We managed to meet Jason in person and he was pretty cool - he told us not to worry, that they’re thinking of ways to make what we do possible within the checkout and that they’d be communicating with us what’s happening. They also announced they’re working on native Post-purchase upsell APIs while we were there.But in the end - we achieved nothing. There was no communication on what we’re supposed to do or what to expect.We just kept operating in the dark waiting for something bad to happen to us. January 2020 - We get locked out of our appOne day I get this email: I had mixed feelings. I was starstruck ( Harley is an idol for me ) and scared at the same time. I had a call with Harley and he was pretty nice: He told me in plain words they don’t want us to continue operating and that they’re locking our API key for new installs as we speak.He told me to wait for “the new checkout APIs” that will be coming in the future and that if we cooperate we’re going to get early access. And just like that, we could no longer onboard new customers…There was just one thing though… The new Shopify ToS said the following: \"not use an alternative to Shopify Checkout for web checkout or payment processing, or register any transactions through the Shopify API, without Shopify’s express written authorization. This Section 2.3.18 only applies to Public Applications.” So… theoretically we could always make private apps? 😅 ℹ️ Private apps means that each merchant can create their “own APP” just for their shop and send us their API keys. It’s pretty much the same, but it’s designed for shops that need to make something custom just for themselves. In simple words: it’s a loophole. We had a choice: Option A - Stop what we’re doing, downscale the business and wait for the new APIs. ( They eventually launched 1-2 years later ) Option B - Make Checkout X work with Private Apps. Keep onboarding new merchants. Anger Shopify & disappoint Harley 😢 I chose option B.The ToS allowed it and that was the only realistic option to continue operating as a business. We kept onboarding new stores and Checkout X kept growing. April 2020 - Shopify hijacks Upsell X A while later, Shopify saw what we were doing with the private apps and decided to block our partner account - which held Upsell X. Initially they quoted violation of the Partner Program Agreement and Terms of Service, but when pressed further they admitted we’re not breaking their ToS.   As Checkout X was using private apps at this point, the only result was that they locked us out of Upsell X and we couldn’t support it anymore. Even further - they kept charging merchants for Upsell X - but we never received those payouts.January 2021 - They finally changed their ToS At the end of 2020 they finally changed their Terms of Service. No more alternative checkouts, not on Public apps, not on Private apps. It was time to stop: Breaking the ToS meant our merchants can be banned ( and lose their business ) because they’re using our service. We were tired of being treated like parasites 🐛. We invested millions in bringing a top-notch checkout experience to Shopify, which our customers loved (and Shopify copied in some cases ) - at the end all we got was a constant hostility. We talked to Shopify once again - they weren’t interested in any collaboration. So we agreed to stop onboarding new customers, they agreed to let us support current merchants. We announced the news, gave people 14 days heads up and closed installations.For good.Aftermath There were so many people asking us to onboard them after the change, it was heartbreaking. We had to say NO to new customers literally thousands of times. 💔 Some merchants even created multiple Shopify stores, installed Checkout X before the close-off and started selling Checkout X enabled stores after the change. 🤯 Shopify also dedicated some of their employees to pretend to be desperate Checkout X customers and beg our support to let them in. Not sure if I should be proud or annoyed by such pitiful actions. Checkout X is still operating today. We still support Shopify merchants that installed the app before the closing of the installations, but we haven’t onboarded new ones for the past two years. Porting Checkout X to WooCommerce The obvious move to survive the Shopify ban was to open Checkout X for other platforms. We tried. We spent way too much time porting Checkout X to WooCommerce and supporting both Shopify and WooCommerce simultaneously. The project was a disaster. 🤦‍♂️ It took us much more dev resources than we planned initially and at the end we couldn’t really market it well. WooCommerce is a very different platform from Shopify, so Checkout X wasn’t the right product for it. The platform has different needs ( it has one-page checkout & upsells ) and plugins there are expected to work differently. We have some customers on WooCommerce but it’s nothing like Shopify. We were so cocky because of our success on Shopify that we never stopped to think if anyone on Woo needs our product. We haven’t tried other platforms. What could have we done differently? Pain + reflection = progress. Right? Checkout X was ( and still is ) a wild journey 🎢. I know that some choices I made were good, some weren’t.Looking back there were a couple of ♟️ key moves we could’ve played differently. Fundraising We had multiple opportunities to fundraise. I had the chance to speak to some world-class VCs and I had tremendous support from the Bulgarian startup ecosystem. ( Thanks to everyone for the opportunities. 🙏 ) I always saw Checkout X as a limited-time-window opportunity and honestly I couldn’t see a future different to what happened to us. ( Maybe that’s why things turned out this way ) The reasons I didn’t want to take funding were: I didn’t want the investors to lose their money on me I didn’t see how funding would solve any of our problems I didn’t want to be stuck building Checkout X beyond Shopify, just because we have money in the bank I wanted to be able to cash out and leave at any moment Looking back, maybe if we managed to get the right investors, they could’ve helped us lobby our way out of the situation with Shopify. Maybe not. I believe VC funding is an amazing instrument that enables innovation, but I never saw fundraising as an objective to be chased at any cost.Acquisition For some reason everyone asks me if Shopify offered to buy us - no they didn’t.They didn’t want to have anything to do with us. We had one acquisition offer ( from another company ) - I declined it because it was too low.We didn’t talk further. Suing Shopify One advice we got was to file an antitrust case against Shopify in a European Court. Theoretically, we could’ve argued that Shopify uses anti-competitive practices to get rid of their checkout competition. Similar to what Spotify & Epic Games did against Apple. While that might’ve been a viable option, honestly, I don’t have the balls to pick a legal fight with a multi-billion corporation.On top of that, I believe that crying to the regulator is a bitch move. After everything, I still believe that Shopify built their platform and they should be able to do whatever they want with it. Ignoring the Shopify ToS updateOne thing that I probably would’ve done differently is not complying with Shopify’s updates.If they want to harass and ban their own customers for using an alternative checkout - that’s their decision - they should’ve dealt with the consequences. Instead, we helped them by becoming our own gatekeeper and refusing to onboard new merchants. But again, I was this 25 year old, just made some money for the first time founder and I was afraid. Shopify has made numerous legal threats against me along the way and I decided to fold, get my profits and move on.Conclusion It’s been a wild ride. I believe that I’m leaving this adventure as a winner, as I find myself with more experience, contacts, recognition and finances than when I first started. At the same time, it’s sad to see my best work so far slowly dying away and I still can’t get rid of the extreme anxiety I felt with Shopify looming over my head for the past years. If I sound bitter - I’m not. I like Shopify. I own Shopify stock. I believe they’re completely dominating the e-commerce platform space and none of their current competitors stand a chance of catching up. I know they did what’s best for their business and this is the end I expected. Still, I also believe it’s important to share stories that aren’t all 🌈 rainbows and sunshines. At the end - I’m happy.I had some wins, I had some fails - it’s time to move on.It’s time for step 3 of the masterplan 😈 I hope this story brought something to you.

    "commentBody": "Bootstrapping to €600k MRR and getting killed by Shopify: Checkout X (leteyski.com)315 points by ericthegoodking 11 hours ago | hide | past | favorite | 173 commentsrahimnathwani 9 hours ago | next [–] I’m surprised at all the comments focusing on the negative here.I found the story inspiring: they bootstrapped a business, grew revenue, hired some people, and grew revenue further.The founder created value and captured some of that value. The fact that the business can no longer acquire new customers is sad, but it’s only a small part of the story.The founder’s 6 year journey is probably more interesting than what most people did at work over the past 6 years.replydavidw 8 hours ago | parent | next [–] Yeah, the story isn't one of those \"THIS IS SO UNFAAAAAAIR\" things. It's just a description of what happened.Depending on the costs, 600,000 euros a month is pretty good even if it doesn't last forever.> If I sound bitter - I’m not. I like Shopify. I own Shopify stock. I believe they’re completely dominating the e-commerce platform space and none of their current competitors stand a chance of catching up. I know they did what’s best for their business and this is the end I expected.replyJ_Shelby_J 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don’t understand how Shopify can maintain market dominance as just a middleman value extractor. Probably why they’re forcing their app. I deleted my account and haven’t used Shopify since they wouldn’t let me get my order tracking any way besides the app. As someone who worked adjacent to logistics it was just the hardest hard “no” of all time for me. Money moves to easily now days to build a monopoly on e-commerce.replyWheatMillington 5 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Value extractor? I'm a non tech guy so I have a different perspective. I started a side business selling online. I have no idea where I would even start on my own, between setting up a website and handling payments etc. Shopify allowed me to literally stand up an ecommerce platform in an afternoon, and soon enough I was accepting $6k per month. The cost was something like $39/month, which was phenomenal value for money.replyAlfeG 10 minutes ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Always wonder why Shopify is needed. In my case a lot of banks provide consistent APIs or buttons for payments. Numerous providers that aggregate those APIs, but no one forcing You. No need to pay middlemanreplylockhouse 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I completely see the value in using something like Shopify. Collecting money from customers online in a safe, trustworthy manner, that is fully in compliance with multiple countries laws, to include charging the proper taxes and duties would take more time than developing the product you’re actually trying to sell.replyhintymad 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Similar to how Alibaba did with Taobao and TMall in China and Southeast Asia? Aggregators do offer values.replynerdponx 5 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] If anything, it's quite a success story.replyMagi604 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Same here, it was a great story.replyspamizbad 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'm not a business expert or an entrepreneur, but I've been around this industry long enough to know: Unless your intention is to flip your startup into an acquisition, I would recommend against plays like this.Specifically, tying yourself up to a closed ecosystem by building what amounts to a (albeit very nice and powerful) super-feature.I am saying this because I work for a large-ish company where someone did this to a section of our product that was also mediocre. One of our co-founders reached out to the company and actually offered to buy them for, what I felt, was an insanely high amount for what they were building. They rejected the offer so we threw some devs and an awesome designer at the problem, made something just as good, and then shut them out. They ultimately shut down.replyfy20 8 hours ago | parent | next [–] It can work the other way around too. Early in my career I was working for a company that provided value added services in the telecommunications space. We grew quite large, working with household name brands in Northern Europe. However everything we did went through a single third party provider - we didn't communicate directly with telecommunications companies.This provider did an ok job, however at the volumes we were processing it meant we were paying them a pretty handsome sum - which the owners (we were privately held without any outside investment) wanted to reduce to increase their profit margin. We made an offer to buy this provider, but they knew how much we were depending on them, and made a counter offer much higher, which we refused.We started building out our own platform to connect directly to the telecommunications companies, which if you've ever worked in this space, you will know it's no easy task. Although there are standards, each company does things slightly differently, so each integration is effectively from scratch. To make it even harder, the process of migrating phone numbers etc is effectively turn it off in one place and turn it on in the new place, there is no gradual switch over. After the failed negotiations our provider did not want to cooperate with this (any more than they legally had to) and they gave us a hard deadline after which they would turn off all our services. Any major issues during this migration could take weeks to resolve, and would surely result in large customers leaving which could be the end of our company.But in the end we did it. The migration over to our platform worked without any major issues, and we were even able to build in extra features that our provider didn't have.And the icing on the cake: a year or so later we bought that provider. As we were their biggest customer - by a long way - they lost a big chunk of business. What we paid for them was much lower than the original offer we made.replyspaceman_2020 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] But at the same time, if you are bootstrapped, profitable and can iterate fast, building on top of an existing platform is a fantastic way to get customers. You have a captive audience, you can understand the market easily, and can launch products fast since the tech stack is already well defined.Not every business has to be sold for $100M or be around forever. A well-run bootstrapped startup like the OP’s can make you millions if it survives just 3-4 years.replyketzo 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Yeah, seriously -- everyone in this thread seems to be talking about this like a story of failure, and I... don't really get that?There aren't a lot of hard numbers in the post, but it sounds like Checkout X grossed in the high 7-figure to low 8-figure range, in ~four years, while paying (not very many) Eastern European salaries. The founder alone probably came away with a few million dollars!replyaltdataseller 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Exactly, and people are forgetting what's the alternative? Doing absolutely nothing, twiddling your thumbs because you CAN'T find another good market opportunity and earning less?replysjducb 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] This guy clearly made several million euros. That’s a massive win.Sure founding a billion euro company is better, but if you don’t have a billion euro idea then starting a million euro company is worthwhile.replynolok 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > Specifically, tying yourself up to a closed ecosystem by building what amounts to a (albeit very nice and powerful) super-feature.Couldn't agree more. It goes something like this :\"What do you offer ?\"\"Feature X on top of Y\"\"What stops Y from doing it themselves ?\"Either A \"Well it's not worth it\" (then why do you do it), or B \"Well, they haven't so far ...\" in which case you have an end date already, you just don't know it yet and it's in the hands of Y.As you said, planning to be aquired is probably the best move, second one being to plan your independence (imgur to reddit like), because otherwise your company has no real future.replywithinboredom 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Usually it's \"C. Because they don't care.\" It's when you start walking away with millions that they could have had, had they cared, that they will suddenly care.replyadamckay 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] > otherwise your company has no real futureThat's not necessarily as bad as it sounds, though.If the future where your company can exist is long enough for you to learn some valuable things and make decent money, it's obviously worth it.replydasil003 4 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Sure, that's the conventional wisdom, but it seems sort of out of context here. This guy gambled and won, bootstrapping a €600k MRR business which is still printing money to this day (Shopify killed the growth, not the business). This guys already made more money than the majority of European developers do in their entire career. I fail to see the downside.replyHWR_14 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I feel fairly confident your \"insanely high amount\" wasn't as high as you feel it was.replyspamizbad 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] For a product built by 2 people it was enough for both of them to retire (albeit humbly) or seed a more ambitious company.Anyway, their best move was to take the money.

Market segmentation is a real thing, for good reasons. If $BIGCO pivots to producing a product similar to yours, that doesn't have to mean \"the end\". I'd suggest everybody read The Discipline of Market Leaders for more on how to choose among different strategies and position yourself vis-a-vis competitors.Of course the problem of fundamentally building on someone else's platform remains. This is why it's a good idea to start at least thinking about how to move your business onto another platform, from day zero. Of course there's a balance between investing time and money in building abstraction layers and evaluating other platforms and doing these different things, versus spending that time and money on immediate growth. But if one invests literally 0 in this situation, they can hardly expect much sympathy if the underlying platform gets yanked out from underneath them and kills their business.replyorasis 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I wouldn’t call it a “great” business strategy if your shelf life is limited.We have a finite amount of life energy to put into our businesses and I’d prefer to give it to something that can generate an annuity.replyWJW 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Financial technology has you covered: spend your finite life energy providing the feature until the bigco implements it themselves, then buy an annuity with the profits you made in the meantime.replyCPLX 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I mean, the fact that this guy was making $7.2MM a year in revenue from his software seems relevant.Quantity has a quality all its own.replydangus 9 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Almost all businesses have a limited shelf life and/or a business cycle of growth and decline.

They'd need experienced chip designers, software engineers for developing drivers and APIs, retail partners... it's a much different business.The key thing that makes \"Sherlocking\" easy is that it's just imitating third party software with first party software, from a first party that is already good at making software.replypolitician 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] As I understand it from my time at AMD, TSMC provides what is essentially an SDK for specifying how to use their process for a given node.

The abstract is as follows:For the first time in the world, we succeeded in synthesizing the room-temperature superconductor ( T c ≥ 400 K , 127∘ C) working at ambient pressure with a modified lead-apatite (LK-99) structure. The superconductivity of LK-99 is proved with the Critical temperature ( T c ), Zero-resistivity, Critical current ( I c ), Critical magnetic field ( H c ), and the Meissner effect. The superconductivity of LK-99 originates from minute structural distortion by a slight volume shrinkage (0.48 %), not by external factors such as temperature and pressure. The shrinkage is caused byC u 2 +substitution ofP b 2 + (2) ions in the insulating network of Pb(2)-phosphate and it generates the stress. It concurrently transfers to Pb(1) of the cylindrical column resulting in distortion of the cylindrical column interface, which creates superconducting quantum wells (SQWs) in the interface. The heat capacity results indicated that the new model is suitable for explaining the superconductivity of LK-99. The unique structure of LK-99 that allows the minute distorted structure to be maintained in the interfaces is the most important factor that LK-99 maintains and exhibits superconductivity at room temperatures and ambient pressure.These illustrations from the paper show the structure of the synthesised material.image 783×840 138 KBThis paper is the first scientific disclosure of these results.

Note that the corner of the material never actually rises above the magnet.In both of these magnetic repulsion videos, keep in mind that magnetic repulsion and/or levitation are not, by themselves, probative of superconductivity: a diamagnetic material such as pyrolytic graphite 21, can be made to levitate 26 in a magnetic field without being superconductive.Here are some additional causes for caution by “some guy on the Internet”. 72This is, of course, far from the first time we’ve discussed high-temperature or room-temperature superconductivity here. See these earlier posts:arXiv Preprint Server Cancels Papers, Bans Researcher over “Inflammatory Content” 11 2022-03-16 Room Temperature Superconductivity? “This Time for Sure!” 13 2023-03-09 The Superconductivity Squabble, Physics, History, and Controversy 4 2023-04-03 Jorge Hirsch on Room Temperature Superconductivity or Scientific Fraud? 6 2023-05-19Unlike earlier claims, which were based upon material under extreme pressure in a diamond anvil cell, this paper claims superconductivity under ordinary laboratory conditions, and rather than exotic materials such as lutetium hydride compounds, uses a phosphate of lead doped with copper, which a competent chemist should be able to whip up and test for themselves, which I presume is going on as I write in laboratories around the world.There’s no need among this audience to explain the technological consequences of discovery of room temperature, ambient pressure superconductivity. If the effect is genuine, and materials can be engineered which retain their superconductivity under the high magnetic fields of power transmissions (which has been a limitation of the cuprate superconductors 13 that operate at liquid nitrogen temperatures), this may spark a revolution in electronics as significant as the invention of the transistor, vacuum tube, and induction motor.We’ll see.(The Korea Institute of Science and Technology 8, home of one of the co-inventors was, in the 1970s, a Marinchip Systems 39 customer.)7 created 1d last reply 4h 9 replies 7.8k views 3 users 30 likes 33 links 6 3 russnelson 1dOh, I hadn’t thought about the induced magnetic field in a high current superconductor.

(@Fourmilab 2023-07-27 12:20 UTC)3 johnwalker 16hDerek Lowe 14 has posted an initial assessment of the superconductor paper in his Science column, “In the Pipeline”, “Breaking Superconductor News 30”, on 2023-07-26.I wrote recently 5 about the turmoil in the field of higher-temperature superconductors, but little did I know what was coming. Yesterday two preprints appeared on the rXiv site, the first 2 bearing the attention-getting title “The First Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor”, and the second 3 going into more detail about its behavior. As you’d imagine, this made something of a splash during the day on Tuesday!Let’s look at what’s being claimed, and how strong the evidence seems to be. The authors describe a lead-based copper-doped material, LK-99, which is made by first preparing a well-characterized mineral (lanarkite, Pb2(SO4)O) from lead oxide and lead sulfate. Separately, copper phosphide 1 (Cu3P), another well-characterized compound, is also freshly prepared from elemental copper and phosphorus. These two substances are ground together in a 1:1 ratio and the mixture is sealed in a vacuum-evacuated quartz tube and heated to 925C, forming LK-99, which is Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, a dark polycrystalline material. The structure is very similar to lead apatite 2, a well-characterized phosphate mineral, but its crystallographic unit cell is slightly smaller due to the substitution of particular lead atoms in its lattice by copper ones.And it’s this effect on the compound’s structure, the authors believe, that leads to its extraordinary superconducting behavior. Honestly, “extraordinary” doesn’t get it across. We’ve been getting excited over the years about superconducting materials that don’t even quite have to be cooled with liquid nitrogen, and this stuff is claimed to superconduct all the way up to room temperature and indeed up past the boiling point of water. Its critical temperature is said to be 127C (!) The phrase “boiling-water superconductor” is not one that I had ever used until yesterday, trust me on that.⋮Another welcome feature is that their procedure for preparing LK-99 seems quite straightforward. You can bet that furnaces in solid-state materials labs around the world have been cooking yesterday and today to try to reproduce its synthesis and the properties, and we should be hearing about the results of these experiments very soon. The first samples should be coming out of the quartz vessels. . .sometime tomorrow, perhaps? Depends on what was available around the lab! Now, as the world knows, all such claims to date have fallen apart on closer inspection - indeed, the superconductivity research group at Rochester that I wrote about 5 earlier this month is now about to have 4 another paper retracted on suspicions of data fabrication. But those reports were on materials that take very specialized equipment to make and evaluate - this new report looks like it’s either going to fall apart very quickly or be quickly vindicated (as were the 1987 superconductor discoveries 11). I absolutely cannot wait to find out.⋮But as usual, it’s a gigantic step to just show that such things can exist. That’s what will shake everyone up well before any applications come along, and if this reproduces, labs around the world will frantically start looking for quantum-well superconducting materials of their own. Who knows what could come out of that? Robust high-current-density room-temperature superconductors are right out of science fiction (SF readers will recall that one such material was a big plot point in Larry Niven’s Ringworld). Electrical generation and transmission, antennas, power storage, magnet applications (including things like fusion power plants), electric motors and basically everything that runs on electricity would be affected. We could stop throwing away so much generated power on heating up the wires that deliver it, for starters.3 johnwalker 15hSuperconducting magnet engineer Andrew Cote gives his view of the claim of room-temperature superconductivity in a Twitter thread 58 collected as “Exploring the Possibilities of Room-Temperature Superconductivity: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly 274”. Clips from the collection:Summary The good: There’s some plausibility here, and if so, it’s game-changing The bad: Reasonable chance this is a similar but different physical property The ugly: Their plots, and engineering usefulnessLet me explain:The Good: Lee-Kim-Kwon (LKK) use familiar materials, Cuprates, and measures some key metrics of a room-temp superconductivity (SC):Zero-resistivity Critical current Critical magnetic field Meissner effectThe bad: Normally the superconducting transition temperature is predicted by measuring heat capacity versus temperature. This is the Debye Temp.TKK say they can’t measure this, because the usual theories of SC don’t explain their sample: a lil bit susThe ugly: Some of their plots.The net-net: No champagne yet, but watch closely - this would be a serious game changer in things like power transmission, energy storage, and future-tech like quantum computers, fusion energy, mag-lev trains.I’m even more optimistic than 6 weeks agoRead the whole thing 274.4 CTLaw 7h Manifold Will the LK-99 room temp, ambient pressure superconductivity pre-print... 2714% chance.

So, to the extent that a tethercoin is real and retains its 1:1 peg to the US$, people are betting real money. This is presumably a way to get around the U.S. federal and state bans on “online gambling”, which define real-currency prediction markets within their prohibition. The only two prediction markets currently open to U.S. nationals are the university-operated PredictIt (based on New Zealand) and Iowa Electronic Markets, in…you guessed it…the U.S. state of Iowa. Neither, at this writing (2023-07-27 at 22:40 UTC), appear to have markets on replication of the claimed room-temperature superconductor.Requiring participants in a prediction market to first get into cryptocurrency is going to dramatically reduce the breadth of participation and the liquidity of the market and its efficiency in establishing the probability of the prediction from the crowd. I would also doubt that operating a prediction market in the U.S. in a stablecoin is going to evade attacks against it as online gambling once its size grows sufficiently large to come onto the radar of state and federal “no fun of any kind” agencies.2 johnwalker 4hHere is Anton Petrov’s summary of the situation regarding the room-temperature superconductor claims and the reasons for scepticism due to previous claims by other researchers in Nature, one retracted and the other increasingly dubious. Sadly, Petrov seems to be falling into the YouTube hole of “over-production”, littering his video with stock video clips that have nothing whatsoever to do with the subject matter bring presented.If This Superconductor Is Real, It's a Nobel Prize!

Not an expert in that part thoughreplyfoven 9 hours ago | parent | next [–] Glad to see a realistic take on HN. Endlessly frustrating to see people be like \"this will be replicated in days\". Yeah, sure, let every other lab just drop what they're doing, order all the reagents on express, do a thorough characterization making sure they understand the impurities and crystal phase, then perform good airtight measurements in a couple days. Crystal growth always has complications many times outside of your control - the most minor of things can cause ridiculous problems.Especially when they admit to having phase impurities, and it's not really clear how they've gone from bulk sample to measurement sample (are they really measuring just the superconductor or the impurity phase?). Needs addressing, especially when the Cu2S phase impurity seems to have a phase transition of it's own at or around 370K (suspiciously close to where some of their Tc measurements are).replyjncfhnb 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Feels like you’re strawmanning the idea here.

The first paper submitted to Nature reproducing excess heat, although it passed peer review, was rejected because most similar experiments were negative and there were no theories that could explain a positive result;[notes 2][42] this paper was later accepted for publication by the journal Fusion Technology. Nathan Lewis, professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, led one of the most ambitious validation efforts, trying many variations on the experiment without success,[43] while CERN physicist Douglas R.

Currently most of the charge is dissipated in the wire and some of it within the transistor.If the wires have no resistance, the transistor will be the one dissipating the energy, not the energy simply disappears.So technically both options are right, but my position is the “technically right, but practically wrong” position lolThat said if the interconnects are less resistive, the switching process becomes more efficient and less power will be wasted than the bare minimum required.replyguerrilla 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Ahh right.

The charge on C2 is 0.Say suddenly you connect C1 to C2 via a lossless wire.The charge on C1 and C2 must be equal before and after the connection since charge cannot be destroyed.After the connection, the voltage on both caps will be equal, and the charge on them will therefore be equal.Charge on each cap is 1C; voltage is therefore Q/C = V, V = 1V on both caps..Now let's look at the energy on either cap. 1/2 CV^2 = 0.5C.The combined energy on both caps are 1C. Where'd the energy go? We just said we connected the capacitors with a lossless wire, so it can't be dissipated there, and capacitors by definition cannot dissipate power.The answer is that lossless wires cannot exist, and if you do the math more carefully, this time with real resistance and take the limit as R->0, you will see that the power-time integral of the wire (dissipated energy) will approach 1C.The same argument can be made for integrated circuits; as your resistance drops, more and more of the portion of loss will be dissipated in the \"other\" sources of loss.edit: superconductors are lossy at AC (but not as much as regular conductors get lossy at AC), and the capacitor connection is an AC phenomena so even with superconductors there will be a teeny loss even with superconducting wires. The rest of the loss will happen in other ways (EM radiation, dielectric loss, loss from capacitor resistance, etc)replydougmwne 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] Citation: thermodynamics.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principlereplyEvgeniyZh 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] We are very far from Landauer limit thoreplyguerrilla 10 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] I get it now.

Is this visual result only possible with superconductors? If so, why?replymgsouth 8 hours ago | parent | next [–] The levitation results from something called \"diamagnetism\" [1]. Diagmagnetism induces a magnetic field that opposes the original field; in this case it pushes the magnet away from the sample material.All superconductors are strongly (perfectly, actually) diamagnetic, and its a classic cool demonstation of their properties. However, not all strongly diamagnetic things are superconductors. In fact, diagmagnetism is present in all materials, but it is usually swamped by other magnetic effects (ferromagnetism and paramagnetism).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetismreplysvachalek 8 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Magnets can also levitate over other magnets, so it's not only possible with superconductors. But it does happen with superconductors. The magnet will induce a current in the superconductor, which creates a magnetic field, which repels the magnet.replyeesmith 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > Magnets can also levitate over other magnetsEarnshaw's theorem describes why a free-floating (paramagnetic) magnet cannot levitate over another such magnet. There must be at least one stable axis which is not from a magnet. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnshaw%27s_theorem> The magnet will induce a current in the superconductorThat's a different sort of levitation. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_suspension . We know it's not the same because you can see a magnet floating above a superconductor even though there's no motion.The relevant reason is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdiamagnetism .] Superconducting magnetic levitation is due to superdiamagnetism, which repels a permanent magnet which approaches the superconductor, and flux pinning, which prevents the magnet floating away.] Superdiamagnetism is a feature of superconductivity.replyit_citizen 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] So does that mean the video would exclude honest mistakes from the researchers?

You can float a diamagnetic material but you need at least 2 magnets, it wouldn't be stable with only one either. Note however that in the video the material is not completely floating, one corner is touching, that would be enough to stabilise a diamagnetic material for example so it's not a sufficient proof of superconductivity by itself.replywhoisburbansky 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] With the regular magnets, you'd have to hold them in places, since otherwise they'd rotate in place and fall back down, attracted to each other.replyceejayoz 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] Levitation demonstrates the superconductivity, but that's not all it's useful for.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_applications_of_...replymhb 9 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] No. It is impossible for an ordinary magnet to float freely over any number of other stationary ordinary magnets.replyiefbr14 10 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] I think they use a shard of the end of an ferrite loopstick antenna to fake the so called levitation.

Resistive losses in wires are not the only cause of wasted energy, and in most battery-powered devices they aren't very important at all. How is a superconductor supposed to help with e.g. switching losses in a buck converter, or reduce the amount of energy stored in a transistor's gate capacitance?replyjacquesm 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > How is a superconductor supposed to help with e.g. switching losses in a buck converterThat one I can answer for you: because it would reduce the time to go from 'on' to 'off' due to the much more rapid flow on account of reduced resistance. The currents in a buck converter can be very high because they are short, but that is also exactly where you'll find the losses: in the transition from 'off' to 'on' and vice versa. So this won't do anything for the MOSFET losses but it could seriously shrink inductor losses and those are the other major factor.replyAdamH12113 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Sure, the inductor conduction losses would go away (and that's a substantial improvement!), but I'm not sure what you're talking about with regard to reducing switching time. I don't think the MOSFET gate drive is limited by the wire that connects to it.replyjacquesm 7 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It isn't but the capacitor that is sitting on the far end of that circuit is limited by how fast you can pump current in or out. And if your current can go up considerably then the capacitor will charge that much faster and so your losses will be smaller because for the same 'on' duration of the MOSFET you can move more charge.

Not all due diligence and checks were done, e.g. missing tests or providing half-assed \"proofs\". (Check, missing phase transition results, provided video proof for superconductivity shows imperfect samples and diamagnetism, no full levitation, no pinning effect in superconductivity.

Rushed publication, plot quality, grammar, etc. Get over yourselves. This is a pre-print for an instant-Nobel, next-tier-of-civilization level discovery. The proper publication will come in due time. Waiting for a more complete verification is a sheltered view. Being first matters. Things changed after the J/Psi discovery in 1974. For those that don't know, Sam Ting discovered it first, yet sat on it for months waiting for a complete verification. Then Richter's group also discovered it months later and Ting was forced to publish at the same time and share the Nobel. This changed the publication attitude in the field significantly. Being first matters.2. \"Terrible science.\" Again, get over yourselves. Just because the preprint doesn't match your taste specifically doesn't mean it's bad science. You can't satisfy everyone- there will ALWAYS be someone who complains about some missing measurement or plot they view as essential. Most of the time, the 'missing' component is directly related to their own work. In other words, people want to see what they understandd as being important to them, also reflected in other publications. That does not mean it's a valid criticism. It's nitpicking.The most realistic timeline is 2-3 months for a positive verification. 6 months for a negative verification. If it works, it will be quicker because a positive reproduction needs less work. A negative verification needs to be more thorough and will take more time.replylamontcg 10 hours ago | parent | next [–] > 2. \"Terrible science.\" Again, get over yourselves.

The recent situation with Dias this year[1] is now under investigation as a case of data fabrication and he didn't even claim to have ambient pressure.Frankly there are too many details missing to trust them. They've fabricated a thin film but not characterized it. It is well known that the properties of a material change when you go from bulk to thin film with a big dependence on the thickness. They don't mention how the resistance of this thin film is measured - that's important for what artifacts you might expect to see in your measurements (van der Pauw vs Hall bar measurements are the standard but they don't mention using either). Without characterizing the thin film it's also difficult to know, chemically and structurally, what you are measuring. I don't see any data confirming the quality of the thin film. The way the data is presented is such that it can be misleading, showing I-V curves instead of resistance when you are really trying to say the resistance is what is changing. The first paper doesn't even mention the insulator-metal transition that is present in the second paper which is bizarre - this is important if you are also claiming a superconductor transition close by and you would expect some discussion of this behaviour.All of these are things that, one would hope, will be picked up by the reviewers as low hanging fruit before even really delving into the detail of the theory they present.Decades of experience alone should not be trusted.

The conversation has been curious and substantive, everyone knows it's probably not true, but most are not making shallow dismissals. There's a shared sense of waiting for the replications to succeed or fail, and in the meantime, discussion of the details as well as what the impact would be if it does turn out. Also driving interest is that the claims are said to be easy to replicate if true, so the answer is expected any time now. Imminence fuels anticipation—like waiting for election results.The shallow dismissal reaction is taking for granted that it's not real and everyone's wrong to give it a chance. The thing is, almost everything is wrong—you can rely on this completely, and by placing your bet on \"wrong wrong wrong\", you achieve a high batting average—you'll be right almost all the time. The trouble is that your expected value will be zero, and you will be both bored and boring (I don't mean you personally—this is a common pattern and we all do it to some extent).It's in the low-probability/high-impact quadrant that the interesting things reside, alongside crank material and dross, and it's not easy to tell them apart.

It's a paper and now people will try to replicate it. Some informed people give their take on why it sounds right and/or wrong, but ultimately they aren't (and can't) verify or debunk it yet pending further investigations. I have zero expertise to give an opinion either way, and honestly the impact of room temperature/pressure superconductors just doesn't seem that overwhelming. Maybe more maglev trains?As with many things now, there are that small set of people who need to pick a \"position\" early and then stake a part of their ego on it.

That last could lead to progress speeding up in that research as more people can try stuff. Lower cost for power transmission would make renewables that are geographically limited more usable.

It is based on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set, which tests the ability of models to follow general user instructions. These responses are then compared to reference Davinci003 responses by the provided GPT-4 or Claude or ChatGPT based auto-annotators, which results in the win rates presented above. AlpacaEval displays a high agreement rate with ground truth human annotations, and leaderboard rankings on AlpacaEval are very correlated with leaderboard rankings based on human annotators. Please see our documentation for more details on our analysis.Adding new modelsWe welcome new model contributions to the leaderboard from the community! To do so, please follow the steps in the contributions section. Specifically, you'll need to run the model on the evaluation set, auto-annotate the outputs, and submit a PR with the model config and leaderboard results. We've also set up a Discord for community support and discussion.Adding new evaluators or eval setsWe also welcome contributions for new evaluators or new eval sets! For making new evaluators, we release our ground-truth human annotations and comparison metrics. We also release a rough guide to follow for making new eval sets. We specifically encourage contributions for harder instructions distributions and for safety testing of LLMs.AlpacaEval limitationsWhile AlpacaEval provides a useful comparison of model capabilities in following instructions, it is not a comprehensive or gold-standard evaluation of model abilities. For one, as detailed in the AlpacaFarm paper, the auto annotator winrates are correlated with length. Though human annotations also display this bias, it is unclear if more verbose answers add utility in downstream tasks. Additionally, the AlpacaFarm eval set, though diverse, consists mainly of simple instructions. We encourage the community to contribute new, more complex eval sets, such as for tool use. Finally, AlpacaEval does not evaluate the safety of any of the models.",

This means GPT-4’s judgments closely align with the majority of humans. We also show that GPT-4’s judgments may help humans make better judgments. During our data collection, when a human’s choice deviated from GPT-4, we presented GPT-4’s judgments to humans and ask if they are reasonable. Despite different views, humans deemed GPT-4’s judgments reasonable in 75% of cases and are even willing to change their choices in 34% of cases.\"[1][1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685replysdenton4 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's helpful!I've done a lot of work in audio synthesis, which is notoriously difficult measure. The gold-standard is human ratings of audio quality, but it is tough to design good tests (easy to fatigue raters) and the iteration time waiting for results is quite long.Instead, there's now some projects which use neural networks trained on human ratings to predict audio quality, such as ViSQoL: https://github.com/google/visqolThis opens up fast iteration - scores going up generally corresponds to higher quality - followed by human testing at major milestones (eg, releasing a paper/model). VISQOL has a harder time comparing 'unrelated' models, IMO - ends up being not so great for comparison of different techniques, but excellent for measuring incremental improvement or catching regressions.But, in the end, yes - you can use NN's to measure the quality of other NN's, so long as you're careful about it and make use of human raters from time to time as well.The problem of test data getting into the training data seems to be an especially pernicious issue with LLM's, which isn't really arising in the audio synthesis space.replyblackkettle 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I’ve started doing this with ASR hypotheses from colloquial spontaneous speech. It tends to have similar issues. Lots of shady human ground truth especially where addresses, alphanumeric sequences, repairs and repetitions and other essentially non read speech are concerned. The very large Whisper models are consistent in their transcription style and highly reliable as long as you pick strongly represented languages. And ChatGPT can do a very good job at comparing the linguistic coherence of hypotheses from multiple recognizers. Together these models can annotate, analyze and ingest far more data more consistently than human annotators at this point (at least in the best covered languages). We haven’t quite realized this as a community yet though, because the standard datasets we use for evaluation contain all these human inconsistencies.

It feels like a distillation of all human knowledge and sentiments. I use it constantly to get advice on plans, architectures, thoughts, etc.. to get an idea of pretty much what the average person would think. It often points out things I've overlooked which I'll improve my design with and go back and forth with ChatGPT until we're both in agreement.I even read a classic book the other day and had a great discussion with ChatGPT about moral relativism, the different schools of thought and how it fit into philosophy as a whole. For students this technology is incredible, I wish I had it for all my classes.Even sometimes comments I'll make on here or Reddit I'll pass through ChatGPT first to see if I made any mistakes in my logic.replyTowerTall 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] > to get an idea of pretty much what the average person would thinkThere is no such thing as an average person.https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/when-u-s-air-force-disc...replyFolcon 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Funnily enough I think you both might be right here, there isn't such a thing as an average person, but ChatGPT may be the synthesis of the average opinion.replywahnfrieden 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] what is an average opinion? it is the sum of opinions which disagree with the resultreplyoceanplexian 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It gives you the average opinion of someone on the Internet, particularly places like Reddit, which is FAR from the “average opinion” of most people.

When I was grading philosophy 101, I would have probably given it a passing grade against the overall curve, but that's about it. Philosophy is a discipline of careful, sometimes jargoney, and always very couched assertions that can be easily misunderstood and appropriated. This is probably its greatest weakness, and in many ways this weakness is the progenitor of philosophy itself in the Western world, with Plato at the start (i.e. with the figure of the sophist, the paradox of a false wisdom).- Maybe one reason: there is a huge amount of, lets say, \"armchair philosophy\" on the internet, compared to other disciplines. Many blogposts and tiny manifestos of people really excited by some out of context quote from Spinoza or whatever. And you start to really feel this part of the dataset when you ask about philosophy.

I think its kinda cheeky answering you so literally, giving it an actual place to fit into :).I don't doubt it can do, like, Wikipedia type classification ok, but that's not like really getting to the substance of anything! And, either way, its not like there is one decided-upon hierarchy of concepts like this people consciously work within. This is a fine picture to some, but others might contest, perhaps, that Meta-Ethics is the \"study of moral thought, language, and properties.\" What is \"moral language\" anyway? Why is it meta relative to Moral Philosophy writ-large? Or perhaps one might argue that we need to think of meta-ethics as a sibling rather than child. The whole discipline is a mess of different thoughts and possible rebuttals and grand intellectual overturnings that will not be captured here. Maybe just try pasting that back into the prompt and asking \"what's wrong with this picture?\".But like I said, its fine in that its fairly comparable to Wikipedia for utility, (with IMO a worse interface, but I get why people like it more).replydgroshev 7 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] The reason you feel that way might be that you are familiar enough with philosophy.After all, LLMs and ChatGPT in particular are are indistinguishable from productised Gell-Mann Amnesia.Edit: rewrote to be more neutral, sorryreplylolinder 11 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] 80% agreement is high, but the margins between models at the top are so low that even that remaining 20% could be enough to alter the final rankings, depending on which direction it errs.replybostonsre 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Is perfect agreement possible?

It is an intriguing idea and I would love to learn more to see if I could use a similar approach.replyTostino 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] Youtube transcripts. It only works with single-person channels at the moment, as I haven't worked on disambiguating multiple speakers. They are very messy if they are just an auto transcription from Google. Practically unusable in most cases.So first step in the pipeline is cleaning up the transcripts for incorrectly transcribed words or sentences. Using the context of the rest of the transcript, it is able to fix the vast majority of them. Then we add punctuation and format it with paragraphs. Then I have another check over the whole transcript for any remaining issues.After all of that, I have a relatively clean transcript that represents the original audio very closely. From there, I am doing things like: 1. creating question/answer pairs from the transcript 2. creating a document of additional context that fills in details about what the speaker is talking about but may not have explicitly said 3. creating a summary of the transcript identifying the main purpose 4. creating a knowledge graph from the transcript with nodes and edges 5. creating an annotated version of the transcript using that knowledge graphI plan on putting some of this data into a vector database, and some of it will be used for fine tuning LLaMA2 models on specific tasks (like knowledge graph creation, annotation using a knowledge graph, and writing using a knowledge graph to keep track of events)replydr_kiszonka 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] That's very informative - thanks so much for the explanation!My only experience with transcripts is in the context of transcribing short interviews.

Debian, Arch or other distros, could have WEI disabled on their chromium distribution, forks like Edge and Vivaldi could disable GAIA, etc.Just give a look at the divergence issues and the PRs solving them [1], most of them are just single file or small changes to compilation/default flags[1]: https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Deviations-from-...replyfabrice_d 12 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] They have much more changes than just compile flags.

Brave committed to continuing support for Mv2 [1]. Adding native adblocking capabilities is also definitely a more complex change than just bundling an adblocking extension.Brave maintains patches in a very specific way [2] to ensure maintainability. My impression is that Kiwi's patches are structured in a way that technically works but isn't easy to keep rebasing on top of upstream changes.

No. Because if it wasn't at odds, it wouldn't exist, these people would be just Chrome/Chromium contributors.Chromium is open-source because they forked WebKit, and WebKit forked KHTML.

This is possibly something they inherited from Chromium, but Brave is very memory hungry compared to Firefox, and is much quicker to slow down when there's 10+ tabs - Firefox on the same computer is able to cope much more easily with multiples of that. It's like using an old school Windows system, Brave has to be restarted periodically or it slows down dramatically, and starts responding erratically to UI interactions. I can have multiple Firefox profiles open, and a Librefox instance on the side too, and they all work fine; as soon as Brave is open, there's a tangible difference in the performance, of both the browser itself and the system as a whole.replysyncbehind 11 hours ago | prev | next [–] I'm shocked at folks' willingness to use a browser that has a history of tampering with a user's URL input (among other shenanigans).

While it's technically true the crypto stuff isn't \"enabled\", it's constantly pushed to you with no option to remove all of that during installation.I'll walk you through it:Upon loading the browser on a fresh install, you are greeted with a new tab page pushing Brave Rewards. With manipulative UX, there is no button to disagree or remove the feature, only a button for \"start using rewards\". You can hide it by clicking the 3 dots, which for most users they're never going to do unfortunately.Looking at the address bar, there's a triangle up there with a badge. Hiding the new tab Rewards card doesn't hide this triangle. Clicking on this does not show a remove feature option. Beside that, there's a sidebar button and a wallet icon again with a badge. Clicking on this only shows a learn more button. I can right click both of these, and finally see a hide option.Finally all of that is hidden. Maybe I browse a page or so, and then open a new tab. I'm shown an ad on the new tab screen. Right clicking it shows no hide button. So I'll try the customize button. Here's where you have to scroll down and disable the \"show sponsored images\" option.All done, right? Ok let's browse Reddit for a bit. There's where you see the \"tip\" button under every post.

You could have a rule that only 1 piece of paper is on your desktop at any time, but I find it much easier and more efficient to work with, as needed, two or more pieces of paper on my desktop. When multiple pieces of paper are on my desktop, I can arrange them such that I can easily focus on different papers by only moving my eyes, or, if the papers are relatively far apart, by moving my head and/or the rest of my body a little too.I personally like the desk organization rule of \"1 project/task per desk\", i.e. you clear your desk when switching tasks to ensure only relevant things are on your desk / within your visual domain.

Not to mention Brendan Eich and his views.If you still don't understand, then I don't know what to tell you.replyeganist 11 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I don't know much about the first one, but the affiliate codes I'm fine with.A browser company that tries to monetize in ways that doesn't weaponize my info against me is much preferred.That said, I can't personally separate his politics from his product, which is why I use Firefox.replysoundnote 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] It's funny, when Brave the organization's politics are pretty narrow and what you'd want out of a browser: Privacy and user control.Meanwhile Mozilla the organization boots people for politics, wants \"more than deplatforming\" and uses as one of their examples organizations deciding what I should see on the Internet - preferring outlets that Mozilla themselves like, naturally. They publish stuff with the gist of \"did you encounter other politics on YouTube, how scary\".Meanwhile the organization spends money on getting a sneaker designer to make time-limited color themes for their browser and writes a pile of copy about how cool it is that a sneaker designer painted the browser blue.https://imgur.com/a/ZmUzr0qMeanwhile, Brave releases a user-customizable filtering function for their search engine so you, not someone else, can decide from what POV you see the Internet and added native vertical tabs to the browser.One organization is blatantly political, the other just makes a good browser.But if you want people you like to decide what I see (at least easily) on the 'net, that's good, I guess./rantreplyziftface 9 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I'm not going to defend mozilla, since I think deciding which organization we hate more is counterproductive. But I will say that as a user of a browser, I don't really care that much what anyone publishes or who they boot from their organization (sounds flippant I know but at the end of the day I just want a browser that works). Brave putting garbage in their browser like crypto mining and redirecting links affects _the product_, which is the only thing I care about. Firefox has made blunders, but nothing like this.Not to mention that they're based on chromium.replymrguyorama 8 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [–] >user controlWhich is why they were silently filling in affiliate links without user consent right?

Sure, there are scams, but the point is to pay people for viewing ads (wealth re-distribution in a decentralized fashion). No one else is paying you to view ads; they are just taking your engagement data, your face and eye gaze data, your mouse trajectory data, etc. Brave is the first to try to pay you a portion of its ads revenue in a way that you the end user can flip into whatever currency you want, including USD.

It may not have played out as intended, but it wasn't a scam.The original intent was absolutely a scam. They wanted to hide the ads that were already on websites, replace them with their own, then give a fraction of the revenue they just effectively stole from those websites back to them (but only if they knew to ask for it).Also they were going to take over all the third-party tracking data for their own, while branding it as “privacy” — so much hand waving about \"we don't run a MiTM proxy\" (while hoping we didn’t notice it’s because they don’t need to be in the middle when they control the browser itself).Absolutely brazen, and they kept changing their story in real time whenever people started to notice hey wtf is this. Happened to be able to find this in my posting history for example; in hindsight I wish I hadn't been so cowed by the fact that I was arguing with Brendan Eich Himself, because man what a load of horsepuckey he and his guy were delivering: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14464518#14465271replyLightHugger 10 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] None of that is a scam?The user and their browser decides what ads they see.

At best it makes Brave a parasitic entity feeding off revenue that would have otherwise gone to the content creators.I'll reluctantly agree that that part on its own doesn't rise to the level of \"scam\" but I certainly don't think it's admirable.replymrguyorama 8 hours ago | root | parent | next [–] I think letting an advertising company have any control over content distribution or display is inherently a problem, so Brave signalling that they want to do advertising is pretty clear to me that they cannot be trusted.Like, do Brave think google is just evil and that if someone else becomes the advertising behemoth things will be just rosy?replyJohnFen 12 hours ago | parent | prev | next [–] > I don't understand a lot of the hate for Brave.I certainly don't hate Brave.

Also of course this means that Brave is simply an advertisement company, like the ones they are supposed to protect you from.When someone visits your page through Brave the ads you would have been compensated for are being blocked, Brave earns actual money for the ads they put in their place, and then users get the chance to tip you in 'attention tokens', which they wisely pre-mined.
