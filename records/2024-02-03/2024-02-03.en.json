    "originBody": "The purpose of this project is to try to understand the type and scale of the moderation of the Hacker News Front Page. NOTE: I love Hacker News. I try to read it every day. In the case of OnnxStream (here for example), 95% of the comments were helpful and intelligent. I also understand that moderating a site with huge traffic and where users are basically anonymous must be a very difficult task. Returning to the purpose of this project, from what I have been able to see, the \"public\" (i.e. observable from the outside) moderation of the Front Page consists of two main tools: modification of the title of a Story (voluntarily or involuntarily influencing its growth in terms of rank) or directly its removal. Regarding the first type of moderation, an excellent site is already available that tracks changes to Story titles. Here instead I will focus on the second type. For the reasons explained in the \"Why?\" section below, I have developed a small application that logs all the Stories that are removed from the Front Page, for personal use. I later discovered that there is no tool/website that provides this type of information and I decided to make it public here. It was a difficult decision but my rationale is: is it better to have more transparency or less transparency? If you know of a tool/website similar to this, please let me know: I will archive this repo or set it to private. A possible very positive outcome for this project could be to have a list similar to this, but available directly among the HN lists. Or even to notify a user when a Story is penalized on the Front Page, perhaps indicating the number of flags and/or the reason, for example. Why? Feel free to skip this part or click to expand How it works Using the official HN API, the service fetches 90 Top Stories every minute and makes a comparison with the first 30 Top Stories (i.e. the Front Page) fetched the previous minute. It logs all missing Stories here. The assumption is that a Story cannot go from the top 30 to a position higher than 90 in a single minute, without having been explicitly removed. If a Story reappears on the Front Page, it is removed from this log. All Stories present in the second cache pool are excluded from the log. Title and URL are those from when the Story first appeared in the top 30. The number of points and comments and the rank are those from when the Story was removed from the Front Page. The ID points to the news.social-protocols.org page for that Story, which provides a graph of the Story's position on the Front Page over time. The list (updated in real time, max delay: 1 minute) Monday, January 22, 2024 39087538 #13 25 points 8 comments -> How to Win Friends and Influence People: The Sam Altman Edition 39088941 #10 8 points 7 comments -> Let Detroit Go Bankrupt (2008) 39087776 #28 33 points 41 comments -> HP's CEO spells it out: You're a 'bad investment' if you don't buy HP supplies 39089421 #23 67 points 25 comments -> CCP members threaten British public piano player [video] 39089599 #23 20 points 41 comments -> Ford's new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car 39092116 #20 4 points 0 comments -> Secret Plan Against Germany 39093901 #18 8 points 2 comments -> Vacation Rental Software Coming After Airbnb 39094343 #11 -> Financial Markets Microstructure Introduction 39091819 #11 92 points 32 comments -> Vx.dev – GitHub-Powered AI for effortless development 39096404 #15 25 points 41 comments -> MrBeast reveals he made $250k from X video 39094387 #23 26 points 41 comments -> Open Source Doesn't Require Providing Builds 39095738 #22 26 points 41 comments -> Sam Altman Says AI Using Too Much Energy Will Require Breakthrough Energy Source 39096892 #23 8 points 1 comments -> Supreme Court rules border agents can remove razor wire erected by Texas Tuesday, January 23, 2024 39097655 #27 105 points 82 comments -> Trello leaked 15M email addresses 39102078 #10 21 points 13 comments -> Avoid Async Rust at All Cost 39103328 #20 11 points 4 comments -> Sex differences in work preferences among gifted men and women 39103942 #11 13 points 16 comments -> Are electric vehicles cheaper to own?

They're all sensationalist, advertising for some company, clickbait, way off topic, or some combination of above. In fact, I don't see a single story that I personally feel should not have been removed. Thanks, mods. reply TheCoreh 17 hours agoparentAt a quick glance, I found several that don't match that criteria you mention, here are a few: Open Source Doesn't Require Providing Builds https://codeengineered.com/blog/2024/open-source-not-builds/ Sam Altman Says AI Using Too Much Energy Will Require Breakthrough Energy Source https://futurism.com/sam-altman-energy-breakthrough Avoid Async Rust at All Cost https://blog.hugpoint.tech/avoid_async_rust.html (Perhaps that last one could be renamed to be less hyperbolic, but the content was still an interesting opinion piece) I don't think this is being done by the mods, by the way. It's more likely some spam filter with false positives, report brigading, or an anti upvote ring mechanism. reply dang 16 hours agorootparentThe first two you listed were downranked by the flamewar detector. The last one was downranked by users. Admins didn't touch any of them. Note for everybody: can you guys please include the HN /item link if you're mentioning specific threads? That would be much more efficient and that way I can answer many more of people's questions. reply jader201 15 hours agorootparent> The first two you listed were downranked by the flamewar detector. Just some feedback that I've found a number of articles fall off the FP due to the flamewar detector that I've felt were good articles/discussions. In fact, I think some of the more valuable discussions tend to have a lot of back and forth discussions relative to the votes. But I also recognize that flamewars can also look a lot like that. So I'm wondering if it may be worth revisiting the algorithm for this, and maybe having it factor in a few other things vs. simply the vote:comment ratio (which is what I'm understanding it currently is, but correct me if I'm wrong). I don't think it necessarily needs to be a lot more complex, maybe simply add to it some standard deviation of upvotes/downvotes (or just a simple ratio), if that's not already part of it. But I've seen some discussions fall off that I don't remember seeing a particularly toxic discussion happening (e.g. relatively little to no downvoted comments). Again, happy to see flamewars fall off, but just hoping to see some more interesting/helpful discussions not get caught in the crossfire. reply dang 14 hours agorootparentAbsolutely. We review the list of stories that set off that software penalty and restore the ones that are clearly not flamewars. No doubt we miss a few, and also - not everyone interprets these things the same way. But if you (or anyone) notice a case of a good thread plummeting off the front page, you can always get us to take a look by emailing hn@ycombinator.com. reply z_ack 3 hours agorootparentI have a compliant : sometimes there a proliferation of anti-scientific posts, in example I can mention those related to the \"50 years nuclear battery\", I remember particularly one from techradar.com that was especially misleading and anti-scientific and more similar to a PR campaign then scientific information, they was stating che you can power a smartphone or a drone with a betavoltaic battery (millionth of Ampere ). This is only an example, I noticed similar article , often related to green energy with the same anti-scientific cut and sometimes anti-scientific is a euphemism. Could nice to have a way to report them , even for occasional readers like me. Often the same articles have approval posts that IMHO are bot made. we live in times where scientific fraud amplified by the media is becoming a serious problem and I think everyone should do more to stop the phenomenon. reply dang 3 hours agorootparentTrying to assess what's scientific vs. anti-scientific is outside the scope of what mods can do. I have my opinions just like you do, but hashing these things out is a community process, not a moderation issue. We could put our fingers on the scale if we chose to, but nothing good would come of it, so we don't. reply smcin 6 hours agorootparentprevHere's one from last week: \"Ring will no longer allow police to request users' doorbell camera footage\" (npr.org) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39138423 I posted an on-topic supporting quote to explain why this item was newsworthy and got one unhelpful one-word response and my comment got inexplicably flagged (not the commenter) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39138481 How did that slip past detection? How do I get the abusive flag on my comment reversed? This behavior seems to have managed to push an important story off the frontpage quickly. (yes there was a badly-worded dupe headline, but that's a separate thing) reply dang 4 hours agorootparentIf I understand correctly, you have three concerns here: (1) the story was downranked off the front page; (2) your comment was flagged; (3) a comment that replied to you was not flagged. I'll try to respond to these in turn: (1) the story was downranked off the front page because the topic had already been discussed a bunch—for example in these threads, two days earlier: Amazon's Ring to stop letting police request doorbell video from users - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39119387 - Jan 2024 (141 comments) Ring steps back from sharing video with police – mostly - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39120892 - Jan 2024 (15 comments) Culling repetition from the front page is one of the most important things HN's systems need to do. Actually, it's probably the single most important thing. Certainly it's best if we can link to the previous discussions so people can know where to find them—but we can only do that some of the time. Users help out a ton by posting links to earlier threads. Ultimately we need better software support for dealing with this, but that's not done yet. (2) Your comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39138481 was flagged by users. We can only guess why users flag things, but in this case I'm pretty sure I know why: comments that do nothing but quote from the article, or try to summarize the article, are considered too formulaic by readers here. If you want to say what you think is important about an article, that's fine, but please do it in your own words and share your own thinking. To simply paste a quote from the article is too superficial. On HN the convention is to assume that readers are smart enough to evaluate an article for themselves. (3) The reply https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39138536, which only said \"and?\", was definitely an unsubstantive comment that deserved to be flagged (and killed) even more than yours did. The reason it escaped detection was simple, albeit unsatisfying: pure randomness. We don't come close to seeing everything that gets posted here—there's far too much. I've flagged it now. reply MichaelZuo 14 hours agorootparentprevThere should be some way of doing language detection to detect the relative quality of 'flaming' going on. So the highest quality 'flame wars' can remain untouched, but downranking everything else below that bar probably makes sense. reply dang 13 hours agorootparentYes, the carrot of automation would be so much easier than the stick of manual review. I haven't seen any system that works well enough yet though. The nice thing is that the comments are all public so if someone wants to take a crack at building a state-of-the-art sentiment detector or what have you, they can have a go—and if anyone comes up with anything serious, we'd certainly like to see it. As would the entire community I'm sure! reply JimDabell 4 hours agorootparentYou don’t really need a state-of-the-art anything here. People get too distracted with building the perfect system when it comes to use cases like this because they are paralysed thinking about the avoidance of false positives and make a bunch of sub-optimal decisions on that basis. False positives are much less of a problem with a human in the loop, and putting a human in the loop doesn’t require moderator effort. You can probably put a big dent in the number of low-quality comments by just showing a “hey, are you really sure you want to post this?” confirmation prompt and display the site guidelines when you detect a low-quality comment. That way you can have a much more relaxed threshold and stop worrying about false positives. Sure, some people will ignore the gentle reminder, but then you can be more decisive with flags and followup behaviour because anything low quality that has been posted will by definition already have had one warning. reply dang 4 hours agorootparentYou're right about one thing: I didn't need to say \"state of the art\". A system that works at all would be great! I don't think a confirmation prompt will help because people tune such things out after they've seen them a few times. reply intended 2 hours agorootparentI hate myself for saying it, because of all of the buzz/hype, but LLMs can assist here. You get better intent assessment than with NLP/ regex/whatever. Plus HN is entirely in English, so you never have to worry about lexical resource gaps. There is no off the shelf solution - afaik. In addition I have no idea how expensive running costs will be. But something serviceable can be built. Source: mod /t&s person dealing with these things reply JimDabell 3 hours agorootparentprevEven a bad implementation isn’t going to be showing this warning to people often enough to desensitise them. And if they make a habit of ignoring the warning to post flamewar stuff… that’s solved with moderation by a human. The intent is to add friction for knee-jerk low-quality comments, not solve for people who persistently, intentionally post low-quality comments after a warning. reply fragmede 4 hours agorootparentprevI asked for a showdead feed to make it easier to train an LLM on for this purpose but got denied. reply dang 4 hours agorootparentNot sure what you're referring to, but you don't need a showdead feed to train an LLM for this purpose. Only 2% of comments are dead, and the number of bad comments that aren't dead is certainly higher than 2%. That's the problem, in fact! reply caymanjim 14 hours agorootparentprevHow can users downrank headlines? I only have an option to upvote them. While it's not too frequent, there are things that make it to the front page that I'd like to express my disapproval of. reply dang 14 hours agorootparentUser flags, once they've accumulated above a certain threshold, have a downranking effect. Pretty sure this is in the FAQ: https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html. reply caymanjim 13 hours agorootparentI'm curious why there's no actual downvote for submissions. Was that ever discussed on here? I did a quick search for prior discussions on the topic but didn't find anything. To me, \"flag\" means \"this is a serious violation that requires moderator attention\". Something I'd want you to see and deal with because it's bigoted, illegal, spam, etc. I wouldn't flag something simply because I didn't think HN was the right audience, or because I personally dislike the topic. You seem to be encouraging me to use it simply as a downvote. I'm not going to start flagging things, nor do I feel that strongly about the lack of a downvote, but if flags are effectively downvotes behind the scenes, and if that's how users are treating flags (which they obviously are, from other comments on this thread), I think the UI should have a downvote button. I assume there's been discussion about this before and I'm curious about the thought process behind the decision. I don't find the FAQ to be informative about this. reply dang 13 hours agorootparentThe only person who could answer that is pg because that design choice was part of the embryo of HN. He must have been thinking something though, because Reddit was originally his conception and he was an influence on the earliest development of Reddit as well (edit: and Reddit does have story downvoting - forgot to mention that bit). reply webappguy 12 hours agorootparentIt's good that this is in this thread, as I bet a ton of power users (I check HN multiple times a day for years but likely only a time or two have glossed over the FAQ), did not know FLAG could be used as a downvote tool. Interesting choice by PG, I agree with the previous comment, we have all come to know FLAG as a violation tool on most platforms. Now we know. reply alisonatwork 10 hours agorootparentI'm surprised by this thread too. I never flag anything because it's recorded on my profile, and I don't want stuff recorded on my profile that isn't useful to me. I only upvote submissions and comments that I intend to refer back to in the future. Upvotes are simply bookmarks to me, so my only tool for voting on the quality of conversation is downvotes. Which, apparently, I can't do for articles without spamming up my profile. Actually I just checked my profile and saw several flags that must have appeared on a mis-click, just like how sometimes upvotes appear on a mis-click. Fortunately, unlike mis-clicked upvotes, you can still remove these. reply dang 10 hours agorootparentDo you happen to remember if the misclicks were on mobile or not? I'm planning to add a confirmation screen to cut down on flags-by-misclick, but the current intention is to make it mobile-only. reply alisonatwork 10 hours agorootparentAlmost certainly they were on mobile, where the small font and use of touch screen to scroll makes mis-clicks much more likely. I'd be happy with a confirmation screen because I rarely or never intend to flag, but by the sounds of it there are a lot of liberal flaggers who could find the extra step annoying. reply ArnoVW 2 hours agorootparentprevNot the original poster, but in my case it's always mobile. Thank you for your tireless work. HN is a breath of fresh air compared with the rest of the internet thanks to it. reply nottorp 11 hours agorootparentprevTbh if you just upvote what you like and do not vote what you don't like it's almost the same thing. The one exception is if some group organizes to upvote something that fits their agenda / business plan.

In this case, you can see from https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que... that there had been a lot of submissions, and from https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que... the ones that got comments.

This will save you a lot of effort answering questions. reply dang 13 hours agorootparent\"Transparent\" means different things to people, but if you mean a full moderation log: I think most likely it would produce more questions and effort, for no clear gain. I've written about this over the years: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&qu... Here's how I look at it: if trust is present, then we don't need to publish a full log, as long as we answer questions when people ask them. That degree of transparency has been available here for many years. If, on the other hand, trust isn't present, a moderation log won't create it. It will just generate more data for distrust to work with—and distrust always finds something. Thus our focus is on building trust with the community and maintaining it. That happens through lots of individual and group interactions, answering questions whenever we get them, in the threads or by email. That's what I spend most of my time doing. We're never going to take the community's trust for granted because it's what gives HN the only real value it has, and it would be all too easy to lose. But I would tentatively say that this approach has proven to work reasonably well for the bulk of the community. If people learn they can always get a question answered, that's a powerful trust-building factor. Equally clear is that it does not work for everybody; but that's always going to be the case no matter what we do. I don't mean that we dismiss such users' concerns—quite the contrary, I make extra efforts to answer them. I'm just not under any illusion that we can satisfy everybody. It's satisfying enough if a few people can occasionally be won over in this way—which does happen sometimes! reply kosolam 10 hours agorootparentWhile you argue against transparency, keep in mind that you are doing it in full public view. reply throwaway665544 4 hours agorootparentprevEnvision an airline withholding safety records, a car manufacturer keeping crash test results private, a restaurant refusing to provide health inspection logs, or a government refusing to disclose details of its budget allocation — all claiming that transparency would only complicate matters and provide \"more data for distrust\". In each case, the flawed nature of your core argument becomes obviously evident. I fully expect your mindset and behavior to never change (unless forced), but just wanted to point out that your argument against transparency is a cop-out and that you're on the wrong side of history here. reply quesera 3 hours agorootparentI don't think you can reasonably compare the importance of transparency in your examples to that of editorial decisions in a private moderated community. In the first set, the stakes are far higher, which is why the collection of objective data is legally mandated in the first place. In the second set, you have only the subjective opinions of people who have an explicit goal to cultivate a specific variety of community. As members of that community, we select into the cultivation regime under which we participate. Not everyone will share the same preferences, and that's OK. reply dang 4 hours agorootparentprevThat's interesting! But I don't think the \"flawed nature of my core argument\" is obviously evident—and I don't think the community would consider that obvious either. It could be fun to look into it together, but the fun stops at \"I fully expect your mindset and behavior to never change\". Why dance if someone wants to kick you in the shins? reply ranger207 2 hours agorootparentprevI think the fundamental difference is that an airline or government is working according to objective rules and regulations, while HN is not.

Personally I don't think that's abuse; I would have flagged that post if I'd seen it. That's despite the fact that I agree with a lot of what's in the post. The title is just too inflammatory. And there are more inflammatory bits in the post, such as saying the feature is \"objectively bad\", and saying that a community member's post \"gracefully omits\" some information (where the word \"gracefully\" sounds like an accusation that they were being disingenuous). Totally unnecessary. Chop off the inflammatory bits and you'd have a perfectly good blog post making an interesting point, but as-is that post was not going to lead to a productive discussion. reply nottorp 11 hours agorootparentOf course, it's only inflammatory because async is a darling to more than half of HN :) But if we get into that we'll trigger the flame war detection. reply dang 11 hours agorootparentprevI assume you mean this one: Avoid Async Rust at All Cost - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39102078 - Jan 2024 (62 comments) I can make an argument either way there. The argument in favor of flagging it could be: Rust is one of the most-discussed topics on HN; Async Rust in particular has had a ton of discussion [1], including a major thread just a few days earlier [2] - therefore this post was very much in the follow-up category [3]; the article was arguably rather low-quality, especially by the standards of this much-discussed topic; its title was flamebait and arguably misleading as well since the article seems more about async in general; and generally it was more of a drama submission on a classic flamewar topic than an interesting technical piece. I'm not saying all that is fair but it's easy to imagine good-faith users flagging for such reasons. I checked the flagging histories of those users and only saw two cases where a user had previously flagged a different article about Rust, and one was years ago. For typical examples of other stories that the same users had flagged, see [4] below. A few of those might be borderline calls but I don't see abuse of flagging there. It's important to remember that even when a story is on topic for HN, flags are legit if the story has had a large amount of discussion recently. Otherwise HN would consist of the same few discussions over and over, and we have enough of that as it is! > Is there a system for monitoring flag abuse? There are some software protections in place against that, but like all such protections, they don't catch all the bad cases and they have false positives as well. We review the flags and turn flags off sometimes. I would not say it's perfect because although we try to look over all the flagged stories, it has to be done hastily (or one wouldn't get much else done). That makes it easy to miss things. However, users often email us at hn@ycombinator.com when they think a story has been unfairly flagged, and in those cases we always take a closer look. I don't know what percentage of the time we turn flags off in such cases, but it's not a low number. So if we include \"users sending emails\" as part of \"the system\", then yes, there's a system for monitoring flag abuse. Last point: this is a pretty typical case. I'd say it's borderline but in the end I probably agree with the flaggers. If the topic of Rust (and async Rust in particular) weren't already so thoroughly covered, and/or if the flamewar aspect hadn't been there, then I'd probably disagree with the flaggers. --- [1] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que...

Most seem normal for the front page or the intellectual curiosity standard (I mean, personally I'd like a much higher standard, but I'm basing it on what HN already has).

First let's find the actual HN submissions... here they are: Ford's new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39089599 - Jan 2024 (78 comments) Secret Plan Against Germany - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39092116 - Jan 2024 (5 comments) Vx.dev – GitHub-Powered AI for effortless development - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39091819 - Jan 2024 (34 comments) Open Source Doesn't Require Providing Builds - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39094387 - Jan 2024 (68 comments) Of those 4, the Ford one and the open-source builds one set off the flamewar detector (a.k.a. the overheated discussion detector); the Germany one was flagged; and the Show HN one got moderated down. Let's look at what happened in that order. The Ford one setting off the flamewar/overheated detector is easy to understand: hatred for modern car UIs is one of the most popular topics on HN these days and always gets people going (me too! but never mind)...which no doubt is one reason why the media sites keep playing it up. We wouldn't turn the penalty off in such a case. The discussion might not have been a flamewar but it was nearly entirely generic - for example the top comment: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39090622. Given how over-discussed this topic already is, I'd say this is a case of HN's software working as intended. The open-source one setting off the flamewar/overheated detector is also unsurprising as open source stuff is also highly discussed and also gets people going. In this case I could make a case for turning off the penalty, but in the end would probably decide against it, because the article isn't very deep, the discussion is rather generic, HN has a surplus of such discussion already, and nothing here really clears the quality bar. But it's more of a borderline call; I can see how others could interpret it differently. \"Secret plan against Germany\" was flagged by users. That's a political story with a baity title, so the default would be for it to get flagged. We sometimes turn flags off on such stories but I don't know that this one clears the bar. It's more current-events than deeply-interesting, the ideological material is inflammatory and nobody is going to approach it with curiosity. The thread was already showing clear signs of turning into a flamewar. Even then, we might still turn off the flags, but only if the story were intrinsically of great significance—the sort of thing it just wouldn't make sense not to discuss at all. I doubt this clears that bar. The Show HN, we moderated down because \"star for free trial\" is not a valid thing to do in a Show HN and is something the community here would strongly oppose (see the top comment). Here's what I emailed the submitter: \"We downweighted the post after getting complaints from users. 'Star repo for free trial' is way too much of a hard sales tactic for HN, and even more so for Show HN, which implies that users can try out the product (see https://news.ycombinator.com/showhn.html). Asking them to star your repo first may be an ok tactic in other communities, but in the HN context it comes across as manipulative and is not in your interest at all.\" --- I guess the summary here is that this list is a mix of clear calls and borderline calls, but defensible ones. Anyone is free to disagree of course! No two readers, including mods, would ever make all the same calls. But if you do disagree, please keep two things in mind: (1) You have to take each decision in larger context. A perfectly good story can be a bad fit for HN's front page if, for example, the story has already had a lot of discussion; and (2) If we moderated cases like the above ones significantly differently, the consequence would be letting a lot more stories onto the front page that are significantly more repetitive and/or sensational than the median front page story is today. I doubt that most readers would want that. You can't think of this in terms of particular submissions or topics; there needs to be some principle according to which the decision would be made differently. Given HN's mandate, we're trying to optimize for intellectual curiosity. If there's a way to do that better, I'd certainly like to know what it is; but given the mandate, that's the only kind of change it would make sense to implement. reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparentprevWhat these are is evidence of your parent comment's point that this isn't direct moderator action, rather a combination of algorithms and user flags. Most likely, people flagged the Germany story because it has a sensational title and they likely aren't from Germany and so wouldn't have context to know whether it's overblown. I'm confident that Vx.dev got flagged by a bunch of people because they're tired of LLM stories (as repeatedly attested in this thread). Based on the ratio of comments to upvotes, I suspect the Open Source Builds and Ford discussions ran afoul of the overheated discussion detector. Usually when the ratio gets too lopsided the software automatically drops the post off the front page, because that's an indicator that a lot of people are arguing in the thread without actually reading or enjoying the article. reply coffeebeqn 15 hours agorootparentI think generally it works well- when there are actual major events like early COVID or Ukraine - HN managed to inform we way ahead of mass media with various interesting sources. But I’m happy to have a “news” thing pop up only a few times a year. You’re gonna have someone be mad about every instance when you moderate reply fuzztester 14 hours agorootparentprev>LLM stories Does that mean stories about LLMs or by LLMs? Serious question.

I've already raised this earlier. If Company A makes a killer product announcement, rival Company B could simply get its employees to spam down votes on and flag that post. Company A gets less visibility, and dang won't be able to come on time to stop it. This is an easily plausible hypothetical, which may already be happening. reply LordDragonfang 15 hours agorootparentFlagging requires high HN karma. You get that by being a positive member of the community. Most such people, if a company even has one, would find it against their personal ethics to do that. And dang can see the karma ratio and unflag any actually worthwhile announcements. reply Macha 15 hours agorootparentI think as people have become more and more aware that flag negatively weights items for rankings, and isn't just a \"hey have the mods look at this rule breaking thing\", more people have started using it as a downvote button. It was my understanding that HN originally didn't have a downvote feature to avoid the kind of issues that the flag usage is now causing. reply MichaelZuo 14 hours agorootparentEven the highest karma users can lose their flagging privileges, temporarily or perhaps even permanently, if they do it enough times within a time window or if abuse is detected. So from what I understand that issue should be taken care of. reply 23B1 16 hours agorootparentprevI think you're probably generally correct, but \"blaming the algorithm\" sure smells to me like a whole lot of camouflage for censorship, which we ought to know by now has as much to do with 'quality' as it does 'shaping the narrative' Generally speaking HN is a good site and a case study in successful community moderation, but you have to wonder 'who's watching the watchers' these days as the Overton window on free speech continues to be narrowed, almost entirely at the behest of big tech. reply throwaway665544 15 hours agorootparentThe simple solution would be to display a log of all removed/flagged/shadowbanned posts and comments, like Wikipedia does. reply nullindividual 15 hours agorootparentEnable showdead in your profile if you want to see dead posts.

We can only guess why users flag things, but in this case it might have been the desire to avoid gender flamewar hell, which is mostly always the same and which HN has had more than enough of. Also, one of the submissions was paywalled (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39104886), while the other was just the tweet of a graphic. We sometimes turn flags off on such submissions, assuming that the article is substantive enough to have a chance at supporting a thoughtful discussion; and also assuming that the topic hasn't been discussed recently. But neither of those particular submissions was likely to be such a solid foundation. It doesn't look like https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00169862231175831, the paper, has been submitted yet. That one might work, if you or someone wants to try submitting it. reply elpocko 16 hours agorootparentprevThe things you see on HN are not purely decided by the community.

I have no reason to doubt your word, and I may have imagined a pattern. I apologize for the accusation. reply bitcharmer 15 hours agorootparentprevExactly, the front page is heavily moderated. Almost every day you'll see posts with 50+ upvotes falling of the front page within an hour or two when some article about LISP withYC -> Sam -> Helios -> nuclear -> obvious conflict of interest -> QED. But such chains of associations rarely have anything to do with what happened to a story on HN. The explanation is almost certainly much simpler. In the case of https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39095738, it just set off the flamewar detector, a,k.a. the overheated discussion detector. We sometimes turn that penalty off, but in a case like this we wouldn't do that because \"$Celebrity says $thing about $common-subject\" is almost never a substantial story. It's essential to HN to clear such stories off the front page in order to make room for more interesting, less sensational things. If we didn't, the front page would consist of little else. reply wiredfool 17 hours agorootparentprevPossibly dups too. reply nottorp 17 hours agorootparentprevYMMV.

It's vital to HN that user flags and/or software like the flamewar detector clear most such submissions off the front page. They tend to attract a lot of upvotes because that's what sensational (and especially indignant-sensational) stories do. Without countervailing mechanisms, HN would be completely taken over by those stories. reply nottorp 17 hours agorootparentprevs/mods/users? everyone can flag stories. reply wolverine876 16 hours agorootparentIt's not flags (or not sufficient to remove the story): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39231055 reply lolinder 16 hours agorootparentFlags are sufficient. I just posted a comment on the comment you linked to: I have many times been the person who pressed \"flag\" on a story and then watched it immediately disappear.

One questions I do have–I would guess posts critical of HN/YC are going to get a log of flags and have not the best discussion. This has a side affect of biasing the home page to not have posts critical of HN/YC. Do you see this as a problem? reply jsnell 9 hours agorootparentThe home page already has a massive bias in favor for pretty much any kind of negativity, but doubly so for anything involving a tech company. It doesn't matter whether the stories are untrue, unverified, repetitive, etc, they'll still get voted up, and the comment threads will half full of low quality complaints repeated from past discussion, often only tangentially related to the submission. And it creates a very visible feedback loop, as users start to think that this is what HN is supposed to be. They're probably the biggest quality problem of HN. reply dang 5 hours agorootparentprev> posts critical of HN/YC are going to get a log of flags You can take this with a grain of salt as I'm obviously not the most neutral observer, but from everything I've seen (which at least is a lot!), yes they get a lot of flags, but they get even more upvotes. It's hard to say which side wins out in the tug-of-war. The tendency towards negativity that jsnell's comment describes is very real, and it's on the upvote side in these cases. Most probably the tug of war goes one way some of the time and the other way the rest of the time. The funny thing is that as mods, we have to have a regulating influence either way. What I mean is that if a rage story hits the top of the front page, we'll downweight it (though not necessarily all the way off the front page); but if a rage story about YC gets too many flags, we'll reduce those or remove them altogether. The recent shitfest is a good example; let me dig up some links for you... Edit: oh wait, I already mentioned those links in the GP. Sorry, I'm getting a bit tired here! Did I answer your question? reply paulcole 4 hours agoparentprev> I don't see a single story that I personally feel should not have been removed Another way to look at this is that the mods have the same biases you do. Depending on how you’re feeling on a given day, you could call that an echo chamber. reply screye 14 hours agoparentprev> mod*s* plural ? reply dang 16 hours agoprev> The assumption is that a Story cannot go from the top 30 to a position higher than 90 in a single minute, without having been explicitly removed. That's wrong. Both the flamewar detector (a.k.a. the overheated discussion detector) and user flags do that, and there are other software mechanisms that do it too. For example, if a story has been on the front page for more than (IIRC) 18 hours, it gets an automatic downweight unless we manually override it. Also, keep in mind that user flags affect a submission's rank long before the [flagged] marker appears. reply nathanyz 15 hours agoparentHow do you keep user flags from being used as a way to squash articles on a particular topic before they have had the chance to be exposed to the wider HN community? Meaning if someone were to theoretically get a real time feed of HN submissions, and flagged articles that they didn't want seen as well as messaging a group of friends to do the same thing. Do you have protections for this type of behavior that would prevent this person from having undue influence on what can and cannot have a chance at being seen by others? reply kortilla 14 hours agorootparentWhat you’re asking about is referred to as “voting ring detection” and it’s something social networks keep very secret. reply maxbond 14 hours agorootparentI don't have any proprietary knowledge of how HN does voting ring detection, but to offer an intuition about how it might work in the scenario proposed by GP, this voting ring would be detectable because their flags are highly correlated and clustered together in time. The more stories they attempt to flag down (successfully or otherwise), the more obvious the pattern will be. I'm sure you're already thinking of ways to bypass that, and yes what you're thinking will probably work, it's a game of cat and mouse and no one technique will be sufficient or work forever. (See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing) ) reply nathanyz 14 hours agorootparentprevYes, I know they do some form of detection on this for up/down votes, but flagging is supposed to be for content that violates rules, so I am curious if they handle it similarly. It doesn't really help you boost content, but can sure be used to suppress content if not tracked as flagging seems to significantly reduce visibility of a post. reply dang 10 hours agorootparentprevI just posted about that here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39235382.

Everyone has their own list of \"what happened to story X, Y, Z, and what about W and V and J too\" and while I'm happy to answer all those in principle, there are physical limits on how many I can work through.

This could also create an unnatural ranking order, so the original time before the reset should be listed as well. reply dang 11 hours agorootparentIt could certainly be a bug! but it could also be a lot of other things. Yes, the timestamp munging is artifact of HN's re-upping system, described at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26998308 and links back from there. About the timestamps, there are past explanations here: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=true&que.... The original times are always available because the modified time is used only on the frontpage and the article's /item page. If you find the article on /from or /submitted, for example, the timestamp will be the original. The two timestamps converge over time. reply falsandtru 11 hours agorootparentCan you also list the original times on the front page for consistency in rankings? reply dang 4 hours agorootparentSorry but I don't understand the question. reply Jun8 11 hours agorootparentprevI use the downvote button for two reasons: overwhelmingly for rude, come-uppance, and similar type of comments; very rarely for comments spreading FUD for no particular reason.

How can he/we verify it's wrong? The down-weighting you describe is not visible to users. Even OP won't know. You can say that down-weighting happens, but we're asking to see where down-weighting happens. reply bnralt 15 hours agorootparentAdditionally, just because it’s possible that this could happen doesn’t really give us an idea of how likely it is. Is it one of those theoretically possible, but it never actually happens events? there’s a huge difference between it impacting half of the stories that fall off that quickly, and it impacting 1 in 10,000 stories that fall off that quickly. reply rhaksw 14 hours agorootparentCommunities would get a good sense for the frequency if forums would simply disclose content moderation to the submitting users. Offending users would learn what's not allowed and share that with the community. But today's forums frequently do not disclose moderation to submitting users, and that is why we are now seeing major court cases over 230, government-led censorship, etc. reply dang 11 hours agorootparentI don't know anything about other forums, but for the reasons why on HN we don't publish a full moderation log, see https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39234189 as well as the past explanations linked from there. You can, however, always get a question answered. That's basically our implicit contract with the community. reply rhaksw 11 hours agorootparentFull moderation logs are different than showing submitters how their posts have been moderated. On HN, my understanding is that you (moderators) can penalize stories without the submitter's knowledge. But if HN instead disclosed that penalty to the story's submitter, that would help this community communicate better. As for how it works elsewhere, if a YouTube channel removes your comment, you won't know [1]. Same thing on Reddit, Facebook, and X. So while HN is relatively small, the practice of withholding content moderation decisions from submitters/commenters is widespread. [1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8e6BIkKBZpg reply dang 6 hours agorootparentI'm sorry, but I think that would have the effect of making what is already a difficult job impossible. Even if most submitters saw that information and went \"oh! well I guess that's that then,\" the number who would instantly fire off emails of protest would overwhelm our capacity to answer them. Every submitter thinks their story deserves to make HN's front page, if not #1. Actually, that's not entirely true—the cleverest and most tasteful submitters are often the most humble. We have to go out of our way to try to find what they post because they're the last people who would ever send an email demanding attention. But I can tell you from experience (81,556 emails and counting) that there are far more people who think their blog post ought to be #1 on HN than I could ever answer, and I can tell you what happens if one tries: many come back with a list of objections that is 3x longer than the entire conversation so far. The problem grows the more you feed it. I want people to be able to get answers to their questions. No one would love it more than me if we could find some automated way of reducing that load while still answering people's questions. But so far every suggestion of how to do this sets off so many alarms in my body that I wonder if I'll sleep that night. I'm afraid that might come across dismissive and I apologize if it does. It's just that the status quo already involves so much pressure that if I try to explain, I come across as a deranged beach ball that's been pinned deep underwater for 10 years. reply rhaksw 6 hours agorootparentYour comment isn't dismissive, but I do think users have a right to know where they've been moderated. reply kortilla 14 hours agorootparentprevWtf are you talking about? He’s literally telling us and has mentioned in the community many times that flagging quickly crushes a story. I’ve seen it happen when I’ve flagged stories so either there is a vast conspiracy of moderators that receive pages when I flag things so they can downrank… or maybe dang isn’t lying about something that should be super obvious as a community self policing mechanism. reply dang 11 hours agorootparentI appreciate the accuracy in your comment but do please edit out swipes like \"Wtf are you talking about\"—those spread bad feeling, and when we're talking about the community itself it's even more important not to do that. https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html reply rhaksw 14 hours agorootparentprev> Wtf are you talking about?

Some mod actions on HN are transparent, some are not. You should not assume that, just because you see marks of some form of moderation, that you can see them all.

I think about that a lot when it comes to moderation because people tend to assume everyone in the community is just like them; and really only moderators have a gauge on how saturated certain can be. It's also why I don't like the \"free speech at all costs\" meme that gets thrown around when $corporation bans $person_i_like.

This happens with every Major Ongoing Topic (MOT) and LLMs are way beyond a MOT [1]. The hivemind tires of repetition extremely quickly [2]. The trick is to try to separate wheat from chaff, where 'wheat' means the stories that bring Significant New Information (SNI) [3] and 'chaff' means the follow-up and copycat stories, which are legion [4]. It's important to understand are that there's a wide spectrum of opinion about this stuff. If you imagine a slider with \"allow zero posts about $TOPIC\" at one end, and \"allow all posts about $TOPIC\" at the other end, pretty much every user would slide it to a different position. This is true for every $TOPIC and especially for the biggest ones. Frontpage space is the scarcest resource HN has [5] and every reader has a different 'signature' of preferences that they would like to see (or not see) there. This means not only that it's impossible to satisfy everybody, but that it's impossible to fully satisfy anybody—because nobody's 'signature' is perfectly matched on the front page, and (lest any of you be thinking of this quick riposte) certainly not the mods'!

Ironically, \"I work in crypto\" went from meaning something useful to society to meaning being a parasite on society, and you'd best not accidentally use the phrase expecting people to understand it to mean the original thing (cryptography). (Yes, not all uses of cryptocurrency are a parasitic detriment. But if you happen to be working on actually useful stuff and we meet socially, then please be very quick about saying that you work at doing something with cryptocurrency or blockchain that is intended to provide actual benefit.

On the timescale of the past 4-5 years, you are correct about the popular usage. However, if cryptocurrency continues to recede from the public eye, then in another 4-5 years I think \"crypto\" will no longer mean \"cryptocurrency\". Understanding both the current lexicon and the \"archaic\" and \"recently archaic\" uses of the term I hold is both useful and pertinent to being able to communicate effectively.

I remember, in particular, the time all the posts about a lead torturer from Abu Ghraib were suppressed. Although she destroyed Congressional evidence, she was promoted to a top position at at a top tech hirer. We should be able to talk about things like that.

The idea is to define the color palette in such a way that we know whether a color combination is accessible just by looking at the color name. For example, using the USWDS design system, I know that blue-30 on gray-80 is accessible (WCAG AA), because the difference between both values is 50+. I once wrote a blog post about this (niche) concept: https://darekkay.com/blog/accessible-color-palette/ reply tomrod 16 hours agoparentYou identified the concept as niche, but I would argue this should be a first-class priority in web design. We will all be disabled at some point, permanently or temporarily. So many great tools are unusable due to accessibility reasons (like Streamlit!). reply csande17 14 hours agorootparentThe concept of color contrast isn't niche, but building your color palette around the WCAG contrast algorithm kind of is. It's useful for checking boxes if you're required to do WCAG audits, but is neither necessary nor sufficient to ensure actual users with disabilities are able to read your text. For example, #F00 text on an #000 background passes WCAG AA, but will be unreadable for users with a common form of color blindness: https://accessibility.psu.edu/color/colorvisiondetails/ reply shados 9 hours agorootparentThe wcag color contrast algorithm isn't great (and there is a proposal for a better one), but sufficient color contrast is necessary for a variety of visual conditions. That it's not good enough for some doesn't mean it's not more accessible than not doing it at all though. reply csande17 9 hours agorootparentA while back, a lot of Big Tech platforms (most notably GitHub) switched their \"should we put black or white text on this user-supplied background color\" algorithm to use the WCAG contrast formula. Doing so caused a lot of white-on-red badges to flip to black-on-red. Many users reported this was harder to read, even those without the form of color blindness which makes black and red hard to distinguish. Whether making this change was really \"more accessible\" than doing nothing is therefore pretty debatable, but it definitely helped them pass their WCAG audits. reply dylan604 12 hours agorootparentprev>unreadable for users with a common form of color blindness or people with taste reply tdeck 12 hours agorootparentprevThis brings up another interesting point I haven't considered before: how to make things not only functional, but beautiful for folks with different kinds of color vision.

At runtime, I use the material-color-utilities library[1] to generate a whole color theme based on that one root color. The applyTheme method puts the theme into CSS variables on the body like --md-sys-color-primary: #c72320; and so on for each color token. 3. In tailwind.config.js I set the colors to point to those variables, for example \"primary\": \"var(--md-sys-color-primary)\", and so on for the rest of the colors. Using this approach I can remap colors at runtime for whole subtrees by simply overriding the CSS color variables.

    "title": "Understanding the Organization of Binary Executables: A Comprehensive Exploration",
    "originLink": "https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/06/how-to-read-an-executable/",
    "originBody": "How is a binary executable organized? Let's explore it! • how-things-work • I used to think that executables were totally impenetrable. I’d compile a C program, and then that was it! I had a Magical Binary Executable that I could no longer read. It is not so! Executable file formats are regular file formats that you can understand. I’ll explain some simple tools to start! We’ll be working on Linux, with ELF binaries. (binaries are kind of the definition of platform-specific, so this is all platform-specific.) We’ll be using C, but you could just as easily look at output from any compiled language. Let’s write a simple C program, hello.c: #includeint main() { printf(\"Penguin!\"); } Then we compile it (gcc -o hello hello.c), and we have a binary called hello. This originally seems impenetrable (how do we even binary?!), but let’s see how we can investigate it! We’re going to learn what symbols, sections, and segments are. At a high level: symbols are like function names, and are used to answer “If I call printf and it’s defined somewhere else, how do I find it?” symbols are organized into sections – code lives in one section (.text), and data in another (.data, .rodata) sections are organized into segments Throughout we’ll use a tool called readelf to look at these. So, let’s dive into our binary! Step 1: open it in a text editor! This is most naive possible way to view a binary. If run cat hello, I get something like this: ELF>@@H@8 @@@@@@��88@@@@�� ((`(`� PP`P`��P�td@,,Q�tdR�td((`(`��/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2GNUGNUϨ�n��8�w�j7*oL�h�� __gmon_start__libc.so.6puts__libc_start_mainGLIBC_2.2.5ui 1```H��k����H���5 H�[]�fff.�H�=p UH��t�H��]�H`��]Ð�UH����@�����]Ð�����������H�l$�L�d$�H�- L�% L�l$�L�t$�L�|$�H�\\$�H��8L)�A��I��H��I���s���H��t1@L��L��D��A��H��H9�u�H�\\H�l$L�d$L�l$ L�t$(L�|$0H��8��Ð�������������UH��SH�H� H���t�(`DH���H�H���u�H�[]Ð�H��o���H��Penguin!;,����H There’s text here, though! This was not a total failure. In particular it says “Penguin!” and “ELF”. ELF is the name of the binary format. So that’s something! Then there are a bunch of unprintable symbols, which isn’t a huge surprise because this is a binary. Step 2: use readelf to see the symbol table Throughout we’re going to use a tool called readelf to explore our binary. Let’s start by running readelf --symbols on it. (another popular tool to do this is nm) $ readelf --symbols hello Num: Value Size Type Bind Vis Ndx Name 48: 0000000000000000 0 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT UND puts@@GLIBC_2.2.5 59: 0000000000400410 0 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 13 _start 61: 00000000004004f4 16 FUNC GLOBAL DEFAULT 13 main (full output here) Here we see three symbols: main is the address of my main() function. puts looks like a reference to the printf function I called in it (which I guess the compiler changed to puts as an optimization?). _start is pretty important. When the program starts running, you might think it starts at main. It doesn’t! It actually goes to _start. This does a bunch of Very Important Things that I don’t understand very well, including calling main. So I won’t explain them. So, what’s a symbol? Symbols When you write a program, you might write a function called hello. When you compile the program, the binary for that function is labelled with a symbol called hello. If I call a function (like printf) from a library, we need a way to look up the code for that function! The process of looking up functions from libraries is called linking. It can happen either just after we compile the program (“static linking”) or when we run the program (“dynamic linking”). So symbols are what allow linking to work! Let’s find the symbol for printf! It’ll be in libc, where all the C standard library functions are. If I run nm on my copy of libc, it tells me “no symbols”. But the internet tells me I can use objdump -tT instead! This works! objdump -tT /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.15.so gives me this output. If you look at it, you’ll see sprintf, strlen, fork, exec, and everything you might expect libc to have. From here we can start to imagine how dynamic linking works – we see that hello calls puts, and then we can look up the location of puts in libc’s symbol table. Step 3: use objdump to see the binary, and learn about sections! Opening our binary in a text editor was a bad way to open it. objdump is a better way. Here’s an excerpt: $ objdump -s hello Contents of section .text: 400410 31ed4989 d15e4889 e24883e4 f0505449 1.I..^H..H...PTI 400420 c7c0a005 400048c7 c1100540 0048c7c7 ....@.H....@.H.. 400430 f4044000 e8c7ffff fff49090 4883ec08 ..@.........H... Contents of section .interp: 400238 2f6c6962 36342f6c 642d6c69 6e75782d /lib64/ld-linux- 400248 7838362d 36342e73 6f2e3200 x86-64.so.2. Contents of section .rodata: 4005f8 01000200 50656e67 75696e21 00 ....Penguin!. You can see that it shows us all the bytes in the file as hex on the left, and a translation into ASCII on the right. The are a whole bunch of sections here (see this gist for the whole thing). This shows you all the bytes in your binary! Some sections we care about: .text is the program’s actual code (the assembly). _start and main are both part of the .text section. .rodata is where some read-only data is stored (in this case, our string “Penguin!”) .interp is the filename of the dynamic linker! The major difference between sections and segments is that sections are used at link time (by ld) and segments are used at execution time. objdump shows us the contents of the sections, which is nice, but doesn’t give us as much metadata about the sections as I’d like. Let’s try readelf instead: $ readelf --sections hello Section Headers: [Nr] Name Type Address Offset Size EntSize Flags Link Info Align [13] .text PROGBITS 0000000000400410 00000410 00000000000001d8 0000000000000000 AX 0 0 16 [15] .rodata PROGBITS 00000000004005f8 000005f8 000000000000000b 0000000000000000 A 0 0 4 [24] .data PROGBITS 0000000000601010 00001010 0000000000000010 0000000000000000 WA 0 0 8 [25] .bss NOBITS 0000000000601020 00001020 0000000000000010 0000000000000000 WA 0 0 8 [26] .comment PROGBITS 0000000000000000 00001020 000000000000002a 0000000000000001 MS 0 0 1 Key to Flags: W (write), A (alloc), X (execute), M (merge), S (strings), l (large) I (info), L (link order), G (group), T (TLS), E (exclude), x (unknown) O (extra OS processing required) o (OS specific), p (processor specific) (full output) Neat! We can see .text is executable and read-only, .rodata (“read only data”) is read-only, and .data is read-write. Step 4: Look at some assembly! We mentioned briefly that .text contains assembly code. We can actually look at what it is really easily. If we were magicians, we would already be able to read and understand this: Contents of section .text: 400410 31ed4989 d15e4889 e24883e4 f0505449 1.I..^H..H...PTI 400420 c7c0a005 400048c7 c1100540 0048c7c7 ....@.H....@.H.. 400430 f4044000 e8c7ffff fff49090 4883ec08 ..@.........H... It starts with 31ed4989. Those are bytes that our CPU interprets as code! And runs! However we are not magicians (I don’t know what 31 ed means!) and so we will use a disassembler instead. $ objdump -d ./hello Disassembly of section .text: 0000000000400410 : 400410: 31 ed xor %ebp,%ebp 400412: 49 89 d1 mov %rdx,%r9 400415: 5e pop %rsi 400416: 48 89 e2 mov %rsp,%rdx 400419: 48 83 e4 f0 and $0xfffffffffffffff0,%rsp full output here So we see that 31 ed is xoring two things. Neat! That’s all the assembly we’ll do for now. Step 5: Segments! Finally, a program is organized into segments or program headers. Let’s look at the segments for our program using readelf --segments hello. Program Headers: [... removed ...] INTERP 0x0000000000000238 0x0000000000400238 0x0000000000400238 0x000000000000001c 0x000000000000001c R 1 [Requesting program interpreter: /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2] LOAD 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000400000 0x0000000000400000 0x00000000000006d4 0x00000000000006d4 R E 200000 LOAD 0x0000000000000e28 0x0000000000600e28 0x0000000000600e28 0x00000000000001f8 0x0000000000000208 RW 200000 [... removed ...] Section to Segment mapping: Segment Sections... 00 01 .interp 02 .interp .note.ABI-tag .note.gnu.build-id .gnu.hash .dynsym .dynstr .gnu.version .gnu.version_r .rela.dyn .rela.plt .init .plt .text .fini .rodata .eh_frame_hdr .eh_frame 03 .ctors .dtors .jcr .dynamic .got .got.plt .data .bss 04 .dynamic 05 .note.ABI-tag .note.gnu.build-id 06 .eh_frame_hdr 07 08 .ctors .dtors .jcr .dynamic .got Segments are used to determine how to separate different parts of the program into memory. The first LOAD segment is marked R E (read / execute) and the second is RW (read/write). .text is in the first segment (we want to read it but never write to it), and .data, .bss are in the second (we need to write to them, but not execute them). Not magic! Executables aren’t magic. ELF is a file format like any other! You can use readelf, nm, and objdump to inspect your Linux binaries. Try it out! Have fun. Other resources: I found this introduction to ELF helpful for explaining sections and segments There’s a wonderful graphic showing the structure of an ELF binary.

There's a fair bit of implementation complexity in dynamic linking, but if you only support static ELFs then it's straight-forward. reply toast0 4 hours agorootparentI had written a static ELF loader for reasons, but when I was no longer to compile a static version of the binary I wanted to load, I found it wasn't too hard to load the system's dynamic loader instead. That's kind of the best of both worlds --- I can run a dynamicly linked binary, and I didn't have to do the linking and relocations. reply mkoubaa 14 hours agorootparentprevI've seriously considered writing an ELF loader that uses a special symbol (like _resolve) where dynamic library resolving is done imperatively.

Doing it is basically a hand assembly. One reads the documentation, selects the bytes needed using a processor data sheet, orders them into the various sections, populates the ELF fields and then it really does boil down to typing them all in. Pre-ELF times, on say an 8 bit Apple 2, the machine code monitor, allowed input of the program bytes directly. Those are then executed.

ELF is platform agnostic, and has been used in operating systems on nearly every existing CPU platform since mid 90's (with a few notable exceptions being OS X, AIX, the embedded world and Windows). reply matheusmoreira 5 hours agoparentprevModifying existing ELFs can also be extremely educational and fun. It's a bit frustrating at first because it's more or less impossible to debug this stuff when it doesn't work but when things finally start working it's awesome. Turns out it's possible to patch ELFs in all sorts of interesting ways. With the auxiliary vector you can even have introspection at runtime: Linux gives us the address of the program header table and from there you can get to anywhere. Just gotta extend a LOAD segment to cover the whole binary. For example I wrote tools to embed lisp modules and code right into my lisp's interpreter executable. The embedded segment is loaded from the ELF automatically, the interpreter just finds it and runs the code. I'm so proud of this little feature I wrote an article about it. https://www.matheusmoreira.com/articles/self-contained-lone-... Would be cool if mainstream languages adopted this method. reply kazinator 2 hours agorootparentThese tricks can be easily done simply and portably, without caring about the underlying executable format. One trick is that you can reserve some global array in the executable, which is prefixed by a byte sequence that doesn't occur anywhere. A small utility can find that byte sequence and write custom data after it to create a customized executable. I think that, also, many executable formats don't mind if something is appended to the executable. If the executable somehow knows its original size (you can write that size somewhere using the previous trick: no grotty executable format parsing required), it can open itself, seek to that offset and read the data. I think this might be how CLISP creates an .exe file on Windows; I think it takes the base clisp.exe and combines it with the lispinit.mem image into one file. reply sva_ 15 hours agoprev> When the program starts running, you might think it starts at main. It doesn’t! It actually goes to _start. This does a bunch of Very Important Things that I don’t understand very well, including calling main. So I won’t explain them. The way I understand it, the symbol main is a C-specific thing. The symbol _start is a language-agnostic entry point for the binary that will in this case call main. A convention of i.e. calling the entry point _start with main's argc/argv would make the format a lot less flexible. reply a-priori 15 hours agoparentTechnically the name _start is not special either. The binary lists its entry point address in a header and that’s where the OS starts execution from. That symbol is just called _start by convention by C and other languages, which is what the linker uses to set the entry point when writing the ELF headers, but if you’re writing your own linker scripts you could call the entry point whatever you want. reply Keyframe 14 hours agorootparentto extend on it, _start is where .text begins and address of that is set by linker reply a-priori 14 hours agorootparentThe entry point can be anywhere in the .text section, and often won't be at the beginning of the section. reply Retr0id 13 hours agorootparentTechnically it doesn't even need to be in the .text section, it could be anywhere in the address space. You'll get a segfault if it's not somewhere executable though (assuming you're on a system with an appropriately configured MMU) reply Keyframe 12 hours agorootparentprevyes and then you'll have a bad time, but at the same time per convention _start is where .text begins. You can see where it starts with readelf --file-headerand look at Entry point address field. You can change it, yes. reply Retr0id 11 hours agorootparentNo, it's not even a convention, _start is most commonly not where .text begins. Compiling a static hello world binary on my system (aarch64 fedora 39, gcc -static hello.c -o hello), .text starts at 0x410080, e_entry is at 0x4103c0, and the _start symbol is also at 0x4103c0. This is not unusual at all. reply logdahl 12 hours agorootparentprevA common hack to reduce ELF size is actually to start the first section (possibly the .text) right on the elf header, as this circumvents the alignment requirements. reply Keyframe 12 hours agorootparentprobably not even mandatory.. lots of /usr/bin stuff on my ubuntu machine have __libc_start_main only reply vlovich123 14 hours agoparentprev> Things that I don’t understand very well, including calling main. So I won’t explain them. It depends on the language runtime, but a common task will be initializing global non-0 statics. For languages like Rust/C/C++ you can also inject variables to be initialized via linker flags. Before start if the program is dynamically linked then I believe the linker runtime is run to resolve the links and then transfer control to _start.

The more I learn about the deep depths of modern computing, the more I realize that they're actually full of inelegant legacy cruft. reply kccqzy 13 hours agorootparentprevThe style guide at both my previous and current employers explicitly forbids having global non-0 statics for this exact reason: code that runs before main() is very unusual. Many assumptions do not hold. A far better way is to use function-local statics. A static variable inside a function is initialized when execution reaches that point when the function is being called. Furthermore, such initialization is thread safe so that one initialization happens despite multiple concurrent calls of the function. The only exception to that style guide rule is the new constinit in C++20. It is sometimes called linker-initialized to make it even clearer that the program didn't do anything to initialize it, the linker did. reply cesarb 13 hours agorootparent> Furthermore, such initialization is thread safe so that one initialization happens despite multiple concurrent calls of the function. IIRC, there are some popular compilers in which initialization of static variables inside functions is not thread safe (even though AFAIK the C++ standard said they should be). reply vlovich123 11 hours agorootparentI’m not aware of this problem in MSVC, clang and gcc and those are the most popular afaik. reply cesarb 10 hours agorootparent> I’m not aware of this problem in MSVC The compiler I was thinking of was indeed MSVC. From a quick web search, it seems that more recent versions of MSVC have changed them to be thread safe by default, so if you can make sure that your code will never be compiled on older MSVC versions (and that nobody will ever use the compiler option which disables the thread-safe initialization), it might be fine to depend on it. reply secondcoming 11 hours agorootparentprevThe issue with Meyers Singletons is that every time they're accessed a flag must be checked first.

And only available on hosted C. Freestanding C lets you have any entry point you want. > The symbol _start is a language-agnostic entry point for the binary that will in this case call main. That's just the linker's default. You can set it to a nicer symbol with -Wl,--entry=\"${symbol}\" and GCC even supports setting it directly with no need for the unsightly -Wl. Also, the entry point is actually a pointer, not a symbol. The linker just takes the address of the symbol you specify and sets the ELF entry point to that. > calling the entry point _start with main's argc/argv In addition to argument count and argument vector, the stack also contains the environment vector and the auxiliary vector. The process startup code can be as simple as popping all that stuff off the stack and into the appropriate registers and then calling a C function of your choosing. Note that the entry point is not itself a function: there's nothing to return to. The entry point code finishes with an exit system call to ensure clean process termination when main returns a status code.

Bickel/AP Eva Stebel, water researcher, pours a water sample into a smaller glass container for experimentation as part of drinking water and PFAS research at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Center For Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response, Feb. 16, 2023, in Cincinnati. Joshua A. Bickel/AP The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing that nine PFAS, also known as \"forever chemicals,\" be categorized as hazardous to human health. The EPA signed a proposal Wednesday that would deem the chemicals \"hazardous constituents\" under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. For the agency to consider a substance a hazardous constituent, it has to be toxic or cause cancer, genetic mutation or the malformations of an embryo. The full list of the nine substances can be found here. Health 'Forever chemicals' could be in nearly half of U.S. tap water, a federal study finds The agency cited various studies in which forever chemicals were found to cause a litany of \"toxic effects\" in humans and animals, including, but not limited to cancer, a decreased response to vaccinations, high cholesterol, decrease in fertility in women, preeclampsia, thyroid disorders and asthma, the EPA said. Short for \"per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances,\" PFAS cover thousands of man-made chemicals. PFAS are often used for manufacturing purposes, such as in nonstick cookware, adhesives, firefighting foam, turf and more. PFAS have been called \"forever chemicals\" because they break down very slowly and can accumulate in people, animals and the environment. Last summer, a study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that the man-made chemicals are present in nearly half the country's tap water supply. Artificial turf contains dangerous chemicals like PFAS — and there's no way to discard it safely The survey tested for 32 types of PFAS, though there are more than 12,000, the USGS said, and they can pose a health threat even at very small amounts. In June, the chemical manufacturer 3M said it would pay about $10 billion in lawsuit settlements to help detoxify water supplies across the country, after plaintiffs claimed the company's firefighting foam and other products were responsible for contaminating tap water with PFAS. The proposed rule will be open for public comment once it is uploaded to the Federal Register, under docket number EPA-HQ-OLEM-2023-0278.

These are recognized as being harmful. It's written all over the msds for these. What is the real change that is going to occur? I remember dealing with these substances in tiny quantities in the lab, and they were treated as carefully as cholorosifonic super acids. A lot of care goes into their disposal or recycle.

Are you aware of the usage of PFAS in textiles, food packaging, and waterproof-treated goods? I'm a little confused what you mean by care goes into their disposal.

No, because that's not true. Teflon (the substance used widely in waterproof goods and food packaging) is not the same thing as PFAS [1] (which is actually not one thing, but a whole class of things). Teflon is PTFE [2], which is different. The terminology being casually flung around this issue is misleading. Certain PFAS types were used in the manufacture of PTFE (specifically Perfluorooctanoic acid [3]) which is the actual answer to GPs question -- this is primarily an issue of industrial concern. PFOA is far more reactive than PTFE, which is one of the most inert substances known to man. You can't just group these chemicals together in the bucket of \"things that have fluoride polymers\" and panic about all of them.

An alternative would be Nikwax, waxed canvas, or polyurethenate-coatings or TPU coatings. These alternatives are already used in many goods! For containers (not wearables), you can get aluminum, stainless steel, TI, or glass waterproof cans and jars and bottles that have threaded, screw on caps with silicone o-rings to create watertight seals. For outdoor goods like backpacks or bags that you want to stay waterproof, I personally recommend PU and TPU coated drybags. For clothing like pants or shirts, I'd recommend opting for non-water-resistant/non-waterproof versions, and just buy an umbrella or raincoat with a PU or TPU coating to shield you rather than trying to wear clothing that will have water bead. Waxed canvas clothing is another option but it can be heavy. Cool if you are into it though, Fjallraven is famous for it, as is Filson.

Indeed we could. And the answer we would find is that no, such requirements were not generally imposed on ordinary homeowners, but on manufacturers and construction firms, in the form of requirements not to use asbestos in future projects and to be forced to undertake remediation efforts when asbestos was found at an existing side that needed to be modified. And we would also find that, as a result, many of those same homeowners ended up with long term health issues from asbestos exposure because they were never informed of the risks or given any feasible way to mitigate them. Nor was any cost benefit calculation done in either case (homeowners or manufacturers/construction firms) to see whether the policy that was actually adopted could reasonably be argued to be a fair tradeoff.

I think that's an outrageous mindset. Think of it like an engineer. We try to test products before deploying them to production (e.g. make all of humanity ingest it). If our tests are wrong some significant portion of the time, or if being wrong is much more damaging than we realized, then absolutely it's time to start the conversation of \"How do we get better test coverage?\" I bet if you put some paltry amount of money, say 100B (compare this to a bailout) into devising tests around the long-term safety of various chemicals some creative solutions would come up. For example, off the top of my head, if reproductive health is a concern, perhaps do a study where some animal that reproduces frequently is exposed to it for 10+ generations. We can validate if this is a viable way of testing by taking some known endocrine-disruptors and validating this test catches them effectively. For whatever reason, some people don't seem to see engineering chemicals that are safe for humanity to be a worthy enterprise, but I think it's as important as any tech company and we should make the financial incentives to reflect that and get the right minds on this problem. reply mensetmanusman 14 hours agorootparentThose tests exist already, but no ethical tests can determine the full truth.

How can anything be tested on on enough humans ethically? We can use animal models to detect some negatives. But if animal tests show a substance is \"safe\", doubt would still remain until tested on humans. It is normal that humanity creates new technology without knowing the future impact. Some people think that we shouldn't introduce new technology since we can't afford the risks. But technology has ethically positive outcomes - not only negative risk. Doing nothing has risks too. reply autoexec 2 hours agorootparentI guess that it's a fallacy because we don't need to determine the \"full truth\", just as much of it as we can if doing so would prevent mass poisonings. reply thereisnospork 9 hours agorootparentprevI'm sorry but that is nothing but a gross oversimplification of the topic.

I assume nobody is proposing banning water, etc. But even plain water can result in large amounts of environmental damage in certain contexts. If the point is just to ban things when the risks outweigh the benefits, that is simply the status quo. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentThe challenge is, one can usually only make that kind of trade off when something is well known enough to know the risks and benefits in a wide variety of environments. The first real problematic PFAS compounds were in fire fighting foam used to put out aircraft fires for example, and took decades for their problems to show up. Which requires either extremely exhaustive (or essentially impossible economically) testing, or yolo’ng it. Or only using already known compounds. reply lazide 13 hours agorootparentprevNo, you’re just being disingenuous. How do you create a MSDS for a chemical that hasn’t been made yet? How do you decide it’s safe to create a large enough quantity of a chemical to figure out what even should be in that MSDS? How can you know if something is mutagenic without exposing it to DNA? Or cancer causing without exposing it to a living organism? Or causes reproductive harm without exposing it to organisms and seeing how it impacts reproduction? Those all are potential harms. Traditionally, some enterprising alchemist/chemist would just try it - and if they lived, would write a paper on it. Further research and experience would then inform if a better alternative should be used. The Haber-Bosch process that allowed the creation of artificial fertilizers has allowed for the massive expansion of the human race. Roughly 3/4 of the humans on this planet right now would starve to death without it. Assuming they didn’t get nuked first. That was in 1909. It also allowed for the creation of modern high explosives (and propellants) at scale, and the horrors of WW1 and WW2. And the mining revolution, which has provided the raw materials necessary to build our modern economies at vastly cheaper prices than were ever possible before for humanity. Chemistry is a fundamental building block of modern society, and removing it would literally cause its sudden and violent collapse. Deciding if ‘freezing’ it in place, or letting it continue to develop new and interesting applications is the discussion - because no, we weren’t sustainable before (unless you count constant and ongoing genocides as ‘sustainable’), and we’ve long passed the point where trying to return to that would be anything but apocalyptic. Literally. And keeping in mind that just because we agree to stop research in one area doesn’t mean anyone else (competitors) will do so. Regardless of if that is in the realm of drugs, or weapons, or soaps, or foods, or whatever. reply naremu 13 hours agorootparentSo, let me get this straight: I've claimed reducing everything to \"chemicals\" is disingenuous, and in response, I'm immediately told \"no, you\" and then challenged with debates over topics or ideas I haven't actually talked about like >How do you create a MSDS for a chemical that hasn’t been made yet? What argument that I've made do you present this logical fallacy to? > Deciding if ‘freezing’ it in place, or letting it continue to develop new and interesting applications is the discussion This is not my viewpoint and was never mentioned by me. This is an argument you're either making in reference to another comment, a point not addressed by myself, or you're talking to your own strawman, who doesn't seem to have a significant stance other than \"well, it's basically unsolveable!\". That is the discussion I was having. You're doing exactly what I mentioned, being disingenuous about the literal technical definition of chemicals and muddying waters because water is a chemical too, man! Well watering my lawn doesn't kill it or give organisms that live mere decades cancer. That's a reasonable measurement to start. And if you're really saying there can't be more in depth, slower research to chemicals that people will end up having in their bloodstream, then I don't even know what to say to that, other than Andrew Ryan would be proud. reply lazide 11 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t seem like you’re reading your comments or my replies? The concern about the chemicals we’re talking about is that they are in the water you are using to water your lawn, anmong other things, and have been getting made at scale for over 50 years. And is a family of 6 million something chemicals, some of which we suspect now may be dangerous - including causing cancer - and some we have no idea. We can only test for things we suspect are an actual issue and have a test for. And for which we actually test. Which we don’t really have reasonable tests for ‘doesn’t bio degrade over decades+ and bio accumulates to potentially dangerous levels’ yet. Except watching nature, anyway, which is how we discovered this problem. There are millions more chemicals that this hasn’t happened either. So what do you propose doing here besides freezing it until such tests can be put in place and developed? reply thaumasiotes 14 hours agorootparentprevNo, it's pretty much the only appropriate response to edgyquant's demand that we do the impossible. reply amarant 15 hours agorootparentprevDo you know what the word \"chemical\" means?

We're a very long way from that. 85% of cars being sold globally are still ICE, and the population of vehicles on the road lags sales figures by a couple of decades. And even with the increase in EV sales figures, oil demand is not dropping, because the total demand for cars is increasing. But if demand for oil starts to drop due to EV adoption, OPEC is for sure going to make sure it's cheap as hell to operate an oil burning car, and people in the majority of the world where it's still legal will have a huge incentive to keep buying them. reply RetpolineDrama 14 hours agorootparentprevReally? Because I would think refineries/wells start shutting down the second their profit goes negative. reply bluGill 11 hours agorootparentThat isn't how it works. Oil wells cost a lot of $$$ upfront to get the first drop of oil. Every liter of oil after that is practically free - there is a little electric or gas needed to run the pumps, but that is so little it doesn't count. Most of the cost is in finding a spot to drill, getting permissions to drill there, and then drilling. (mineral rights are really complex, but generally whoever owns them gets a % of the sale value of the crude, so if the price goes down or the well produces less they get less money) Which is to say oil wells don't shutdown when the profit goes negative because that never happens. Oil wells do shutdown (or more likely produce less because the pump is slowed) if the owner decides they want to control supply to bring the price up - but you have to have a lot of wells to even think about that. During the pandemic oil wells shutdown, but that was because there was no place to put store the oil - if you could store it there was plenty of value in pumping it (though it was an investment). Refineries don't shutdown when the profit goes negative. Again, because the sunk cost in machinery is a large part of the cost. If the profit goes down they will often not remodel and eventually shutdown because the equipment it wore out. Many have shutdown because the right crude wasn't available (and they didn't want to invest in machinery to handle crude they can get) - and then reopened a decade later when someone started pumping the right crude again. Yes of course if profit goes negative they will both shutdown. However long before profits go negative they will be managing things and so in practice they are shutdown for other reasons first. reply kube-system 14 hours agorootparentprevThe high-cost suppliers in countries where cartels are illegal do.

Fuel, bitumen and other heavy fractions is the main reason we distill oil. Those are the hydrocarbons that are actually hard to make. The light fractions used in plastics fall out of that process. It’s not a competition, it’s a synergy. If they’re going to turn ALL the oil into plastics, at the very least they have to have more processing steps. It’s not hard but it will require bigger refineries, in other words, more expensive plastics. Also, they will be competing with bio-plastics and other alternatives, that will probably get more favourable regulations in many countries. Plastics won’t go away. Even if we don’t pump for oil it’s not very hard to make the same plastics from biological hydrocarbons. reply RetpolineDrama 14 hours agorootparentprev>So halving demand is more likely to reduce prices. 1) Halve demand 2) Price plummets 3) Sources shut off 4) Prices climb again, _but at lower volume_ Plastification requires $x/barrel oil _at insane volume_ to work. reply marcosdumay 12 hours agorootparentThe key thing people are talk over each other here is that step #3 takes years.

At normal working temperatures, it is one of the most chemically and biologically inert materials known to exist. PTFE has a number of unique properties that make it an irreplaceable material in a wide variety of applications. Some of the feedstock chemicals used to produce PTFE are likely toxic. The most concerning of these is perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA); this is one of the chemicals that the EPA proposal applies to. Most manufacturers of PTFE have already voluntarily phased out the use of PFOA. There is some debate about whether the replacement feedstock chemicals are meaningfully less toxic. These feedstock chemicals can - and should - be prevented from ever entering the environment, which would largely nullify concerns about their toxicity. reply TylerE 15 hours agorootparentYou’re overselling it a bit.

I’m under the impression that a lot of environmental contamination likely also comes from their use in firefighting foams - a useful application to be sure, but there are some things it’s not a great idea to spray straight into the environment. > Are they chemically bonded to something that reduces bio-interactivity? A huge part of the story of PFAS is that they are quite resistant to (permanent) chemical bonding, which has often lead to them being thought of as “inert” in a sense that is conflated with safety. But this sense of inertness is a bit of a red herring when it comes to biology (plenty of things interact with receptors without covalently bonding) and meanwhile makes them highly persistent both within organisms and in the environment. “PFAS” as a literal chemical category feels pretty broad. The ones best established to be harmful are fluorosurfactants like the whole list explicitly targeted here. But broadness is also kind of the point because there are tons of chemicals in use that are likely to have similar accumulative properties that have never really been studied for health effects, and which can’t really be assumed to be harmless if the others aren’t. reply Nevermark 14 hours agoparentprev> sorry, my exhalations are not \"pollution\" Try breathing in a bag. Air is 21% oxygen. On average, a resting adult breathes in about 250ml of oxygen per minute. Air is about about 0.04%. The average adult expels approximately 200ml to 250ml of carbon dioxide per minute. Roughly the same as the o then they intake. So the relative percentage of C02 increases extremely rapidly in any small volume of air, compared to relative reduction in oxygen. Up to 0.5% (5,000 parts per million): Considered safe for prolonged exposure, this level is typically used as an occupational exposure limit. 1% to 2%: Can cause drowsiness and poor air quality perception. 3%: May lead to impaired hearing, headache, and increased blood pressure and pulse rate. 5% and above: Can lead to shortness of breath, dizziness, confusion, and even loss of consciousness. Exposure at this concentration for several hours can be dangerous to human health. Above 8%: Can be fatal. More? Once someone expires, the percentages reach an unwanted steady state! Even in a tightly closed building, CO2 buildup can impact cognition. And build up in the atmosphere impacts the heat balance of the planet. Your exhalations are only pollution when they destabilize healthy levels. So that’s a bit of a straw man concern.

It might be counter intuitive - because water is not a risk in most contexts. But on another planet where water is an unusual corrosive, then of course it could be a pollutant. And even on Earth, if some production system kept pumping our environment full of water as a side effect of some process, to the point of endangering or killing ecosystems, in that context it would be a pollutant. A pollutant is when the accumulation of some left over of a process significantly alters and harms its environment. Pollutant is a statement about some material’s impact in its context.

    "originBody": "Carl Weathers, Apollo Creed from Rocky movies, dies aged 76 Published 4 hours ago Share IMAGE SOURCE, GETTY IMAGES By Max Matza BBC News US actor Carl Weathers has died at the age of 76, according to his family. Weathers, who starred as Apollo Creed in the first four Rocky films, \"died peacefully in his sleep\", according to a statement released by his family. His other film credits include Predator, with Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Adam Sandler's Happy Gilmore. Weathers, who began his career as an NFL linebacker, \"was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life\", his family's statement added. \"Through his contributions to film, television, the arts and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations,\" said the family. \"He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.\" The athlete-turned-actor was comfortable starring in action and comedy, in appearances ranging from Arrested Development to The Mandalorian, where he featured in all three seasons of the Disney+ hit series. His one-time co-star, the former California governor and superhero action star Schwarzenegger, praised Weathers on X, formerly Twitter: \"Carl Weathers will always be a legend. An extraordinary athlete, a fantastic actor, and a great person. \"We couldn't have made Predator without him. And we certainly wouldn't have had such a wonderful time making it.\" Born in 1948 in New Orleans, Weathers began his career playing football at San Diego State University, where he studied theatre acting, before joining the Oakland Raiders in 1970. During his over 50-year career in Hollywood, he appeared in more than 75 films and TV shows, according to Deadline. In 2021 he was nominated for an Emmy for his role in The Mandalorian. He directed two episodes of the Star Wars series, as well as episodes of Law & Order and Chicago Med. He was also known for Action Jackson, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Eight Crazy Nights, Little Nicky and the Toy Story franchise. Adam Sandler paid tribute on social media, writing: \"A true great man. Great dad. Great actor. Great athlete.\" \"What a guy!! Everyone loved him,\" he wrote. \"Love to his entire family and Carl will always be known as a true legend.\" Breaking Bad actor Giancarlo Esposito said: \"I will sorely miss my dear friend & brother Carl Weathers. You are truly one of the most wonderful human beings I have had the honor & pleasure of spending time with!\" In a video posted on Instagram, fellow Rocky star Sylvester Stallone said Weathers was \"an integral part of my life, my success... I give him incredible credit\". \"I never could have accomplished what we did with Rocky without him. He was absolutely brilliant,\" Stallone added in an emotional tribute. In an interview with the Detroit News last year, Weathers called himself a \"lucky guy\". There are so many people that came before me who I admired and whose success I wanted to emulate, and just kind of hit the benchmarks they hit in terms of success, who created a pathway that I've been able to walk and find success as a result,\" he said. \"And hopefully I can inspire someone else to do good work as well.\" \"I guess I'm just a lucky guy.\" 10 sports stars who became actors Is Rocky 'the most successful bad film ever made'?

And not only that, but it was actually Weathers himself who came up with the running bit for his character: \"So I called Carl, and said, 'Hey, I don't know if you've seen the show but we wanna use you for it, and you'd be working with David Cross.' And he goes, 'Great, but let me ask you something. It's not going to be just a bunch of Rocky jokes is it?' I laughed, 'No! No! Give me a little credit, Carl. Of course not! It's a multidimensional character.' And he was like, 'Because I direct and I'm a funny guy and I don't wanna just do a bunch of Rocky jokes. Nobody wants that. Maybe I could be really cheap or something?' And I said, 'Whaaaat?' 'Maybe I could be really cheap?' 'Really? You'd like to do that?' 'Oh, absolutely, that's what I'm saying. I want to play someone funny, not just be a sight gag.' It was so much better. I went back to the writers room and said, 'You're not going to believe this.

    "originBody": "Why Isn't theElement 100% Supported on CanIUse.com? February 02, 2024 I saw a Mastodon post that made me laugh this morning. It seemed sort of crazy that the html element wouldn’t have 100% support on CanIUse.com. Heck, I’ve been using it since 1994 and it worked just fine back then! This led me down a bit of a rabbit hole. A bit of background, first. Can I Use… is a site that helps web developers track the adoption rate of web technologies. It estimates browser usage, measures feature compatibility, and spits out a number that tries to reflect how available a feature is. It’s a site I’ve been using almost since it launched in 2010 and I’ve always found it really useful. So why is it currently saying the html element only has 97.34% support? That’s less than the current support percentage for the audio element! It also looks like the same is true for the a and p elements with exactly the same 97.34% support number. One thing I learned when looking into this is that a lot of the data on the site actually comes from MDN 1. MDN is another resource I use and trust, so this seems reasonable to me. It also often has stats about feature uptake, so it makes sense for CanIUse.com to piggyback on that. Looking at the MDN page for the html element, it has a browser compatibility section. In that are two rows with a lot of red Xs. The first is for the optional manifest attribute on the html element. This is deprecated and was never standardized. The second is the related “secure context required”, which is an Editor’s Draft — that is, not something currently on the standardization track. I don’t know how this was previously related to the html element, but that use was also never standardized and is deprecated. So, there are two features listed here that almost all browsers correctly do not support. But still, it doesn’t look like this is the reason for the missing 2.66%. There are some browsers that are listed as “Support Unknown”. Adding up all the current usage for these browsers comes to 1.27%. There’s also an entry for Android Browser versions 2.1–4.3 which is listed as not supporting the html element — which I find highly dubious — but it’s listed as having a usage share of 0%. I suppose there might be some rounding errors here that would bump the 1.27% to 2.66%? But I still find this very unclear. Also, I feel very confident that those older browsers supported the html element! So yeah, I don’t have a great answer for this. If you do, please let me know! I’ve always taken the numbers from CanIUse.com with a few grains of salt, but I’ll be adding a few more going forward. I still think it’s a great resource. UPDATE: rezonant on Mastodon poked me to let me know that he posted a comment on Hacker News that has a possible explanation. The short version: if you switch to “% of all tracked” in the top right beside “usage”, and then add up the “support unknown” browser number, you get 99.98%. It’s a lot easier to see how rounding errors could make this the correct number. Still, I think the way older browsers are handled here is confusing. It doesn’t affect the overall number too much, but in the case of base level elements like html, it seems odd. MDN used to stand for Mozilla Developer Network. Now it’s just MDN. I spent a few minutes looking on the MDN site to see if I could find any mention of the full name, but I guess they’re just all in on “MDN” now. ↩",

    "commentBody": "Why isn't theelement 100% supported on caniuse.com? (anderegg.ca)257 points by GavinAnderegg 12 hours agohidepastfavorite71 comments rezonant 10 hours agoYou'll notice that CanIUse has a \"% of all\" option right above the Global percentage. If you dig into the gear wheel on a feature you'll see more information about this: Usage calculation: ( ) All Users: Any usage % of browsers not tracked by caniuse is considered unsupported. ( ) All tracked users: Excludes the usage percentage of browsers not tracked on caniuse. This implies that CanIUse pulls in data about global browser usage, but does not cover all of the browsers mentioned in that usage data. By default it just assumes that browsers that it doesn't track any data on are not supported. If you change this to All Tracked Users you then get 98.71%. The sum total of the browsers listed in the chart which have unknown support (these are different than the browsers being referred to in the setting above) is 1.27%. Worth it to note that likely there's some rounding going on here, as when you take 98.71% and add in that 1.27% you get 99.97999..% Pretty close though. So the real issue is indeed that those browsers show Unknown, when I think we can safely say they do in fact support the html element. reply derefr 7 hours agoparentGiven what the \"not recognized as anything in particular\" User-Agent strings in the request logs to our API SaaS look like, I have a feeling that 1.27% of \"browsers\" could very well actually be various kinds of special-purpose scrapers that have accidentally stumbled out of their domain of expertise. And as such, they may not necessarily know how to parse . They could be JSON scrapers! reply tgv 2 hours agorootparentI've come across browsers embedded in another app. One of them was a coupon-app. Apparently, people open these for the coupons, and have to browse somewhere, but then keep browsing inside the app. It had a weird user agent. And of course the PlayStation browser, that was another weird one. So there might be real browsers in the rest group. reply dotancohen 9 minutes agorootparentUsing such application-embedded browsers is a very common technique to circumvent locally-enforced network access controls. reply rezonant 6 hours agorootparentprevGood point! Would we call them browsers? Well, no, but they do speak HTTP and are bound to get picked up in the data. I suppose that would be the remaining 0.03% though, since the 1.27% is accounted for, if we trust the upstream browser usage data. reply maweki 3 hours agorootparentI think the word \"browser\" usually doesn't appear in the w3c documents. It's a \"user agent\". And as long as the scraper works for a user, it fits nicely. reply dotancohen 11 minutes agorootparentIn my usage over the past two decades, a browser is a user agent whose output is meant to be consumed by a human. Contrast with a script or scraper, which are user agents whose output is designed to be the input to another processing technique. reply Mtinie 3 hours agorootparentprevShould they be represented in that case? Scrapers can literally cover every variable within all programmatic languages. Special purpose is specific, and therefore not standard.

Huh, yeah, nerd-sniped on that one; I can't find anything either. reply atopal 9 hours agoparentWe made that change around 2017. Mozilla Developer Network is somewhat ambiguous. In surveys and user interviews people were confused about the name. Web developers thought it might be a resource specifically for Mozilla developers, which to be fair was the focus in the earlier days. The web platform documentation was just one part of many Mozilla related things documented on MDN for some time. In 2017 though the web platform documentation had grown to make up 95% of MDN's traffic and it had become clear that it was not primarily a resource for Mozilla developers anymore, the name change to \"MDN Web Docs\" was intended to reflect that change in focus. reply susam 9 hours agorootparentWhen the expansion of the first letter of an acronym becomes obsolete, I think it is a good opportunity to turn the acronym into a recursive acronym, e.g., MDN = MDN Developer Network. reply patze 9 hours agorootparentThis reminds me on the recursive XNA acronym which stands for “XNA’s not acronymed”. reply susam 8 hours agorootparentNice one! Thanks for sharing! One of my most favourite recursive acronyms is XINU which stands for \"XINU Is Not Unix\". The delightful thing about this acronym is that \"XINU\" is also the reverse of \"UNIX\". Upon a closer look, it turns out that for a given word W, a recursive acronym proclaiming that it is not W while simultaneously being the reverse of the word W, we need W to be of the form W = \"?NI?\" where each \"?\" denotes a distinct letter. Some fictitious examples: * ANIL ⇒ LINA = LINA Is Not ANIL. * KNIT ⇒ TINK = TINK Is Not KNIT. Words of the form \"?N?\" also work if we are happy with a contracted \"is\" in the acronym. In fact we can get circular recursive acronyms in such cases: * ANI = ANI's Not INA ⇔ INA = INA's Not ANI. * ONE = ONE's Not ENO ⇔ ENO = ENO's Not ONE. Both acronyms in each pair refer to each other thus making them circular while also being the reverse of each other! These could be useful names to express friendly banter between rival projects. reply phinnaeus 8 hours agorootparentHow about the classic \"I'm So Meta, Even This Acronym...\" ? reply susam 8 hours agorootparentWow!

MDN is just a name, you learn what MDN means and you know it, like you learned what Apple means or what Windows means. \"Mozilla Developer Network\" sounds more like a description that you're supposed to interpret the meaning of, and one natural interpretation is the network for Mozilla developers, and another is that it's a network for people developing for Mozilla platforms, maybe to do with Firefox add-ons. I'd maybe call it \"misleading\" more than \"ambiguous\" but meh. reply Forricide 8 hours agorootparentprevThis is a super interesting anecdote, considering the name definitely confused me at the time - trying to learn web development with no context I did indeed think it was some kind of Mozilla-centric resource.

See also Apple, who, after a relatively brief dalliance with the name iTools, rebranded its online service as \".mac\". Sigh... I miss early Internet names like these, although I suppose the fact that the original dot com era didn't last and a bunch of early startups got wiped out - Pets.com, anyone? - gave it a stench that marketers were all too willing to run away from at the first possible opportunity. reply tentacleuno 9 hours agorootparentprevObligatory Wikipedia article[0].

The overwhelming majority of the source is going to consist of the text of the documentation, which is open anyway. reply Waterluvian 10 hours agorootparentprevThat’s a clever and thoughtful idea, but those responsible for branding at Microsoft would burn the entire place down if this was ever to be the case. reply pfgallagher 10 hours agoparentprevSearching for: site:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ \"mozilla developer network\" yielded ~115 results on Google reply GavinAnderegg 10 hours agorootparentIt is mentioned by its old name in older blog posts, but there seems to have been a rebrand to just \"MDN\".

Interestingly, they were one of the very first ISPs that I can remember, certainly one of the, if not the, most advertised to consumers at the time and I think it is the only ISP which still exists today from those very early days.

No HTML tag there. reply zamadatix 8 hours agoparentIt doesn't seem particularly related ashas about the same percentage: https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_title. Rather it seems more to do with how it counts browsers it knows the usage of but doesn't have validation of support one way or the other for. Trivia: That HTML is actually invalid, gets treated as a blank title, which is not valid. If you change it to . or similar it should be error free though. reply chrismorgan 2 hours agoparentprevWhen framed in a protocol that can convey a title otherwise, such as email with its Subject header,is optional.

If you open this page with any browser, it will contain antag. reply Mogzol 6 hours agorootparentThe difference is that it is actually valid according to the HTML spec. Browsers will render lots of invalid HTML which is shorter than that, but if you put such HTML in a validator such as [1], it will have errors. Putting . in that validator returns no errors (it does have a warning though). Although in response to OP's question, no, I don't think it is related. [1] https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea reply phyzome 11 hours agoprevProbably worth breaking out a separate feature \"html-manifest\" on caniuse. Also, I want to echo that MDN is a fantastic resource. reply starkparker 10 hours agoprev> a lot of the data on the site actually comes from MDN Eh... not really. The feature support matrix (as linked on CanIUse) comes from MDN's browser-compat-data repo. Here's the HTML element's source data: https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/html/el... This doesn't contain the testing and usage info that CanIUse cites for support, though, just which browser versions included which features. CanIUse also points to their own repo, which contains a lot of data: https://github.com/fyrd/caniuse But I can't find an easy entry point to find where they're getting the numbers for a specific element. The data on there seems to be primarily for features. So the more precise question is, where is CanIUse getting HTML element testing and usage numbers from? Because that seems to be the issue. reply galaxyLogic 2 hours agoprevWhat would it mean to NOT \"support\"-element?

As someone else noted it's not actually even required to have a valid error-free HTML document, for that onlyand a validare.

There are several listed on my local Craigslist right now for between $500 and $2500 USD. I could simply play pinball whenever my heart desired. The fellas who bankrupt early and rode with someone else when we play cards could have something do. I could maintain it obsessively, finding original manuals and schematics. They don't depreciate significantly if maintained. Am I a moron for not owning one? Why don't you people own one? reply ohwaitnvm 10 hours agoparentI picked up my first two last year - they require a decent amount of maintenance -- more the older they are. Home use only machines will be in better shape - my 2018 Stern pin (3rd owner, home use only) has only really needed replacements of the coil stops and sleeves for the the upper flippers. On the other hand, my 2002 Stern machine (3rd owner, but first was on location in a Century theater where it saw thousands of plays) required in just two months of ownership: - diagnosis and replacement of a bad bridge rectifier for the controlled lights, - new plumb bob (machine info showed it had never reported a tilt before - looks like it had been removed before ever been played), - clear mylar patch on the playfield near the plunger lane exit, - replacement of the main power cable -- someone had ripped out the third/ground prong (which is apparently very common), - redoing the connections inside the power box -- someone had decided all the connectors should just live in giant solder balls....., - replacement of the coin door lock mechanism, - replacement of a flipper return spring and it has a few cracked pieces of protective plastic that just aren't worth trying to find replacements for. In total all together that's still less than $50 in parts, but figuring out the lights issue took weeks, and some of these required soldering. (And desoldering! I strongly recommend the Hakko FR301 desoldering tool instead of mucking about with copper braid.) For the prices you listed, I would guess you're looking at older machines, which will probably have more issues sooner than new (but not brand-new!) pins. I suggest pinside.com for the classifieds and also the \"_X_ Machine Owner\" forum threads which might have game-specific info for you. Stern has very detailed manuals, and pinballlife/marcospecialties have just about every part you might need when you do have a problem. Good luck, and have fun! reply Boogie_Man 5 hours agorootparentThis is the best, most helpful message I've ever received in response to something I've typed on the Internet. I'll take it to heart, thanks boss. Edit: to further take advantage of your kindness, let me ask you a question: it looks like an old bowling alley near me has several machines reported to be non functional, including an Elvira and the Party Monsters. In your humble restoration opinion, would it make sense for me to stop by and give them the old \"eh it's busted? Maybe I can do something with it. Sell it to me for $400?\" type spheel and see if I can dump ~$700 into it to get a functional machine for a good price? I wouldn't be looking to resell. https://pinside.com/pinball/machine/elvira-and-the-party-mon... https://www.afpinball.com/restorations/system-11b-mpu-batter... reply ohwaitnvm 1 hour agorootparentAww I'm glad it helped! I wanted to illustrate the amount of upkeep it takes to even keep a machine that was already about 99% working from disrepair. I think you could give the offer a shot, but it looks like the market is a good bit higher - the bigger the discount the more you're probably going to have to work to get it operational. It looks like you've already got a headstart on that, so if none of this is scaring you off, I say do it! My two machines are Whitestar and Spike2 systems, and are from Stern, which is still operating. My concern going for Party Monsters would be that System 11(B?!) boards and replacement parts may be in short supply, and I can't comment on the quality of documentation for it all. Looking at pinside though, between the owner thread and system 11 thread, there are probably more than enough helpful folks who will have good advice for you if you take on the project. https://pinside.com/pinball/forum/topic/elvira-and-the-party... https://pinside.com/pinball/forum/topic/system-11-club Watch out though - I see posts about mods in the game thread. My newer machine came with 6-7 already installed by the first owner, which got me hooked. At this point I've added another 25 or so... I think I spend as much time working on these machines as I do playing them (but my goal is to make my own machine, so every piece of work comes with learnings and better understanding of what's in store for me.) Post back here later and let me know what you end up doing! reply bdash 12 hours agoparentprevThey’re heavy, awkward to move, and take up a lot of floor space. They’re loud and require ongoing maintenance. They’re also a lot of fun! I really enjoy both playing and working on mine. reply mrrsm 11 hours agoparentprevI got a virtual pinball machine which gives me all of the fun of owning a pinball machine with almost none of the maintenance. My machine is the size of a normal wide body pinball cabinet and works like a normal machine does as far as tilt/bumping, flippers, coin door, etc go. If you have the time and passion for keeping up a regular pinball I would go that route. If you want something a bit more easy to maintain but just as fun to play I would look for a virtual pinball setup. reply FabHK 3 hours agoparentprevI've had a 1986 Bally Motordome for decades. It's fun. There are many techniques and tricks to get better, detailed in books and online, and when you have a machine at home, as you say, you can play whenever your heart desires and practice. Playing for a long time has a meditative quality, too, and is a good metaphor for life - a mix of skill and random factors. As others have noted, maintenance is a bit of an issue, though not overwhelming. The machines are beautifully crafted - maintenance can be fun. reply larrik 12 hours agoparentprevYou people? I have 4! :P They require enough maintenance that you'll need a back up ;) reply bdash 12 hours agorootparentThat's how mine started getting out of control. I had one non-working machine that I rescued from a family friend's barn. My wife decided we should get a newer, working one so we would have something to play while I kept working on the first. A year later and I'm at over a dozen… reply CoastalCoder 6 hours agorootparent> My wife decided we should get a newer, working one so we would have something to play while I kept working on the first. Does she have a sister??? reply Boogie_Man 12 hours agorootparentprevThere's a bit of a gap between 2 and 12. Can you elaborate? reply bdash 11 hours agorootparentI've bought non-working pinball machines from Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist for great prices and brought them back to life. They cover a range of the pinball spectrum from electromechanical games from the 1970s through 1990s games with dot matrix displays. I fix these up, play them until I get bored of them, then sell them to make room for future projects or trade them for something new-to-me. Separately from that, I've bought, sold, and traded to end up with a set of games that I enjoy playing. There are a couple of modern Stern games in the mix along with some mid-90s Bally/Williams games. reply Boogie_Man 11 hours agorootparentIf I may ask, are you making a worthwhile profit on the machines you sell, or are you doing it for the love of pinball? I used to know a guy who claimed to have done this with claw machines and made a lot of money. (Yes he had a ponytail) reply bdash 11 hours agorootparentI'm not really making any money doing it. I learn a lot and enjoy the process. As an example, I picked up a 1978 Bally Strikes and Spares machine from Marketplace. It'd sat in the owners garage unplayed for 10 years and no longer worked. I bought it for $400, put somewhere between 20-30 hours of work into it and around $600 in new parts. If I'm lucky, I'll be able to sell it for around $1800. reply feedsmgmt 9 hours agoparentprevThey're big and heavy and have a lot of wear parts that are expensive to maintain. Standing in one spot not blinking isn't great. I can play pinball in VR and have about an equally good experience these days. reply JKCalhoun 9 hours agoparentprevSome months ago Visual Pinball was on HN's front page. I took the impetus to actually build a full size virtual pinball cabinet. It turns out the wife actually enjoys it more than I do. Instead I enjoyed building it, and now I've been deep diving into fixing the scripting on some of the older EM (electro-mechanical) tables (virtual ones) that are out there. Learning Visual Basic (or a variant of it) was never on my Bingo card.... reply whitej125 10 hours agoparentprevI grew up having pinball machines in our house (my dad bought and fixed them as a hobby, sold or gifted them to friends). I have my childhood Black Knight pinball with me now. Love playing it, the kids and their friends love it. Honestly it’s great. Repairs and maintenance is very DIY able at least for this age of machine. Luckily I can still call dad when I’m stuck troubleshooting. No idea if they hold their value. Never thought of selling. reply mumblemumble 10 hours agoparentprevThe organizer of a pinball tournament league I used to participate in expressed regret about buying his own machine. The up-front price of buying one isn't terrible, no. What he disliked was that he felt committed to that one single machine, and ended up playing it so much that he was thoroughly bored of it within a year. reply vikingerik 8 hours agorootparentYou're not committed, though. It's not that hard to resell and buy another one, or even find a partner to trade machines with. I've done that quite a few times. I have 5 machines at home, but have rotated through close to a dozen this way in the last couple years. reply TulliusCicero 9 hours agoparentprevMy quota for stupid nerd space things is already taken up by my DDR pads that were taken from a 7th-gen cabinet.

Definitely give them some support if you're a Pinball fan. Portland was the original base location and then IIRC they expanded to other cities. Portland's reputation as the pinball capital of the world is well founded. reply larrik 12 hours agoparentI thought Chicago was the pinball capital of the world, given every pinball manufacturer basically ever was based there. reply mumblemumble 10 hours agorootparentIt was for manufacturing. It's not as great as one would hope for actually playing. The city has an ordnance that says that you need a special \"public place of amusement\" license if you have more than 3 machines and are open to the public, and it can be rather expensive. So places to play are generally limited to a relatively small number of barcade-type venues that tend to be loud and crowded. I prefer the pinball scene in Milwaukee. Seemingly every neighborhood has at least a few relaxed, cozy bars with a decent number of machines in the back room, and there are also a few decent venues that are open to minors. I don't know Portland as well, but based on what little time I've spent there it seemed like the situation was more similar to what it's like in Milwaukee. I've stumbled across some great old classic machines when I was there. reply MivLives 9 hours agorootparentSeattle is like this too. There seems to be one or two machines in a lot of bars, particularity the sleepy ones. There are a few dedicated pinball bars as well which are always fun to kill an hour or two in. reply feedsmgmt 9 hours agorootparentprevHave you been to Galloping Ghost's pinball arcade? reply mumblemumble 9 hours agorootparentI haven't. Brookfield isn't really accessible if you live in the city and don't have a car. reply feedsmgmt 7 hours agorootparentIt's less than a mile from a train stop. That isn't accessible? reply JeremyHerrman 13 hours agoprevOne of the APIs powering the Pinball Map is the excellent Open Pinball Database (opdb.org). OPDB came about because an older site IPDB doesn’t have an API (and doesn’t want to have an API) in order for various pinball software to communicate with each other. I'm in some pinball leagues with the developer, Andreas Haugstrup, who also makes matchplay.events, pintips.net, and other sites that serve the pinball community. reply pbj1968 10 hours agoparentIPDB is run by an odd dude that refuses to modernize.

They record all your scores and give you little icons for achievements etc. I don't know what other data they store, but it would be pretty rad to do some stats on it and look at the time of day when balls get drained, and multiball run times against a population. So curious to see if any outside factors influence gameplay. Outside of proper leveling, operation etc. reply bdash 13 hours agorootparentThey collect a lot of information, but make very little of it available. What is available isn't exposed in a particularly friendly way. Some of the extra data they gathered makes it into the Year in Review stats they make available at the start of the year. https://social.bdash.net.nz/@mrowe/111779120066480793 shows an example of this. I'd love to be able to see a moving average of my score on a particular game so I can see how I'm improving (or not) over time. Beyond that, I'm not sure what data would be useful other than as a curiosity. reply KingFelix 12 hours agorootparentWould be cool to see some other data like that for sure. I'll drop it in the suggestion box haahha reply KingFelix 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah my local barcade paid for it, just waiting for it to show up! Have you played it yet?

It looks like this machine has either moved on from MuMaLab, or was never listed in the first place. It would be nice to be able to filter machines here by what kind of lights they use.

(Once you've revealed every non-mine space, all the mines get flagged automatically and you win.) Disabling left+right click brings us a lot closer to that mode. Maybe you could formalize it and call it an option? A much bigger problem with right click (and left+right click) is that it's bringing up the browser context menu. That shouldn't happen. If we're trying to be authentic to original Minesweeper, I see that you've implemented the sunglasses face that appears once you've won the game. The original also uses an \":o\" face (circular mouth) when revealing a hidden square. Maybe U+1F62E? reply piranha 12 hours agorootparentprevMiddle click does not work for me on a Mac.

Get bomb squad points every time you get a correct answer, answer so many in a row, get a bomb suit (outlive one bomb). Get more point for the least number of unclicked tiles that expire to the scrolling of the field to the left... if you dont have any un-marked tiles moving through the filed moving click, then you get bomb squad points to next bomb suit. reply frading 8 minutes agorootparentahah, wow.

Been awhile since I played actual minesweeper, but shouldn't revealing a tile with a number on it which otherwise has empty neighbors also uncover those neighbors? I could swear that's how the original works. reply frading 12 hours agoparentah very sorry about the dialog being too large. Which phone have you used it on? I should really fix this. I've tested on an iphone mini, and even though the dialog is quite big on it, so I should indeed try and shrink it, it doesn't prevent completing the tutorial. But it looks like I wrongly assumed this would be the smallest phone I could test it on. And as far as I know, the empty tiles only gets uncovered if you uncover another empty one, so I followed this principle. If that was also the case when you uncover a number, this would reveal too much. reply Riseed 9 hours agorootparentNot the user who made the original report, but I had the same problem. I got stuck on the second mine because the tutorial textbox covered that shape and so I couldn’t flag the mine. iPhone SE, Safari reply frading 9 hours agorootparentVery good to know.

As at the moment, when testing in chrome dev tools, with iphone SE selected, it looks like it doesn't display the right size of the phone (or maybe I've misconfigured the dev tools), as the dialog box doesn't prevent from completing the tutorial. reply polygotdomain 13 hours agoprevI love this, and it brings an interesting twist to an old favorite. What initially tripped me up is the cells at the points are considered a neighbor. Of course as I write that it makes perfect sense, but because of the irregular nature it's a bit harder for me to register them as such. Not a complaint, just an intriguing side effect of the irregular grid. reply frading 12 hours agoparentYes, completely agree. It does take time to get used to it. And even after having playing many games of this one, I can still trip me up at times. reply Springtime 2 hours agoprevSince some have posted favorite twists on the genre, a delightful one I discovered recently, Dungeon Sweeper[1], is themed like an isometric city builder, where the mines are dungeons and the clues are graveyards around them. Uses hexagonal tiles. [1] https://setamopixel.itch.io/dungeon-sweeper reply Procrastic 6 hours agoprevOn the iOS app, when zoomed in, I want to be able to pan across by using one finger on either the outside of the map, or revealed tiles. I also want to be able to double tap a number to reveal all un-flagged tiles adjacent. (For extra safety, this should only work if the number of flags adjacent are equal or greater to the cell’s value) Also, the ‘rate this game’ shortcut doesn’t work. Maybe because I’ve disabled rating pestering. reply CGamesPlay 2 hours agoprevI tried it out and downloaded the iOS version, but unfortunately it doesn’t save between sessions. That sucks, especially for a game in the puzzle genre. Also, the ads offset the display but the taps still go to the original positions. Hope these can be fixed! reply frading 6 minutes agoparentThanks a lot for this feedback. I have indeed not thought about saving between sessions, I'll try and add it, I agree it is important. For the clicks being offset because of the banner, I'm surprised and did not see the issue when developing. I'll double check, so thank you for that. reply pfedak 9 hours agoprevTametsi explores a similar concept, although with mostly-regular non-square grids http://store.steampowered.com/app/709920/Tametsi/ reply mkl 7 hours agoprevNeat! A Voronoi tesselation [1] based on Poisson disc sampling [2] would probably lead to more varied and interesting boards, but would lose the all-quads feature.

For the tile not having bevels when it should, would you be able to take a screenshot? That will help me understand when this happens. I haven't seen this yet, so I'm not entirely sure what could cause this. reply em-bee 10 hours agorootparenthttps://ibb.co/0fCPprF the tiles with missing bevels are marked with bombs reply frading 9 hours agorootparentThanks a lot, I'll have a proper look at how this can happen. reply milicat 13 hours agoprevThis is really cool. Fascinating how the intuition maps neatly onto this grid As a notorious Minesweeper speedrunner I find the animation uncover animation when middle clicking to be a little slow as I find myself waiting it for it to finish for a second or so. reply frading 12 hours agoparentah very interesting! I've done quite a few iterations of the speed at which they get uncovered, and it's definitely tricky to nail down. I've tried to find a middle ground between something that's rewarding/satisfying (so should take 1-2 seconds, long enough to be enjoyed), but also doesn't block you (so should be instant). And that animation would need to very different if it's revealing 10 tiles or less, or 500+. I realize this still isn't quite right. So thank you for saying that, I'll try and improve it. reply viraptor 12 hours agorootparentAn idea (not sure if it will work well) - how about uncovering fields with a \"wave\" rather than one by one? So instead of linear time, make it linear-by-distance time. First reveal the original tile, then its neighbours, then their neighbours, ... It should still feel pretty fluid, but faster. reply frading 11 hours agorootparentIf I understand correctly what you're describing, it's more or less what's happening now. But it may not look like it if you're on the beginner grid, and may only look good/better on the larger grids (either expert size, or custom with very large size). But in short, when you uncover the first tile of this wave, at each frame I uncover only 1/60 of the total. So if you've uncovered 600 tiles, 10 should be uncovered on each frame, and it should be done in 1 second if your display is at 60FPS. But if you uncover 60 tiles only, it will uncover 1 per frame, and that can look pretty bland. Could it be what you see? If that's the case, I believe (with a good 60% certainty!) that I mostly need to revisit the method when it's for a small number of tiles. reply viraptor 11 hours agorootparentYes, I'm on a small grid, so only see a \"chain\" of the boxes being uncovered one by one. It does feel pretty slow, even though I'm nowhere close to speed solving : - ) reply frading 10 hours agorootparentI've thought about what you said a bit more, and I think you meant it should accelerate with time? In any case, I've just done that and deployed it. So if you refresh the page, the animation should - hopefully - be less bland. Feel free to let me know what you think. reply viraptor 8 hours agorootparentI think it's faster now. Thanks! reply air7 3 hours agoprevTried the game on mobile. Skipped the tutorial and instructions and naturally tried quick press to uncover, long press to mark a mine. Good job for coming up with such an intuitive interface! reply Rygian 12 hours agoprevBug report: https://ibb.co/Db44nWp The orange arrows point to a cell that should show \"2\" but shows \"1.\" EDIT: Nevermind :-) reply frading 12 hours agoparentThanks a lot for the feedback. Although I've received several bug reports like this, and unfortunately every time, it was the player who placed a flag incorrectly. So at the moment I'm more leaning to one of those 2 flags being incorrect. I think out of those 4 flags, the second from the top shouldn't have been placed. But my assumption can certainly be wrong! To be sure, could you take a screenshot of a loosing screen? as all the mines will be revealed then, and we can see if the number is indeed correct or not. reply ryannevius 12 hours agoparentprevThere are a lot of bugs in that screenshot reply city41 12 hours agorootparentI think it's ok. One of the mine spots is incorrectly labeled. The spot that the upper orange arrow is touching is not a mine. reply stuart73547373 12 hours agorootparentprevactually none. 2nd flag from the top is wrong reply tasuki 2 hours agoprevI made a version of go without the grid. It is spectacularly unplayable, but I don't want to give up on the idea... reply omoikane 6 hours agoprevThe non-rectangular grid idea was great but didn't feel as fun for me. I wish the grid was non-rectangular but regular, like the alternative grid types available in Loopy: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/loop... reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 11 hours agoprevThis is really cool. I have wasted far too many hours playing minesweeper and this adds a bit of challenge back to a game that's become a bit too mundane for me(I mostly play it to fall asleep now). I will say though that it seems like the map ends up a bit empty, reducing the difficulty. Managed to get through the expert setting without encountering a single 5, for instance. And a question: Does this generate maps where guessing is necessary, like the original? I didn't come across any, and I was curious whether that was by accident or design. I hate those situations in what is supposed to be a logic game. Great work! reply frading 10 hours agoparentThanks a lot! And yes, the ratio of mines vs clear tiles may not be optimal, and is currently completely random, so guessing may be required at times. But there's an undo button so you won't have to restart a new level if you hit a mine. But I'd love to remove guessing ultimately. I just haven't found a reliable way to make it work yet, and would need to dedicate a fair amount of hours to it, which I've preferred allocating to the other games on my roadmap. Nevertheless, it still may happen. Could you maybe try the custom settings? You can change the ratio of mines. I'd be curious to know what quantity of mines you find works best. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 10 hours agorootparentSimon Tatham has a completely guess free minesweeper in his portable puzzle collection: https://git.tartarus.org/?p=simon/puzzles.git;a=blob;f=mines... The basic idea is he generates a grid, runs it through a deductive solver, and if it fails, heuristically changes the grid a little where it failed and tries again. I'll try some different ratios and get back to you! edit: I tried some runs with size 3 and 20% mines, that felt a lot more like expert difficulty Minesweeper too in terms of the sizes of the empty patches you uncover by uncovering a 0. reply frading 10 hours agorootparentThanks a lot for taking the time to check this, that's very useful info. Although the reason I haven't set 20% as the default, is because I'm concerned this may create too many situations where guessing would be required. So I'd need to have the solver in place. So thank you for the link as well. Although now, I'm wondering if the solver can be smart enough to allow situations like this, where finding how to progress isn't quite obvious, like this one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39234686 reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 9 hours agorootparentYeah, I did eventually run into a few guesswork situations. But besides those, it was a lot of fun. On the 20% I really had to stop and think, because all the logic I already knew was there, but subtly different due to the number of neighbours, so new patterns emerged that I had to re-deduce. Still haven't successfully solved one! most of the guesswork I've had to do was around the edges. Maybe going somewhat down from 20% in total and having a smaller percentage around the edges could be a useful temporary heuristic until a potential solver is in place. I also spotted a bug I think, where when you fail and undo, some of the mines are rendered similar to an empty cell, thereby spoiling where they are. This was on Firefox. reply rrr_oh_man 12 hours agoprevExcellent on iPhone 12 mini. Love it. Thank you for sharing!! Q: Would it be possible to make the grids… even more random? What’s your gridding approach? I was almost a bit \"disappointed\" that the grids still looked like, well, grids. reply frading 11 hours agoparentThanks a lot to you for the kind words, that's great to read! And I explain the generation method in another comment, but here it is as well: -------------------- The generation is inspired by what Oskar Stålberg has done for his game Townscaper. It is done with those steps: - start with triangles (ideally in an hexagonal pattern). - merge pairs of triangles into quads, randomly leaving some as triangles. - we subdivide both quads and triangles, and end up with quads only. - smooth the whole to get nicer shapes It can be a bit abstract with just this list, so you can see some videos in my tweet: https://twitter.com/fradingue/status/1712218108826460428 I've also created a webgl engine to solve this type of procedural modeling for the web, and you can see 2 examples scenes where you can play with parameters that affect the shape of the irregular grid: - https://polygonjs.com/gui/irregular_quads/edit - https://polygonjs.com/gui/irregular_quad_relaxation/edit -------------------- So even though you're currently seeing a flat grid, it's all 3D under the hood. So I'm also considering having those grids on a sphere, a torus, or even a custom 3D model. I had done some earlier test: https://polygonjs.com/gui/minesweeper_torus_sphere/edit So it's technically possible, but there's more work to have this easy to navigate around, and to still look visually minimalist while still being pleasant. If the steam version becomes profitable, I'll definitely explore those directions. I agree this can be stretched further. reply rrr_oh_man 2 hours agorootparentThank you, wow! reply mkimball 7 hours agoprev'Delete' is an interesting take on Minesweeper, played on the surface of irregular 3D objects: https://store.steampowered.com/app/773670/Delete/ reply rightbyte 9 hours agoprevNice twist to it!

I've played https://pwmarcz.pl/kaboom/ enough in \"countdown mode\" (i.e. where the numbers are the number of hidden mines) that I can't adjust to this.... reply frading 12 hours agoparentOn the left of the face emoji, in the top bar, you should see the number of remaining mines. It's not exactly like the version you linked, which should \"number found / total\", as what I show is simply \"remaining mines\". Is that what you mean? Although the number I show is actually a bit sneaky, as I subtract the number of flags placed to the total number of mines. So if you were to place more flags than mines, you'd see a negative number. (which I realise as I type that your version is similar, as the number can also go above the total). reply amenghra 10 hours agoprevI think Battleship on a hex or irregular grid could be more interesting than a regular grid. reply bigmattystyles 10 hours agoprevI had totally forgotten how fun and sometimes nerve-wracking even when your reasoning is sound this game is.

Still, you're now ready to move on the intermediate/expert grids :D reply anoncow 4 hours agoprevAll the best scores will be 61 seconds reply quectophoton 12 hours agoprevLooking at the high scores, is that \".\" a decimal separator? Are those scores for the beginner difficulty \"one and a half seconds\"? reply frading 12 hours agoparentYes, you're correct, it's the decimal separator. I remember now that this is not international. I believe the comma is used in the US? Having grown up in France, I'm used to the dot. And that score is indeed suspicious, although there are some protections to prevent cheating. Someone would have to be quite motivated to go around them. But it might be possible, as you don't need to flag all the mines in order to win, you can wind by just uncovering the non-mines. I felt this could be allowed as this is really the same outcome. But I can see that if you're really lucky, the mines are placed in a very convenient way, a quick win could happen. But I assume this can only happen on the beginner grid, not on the larger ones. In any case, I'll reconsider this, and may force all mines to be flagged in order to win, that might be safer. reply dmoy 54 minutes agorootparent> In any case, I'll reconsider this, and may force all mines to be flagged in order to win, that might be safer.

Kudos! reply mminer237 13 hours agoprevNeat. Does this ensure there's no 50/50 guesses needed then? That seems easier when you can split a square in two. reply frading 12 hours agoparentIt doesn't sadly. I had tried to implement that, but couldn't find a provable way to prevent 50/50. It's especially trickier as I can't use an algo with just rows and columns, it has to work on a graph. And it would need to be fast enough as to not slow the grid generation (which already takes a few seconds on the maximum size). So I'd love to add this ultimately, but not entirely sure I'll have the resources. reply vl 8 hours agorootparentBut also it’s not really a requirement, original Windows minesweeper doesn’t have that, so it’s kind expected to have to try your luck sometimes. reply mtlmtlmtlmtl 5 hours agorootparentIt makes the game way better in my experience(not having any probabilistic decisions to make).

I can't see an obvious way to progress without luck either. reply SnooSux 12 hours agorootparentThere are definitely ways to progress from here, but they may be more advanced? The 1 SouthEast of the bottom 2 touches two tiles, and the 1 immediately West touches a superset of those two. The difference between the larger and smaller set must be clear.

Or run go install github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/weed@latest. Run weed server -dir=/some/data/dir -s3 to start one master, one volume server, one filer, and one S3 gateway. Also, to increase capacity, just add more volume servers by running weed volume -dir=\"/some/data/dir2\" -mserver=\":9333\" -port=8081 locally, or on a different machine, or on thousands of machines. That is it! Quick Start SeaweedFS S3 on AWS Setup fast production-ready SeaweedFS S3 on AWS with cloudformation Introduction SeaweedFS is a simple and highly scalable distributed file system. There are two objectives: to store billions of files! to serve the files fast! SeaweedFS started as an Object Store to handle small files efficiently. Instead of managing all file metadata in a central master, the central master only manages volumes on volume servers, and these volume servers manage files and their metadata. This relieves concurrency pressure from the central master and spreads file metadata into volume servers, allowing faster file access (O(1), usually just one disk read operation). There is only 40 bytes of disk storage overhead for each file's metadata. It is so simple with O(1) disk reads that you are welcome to challenge the performance with your actual use cases. SeaweedFS started by implementing Facebook's Haystack design paper. Also, SeaweedFS implements erasure coding with ideas from f4: Facebook’s Warm BLOB Storage System, and has a lot of similarities with Facebook’s Tectonic Filesystem On top of the object store, optional Filer can support directories and POSIX attributes. Filer is a separate linearly-scalable stateless server with customizable metadata stores, e.g., MySql, Postgres, Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, LevelDB, RocksDB, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, Etcd, CockroachDB, YDB, etc. For any distributed key value stores, the large values can be offloaded to SeaweedFS. With the fast access speed and linearly scalable capacity, SeaweedFS can work as a distributed Key-Large-Value store. SeaweedFS can transparently integrate with the cloud. With hot data on local cluster, and warm data on the cloud with O(1) access time, SeaweedFS can achieve both fast local access time and elastic cloud storage capacity. What's more, the cloud storage access API cost is minimized. Faster and cheaper than direct cloud storage! Back to TOC Features Additional Features Can choose no replication or different replication levels, rack and data center aware. Automatic master servers failover - no single point of failure (SPOF). Automatic Gzip compression depending on file MIME type. Automatic compaction to reclaim disk space after deletion or update. Automatic entry TTL expiration. Any server with some disk space can add to the total storage space. Adding/Removing servers does not cause any data re-balancing unless triggered by admin commands. Optional picture resizing. Support ETag, Accept-Range, Last-Modified, etc. Support in-memory/leveldb/readonly mode tuning for memory/performance balance. Support rebalancing the writable and readonly volumes. Customizable Multiple Storage Tiers: Customizable storage disk types to balance performance and cost. Transparent cloud integration: unlimited capacity via tiered cloud storage for warm data. Erasure Coding for warm storage Rack-Aware 10.4 erasure coding reduces storage cost and increases availability. Back to TOC Filer Features Filer server provides \"normal\" directories and files via HTTP. File TTL automatically expires file metadata and actual file data. Mount filer reads and writes files directly as a local directory via FUSE. Filer Store Replication enables HA for filer meta data stores. Active-Active Replication enables asynchronous one-way or two-way cross cluster continuous replication. Amazon S3 compatible API accesses files with S3 tooling. Hadoop Compatible File System accesses files from Hadoop/Spark/Flink/etc or even runs HBase. Async Replication To Cloud has extremely fast local access and backups to Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, BackBlaze. WebDAV accesses as a mapped drive on Mac and Windows, or from mobile devices. AES256-GCM Encrypted Storage safely stores the encrypted data. Super Large Files stores large or super large files in tens of TB. Cloud Drive mounts cloud storage to local cluster, cached for fast read and write with asynchronous write back. Gateway to Remote Object Store mirrors bucket operations to remote object storage, in addition to Cloud Drive Kubernetes Kubernetes CSI Driver A Container Storage Interface (CSI) Driver. SeaweedFS Operator Back to TOC Example: Using Seaweed Object Store By default, the master node runs on port 9333, and the volume nodes run on port 8080. Let's start one master node, and two volume nodes on port 8080 and 8081. Ideally, they should be started from different machines. We'll use localhost as an example. SeaweedFS uses HTTP REST operations to read, write, and delete. The responses are in JSON or JSONP format. Start Master Server > ./weed master Start Volume Servers > weed volume -dir=\"/tmp/data1\" -max=5 -mserver=\"localhost:9333\" -port=8080 & > weed volume -dir=\"/tmp/data2\" -max=10 -mserver=\"localhost:9333\" -port=8081 & Write File To upload a file: first, send a HTTP POST, PUT, or GET request to /dir/assign to get an fid and a volume server URL: > curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign {\"count\":1,\"fid\":\"3,01637037d6\",\"url\":\"127.0.0.1:8080\",\"publicUrl\":\"localhost:8080\"} Second, to store the file content, send a HTTP multi-part POST request to url + '/' + fid from the response: > curl -F file=@/home/chris/myphoto.jpg http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6 {\"name\":\"myphoto.jpg\",\"size\":43234,\"eTag\":\"1cc0118e\"} To update, send another POST request with updated file content. For deletion, send an HTTP DELETE request to the same url + '/' + fid URL: > curl -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:8080/3,01637037d6 Save File Id Now, you can save the fid, 3,01637037d6 in this case, to a database field. The number 3 at the start represents a volume id. After the comma, it's one file key, 01, and a file cookie, 637037d6. The volume id is an unsigned 32-bit integer. The file key is an unsigned 64-bit integer. The file cookie is an unsigned 32-bit integer, used to prevent URL guessing. The file key and file cookie are both coded in hex. You can store thetuple in your own format, or simply store the fid as a string. If stored as a string, in theory, you would need 8+1+16+8=33 bytes. A char(33) would be enough, if not more than enough, since most uses will not need 2^32 volumes. If space is really a concern, you can store the file id in your own format. You would need one 4-byte integer for volume id, 8-byte long number for file key, and a 4-byte integer for the file cookie. So 16 bytes are more than enough. Read File Here is an example of how to render the URL. First look up the volume server's URLs by the file's volumeId: > curl http://localhost:9333/dir/lookup?volumeId=3 {\"volumeId\":\"3\",\"locations\":[{\"publicUrl\":\"localhost:8080\",\"url\":\"localhost:8080\"}]} Since (usually) there are not too many volume servers, and volumes don't move often, you can cache the results most of the time. Depending on the replication type, one volume can have multiple replica locations. Just randomly pick one location to read. Now you can take the public URL, render the URL or directly read from the volume server via URL: http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg Notice we add a file extension \".jpg\" here. It's optional and just one way for the client to specify the file content type. If you want a nicer URL, you can use one of these alternative URL formats: http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6/my_preferred_name.jpg http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6.jpg http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6 http://localhost:8080/3,01637037d6 If you want to get a scaled version of an image, you can add some params: http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&width=200 http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&width=200&mode=fit http://localhost:8080/3/01637037d6.jpg?height=200&width=200&mode=fill Rack-Aware and Data Center-Aware Replication SeaweedFS applies the replication strategy at a volume level. So, when you are getting a file id, you can specify the replication strategy. For example: curl http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?replication=001 The replication parameter options are: 000: no replication 001: replicate once on the same rack 010: replicate once on a different rack, but same data center 100: replicate once on a different data center 200: replicate twice on two different data center 110: replicate once on a different rack, and once on a different data center More details about replication can be found on the wiki. You can also set the default replication strategy when starting the master server. Allocate File Key on Specific Data Center Volume servers can be started with a specific data center name: weed volume -dir=/tmp/1 -port=8080 -dataCenter=dc1 weed volume -dir=/tmp/2 -port=8081 -dataCenter=dc2 When requesting a file key, an optional \"dataCenter\" parameter can limit the assigned volume to the specific data center. For example, this specifies that the assigned volume should be limited to 'dc1': http://localhost:9333/dir/assign?dataCenter=dc1 Other Features No Single Point of Failure Insert with your own keys Chunking large files Collection as a Simple Name Space Back to TOC Object Store Architecture Usually distributed file systems split each file into chunks, a central master keeps a mapping of filenames, chunk indices to chunk handles, and also which chunks each chunk server has. The main drawback is that the central master can't handle many small files efficiently, and since all read requests need to go through the chunk master, so it might not scale well for many concurrent users. Instead of managing chunks, SeaweedFS manages data volumes in the master server. Each data volume is 32GB in size, and can hold a lot of files. And each storage node can have many data volumes. So the master node only needs to store the metadata about the volumes, which is a fairly small amount of data and is generally stable. The actual file metadata is stored in each volume on volume servers. Since each volume server only manages metadata of files on its own disk, with only 16 bytes for each file, all file access can read file metadata just from memory and only needs one disk operation to actually read file data. For comparison, consider that an xfs inode structure in Linux is 536 bytes. Master Server and Volume Server The architecture is fairly simple. The actual data is stored in volumes on storage nodes. One volume server can have multiple volumes, and can both support read and write access with basic authentication. All volumes are managed by a master server. The master server contains the volume id to volume server mapping. This is fairly static information, and can be easily cached. On each write request, the master server also generates a file key, which is a growing 64-bit unsigned integer. Since write requests are not generally as frequent as read requests, one master server should be able to handle the concurrency well. Write and Read files When a client sends a write request, the master server returns (volume id, file key, file cookie, volume node URL) for the file. The client then contacts the volume node and POSTs the file content. When a client needs to read a file based on (volume id, file key, file cookie), it asks the master server by the volume id for the (volume node URL, volume node public URL), or retrieves this from a cache. Then the client can GET the content, or just render the URL on web pages and let browsers fetch the content. Please see the example for details on the write-read process. Storage Size In the current implementation, each volume can hold 32 gibibytes (32GiB or 8x2^32 bytes). This is because we align content to 8 bytes. We can easily increase this to 64GiB, or 128GiB, or more, by changing 2 lines of code, at the cost of some wasted padding space due to alignment. There can be 4 gibibytes (4GiB or 2^32 bytes) of volumes. So the total system size is 8 x 4GiB x 4GiB which is 128 exbibytes (128EiB or 2^67 bytes). Each individual file size is limited to the volume size. Saving memory All file meta information stored on an volume server is readable from memory without disk access. Each file takes just a 16-byte map entry of . Of course, each map entry has its own space cost for the map. But usually the disk space runs out before the memory does. Tiered Storage to the cloud The local volume servers are much faster, while cloud storages have elastic capacity and are actually more cost-efficient if not accessed often (usually free to upload, but relatively costly to access). With the append-only structure and O(1) access time, SeaweedFS can take advantage of both local and cloud storage by offloading the warm data to the cloud. Usually hot data are fresh and warm data are old. SeaweedFS puts the newly created volumes on local servers, and optionally upload the older volumes on the cloud. If the older data are accessed less often, this literally gives you unlimited capacity with limited local servers, and still fast for new data. With the O(1) access time, the network latency cost is kept at minimum. If the hot/warm data is split as 20/80, with 20 servers, you can achieve storage capacity of 100 servers. That's a cost saving of 80%! Or you can repurpose the 80 servers to store new data also, and get 5X storage throughput. Back to TOC Compared to Other File Systems Most other distributed file systems seem more complicated than necessary. SeaweedFS is meant to be fast and simple, in both setup and operation. If you do not understand how it works when you reach here, we've failed! Please raise an issue with any questions or update this file with clarifications. SeaweedFS is constantly moving forward. Same with other systems. These comparisons can be outdated quickly. Please help to keep them updated. Back to TOC Compared to HDFS HDFS uses the chunk approach for each file, and is ideal for storing large files. SeaweedFS is ideal for serving relatively smaller files quickly and concurrently. SeaweedFS can also store extra large files by splitting them into manageable data chunks, and store the file ids of the data chunks into a meta chunk. This is managed by \"weed upload/download\" tool, and the weed master or volume servers are agnostic about it. Back to TOC Compared to GlusterFS, Ceph The architectures are mostly the same. SeaweedFS aims to store and read files fast, with a simple and flat architecture. The main differences are SeaweedFS optimizes for small files, ensuring O(1) disk seek operation, and can also handle large files. SeaweedFS statically assigns a volume id for a file. Locating file content becomes just a lookup of the volume id, which can be easily cached. SeaweedFS Filer metadata store can be any well-known and proven data store, e.g., Redis, Cassandra, HBase, Mongodb, Elastic Search, MySql, Postgres, Sqlite, MemSql, TiDB, CockroachDB, Etcd, YDB etc, and is easy to customize. SeaweedFS Volume server also communicates directly with clients via HTTP, supporting range queries, direct uploads, etc. System File Metadata File Content Read POSIX REST API Optimized for large number of small files SeaweedFS lookup volume id, cacheable O(1) disk seekYes Yes SeaweedFS Filer Linearly Scalable, Customizable O(1) disk seek FUSE Yes Yes GlusterFS hashingFUSE, NFS Ceph hashing + rulesFUSE YesMooseFS in memoryFUSENo MinIO separate meta file for each file Yes No Back to TOC Compared to GlusterFS GlusterFS stores files, both directories and content, in configurable volumes called \"bricks\". GlusterFS hashes the path and filename into ids, and assigned to virtual volumes, and then mapped to \"bricks\". Back to TOC Compared to MooseFS MooseFS chooses to neglect small file issue. From moosefs 3.0 manual, \"even a small file will occupy 64KiB plus additionally 4KiB of checksums and 1KiB for the header\", because it \"was initially designed for keeping large amounts (like several thousands) of very big files\" MooseFS Master Server keeps all meta data in memory. Same issue as HDFS namenode. Back to TOC Compared to Ceph Ceph can be setup similar to SeaweedFS as a key->blob store. It is much more complicated, with the need to support layers on top of it. Here is a more detailed comparison SeaweedFS has a centralized master group to look up free volumes, while Ceph uses hashing and metadata servers to locate its objects. Having a centralized master makes it easy to code and manage. Ceph, like SeaweedFS, is based on the object store RADOS. Ceph is rather complicated with mixed reviews. Ceph uses CRUSH hashing to automatically manage data placement, which is efficient to locate the data. But the data has to be placed according to the CRUSH algorithm. Any wrong configuration would cause data loss. Topology changes, such as adding new servers to increase capacity, will cause data migration with high IO cost to fit the CRUSH algorithm. SeaweedFS places data by assigning them to any writable volumes. If writes to one volume failed, just pick another volume to write. Adding more volumes is also as simple as it can be. SeaweedFS is optimized for small files. Small files are stored as one continuous block of content, with at most 8 unused bytes between files. Small file access is O(1) disk read. SeaweedFS Filer uses off-the-shelf stores, such as MySql, Postgres, Sqlite, Mongodb, Redis, Elastic Search, Cassandra, HBase, MemSql, TiDB, CockroachCB, Etcd, YDB, to manage file directories. These stores are proven, scalable, and easier to manage. SeaweedFS comparable to Ceph advantage Master MDS simpler Volume OSD optimized for small files Filer Ceph FS linearly scalable, Customizable, O(1) or O(logN) Back to TOC Compared to MinIO MinIO follows AWS S3 closely and is ideal for testing for S3 API. It has good UI, policies, versionings, etc. SeaweedFS is trying to catch up here. It is also possible to put MinIO as a gateway in front of SeaweedFS later. MinIO metadata are in simple files. Each file write will incur extra writes to corresponding meta file. MinIO does not have optimization for lots of small files. The files are simply stored as is to local disks. Plus the extra meta file and shards for erasure coding, it only amplifies the LOSF problem. MinIO has multiple disk IO to read one file. SeaweedFS has O(1) disk reads, even for erasure coded files. MinIO has full-time erasure coding. SeaweedFS uses replication on hot data for faster speed and optionally applies erasure coding on warm data. MinIO does not have POSIX-like API support. MinIO has specific requirements on storage layout. It is not flexible to adjust capacity. In SeaweedFS, just start one volume server pointing to the master. That's all. Dev Plan More tools and documentation, on how to manage and scale the system. Read and write stream data. Support structured data. This is a super exciting project! And we need helpers and support!

Hard drives usually get 100MB/s~200MB/s. Solid State Disk To modify or delete small files, SSD must delete a whole block at a time, and move content in existing blocks to a new block. SSD is fast when brand new, but will get fragmented over time and you have to garbage collect, compacting blocks. SeaweedFS is friendly to SSD since it is append-only. Deletion and compaction are done on volume level in the background, not slowing reading and not causing fragmentation.

    "commentBody": "SeaweedFS fast distributed storage system for blobs, objects, files and datalake (github.com/seaweedfs)225 points by thushanfernando 11 hours agohidepastfavorite68 comments bnewbold 10 hours agoSeaweedFS does the thing: I've used it to store billions of medium-sized XML documents, image thumbnails, PDF files, etc. It fills the gap between \"databases\" (broadly defined; maybe you can do few-tens-KByte docs but stretching things) and \"filesystems\" (hard/inefficient in reality to push beyond tens/hundreds of millions of objects; yes I know it is possible with tuning, etc, but SeaweedFS is better-suited). The docs and operational tooling feel a bit janky at first, but they get the job done, and the whole project is surprisingly feature-rich. I've dealt with basic power-outages, hardware-caused data corruption (cheap old SSDs), etc, and it was possible to recover. In some ways I feel like the surprising thing is that there is such a gap in open source S3 API blob stores. Minio is very simple and great, but is one-file-per-object on disk (great for maybe 90% of use-cases, but not billions of thumbnails). Ceph et al are quite complex. There are a bunch of almost-sort-kinda solutions like base64-encoded bytes in HBase/postgresql/etc, or chunking (like MongoDB), but really you just want to concatenate the bytes like a .tar file, and index in with range requests. The Wayback Machine's WARC files plus CDX (index files with offset/range) is pretty close. reply seized 9 hours agoparentGarageS3 is a nice middle ground, it is not file on disk per object but it's simpler than SeaweedFS as well. https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/ reply anonzzzies 1 hour agorootparentYes, garage sourcecode is very easy to read and understand.

As a noob in this domain, this made sense to me. It will be great if you can share name or reference of some papers around this. Thank you in advance. reply dspillett 35 minutes agorootparentFor many small objects a generic filesystem can be less efficient than a more specialised store. Things are being managed that aren't needed for your blob store, block alignment can waste a lot of space, there are often inefficiencies in directories with many files leading to a hierarchical splitting that adds more inefficiency through indirection, etc. The space waste is mitigated somewhat by some filesystems by supporting partial blocks, or including small files directly in the directory entry or other structure (the MFT in NTFS) but this adds an extra complexity. The significance of these inefficiencies will vary depending on your base filesystem. The advantage of using your own storage format rather than naively using a filesystem is you can design around these issues taking different choices around the trade-offs than a general filesystem might, to produce something that is both more space efficient and more efficient to query and update for typical blob access patterns. The middle ground is using a database rather than a filesystem is usually a compromise: still less efficient than a specially designed storage structure, but perhaps more so than a filesystem. They tend to have issues (it just inefficiencies) with large objects though, so your blob storage mechanism needs to work around those or just put up with them. A file-per-object store may have a database also anyway, for indexing purposes. A huge advantage of one file per object is simplicity of implementation. Also for some end users the result (a bunch of files rather than one large object) might better fit into their existing backup strategies¹. For many data and load patterns, the disadvantages listed above may hardly matter so the file-per-object approach can be an appropriate choice. -- [1] Assuming they are not relying on the distributed nature of the blob store² which is naive³ age doesn't protect you against some thinks a backup does unless the blob store implements features to help out there (minimum distributed duplication guarantee any given peice of data, keeping past versions etc). [2] Also note that not all blob stores are distributed, and many are but support single node operation.

And that's too bad, because SeaweedFS was otherwise working well! What we need and haven't identified yet is an SDS system that provides both fully-compliant POSIX FS and S3 volumes, is FOSS, a production story where individuals can do all tasks competently/quickly/effectively (management, monitoring, disaster recovery incl. erasure coding and tooling), and CSI drivers that work with Nomad. This rules out Ceph and friends. GarageFS, also mentioned in this thread, is S3 only. We went through everything applicable on the K8S drivers list https://kubernetes-csi.github.io/docs/drivers.html except for Minio, because it claimed it needed a backing store anyways (like Ceph) although just a few days ago I encountered Minio being used standalone. While I'm on this topic, I noticed that the CSI drivers (SeaweedFS and SDS's in general) use tremendous resources when effecting mounts, instantiating nearly a whole OS (OCI image w/ functional userland) just to mount over what appears to be NFS or something. reply chrislusf 7 hours agoprevThanks for sharing! I work on SeaweedFS. SeaweedFS is built on top of a blob storage based on Facebook's Haystack paper.

All projects were either cancelled, features cut, or officially left in limbo. It's a pretty remarkable piece of Microsoft history as it has been there on the sidelines since roughly post-Windows 3.11. The reason they returned to it so often was in part because Bill Gates loved the idea of a more high level object storage that, like this, bridges the gap between files and databases. He would probably have loved this kind of technology part of Windows -- and indeed in 2013, he cited the failure of WinFS as his greatest disappointment at Microsoft, that it was ahead its time and that it would re-emerge. reply osigurdson 8 hours agoparent>> and indeed in 2013, he cited the failure of WinFS as his greatest disappointment at Microsoft, Failing to capture any of the mobile handset market while missing out almost entirely on search and social media businesses would be higher on my list if I were in BG's shoes. reply EVa5I7bHFq9mnYK 1 minute agorootparentSpeaking of mobile handset markets, does SeaweedFS support Android? reply mbreese 6 hours agorootparentprevIntellectually though, I could see the WinFS failure as being more disappointing. If it had worked, local computing would have been completely different. Much like BeFS, WinFS (as marketed) would have introduced many new ways to interact with your computer and data. Having a bigger presence in mobile and social would have been more lucrative, but from a CS geek point of view, the failure of WinFS might have been more stinging. reply Guthur 5 hours agorootparentprevMicrosoft has never been good in either consumer electronics or advertising (social media).

My use case’s involves writing a lot of data to temporary files that are then renamed to their final name. This is always the Achilles heel for distributed file storage, where files are put into buckets based on the file path… when you rename the path, but keep the data, lookups become more complicated. (This is HPC work with large processing pipelines. I keep track of if the job was successful based upon if the final file exists. The rename only happens if the job was successful. It’s a great way to track pipeline status, but metadata lookups can be a pain — particularly for missing files. ) reply chrislusf 7 hours agoparentShould not be a problem. One similar use case used Cassandra as SeaweedFS filer store, and created thousands of files per second in a temp folder, and moved the files to a final folder. It caused a lot of tombstones for the updates in Cassandra. Later, they changed to use Redis for the temp folder, and keep Cassandra for other folders.

But with MinIO and erasure coding a single PUT results in more IOPS and we saw lower performance. Also, expanding MinIO must be done in increments of your original buildout which is annoying.

    "commentBody": "Japan to introduce six-month residency visa for 'digital nomads' (nikkei.com)224 points by mikhael 19 hours agohidepastfavorite281 comments Shank 18 hours agoIt's exciting to see progress, but I think 180 days is too short for this to be worthwhile for people who really wanted this. They've leaned heavily into the \"nomad\" part, but the issue is more of practicality. This visa doesn't come with a Residency Card, which means that getting a traditional lease in Japan is going to be difficult. For 6 months, you'll be on an uphill battle with some services like housing, which can be important. It's just long enough that you won't want to maintain a home in your home country unless it's paid for, and short enough that it makes moving your possessions impractical. You also can't renew it, and you have to be out of the country for 6 months before you can get it again. I think this would be very appealing if it was a 1 year visa at minimum, but comparable visas (e.g., the Taiwan Gold Card) are up to 3 years. I'm not terribly upset at the lack of Individual Number or Residence Card, but the length is definitely something that makes it unappealing except in the most nomad-of-nomad situations. Apparently they'll be opening it for public comments in the second half of February. They said that they based the 6 month time period on questions they asked foreigners about how long they would want to stay -- so maybe this is the time to push for a longer period of time. reply plz-remove-card 16 hours agoparentLength is far too short, I can stay for 3 months without filling out anything, an additional 3 for the effort of applying kinda sucks (having applied for a Japan tourist visa for my wife, expect this visa to be just as onerous) If they allow dependents (like the Korean one does) and allowed for 1 year with the option of extending up to 2, we'd be packing right now. reply timr 16 hours agorootparentYou can also get another 3 months on a tourist visa by leaving and coming back (at least, most visa-free tourists can; I've had many friends do this). I suppose it's less cost to do it this way, but it sure seems like a \"digital nomad\" would have no problem going somewhere else for a week (Korea, Taiwan), and coming back. reply plz-remove-card 16 hours agorootparentI know that's fine for some countries such as the Philippines (though their tourist visa can be extended so long, it's rarely necessary) but IIRC this doesn't fly in Japan, it's 90 days per year, total, and they're very strict about it. reply timr 16 hours agorootparentI don't know if it differs by country, but that's incorrect for residents of the US, and various countries in western Europe. You get 90 days per stay, with 2 stays a year. (edit: I could be wrong about the 2 stay max. It might be higher. I'm pretty sure I entered Japan more than 2 times in a single year on a visa-free waver, but I don't know if there's some window that applies.) reply presentation 11 hours agorootparent2 stays max is not officially written anywhere but about 180 days is the rule of thumb people usually go by. reply gwill 16 hours agorootparentprevit is not 90 days total per year, but the officials are strict on it. if they see you were recently in japan they may suspect you of working illegally. they also can say you’ve returned too soon and reject you. not worth the risk imo, even though a i know a few people that have done it successfully so they could study in japan without a year long visa. reply plz-remove-card 15 hours agorootparent> it is not 90 days total per year, but the officials are strict on it. That may have been what I was thinking, I recall on my first trip there, they were pretty strict and wanted to know exactly where I was staying I even had to show them on the map. For my wife's tourist visa we had to apply to a travel agency that was a liaison with the Japan embassy (The Japan embassy required it, you couldn't apply directly in her country) and the process was very tedious, we had to include a day-by-day itinerary, and all kinds of documentation. All that to say I guess when I hear that Japan is strict about something, I just take that as it's not worthwhile to try and get around it. reply timr 12 hours agorootparentYeah, there's likely a citizenship thing at play. I imagine the treatment for a \"digital nomad\" from the US is going to be pretty different than someone from the Philippines or Vietnam [1], for example. Japan (like most countries) probably doesn't care so much about re-entry of rich tourists, so long as they're not working or doing anything illegal. [1] Both are countries with lots of unskilled folks who desperately want to work in Japan. reply huimang 18 hours agoparentprevAgreed, 180 days and no residency card makes this way too much hassle for the meager benefits. It's similar with the recent 1-year South Korean F-1-D Nomad/Workation visa for Canadians, who get 6 months as tourists anyways. I'm going through the application process since U.S. citizens only get 3 months as tourists, but the hassle is only really worth it for the residency card. reply thehappypm 18 hours agoparentprevDon’t you think that the housing market will create a niche for these people? Foreigners with deep pockets coming in for six months sounds like a great thing for landlords. Plus, you know they won’t squat because they’re gone after 6 months or they get deported reply Shank 18 hours agorootparentIt's not out of the question, but foreigners already have a tough time getting housing in Japan with a Residency Card. There are very real concerns people have about not getting paid for rent, or people not being able to support themselves. This is why normally, residents will have a guarantor sign documents with them to ensure that the landlord is made whole if something goes awry. I would also expect, pessimistically, that the housing for foreigners on this visa will, if offered, be significantly more expensive than normal housing on the expectation that foreigners can afford it. Maybe this won't be the case, but I think it will definitely make an already-annoying problem harder. reply thehappypm 15 hours agorootparentIt would almost certainly be more expensive. It would probably require payment upfront, or a substantial payment upfront as well. reply herbst 18 hours agoparentprev> Taiwan Gold Card From the first looks of it, it seems it expects me to work there for a company and not 'nomad'? reply jwells89 17 hours agoparentprevAssuming it’s legal to do so I imagine that some will use this visa as a springboard to access other visas. 180 days is long enough to hunt for a work-visa-furnishing job or a school to attend for an education visa for example. That may have been possible under the 90 day tourist visa (though I think that one may explicitly bar job hunting), but 90 days disappears surprisingly quickly and the flight out and back in to get the second 90 day period is a nuisance. reply thridnri 17 hours agoparentprevLength is fine. I am seriously considering it. Properties in rural Japan are VERY cheap (like 20k USD). It makes sense to just buy summer house there. It is pretty good life to spend summers in Japan, and winters somewhere at south. reply timr 16 hours agorootparentPlease note: these houses you see online for 20k have problems. You aren't going to just be able to move in. Most of them need to be emptied of junk and repaired, if not completely renovated. If you're lucky, the only problem will be that the house is very remote, and you need a car to get there. That alone is a substantial problem on a 6-month basis if you don't have residency. But realistically, houses that are in move-in state in an area where you'd actually want to live cost far more than $20k. reply thridnri 16 hours agorootparentI am familiar with situation in Japan. The house is not an investment, it is simply better, than paying rent for 7 or so years I plan to visit. I like hiking, remote location is the feature for me. Not everyone has to live in Tokyo. I will buy a bike and rent van when needed. Japan is a cheap developed country, with low crime. Not many places like that. reply timr 16 hours agorootparentOK, I'm just saying that you should understand what you're getting into. These online memes are not reality. > Not everyone has to live in Tokyo. LOL, I'm not even remotely talking about Tokyo. I'm talking about 2nd- and 3rd-tier cities. If you find a $20k house in Tokyo, it's going to be unlivable, and so far outside the city that you won't believe you're in Tokyo. Honestly, $20k is low even for a well-maintained place in a small town. Most likely, any house at this price point, anywhere, is in a flood zone or at serious risk of mudslide, filled with junk, and/or requiring seismic/electrical/plumbing improvements before you can move in. reply thridnri 16 hours agorootparentIt is still better than RV, and you avoid most problems in summer. Mudslides are great point, thanks. reply btbuildem 16 hours agoparentprevMany countries have requirements to maintain residency status -- for example Canada requires 183 days (half a year) residency in the country to maintain access to all the benefits and privileges. reply somenameforme 18 hours agoprevMost aren't aware of the situation Japan is in today because of the world we all grew up in, where Japan was at one point nearly the largest economy in the world. Japan has been in between a recession and stagnation for 30 years. Their GDP was higher 31 years ago than it is today. [1] Their GDP/capita is $33,950 with most wages well below that. They hit a record high for average wages in 2022 of ¥311,800 - about $2,100. [2] Next - they're dying off. They hit their inflection point in 2009 and they've been shrinking since [3]. They've lost more than 5million people since 2009. And the \"fun\" thing about fertility collapse is that the decline will never stop. Their population will keep shrinking down at the 'equilibrium rate' (decided by fertility rate) until they start having babies, or go extinct. The exact same will happen to every other country with sub-replacement fertility rates. This, IMO, is an effort to try to attract a certain type of immigrant largely for the purposes of revenue generation. --- [1] - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?location...

But it's interesting to think about it from the point of view that Japan disproves the idea that a growth economy is the only way. Here is a country that increases worker efficiency and has a really high standard of living, but doesn't do it in a hyper growth kind of way. 2) Yes, Japan is super, super xenophobic compared to other countries. This is contrasted with it being one of the top tourist destinations on earth. I think things like digital nomad visa could be a small step on the way to closing this dichotomy. It's clear that one of the easy levers Japan could pull to alleviate their economic issues would be to allow more immigration, and I think the world's facination with Japan and Japanese culture is such that they could pull it off. reply remarkEon 17 hours agorootparentBut not ever place needs to turn into cosmopolitan London. In the same way that Japan showed it’s possible to have a high standard of living without obsessing over growth, I trust that the Japanese can find a path forward that doesn’t default to “just bring in millions of immigrants”. reply niam 16 hours agorootparentWhy are we treating a known working and humanitarian strategy as some evil \"growth\" thing? I feel like we're dragging that term out of the hyper-capitalistic sense it's meant to evoke. People ought to be able to move where they're most happy / productive. One consequence of that may be that a place turns \"into cosmopolitan London\". But that's hardly a horror. reply noptd 13 hours agorootparentI think the argument against can be boiled down to this hypothetical analogy: A few friends and I like your home better than ours. It's much nicer and safer than where we currently live, so we move into a few open bedrooms. Now that we outnumber you and your family, we vote to change things in the common areas more to our liking. Some changes are small and happen over time, others more jarring and immediate. You like some of these changes in some cases, but sometimes quite the opposite. Is it a foregone conclusion that this situation is for the greater good? If so, should your family be pressured or forced to accept? Who has the power to make that determination? After all, you were only there first so what gives you the right to prevent others from moving in? --- Personally, I can see the argument for both sides. reply somenameforme 5 hours agorootparentI'd also add here that it's really not even just about the greater good. There's something obviously unique and valuable about different places remaining different, rather than creating some sort of global homogeneity. Austin coined 'Keep Austin Weird' which Portland, and a handful of other such cities, then mimicked. Of course it failed - the attractiveness of Austin, in part because of its distinct character, left it facing widespread 'migration' of a sort that the city was unaccustomed to dealing with, and it increasingly just looks like any other city. Identical to how if Japan starts opening the flood gates there will be all these people moving there because 'wow, Japan's so weird and unique' and soon enough e.g. Tokyo will look like any other city. It could well be \"better\", by some metric or another, for Austin, Tokyo, and everywhere else to be basically the same, excepting some window dressing.

Edit: formatting reply carlosjobim 15 hours agorootparentI assure you that there is nothing disingenuous in my comment, and not everything is a \"dog whistle\". A dog whistle for what, if you mind? No people has ever willed to be colonised (and that was the proposal in the comment I replied to). Immigration is a different matter. The people in history who welcomed being colonised were very sorry for it afterwards.

And I don't disagree with you. What I'm objecting to is your hyperbole; on further thought I don't care much for your throwing around of this \"genetic extermination\" term either. \"Extermination\" implies a third party is involved and has a hand on the gas valve. A more appropriate euphemism would be \"genetic extinction.\" Genocide is explicitly defined as \"the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group.\" The immigrants are not arriving onshore and butchering the natives. Words have meaning and this one does not invite ambiguity. A genetic clique disappearing because of cross-breeding is not goddamn Genocide. It's just Nature. And again, I'd argue they're doing it to themselves. They just handed the title of Miss Japan to a Ukie. Now this. Nobody's making them sell out to foreigners.

No, but when immigrant/coloniser diaspora becomes large enough in numbers they rise up against the natives and start displacing them, most often violently. As seen almost always throughout history, or in the news tonight. > It's just Nature. Nature is nature, and human policy is separate from that. Displacing enormous amounts of people to \"fix\" some imaginary GDP number is as far from nature as can be, unless we argue that war and genocide is a natural behaviour among human beings. Which unfortunately I think we can. Then again if it's \"just nature\", then why do people here argue for organising mass migration to Japan. Let nature have it's course then? As for the rest of your comment, you are arguing automatically based on what you have imagined that I wrote, even though I tried to clarify to you. I don't know how I can get my point through, so you can understand that I connected organised foreign colonisation / mass migration to Japan with genocide. Because one usually follows the other. Even an outright military invasion can be less of a threat to a nation, since some conquerors only want to extract resources and tributes without taking over the land by putting their own population there. reply awongh 17 hours agorootparentprevThere's a discussion around the english words for people who come to a country. Some people are \"expats\" and some people are \"immigrants\". I was talking about \"immigrants\" rather than \"expats\". Of course this dynamic has many facets to it. I've met some people in Thailand who couldn't give a shit about Thai people and just wanted to save 50% on their latte. This is a common \"expat\" sterotype. There has been, and still is a lot of \"orientalization\" of Japan, but almost every immigrant you meet in Japan today has a deep love for Japan in some way. (Also because only the truly dedicated would go to the trouble to be able to stay). So if Japan decided to start allowing more people in I feel like they would all fall more on the immigrant side than the expat side. reply eska 16 hours agorootparentThere isn’t really any ambiguity about the two terms. That’s a dog whistle by people who want to see racism where there is none. They usually say something along the lines of “so when black and brown skinned people go to Europe they’re immigrants.

I see that's in conflict with the idea that people should be/do whatever they want. I don't see how to reconcile the two sides. Radiolab had an episode on this issue WRT to Samoa (https://radiolab.org/podcast/americanish-2306) My memory of the episode is the first half they paint the picture of a particular seemingly \"racist\" local trying to keep non-Samoans from owning any land. Most people are okay with it, then this person whispers in their ear and suddenly they're against it. In the second half they go over why. The reason being rich non-Samoans would quickly buy up the entire island and there would be no Samoa / Samoan culture anymore. I don't know how to resolve that. Part of me thinks they Samoans, Jews, Japan, British, Native Americans, etc... should not disallow immigration. It seems anti-democratic, anti-liberal values.

All the above countries have their own demographic collapse as well BTW. reply somenameforme 14 hours agorootparentThe typical explanation given is poor economic policy - good times led banks to start lending excessively, excessive lending drove speculation, speculation drove bubbles, those bubbles burst, everything collapsed, and they just never managed to get back up again. But that last part is what most interests me. Most of the Soviet Bloc type nations you named had reasonable fertility rates under the USSR, only collapsed once the USSR collapsed in 1991, and are inching back up again. Japan, by contrast, never had a particularly great fertility rate post-war. Then it just collapsed in the 1970s and simply kept going down. [1] Fertility rates just determine so much. With a good fertility rate companies grow naturally because their market size is constantly naturally increasing. And vice versa for poor fertility rates. It also determines the overall age distribution of a population, such as how in Japan now 10% of the population is over 80. When an ever larger chunk of your population is leaving the labor force with not enough people to replace them, and then an even smaller taxpayer base to provide the social benefits necessary to sustain these people in their elder years - everything just becomes completely unsustainable. And, again, none of this will ever get better such as, for instance, when the older people start passing en masse. This is because fertility rate determines the ratio of distributions within a population. You can see this quite clearly in this [2] population pyramid. The only solution is for them to suddenly start dramatically increasing their fertility rate. [1] - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?location...

(edited) reply akaij 11 hours agorootparentI'm not trying to discredit GDP; I don't think it is a useless metric. Lawmakers around the world—some that are paid handsomely—care about it and obviously quite a bit can be inferred from it, but in this case we would be better served utilising a multi-dimensional lens, so to say, in these tangential topics. I'm just against hearing about it as the most important economic metric of a country. It's very often used as a single data point to come to all kinds of conclusions. There are some top-comments in this thread where people are almost forecasting Japan's doom, which is of course a ridiculous view. That's the general direction my comment was aimed at. At the risk of being out of my depth: You only need a few seconds to look at the per-capita list before finding yourself asking \"wait, why is THAT country so high up?\". Again, useful info can be inferred, but it doesn't put the country above others in other important lists, which is what people usually imply and use it for, on topics not strictly related to economy statistics. reply extasia 9 hours agorootparentThanks for clarifying, that's definitely a more well thought through perspective than I gave you credit for before.

They already have good standards of living, great infrastructure, high societal trust, low crime, a competent government, etc. Europe's strategy of importing millions of low skill foreigners who are mostly dependent on welfare and have destabilized their societies is also probably not a great idea either. These population projections also ignore the many factors that may change. As the population declines, more opportunities may open for young people, leading to increased family formation.

But once it became more prevalent, it creates the problem (on governments view, especially post 9/11) of having a bunch of foreign folks living for months and receiving money from abroad for god knows which reason. This creates the problem for law enforcement of having to separate nomad workers from more shady characters that have exactly the same \"signature\": long term stays, getting regular money from above, not doing the usual tourist stuff that people that have money and free time enough to stay in a foreign country for months usually do. So, for law enforcement purposes, it makes sense to have an specific kind of Visa for those \"working tourists\", so they can pre-filter this population and get back to a smaller working set of persons of interest without the added noise of \"working tourists\" (digital nomad as a term is incorrect, after all, true nomads would be working locally) reply herbst 18 hours agoparentWhen I was in Thailand about 7 or 8 years ago they just recently raided a co-working coffee and jailed the 'nomads' over night (as far as I remember) there was also regular talks about what to tell and not tell border patrol and official visa places.

It is, as long as you don’t go out of your way to spend extra. reply herbst 9 minutes agorootparentMy daily spending was about like this: - Cheap first meal: $2-$3 - 2-3 Espresso from Supermarkets: $4 - Coffee or tea to go: $3 - Water: $1 - Eating out: $6-$30 So my average day in Food was about $16 - $41 per day. I rarely spend this much in Switzerland when buying only organic food and mostly from farmers. I save a lot on coffee by having a proper coffee machine. gettodachoppa 16 hours agorootparentprev>“Normal” meals in Thailand are food stalls, $2 per meal if not less. I gotta disagree here, that's what low-skilled staff eat on their lunch break. It's usually not very tasty or hygienic (depending on what you order), so westerners only eat this once or twice to try it out before learning their lesson. Then they stick to restaurants which cost $5-12 per meal. Your average western expat spends 30 euros per day on food in Thailand, if they eat out.

If you apply for a working visa you can be flagged as having revenue generated while in the country, so you'll pay an income tax on it. The other side of it is visa overstay: it's more financially viable for working people to overstay their visa, where pure tourist have to go back at some point. Terrorists will be flagged whatever they do, as international money transfers are already heavily scrutinized and under a working visa you still have to declare your work. reply dageshi 18 hours agorootparentI doubt it's got much to do with either. Overstaying a visa is likely a criminal offense depending on the length of the overstay, these people still have to leave the country, they're going to get caught and flagged. At a minimum they'll be prevented from re-entry but chances are there could be real punishment. In terms of taxes, I really really doubt it, a DN is not taking a locals job, their clients & business are all out of country, their accounts and transactions are all overseas.

That's also the whole reason for potentially introducing this new type of visa; if you were allowed to do remote work on a tourist visa, they wouldn't need to do this. reply oldtownroad 18 hours agorootparentI’m asking because I visit Japan on a tourist visa and I have never encountered this rule.

Unfortunately, I don't think this a specific rule which makes it hard to point to a source, but you simply aren't allowed to work in any form if you are in Japan on a tourist visa, and from the government's perspective, this obviously includes remote work. If you want some specific government opinion in writing saying that remote work is illegal under tourist visas under current law, after the government holds public comment, it usually publishes an interim report compiling the comments it has received along with analysis, and I imagine that in this case the report will note this, but right now I can't find an official document stating this. However, googling it, there are various opinions from law firms agreeing that it is illegal. There is also no reason you would have \"encountered\" this because the only way you would be able to encounter it is if you somehow made the government aware that you were illegally working remotely and they deported you. It's basically impossible for them to tell if you are working remotely though, so it's almost a moot point in most cases unless you specifically go out of your way to make the government aware. reply sirn 18 hours agorootparentprevIANAL, but it's written in Immigration Act Article 19, Paragraph 1, No 2 (入管法19条１項２号)[1].

The quoted \"Appended Table I (3)\" (別表第一の三) says: > Temporary Visitor > Sightseeing, recreation, sports, visiting relatives, inspection tours, participating in lectures or meetings, business contact or other similar activities during a short stay in Japan. None of this says \"within Japan\", which from my understanding is that it allows for the maximum interpretation of the law, i.e. \"involving income or activities for which he/she receives remuneration [from anywhere]\" with the noted activities in Appendix Table being the exception. Either way, it depends on how immigration interpret the law.

The existence of a digital nomad visa bolsters the understanding that digital nomads are allowed to use a tourist visa. A working visa is very difficult to get in most countries and requires local sponsorship because of the risk to the local economy — you’re potentially taking a local job from local people. Tourist visas are easy to get because there’s no risk: a tourist arrives, spends money, leaves. A digital nomad is a tourist by every measure. The reason tourist visas are short is to ensure people don’t move to the country without permission. A digital nomad doesn’t present a risk to the local economy so bumping their length of stay is safe for the local economy, hence, digital nomad visas. reply nicbou 18 hours agoparentprevThis is what happens in practice, but in theory you're not supposed to live and work from somewhere without the appropriate visa.

If you are a tourist who works for a foreign company while visiting a country, well I don't know a single person who has been actually deported for this. I know it can happen, but most places seem to not care much, and mostly care you're spending your money in their country. I am a digital nomad myself for about 1/2 every year so I do have my biases though. reply mdasen 17 hours agorootparentI agree that people are really unlikely to be deported for this, but I'm not sure that countries would treat you favorably if you walked up to immigration and said \"I'm here to work in your country on a tourist visa, but don't worry because I'm just working remotely for a foreign company.\" I think a big part of this is that it's basically impossible to find digital nomads. How would a country know if you're in a hotel room or coffee shop working on your laptop? If you don't tell anyone what you're doing, they aren't going to know. Digital nomads also don't trigger the same \"taking a job that a local could have\" fear that drives a lot of immigration policies. As you note, you're just a person in that country spending money. However, you're also probably not paying taxes. I think there's a bit of a tension there. On the one hand, you're bringing in foreign money. On the other hand, you're using services just as a resident would and not paying all the taxes (you are likely paying some taxes like sales/VAT). Ultimately, I think a big part is that countries haven't figured out what to think of digital nomads. Heck, companies haven't figured out how to feel about them. Companies still haven't settled on whether remote workers should be paid less if they move to a cheaper location. reply someguydave 18 hours agorootparentprevThat the law is rarely enforced does not make the law invalid or unenforceable. reply alibarber 18 hours agorootparentprevMy definition of tourist is unimportant.

The fact that these visas are becoming available means that governments are wising up to the fact that people have been working remotely on tourist visas and want in on it. They want to be able to charge for it, or set a limit on who can do it, or tax it. Now that these visas exist, and immigration officers know that, it’s only obvious that they’ll start to ask ‘tourists’ if they plan on working remotely or not. You can lie all you want, but if they find evidence (two laptops, notebooks, equipment) then good luck.

I ask given my experience with German’s cultural predilection for following rules to the letter. reply Jcampuzano2 18 hours agoparentprevHonestly I just think you and some others get too stuck on specific rules. There are thousands of people who run digital companies and travel all the time, including people who literally travel full-time as digital nomads with zero issues whatsoever. I can almost guarantee you that if you left the EU and \"accidentally\" made money via your website you would have no trouble coming and going given that I literally know and have met people all over outside of the EU, who are from the EU and do exactly this. Even in just this past week I've met like 3 people from the EU travelling full-time who run their own bussiness online while I'm located here in South America. reply herbst 17 hours agorootparentI know I can, I know nobody will ever notice. It's just weird that it's illegal. reply ghaff 17 hours agoparentprevI wouldn't even get hung up on the website part. Pretty much any business traveler is making money when they're traveling and may even be doing business-y things like going to a conference or meeting with customers. Some countries require a special business visa for that but many/most don't and mostly don't give you a long precise list of what you can and can't do. reply herbst 17 hours agorootparentIn fact for any visa outside of Europe I had so far I signed a long precise list of things I can and can't do. That's what all the small text is about. reply ghaff 17 hours agorootparentChina I definitely needed a business visa to go to a conference. Malaysia was some sort of visa on arrival thing. Indonesia I don't remember but it wasn't something I had to get ahead of time and that was business. Japan I don't need a visa from the US nor Singapore; ditto for Europe. It's entirely possible if I needed a visa for some of the countries I've been to, I might have needed a business visa of some sort for customer meetings etc. But I've very rarely needed to get a visa for countries I've traveled to. reply herbst 17 hours agorootparentVisa on arrival forms have a reference to a URL or something attached and mention that you acknowledge their visa rules by applying for a visa. It's like a prechecked privacy policy checkbox. reply ghaff 16 hours agorootparentIt was probably actually Indonesia I had a visa on arrival for. And they explicitly allow business meetings and attending events--which is pretty much the norm for most (but not all) countries whether they say so explicitly or not. The US does seem to have a different visa for temporary business activities. reply wongarsu 17 hours agoparentprevYou can (and probably should) incorporate your business. Then you write yourself an employment contract and give yourself vacation whenever you want to travel. The bigger issue is that actually having a vacation where you don't work is unrealistic if you run a business by yourself, but is what the letter of the law demands for most tourist visas. reply herbst 17 hours agorootparentYour last point is where it gets complicated. I can barely have a week for myself, I can't realistically go anywhere for a month without 'working'. (Yes I know, nobody will ever know) reply mekoka 16 hours agoparentprevCan you point to a specific article of the law from a country that states that you cannot work on your business registered in your home country, while visiting that particular country? reply awongh 17 hours agoparentprevThese rules and laws esp. with regards to visas and immigration are not about the rules themselves. They're a proxy for government to be able to control the types of people they think benefit their society (and whether or not to let them in the country). If you fit within those concepts of what is deemed acceptable, no one will bother you. Are you a rich, white professional class person with a first-world passport? You have signalled that no one needs to bother with you. Things like visa regulations will be applied less strictly. If you are from the wrong country or you are the wrong skin tone, your chances of having a bad time are much higher. This applies not only to Japan, or countries like Thailand or Mexico, but also to the USA and Europe equally. reply ravxx 17 hours agorootparentWhy bring race into it? reply verticalscaler 18 hours agoparentprevI give you permission to spread your wings and leave the EU for a stint. Of course don't take the word of an internet stranger, confirm with a lawyer. reply m_dupont 18 hours agoparentprevI mean sure, but the chances of that ever being enforced are close to 0. I'm a full time digital nomad for over a year in various latin american countries, always on tourist visas. Nobody notices or cares. The only time I ever had an issue is when entering the united states, the immigration department gave me a grilling because my passport showed that I was clearly a nomad and they expected me to be working online. Go ahead, take that holiday. reply herbst 18 hours agorootparentNo worries, I am not limiting myself :) When I was in Thailand years ago a coffee shop was raided, and I heard some bad experiences of people being to stupid about their visa forms.

Thailand was basically just noticing this trend and reacting, afaik this hasn't happened again. About the visas people just were really stupid to be honest about their income (or lack of) reply dazamarquez 17 hours agoprevI don't understand why this would be interesting. These \"digital nomads\" who would travel to Japan for work+sightseeing aren't taking local jobs and don't have a Japanese bank account. Does Japan want to tax income produced within its borders, regardless of where one is actually a tax resident? Most countries I'm aware of treat people as tax residents if they reside there for more than 180 days a year. reply andybak 19 hours agoprevThe salary requirement seems harsh for people working on non-profit, self-funded or early-stage. reply spidersenses 18 hours agoparentJapan is a country that is expensive to live in. Having minimum salary requirements already filters out the type of 'digital nomad' who would otherwise become a burden on society or those who merely seek immigration from Africa or South Asia under the disguise of the 'digital nomad'. reply nerdbert 18 hours agorootparentJapan is not particularly expensive. It's significantly cheaper than USA, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, NZ, etc. US$68,000 is enough for a very comfortable life there. reply mywittyname 17 hours agorootparent$68k about the median household income in the USA - and higher than the median in a lot of states. One could live a comfortable life in many parts of the USA for that salary. reply jwells89 17 hours agorootparentprevParticularly if you’re not living in Tokyo, Fukuoka for instance is significantly cheaper despite also being a densely populated city with the usual amenities. reply keiferski 18 hours agorootparentprevIt really isn't though, especially with the currency exchange. Tokyo is comparable in cost to a second or third tier American city, not to NYC/LA/SF/London. See: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/compare_cities.jsp?cou... I do agree that $68k as a salary requirement is fairly reasonable, though – but it's much higher than the \"average\" salary for a Japanese person. reply andybak 18 hours agorootparentprevThere's a large gap between \"burden on society\" and \"provable $58k income\" reply gottorf 19 hours agoparentprevOn the other hand, if you meet any of those criteria, perhaps it's not the best use of your resources to be a digital nomad in Japan. reply andybak 18 hours agorootparentThat's fairly presumptuous of you. reply gottorf 17 hours agorootparentPerhaps, but perhaps also less presumptuous than anybody who thinks they have an innate right to go to Japan on whatever terms they please. reply andybak 17 hours agorootparentMy mistake. You're not presumptuous. You're just rude. reply totetsu 19 hours agoparentprevJapan legislature seems to spend a lot of time passing these kind of laws that only ever affect a few people. But with some of the other ones after a few years of no one using the residency statuses, they loosened up the requirement a bit. reply wharvle 18 hours agoparentprevThe point is to get people in who'll spend money. Governments don't usually create visa programs to be nice—they do it for some benefit. reply mc32 18 hours agoparentprevThey don't want pretenders. They want people who are going to be productive and bring something to the country. They're not looking for \"backpackers,\" they're looking for well paid professionals who will spend money and also conform better (these people would hire people to do paperwork, translate, etc., rather than drain local resources.) People may not agree with the above, but that's what they want, and I can't blame them for wanting good for their country. reply andybak 18 hours agorootparentNice line in unveiled insults you've got there. EDIT - you changed \"poser\" to \"pretender\" which was a small improvement. It's polite to make it clear that you've edited a comment if someone has replied. reply mytailorisrich 19 hours agoparentprevObviously this type of visa is aimed at getting people to spend money in the country. Why would they want people with no money? reply informatimago 18 hours agorootparentWell, the digital nomad doesn't spend a lot of money. Some on accommodation, some for internet, some for food, and that's it. He spends his time remote working on his laptop. His income is paid offshore. Apart from the tourist aspect of it, the point of a digital nomad is to save money on rent, food and taxes, not to spend all your money in a foreign country. Of course, a business hub, or a technological hub can attract digital nomads punctually, even if accommodations are more expensive. Now Japan has a problem with its age pyramid and desertification of its country side. So it should be possible to attract digital nomad for longer and cheaper stays, even if they don't have a lot of money (to spend in Japan), at least that's good for the young body count, and perhaps they'd eventually fixate and have families. But again, this wouldn't be a six-month thing, they would have to add more incentive (free or $1-house in the countryside with minimal occupancy, good internet connection (I don't know if Japan has 100% territory fiber coverage) (that said nowadays there's Starlink), etc. reply lupire 18 hours agorootparentWhy would a nomad spend less than a resident? reply mytailorisrich 18 hours agorootparentprevI would have thought that the point of spending 6 months in Japan was to experience Japan in a deeper and more relaxed way than a short-ish trip as a tourist. Spending money on living expenses, including rent, and touristy stuff is indeed spending money in the country. And if you are well paid then that may be more than the average local: the threshold for this visa is $68k while the average annual pay in Japan is apparently $41-45k. reply andybak 18 hours agorootparentprevHow is everyone reading this as me saying \"no money\"? You can have significantly less than $58k provable income and live very nicely while travelling. Is this some silicon valley bubble thing? reply mytailorisrich 18 hours agorootparent\"No money\" is obviously a figure of speech. I rephrase: Why would they want people with \"significantly less than 58k/68k provable income\"? \"Digital nomad\" can encompass many and any thing. It seems sensible to target higher earners if they can. It's not about how nicely you think you can live, it's about the benefits a country seeks in letting foreigners in. reply prg20 18 hours agoparentprevTotally. They should allow anyone, even those with no income, to come to their country and use their services for nothing in return. We can see how well that's worked in the US. reply andybak 18 hours agorootparentYou obviously want to soapbox an entirely different topic - nobody said \"no income\" so your answer just makes you look slightly off-kilter. reply dvngnt_ 18 hours agorootparentprevUS has a bigger economy though so something is working reply jskxneks777 16 hours agorootparentUS is a shit hole compared to japan lmao reply mekoka 16 hours agoprevI've often seen suggested in forums that tourist visas forbid any kind of work while visiting a country. I've yet to see a single article of the law that actually points to this. So, I'm inclined to think that when people repeat this, they actually haven't checked. I have looked at the clauses on many tourist visas, as given to me by various consulates, and seen no evidence of this new interpretation. A tourist visa often forbids working or doing any kind of local business, other than volunteering and the likes (i.e. taking a local job, selling stuff locally, meeting with local businesses, etc). That this new interpretation coincides with the emergence of nomad visas just tells me that nomads have been questioning their appeal and it's been suggested that they might be infringing some law, if they keep using tourist visas instead. Think of the ramifications of trying to regulate all the fuzzy definitions of what constitutes \"work\". What about someone writing their memoir? What about any kind of opus you're working on while on vacation (electronics, code, writing, etc)? What about needing to manage your business at home for an hour everyday? What about being on-call for work emergencies? What about meetings? Such a visa would easily make anyone an outlaw, which many people think is a non-issue, because the country doesn't enforce it, but is actually a big deal. reply unnah 15 hours agoparentVisa rules were typically set up at a time when there was no such thing as remote work to speak of. When they mention working, they don't make any distinction between remote or local work. For example, a US B-2 visitor visa allows \"tourism\" and also specific business purposes such as \"consult with business associates\" or \"attend a conference\". What is prohibited is simply \"employment\", without making any distinction between remote or local employment. Source: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-... reply mekoka 14 hours agorootparent\"Employment\" on that list is among other items of \"Not permitted travel purposes\" that hint at an obvious implied context for the said purposes, i.e. the United States. You are not allowed to visit the United States for the purpose of employment while on a visitor's visa. A digital nomad typically is already employed and doesn't visit countries for that purpose. Having traveled to the US a number of times and been asked by border agents, I've explained that although employment not being the purpose of my visit, I often work on my computer for my own business, in my own country. After a brief exchange to clarify that my activities in no way involved US businesses or clients, I was cleared. I agree with you that the rule might seem fuzzy, but based on the questions asked, the intent has never been. In the many years that I've traveled, it's historically been the same in any countries that I've visited. Even the ones where it's currently suggested that the issue might be blurrier (coincidentally after they start issuing nomad visas). Meanwhile, no one can tell you specifically what exactly constitutes a \"digital nomad\" and what makes them \"not a tourist\". I think it's unfortunate that instead of asking for more clarity from regulators, travelers are playing along by repeating the suggested tropes. reply holoduke 17 hours agoprevI think within 10 years this is also needed in Europe. Back in 2000 1 in 5 eligible for working were pensioned. Now its 1 in the 3. This mumber only gets worse. Japan is a few years ahead. But population decline in a growth based economy is not good.

    "title": "Giving Up on a Failing Project: A Cautionary Tale",
    "originLink": "https://www.preethamrn.com/posts/when-should-you-give-up",
    "originBody": "👨💻 Preetham Posts Projects Contact When should you give up on a project that doesn't work? 1 February 2024 · 5 min read I spent a lot of my free time after work over the last month working on a project and today I'm giving up. The idea was based on a simple hypothesis. People enjoy surfing Wikipedia to find interesting articles by randomly clicking on links. What if there was a way to search for articles by clicking on locations? In fact, Wikipedia used to have this feature built into their apps (they still have it but now it's only a website). There are a few issues with Wikipedia's solution though: They don't show the points on a map so you'd have to guess where the articles are in relation to each other (or plug the coordinates into a map separately) They sort articles by distance and not by popularity or some other heuristic. My hypothesis was that if you could drag around a map to search for articles nearby and sort them by pageviews it would be more fun and could potentially help with vacation planning. I was wrong and here's how I found out. 1. Initial passion The first week of the project was great. Day 1, I was able to integrate OpenStreetMaps and the Wikipedia API to list all the articles in the area with their view counts. By Day 3, I supported fetching articles progressively as you moved the map around, added a page view filter, and added popups which linked to the Wikipedia page. By the end of the first week, I had finished most of the basic UI. The map takes up the full screen, it's possible to collapse the list of articles, and you can sort by views. By this point I had everything I needed to validate my hypothesis. Instead I decided to keep adding more random features without having a clear vision in mind until... 2. Excuses After the first week, I ended up getting busier with various tasks at work while also having to travel around. I told myself I would try to get some work done on the project if I got free time but somehow that never ended up happening. At the time I figured I couldn't be so hard on myself because I did actually have other stuff to do, but in hindsight I think this is where my lack of motivation started to kick in. Was I subconsciously afraid that the project wasn't going to work out the way I thought it would? 3. Fake productivity After one week of not getting much done, I decided to kick it into high gear and make a bunch of changes. Changing UI libraries to naive-ui and again to Quasar Changing the color of map markers based on how popular an article is Using the Navigator.geolocation property to search for articles near the user's location Loading more details when clicking a popup Adding a crosshair to the center of the map so you know where you're loading from A bunch of different CSS tweaks A week passed and here's what I ended up with. It certainly looks a lot better, although what you don't see is the horrible lag that happens when you first load the page (and whenever you move around the map), the fact that the popups often don't load until all the page views are fetched (I'm assuming because of some rate limiting on Wikipedia's side), and how the table on the right breaks down and becomes practically useless after moving around the map for a while and accumulating thousands of articles in the list. Don't get me started on how it looks on a phone. 4. Pushing tasks back by days Once the low effort tasks dried up I wasn't sure what to do next. I started to realize that a lot of things would need to be built from the ground up and had to confront the fact that what I was doing just wasn't working. The website was laggy, the most viewed articles were just the city pages (which aren't particularly interesting coordinates to visit on a vacation), and many of the prominent articles that showed up were things like YouTube headquarters shooting\" and \"Death of Jeffrey Epstein\" while more interesting places like \"Pittock Mansion\" and \"Ghirardelli Square\" were hard to come by. I'm surprised the first two even had coordinates to begin with. What I really needed to do was overhaul the algorithm that I used to sort and display articles to users, improve the map controls to be less laggy, make the page more responsive on first load, and set a better zoom level which helped highlight the articles that were loaded. But still, I spent the next few days continuing to mess around with the CSS, add mobile UI support, and improve the popup and table displays. None of these solved the core problem and here's what I have today - Wikimaps. 5. Giving up The reason it was so hard to get to this stage was the fear that I was wrong with my hypothesis. I tricked myself into believing that if I just kept making these small incremental changes that I'd make it fun to use again. But in reality, I think I probably should have quit after week 1... or at least drastically changed how I approached things. Maybe I'll come back to this project some other day, but for now, it'll go back on the shelf. Why am I writing this? Partially as a cautionary tale to myself and others so in the future I won't make the same mistake. Partially because I spent the last month making something and I didn't want that to go to waste. And partially in the hope that sharing this idea with others1 might reignite some of that initial passion that I had. I think the biggest takeaway from this is that if something is worth building, you'll know right away. A barely functional prototype from another project I worked on almost 4 years ago got over 1000 upvotes on Reddit in a day just based off of a gif. For now I'm on to bigger and brighter pastures. I have another project in the works and this time I'll make sure to test my hypothesis as early as possible. Footnotes I already posted this on Reddit and got some interest. However most of the suggested changes were \"fake productivity\" things like supporting showing distance in meters, supporting non-English articles, and fixing minor bugs with geolocation so I probably won't get back to it ↩ #Programming Written by @preethamrn: Software developer at Uber with a degree in CS.

One approach I really liked was the 2/2/2 rule: 2 hours for a poc → does this even make sense? 2 days for a prototype to share with friends 2 weeks to build something useful (paid if your goal is to charge for it) You can leave the process at any stage.

Opportunity cost. I had a really compelling but unproven idea once, for a gap in the market for a library. I made an absurdly ruthlessly minimal prototype in 2 hours; then spent 1 long day (9 hours) making a website. My rule was if no one appreciated it in 10 days, I'd forget it.

Probably two-thirds of them don’t end up going anywhere, but experimenting with those kinds of things is fun. To answer the OP question, I can't find the interview I was looking for now, but I remember that he said that he stops working on a prototype when he realizes that he's learned enough from it. reply Verdex 11 hours agoparentprevI think unfinished projects are important. On a personal level, I've had many unfinished projects that felt (at the time) like failures. At one point in time, I had two different ideas for parse libraries that I had to give up on because I couldn't figure out how to make them work in a way that was remotely useful. However, a few years later, I was able to create a third, otherwise unrelated, project that I realized I could use to unify the previous two. If you're not running into situations where you have to put away a project as unfinished then it might mean that you're not pushing yourself to and beyond your capabilities (which, depending on your goals, can be totally fine). And just because something ends up unfinished, doesn't mean that it might not be able to come back later in a different form. reply hyperthesis 10 hours agorootparentReminds me of Feynman saying that when he learnt a new mathematical technique, he'd try it to see if it helped on his unsolved problems. reply alkonaut 13 hours agoparentprevThis. I have done this for 30 years and never, ever thought about a side project “this could be a commercial success”. What’s described here is a lot further along than I normally take a project. There is always a more interesting project to make that has no potential of being “successful” than the most interesting idea among potentially successful projects. I think for some people the entrepreneurial angle itself is enough to make a project attractive. But I never quite understood it. reply gertlex 13 hours agorootparentI also never ponder personal projects from a commercial standpoint. But I sure see that narrative here on HN frequently. I have to conclude that most people on HN talking about commercializing are doing purely software projects. My projects very often include hardware. Commercializing hardware+software projects is hard... orders of magnitude harder than just software. That's probably a factor in why the idea of making money from wiring/soldering/dremeling/hacking things is so far from the forefront of my mind. As for what's attractive... novelty and usability/street cred do seem to be my subconcious goals. \"Street cred\" or even just aspiring to have people use a software tool is certainly a form of non-profitable entrepreneurship. reply xmprt 4 hours agorootparentStreet cred is a pretty big part of why anyone does anything. Money is one way to get that but having something that no one else does is even better in my opinion. I spent a few weeks making a custom version of a board game that I really enjoy and while I could never commercialize it (for copyright, trademark, and a whole slew of other intellectual property reasons), I think having it for myself makes it even more valuable. reply hyperthesis 9 hours agorootparentprevHN began as startup news, and remains part of YC (news.ycombinator.com): commercialization bias. reply imhoguy 11 hours agorootparentprev\"commercial success\", I think it is a common dream of escaping 9-5 worklife.

But fame and fortune do attract people. There is also something else exciting about a gap in the market: a kind of discovery and a way for the impact and usefulness of your efforts to be multiplied. reply JJMcJ 13 hours agorootparentprev> “this could be a commercial success\" Someday maybe, but if not, that's fine anyway because I learned something and had some fun. reply codegeek 14 hours agoparentprevI love to do small projects even if they technically don't finish. Sometimes those are useful later down the road when I am working on a bigger project and that little project comes in handy. For example, I just created my own poor man's CMS in Go that processes Markdown to HTML. A while ago, I had played around basic Go library that does that so I just used it easily in my project without needing to spend too much time figuring out that library. reply diggan 14 hours agorootparentSounds like the general definition of \"finish\" doesn't match with your own. One could \"complete\" or \"finish\" a project if the goal was to learn something specific (or general), although others wouldn't considered it finished unless it was deployed and others use it. I think lots of us would be better off if we redefined \"finish\" to basically mean \"done\", which you can define however you want :) reply RajT88 14 hours agoparentprevThis! I have many unfinished projects. The goal was not to build a thing - it usually was more an excuse to learn. Although sometimes it was to build a thing. I once wrote a podcast downloader in powershell because all the ones out there sucked. reply TheCaptain4815 13 hours agoparentprevSame here for physical \"ideas\"/ecommerce stuff. By constantly \"failing\", I've gotten very efficient at knowing whether an idea or product is worth attempting.

For me, due to life circumstances of severe chronic pain, until relatively recently my life and projects were mostly on hold. To cope with my projects \"dying\" 10+ years ago from no longer being able to work on them, aside from the grief of going through my entrepreneurial baby \"dying\" - the main project I was working on and putting all of my effort on, and was going well - I began to tell myself that things were simply on hold, on the backburner, and I will revisit them again in the future.

I agree with your perfectionism point; but how to test the hypothesis that it would be \"fun\"? A rough prototype can easily not be fun, even if the hypothesis is true! User experience seems hard... Perhaps this is the reason for Mark Cerny's Method in game dev: to complete a slice of a AAA game to shippable standard, to tell if it's worth completing. Because players can't evaluate the experience of a game without the finished game. It's a hell of a lot of work, like $3 million; but doing just a slice makes it less than the $30 million for the whole game. Whereas, for some reason, for Zelda: Breath of the Wild, they developed a cheap 2D prototype to test out their \"physics\" and \"chemistry\" ideas. How were they able to test their hypothesis so cheaply? What makes a hypothesis cheap to test?

The hypothesis was “if you could drag around a map to search for articles nearby and sort them by pageviews it would be more fun and could potentially help with vacation planning.” After one month they realized it would be harder than they thought.

I work on small projects like this, I get them to a point, I pause. I come back a day or a week or a year later when I need it again (and find it broken) or want to add some feature.

It seems like a really challenging problem! But because it is clearly defined and scope-limited, I feel it's more straightforward than the first one. reply janalsncm 13 hours agorootparentprevI don’t think you need to throw your code away, I think you need to fix your ranking algorithm. People use Craigslist even though it’s got minimal styling. CSS isn’t UX. And to fix your ranking algo you need to understand places more deeply. The core of your product. You mentioned yourself that ranking by page views was flawed. First of all, it seems that you can probably categorize places into a distinct set of categories. Historical landmarks, locations of past events, locations of ongoing or regular events, buildings for large businesses or government, metro areas (cities, counties, states) etc. Figure out what you actually think is interesting. Probably don’t include a link to Manhattan on your map next to a local business for example. Choose a city you’re not familiar with and figure out if the top links are interesting to you. Tweak your algorithm and check another city. Simple isn’t always good, the world is messy and you’ll have a lot of edge cases. reply nonrandomstring 14 hours agorootparentprevYeah \"the shelf\" is where projects go. Never give up. There's some kinda weird zombie projects though; Project Deja-Vu: halfway through a new project you have a vague recollection of having done something similar before, and when you search your archives and find exactly what you're working on - even with the same comments (maybe this is an age related thing ) Project \"Father give me legs...\": Every time you look at it you're overwhelmed with a wave of guilt, memories of broken promises...

Since I work in ML and not web stuff (which I don't really enjoy), this is not really how I'd like to spend my time. Unfortunately, almost every idea I have, even if it deep down has to do with AI or ML, includes some form of web app, because you need some way to interact with the interesting thing. In the end, maybe that means just doing nothing, because with kids and a busy life I just don't have the energy to spend on npm dependency management, front-end frameworks and JS build systems. reply radley 9 hours agoprevLife tip: you can give up on projects that do work, too. The only mistakes are planning a long-term commitment prematurely, and framing it as \"giving up\" instead of \"moving on.\" Have fun, try things. reply mfrye0 10 hours agoprevI think it depends on what you're trying to do. For any given project, what's the goal? Who are you building it for? Are you trying to build a business around it? There's a big difference in working on a project for fun, and building something to solve a problem for users. In the article, I do not see any mention about talking to users, customers, etc. and asking what they want. It's a lot more motivating to continue working on a project when you're building something people want and solves real problems. reply mittermayr 13 hours agoprevAs someone who also makes these kinds of things all the time (sometimes it works, most of the time it does not) — let me just thank you for the \"fake productivity\" angle you highlighted. I am right in the middle of one of those, pushing the launch further out, yet again, and reading your article made that crisp and clear (in my case: changing from SQlite back to MySQL, from JWT via Auth Header to JWT via Cookies, etc.). I also wanted to mention that clearly knowing the hypothesis to test for at the very beginning isn't all that easy, in my opinion. A lot of the time, you need to walk down the path, even walk it for a good long while, until you hit the right angle or context to truly see where the project could land. You (hopefully) start these things with a \"good enough\" reason, but it often needs a lot of shaping and refining to get it all back into the light, for a wider audience. Curiosity in learning new things will (should) always be a good part of what fuels the effort, it's a safety net (for me as a developer anyway), shielding me a bit from ending up with purely wasted time once it's clear that it didn't lead anywhere. At least I learned something new along the way. reply mattvr 1 hour agoprevWait. This is amazing. I think there are plenty of potential users.

When you see yourself doing fake productivity its bad news. I also find that sometimes I will scope tasks too big, take too long to finish them and get demotivated, if I break them up further I can keep momentum (even if the breakup is during the original task).

You implement important game mechanics and interactions with just enough fidelity for it to be believable.

But if it's not fun, it might just be the lack of fidelity - not believable enough. I guess one needs an opinion for how much fidelity is enough to know, for the specific mechanics/interactions. EDIT can always increase fidelity. Through this discussion, I realize I'm more interested in \"feel\" than fun as such - e.g. a sense of place, being somewhere, in a walking simulator; or the feel of guns in COD. Not a mechanic; but perhaps a kind of interaction. Not necessarily \"cinematic\", but probably more akin to issues in cinema than game mechanics. I suppose one can still isolate an aspect and iterate on it; but it seems fidelity is important here... reply Jensson 1 hour agorootparentGames don't get more fun with more fidelity, minecraft and terraria are very low fidelity but still fun. Fidelity improves other aspects, but not the \"fun\" part. Audio feedback and visual feedback are very important for fun though, like the knocking you hear when hitting things in minecraft and blopping from picking things up, but it is better to try to make things fun without that at first since those can make just clicking around in a forum fun. reply hyperthesis 53 minutes agorootparentWhat aspects does fidelity improve?

Some are just \"on hold\", the subject still interests me, though the passion has dwindled. Some are just dead, they served their purpose. Some are \"in production\", in that I use them but don't \"work on them\". They're good enough. Back in the day, we were using a tool that facilitated rapid iteration and development. The premise (way before any of this stuff became really fad-ish) was to get the customer involved. Fast results, early demonstrations, fast feedback. You know the drill. But the key take away was the analogy he promoted. Simply \"it's one thing to have sheet music, it's another to hear it\". The premise being you can write the music all you want with notes and staves and what not, but it's not real until you hear it. And, I don't know anything about music, so I can't speak to how actually writing music works for folks. But the point was made. You can make all the slide shows you want, but running code, hands on experience speaks volumes more than shouting at each other in a room with a whiteboard. Of course, like everything, it's nuanced. But the point is made. Recently, my friend had a need, and we came up with a pretty cool database type of system. No reason to go into details, but it was pretty cool, we came up with some great concepts, we thought through some hard problems, we started pounding out code, wrote up a nice rough draft of the query language. In the end though, we felt that we were working on a trap with no mouse. The need wasn't that great. So we shelved it. We were close, but not quite to the most minimal MVP. To prove the core tenet. But, even close we felt it wasn't worth pursuing. So, we stopped, and really haven't looked back. And there's nothing wrong with that. Learn, move on. That said, it behooves to make honest appraisal of why something is being stopped. Sometimes, and it's hard to tell when, but sometimes it's worth pushing through whatever barrier has come up and push on. Maybe with a little more work, you'll find that whatever was stopping you was surpassed and is no longer holding you back. Perhaps some new wind will fill your sails. reply hyperthesis 8 hours agoparentI like the sheet music vs hearing analogy.

Every genuine problem which humans had, has been solved decades ago. The problems which people are solving today are things that people want but don't need. What the majority of people need is: - Financial independence. - Genuine social relationships. - A sense of community. Disturbingly, our political and economic system works against all of these things by using our monetary system to artificially create poverty. We've reached a stage in human development where it doesn't make sense to solve any problem until we've solved the problems above for the majority of people. That's why I never know what to build. Every project which will attract any money is going to be some band-aid patch. A drug which gives users a temporary high but doesn't benefit them at all in the medium or long term... Or if the project is a b2b solution, it's just going to be some gimmick to further enslave humanity away from the things they need. I got into cryptocurrencies because the kinds of communities that it could facilitate are exactly what people need.

Seems like you had excellent ideas, for all to end up being workable. I did similar at about 15yo, wrote a game, exhausted myself actually completing it.

    "originBody": "Networking Amazon’s new AWS charge for using IPv4 is expected to rake in up to $1B per year — change should speed IPv6 adoption News By Mark Tyson published 2 February 2024 Charging $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses quickly adds up. Comments (5) (Image credit: Shutterstock) On Thursday, Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced a new charge for customers with public IPv4 addresses. It had warned that a new pricing plan would be put into place six months ago, and we had a rough idea of the scale of charges that many customers would face. However, the Border0 blog has spotlighted some very interesting financial implications of the change, estimating that Amazon will make as much as an extra $1 billion from its stable of IPv4 addresses over the coming year. Last summer, we reported on the impending AWS IPv4 pricing change. Amazon said that starting February 1, 2024, it would start charging customers $0.005 per IP per hour for all public IPv4 addresses, whether attached to a service or not. It reasoned that IPv4 addresses are increasingly scarce and difficult to manage and explained that “the cost to acquire a single public IPv4 address has risen more than 300% over the past five years.” At the same time, it encouraged users to accelerate the adoption of IPv6. So, $0.005 per IPv4 per hour sounds like a tiny amount, right? Previously, we worked out that it would mean a new fee of $43.80 per year per IPv4 address on an AWS service bill. Border0 has dived deeper into the figures and what the service pricing change could mean to AWS's income. It picked through data in the “AWS IP JSON and the various whois (ARIN, RIPE, etc.) data entries” to determine that Amazon has nearly 132 Million IPv4 addresses. Remember, we are told these addresses are in high demand / scarce, so it is reasonable to assume many are used by customers. Combining the 132 million IPv4 addresses managed by AWS with ipv4.global data showing that the average price for an IPv4 address is currently ~35 dollars, Border0 calculated the total value of AWS IPv4 stock to be worth $4.6 billion. The firm also considered the potential yearly income from these IPv4 addresses. Using a conservative estimate that 30% of AWS IPv4 stock (79 million IPv4 addresses) is in use by paying customers, Amazon would be able to rake in over a billion dollars a year from this internet real estate (23.7 million x $43.80 = $1.04 billion). The best guess of Border0 was that AWS would be making between $400 million and $1 billion a year from the IPv4 charging change implemented yesterday. (Image credit: AWS) Go IPv6 if you can? Why would Amazon want users to change to IPv6? IPv4 is a 32-bit addressing scheme and thus limited to 4.3 billion unique devices - not enough for the modern internet, IoT, and so on. IPv6 was created in 1998 and implements 128-bit addressing to provide approximately 340 undecillion addresses. That ought to be enough for anybody (sorry for recycling that joke from last time, but it was irresistible). As mentioned above, the scarcity of IPv4 addresses in 2024 means that there is a lot more effort needed to acquire, recycle, and manage them - so we have the new AWS IP address charging plan. However, AWS is not leveraging hourly charges on IPv6 addresses, and it provides tools for users to audit their IPv4 addresses, check where IPv6 addresses might be useful (several references), and release unused IPs. Border0 also offers IP management solutions, including a free tier, which can potentially help you lower your AWS bill. If this charge structure change might affect you or your organization, you can read more about Border0’s services via their blog link in the intro.

Windows 2000 had native IPv6 support so it is not a client issue. Not all ISPs support IPv6. Bell Canada doesn't for example. What I see is the biggest hold up is Cable and DSL modems. Their firmware, UI and default settings is designed around IPv4. Most modems in use are already past their EOL. If they had to cut over to IPv6, new firmware would have to be pushed down to them. They would have to convince manufacturers to build new firmware for EOL devices. At the end of the day, ISPs would need to replace millions of devices overnight. No ISP will want to pay for that. I can't imagine the e-waste it would cause. Another issue. Prefixes are assigned by an ISP. Have fun redoing you internal static addresses on you key devices if you change ISP. At least with NAT you can just drop in a replacement ISP. Edit: One last note. Rural areas tend to get hand me down equipment when Cities get upgraded equipment. That is due to a low ROI on new infrastructure on for a handful of people. If there is an IPv6 cutover, there will be those without internet. Reply greenreaper In the UK, it's Virgin Media that's the big blocker. That said, if some sites just aren't available over IPv4 then that could force their hand as it will become a competitive pressure. There will come a tipping point because it is now a non-trivial amount for a VM. Vultr is already offering IPv6-only VMs on its smallest plan for a $1/month discount, IIRC. Reply Rob_mc_1 I greenreaper said: In the UK, it's Virgin Media that's the big blocker.

I could also see pressure go in the other direction. ISPs have their own data centers and won't be as phased by what AWS is doing. That instead will put pressure on people to secure IPv4 access or become irrelevant. As long as the average person can watch YouTube, buy things on Amazon or access Reddit and Wikipedia there will be little impact. Reply mac_angel okay, but no more trashing me for still asking, \"Can it play Crysis\" Reply Daniel15 For hosting services, what it comes down to is that you really only need IPv4 on a limited number of edge nodes (load balancers and CDN nodes) that users directly connect to. Most servers aren't directly user-facing and would be fine only having an IPv6 address. This is what large companies like Google and Meta do - their internal network (both in their data centers and in their offices) are mostly IPv6-only. Rob_mc_1 said: IPv6 is not going to happen ~40% of traffic to Google and ~37% of traffic to Facebook are going over IPv6 (https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html, https://www.facebook.com/ipv6/). It really depends on where you live. It's mostly going great in the USA. Around 50% of traffic to Google and 60% of traffic to Facebook is going over IPv6. In the USA, most mobile networks are already IPv6-only, using 464XLAT and/or DNS64 for connectivity to legacy IPv4-only servers. They do NOT use CGNAT like in some other countries. T-mobile did this first, then some of the other carriers followed. Some aren't entirely IPv6 but they're 90%+ IPv6. Comcast rolled out IPv6 way back in 2011. By 2015, 70% of their customers had IPv6 provisioned (https://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/ipv4-depletion-not-the-beginning-of-the-end-its-just-the-end-of-the-beginning) and I think that's closer to 85% today. That means customers that actually have an active IPv6 prefix. Rob_mc_1 said: What I see is the biggest hold up is Cable and DSL modems Any modems from the past 5-10 years should support IPv6. I don't think any major ISPs (at least in the USA) are shipping modems that don't support IPv6 any more. If you're renting a modem from an ISP and it's very old, you can just ask them for a new one. That's one of the main reasons for renting a modem - you can upgrade it over time. Rob_mc_1 said: Another issue. Prefixes are assigned by an ISP. Have fun redoing you internal static addresses on you key devices if you change ISP. At least with NAT you can just drop in a replacement ISP. This is what ULAs (unique local addresses) are for. Your devices can have multiple IPv6 addresses, like a ULA for use within your network, and a public IP for internet access. Both of them can be assigned using SLAAC. NAT is a horrible hack and I'll be glad to see it gone.

They're exclusively IPv4 and they default everyone to CGNAT unless you call and complain - in that case you get a static IPv4 for free for a year and then $10/month after that (although another phone call usually gets another free year.) I specifically asked for IPv6 and was told they don't offer that. reply tw04 15 hours agorootparentThis isn't universally true.

Handing out /64 is the problem, but you and I can't solve it - that's the ISPs stupid decision. People will continue solving this by making smaller subnets and I believe this will become an official solution in the future, because smaller subnets solve a real (even if artificially created) problem. reply wongarsu 10 hours agorootparentprevIs not subnetting /64 solving a real problem?

If you pay for a business connection you can get 1 or more static IPv4 addresses, but then you get no IPv6 connectivity. reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentprevWeird, most cable ISPs that I know of have been IPv6. Last I checked in the US (pre pandemic) there is more IPv6 nights and weekends than working hours by a lot because the Cable ISPs and cell phone companies rolled out IPv6 long ago, while companies mostly are behind. OF course you didn't say what country you are in - different countries have very different numbers. reply thimp 16 hours agorootparentprevI reckon 20% of EC2 is NAT gateways with one instance behind them. reply szundi 15 hours agorootparentWhy would this make sense? reply thimp 15 hours agorootparentI've configured at least 3 VPCs in the last decade which were exactly that. Literally one instance with VPC service endpoints deployed and an egress NAT gateway. Surprisingly common when you have a random shitbox which sucks data up from somewhere and doesn't fit within the constraints of a Lambda or something. They mostly exist to tick the compliance and architectural documents which are all under AWS \"best practices\". Note that I do not consider AWS \"best practices\" to be best practices necessarily. In fact a lot of time they are completely over-engineered against hypothetical scenarios which if they did happen, fixing some EC2 integration shitbox would not even remotely be the first problem you had to worry about.

It should look like a normal resource so that false-negatives are not introduced by NoScript or uBlock. People can of course manually test here [1] from their homes, schools, work place. I would wager most cellular data networks would be fine. The impact would probably depend on how a website is utilized. Stats on mobile vs. non-mobile would probably be telling. The people on their cell should test LTE vs Wifi and clear cache between tests.

Yes, Cloudflare's customers should know what that means, but the end users that are using the service may not be and if the error in anyway says Cloudflare, then it gives Cloudflare a bad reputation. While AWS is a bit (just a bit) more removed from the end user than Cloudflare, there is still the potential for it not being good PR. reply lolinder 13 hours agorootparentCloudflare actually presents end users with an authentication page on a regular basis. AWS is strictly behind the scenes. The only time I've ever become aware that a site is using AWS is when reading their engineering blog or spelunking in the dev tools. reply elwebmaster 12 hours agorootparentThese infinite verification prompts are the reason I no longer consider Cloudflare as an option for business use and would not recommend it to anyone. I know that they are configurable by the admins but they give bad PR to Cloudflare. I am not sure what this company was thinking associating itself with such a terrible user experience. reply bluGill 14 hours agorootparentprevCloudflare couldn't dare of IPv6 only until a lot more of the internet supports IPv6. They could however offer a discount of some sort to customers that are IPv6 only. That includes proxy your IPv6 only site to IPv4 (actually they would probably not give a discount directly, but let you apply discounts you get from your ISP) reply wongarsu 14 hours agorootparentprevBut a load balancer doesn't have to be user-facing.

It’s already not trying to be too visible and I assume many participants would be happy to jump through hoops. Or something crypto. Pay to your IPv6 address, or nodes must be IPv6. Or social network. Start with an edge case that gets insiders to change behaviour. reply p1mrx 12 hours agoparentprevIt's rather brave of them to publish the list of \"no\"s. I imagine that's helping to crack the whip on IPv6 support within the company. reply mrweasel 17 hours agoprevThis could also slow down IPv6 adoption. This is going to free up a ton of IPv4 addresses, reducing the need for AWS to purchase new ranges. I know of a few companies that started auditing their public IPv4 usage on AWS after the original announcement. Some AWS customers have released 80+% of their public IPv4 addresses. The alternative isn't IPv6, it's private addresses. Many AWS customers have been slapping public IPs on EC2 instance just because they could or because they didn't know any better. reply jerf 15 hours agoparent\"This is going to free up a ton of IPv4 addresses, reducing the need for AWS to purchase new ranges.\" Yup, this has been obvious for a while if you read the better economic analyses. Charging for IPv4 doesn't on its own remove it. It creates some sort of economic balance between the value and scarcity of the IPv4 address space. When you're trying to fit the entire world of 7 billion people into 4 billion addresses, the space looks pretty scarce. But assuming a roughly power law distribution of services and their importance of being on IPv4, as you cut off the people with lower-end needs, like, \"my cell phone needs to communicate on the internet so let's give it an IPv4 address\", you extremely rapidly cut through orders of magnitude of the old uses. That long tail of \"Facebook is not willing to cut off even .01% of its user base so it has IPv4 addresses to serve on\" may take a long time to get through, but we're well through getting huge swathes of the other users off of it. What kills IPv4 is in the far future when the expense of maintaining it specially exceeds the benefits. Since maintaining it is rather cheap, this is going to take a while. But as IPv4 diminishes in importance, ironically, so does the value of entirely eliminating it. When it is 1% of the traffic, who will really be desperate to drop that to zero? reply zokier 11 hours agorootparentI don't find it at all difficult to imagine that someone like Google or Apple would sunset ipv4 when it reaches single digit percentage. They know no ISP would risk losing connectivity to them. For example Apple has already been requiring that appstore apps work in ipv6 only networks since 2016. They can just keep tightening such rules until ipv4 dies. It's naive to think that maintaining ipv4 (/dualstack) networks is (and will remain) cheap at large global scale like Google. reply lucw 7 hours agorootparentThat's exactly what might happen. Just like browsers made https mandatory. reply sva_ 15 hours agorootparentprev> entire world of 7 billion people Should be more like 8bn now reply bluGill 15 hours agorootparentprevThing is if it is only 0.01% of users Facebook won't give up on they can just do a few ipv4 server/address. Now Facebook has severs around the world, but if it is only a few users they just need two servers - and that is only for redundancy. Now they have thousands (maybe even millions? I don't know) of servers and they may as well give all the external facing ones IPv4 addresses as most need that anyway and so the hassle of maintaining IPv6 only servers isn't worth it. And of course if you are in the 0.01% you will discover that while Facebook and google won't give up on you many other providers will as it just isn't worth the cost. By that time the cost won't be IPv4 addresses - they will be again free - it will be the cost of maintaining IPv4 on all the routers and servers. (the routers mean IPv4 will cost more, but it won't be for the address it will be for routing access) reply marcus0x62 14 hours agorootparentprev> When it is 1% of the traffic, who will really be desperate to drop that to zero? The service providers who have to maintain IPv4 and IPv6 configurations in their networks. reply kccqzy 15 hours agoparentprevCorrect. I am convinced that the best way to speed up IPv6 adoption is to provide IPv6-only networking but with NAT64. Historical evidence is on this: cell phone ISPs have started doing this a long time ago and look at how high the IPv6 adoption is on mobile. Also, an IPv6-only network removes the happy eyeballs algorithm so any routing issues on the IPv6 internet won't be papered over by the speed of the IPv4 internet, so there's more incentive to fix that. (If you are interested in doing this at home, the most up-to-date documentation is a presentation from RIPE https://ripe87.ripe.net/wp-content/uploads/presentations/8-I... that covers NAT64/DNS64/DHCP108/PREF64). Of course everything I said above is conditioned on speeding up IPv6 adoption as a goal. Unfortunately for many, IPv6 adoption is not a goal at all, so nothing I said above applies to them. reply ianburrell 11 hours agorootparentDon't forget about MAP-T which does IPv4 NAT over IPv6. The client is IPv4, the ISP is IPv6, and server is IPv4. This is still CGNAT but IPv6 is provided. But means ISP uses IPv6 internally. The problem for NAT64 in general use is that there is lots of IPv4-only software. NAT64 is great for business networks where control the software, but home users are going to try to use their Xbox 360 or Windows game from the 90s. reply nemothekid 15 hours agoparentprev>The alternative isn't IPv6, it's private addresses. I really wish more AWS services or workflows worked with private addresses. Sometimes a service can be completely internal but needs a public address to either talk to Dynamo or install packages; but those endpoints aren't available via private IP, even though they physically live in the same region reply coredog64 14 hours agorootparentI believe the latest version of the VPC wizard defaults to gateway endpoints for both S3 and DynamoDB. If you’re in a 6-only VPC/subnet, an egress only gateway will allow you to grab packages from IPv6 enabled public data sources. reply paulddraper 14 hours agorootparentprevWhy? reply nemothekid 12 hours agorootparentI really don't care about IPv6 or IPv4. In my neck of the woods, 10.0.0.0/8 is more than I would ever need. Most architectures I've seen only realistically need only a handful of public IPs, that then are assigned to a load balancer that does service discovery on internal services. I don't think about IP addresses at all. reply paulddraper 11 hours agorootparentYeah but then you have to futz around with NAT. reply nemothekid 11 hours agorootparentToday you have to futz around with NAT, but you wouldn't have to if you simply never made any connections to the public internet. And for many services that's completely fine. reply zamadatix 17 hours agoparentprevCustomers having to switch to private addressing still seems like more pressure than customers having infinite free public addresses was providing, not less. I.e. address exhaustion pressure isn't only about the complete inability to buy an IP it's about how much work you have to do to use IPv4 addresses. reply wongarsu 17 hours agorootparentIt depends on how you measure IPv6 adoption. Is it about your ability as consumer to use only IPv6, or your ability to offer a website reachable only via IPv6. AWS charging for IPv4 will help with the former, because companies now have more of a reason to care about IPv6. But it might delay the latter, because fewer IPs wasted on internal servers means less price pressure on useful IPv4 use by ISPs, giving those that still hold out less financial incentive to change anything. reply kees99 16 hours agorootparentIMHO, best way to measure IPv6 adoption would be - what percentage of your website's visitors are able to reach your IPv6-only site. That percentage should be well above 99% for a popular website operator to even consider going IPv6-only; needless to say, in most markets, this figure is way lower, with no clear path to improving. reply eastbound 15 hours agorootparentIt doesn’t help that, if you enable IPv6 in Debian, the network becomes extremely slow for many things. The reason? If first tries to reach all domains with IPv6, times out, then use IPv4. Of course that’s because I didn’t successfully configure IPv6 with the network, but on the other hand, IPv4 only was successful at first try. reply patmorgan23 11 hours agorootparentprevBut this is also AWS exerting price pressure on its customers. This move is an increase in price pressure, not a decrease. If everything host on AWS becomes dual stack and gets first class IPv6 support after this move, that's a win for IPv6. The price for v4 address is going to bob up and down as more networks and content providers adopt v6 and are able to reduce their public v4 usage to just their edges. There will definitely be a long tail of v4, especially in the corporate world, but I think we'll get to 90-95% v6 capable within the next 5-10 year reply sgjohnson 16 hours agoparentprevAWS owns about 7% of the entire public IPv4 allocation space.

About 7 years ago there was a big IPv4 depletion scare when ARIN made it harder to obtain IPv4. I did a bunch of dual stack deployments for customers around this time.

Realistically the AWS charge mostly causes companies to stop giving IPv4 addresses to servers that never directly talk to customers. As a knock-on effect this will cause tooling to become more IPv6 aware, and put pressure on SaaS in infrastructure monitoring and dev tooling to be reachable via IPv6 (for example this might cause github to finally fix their IPv6 game because of higher customer demand). Maybe companies use the same opportunity to make sure their services also work via IPv6. But they won't stop offering their services on IPv4, and AWS changes don't put meaningful pressure on ISPs to roll out IPv6. If anything it will reduce the pressure on the price of IPv4 addresses, making it more viable for ISPs to hold out. reply zinekeller 16 hours agorootparent> will cause tooling to become more IPv6 aware I doubt it, especially that there is an option of using private/CGNAT ranges instead of adopting a whole new protocol. Everyone who cares about IPv6 have already done their part, and people who don't care about it will likely use the lower-friction option, and between private IPv4 networks and IPv6 I bet that a lot of people will see private IPv4 as a lower-friction option. reply wongarsu 10 hours agorootparentHowever the lowest friction option is to use private IPv4 between your servers, but give every server a public IPv6 it can use for outgoing calls: updating the OS, fetching github repositories, collecting logs on your favorite SaaS, etc. Of course you can do all this via IPv4 by setting up proxies or gateways, but that's more work and more moving pieces than checking the checkbox that you want a public IPv6 and having it just work ... provided everyone you want to talk to talks IPv6. reply zamadatix 17 hours agoparentprevThe tracker is for client connections to Google. To impact that graph AWS customers would have to, en masse, decide the $1/m charge is worth losing half their current users over and then the users and ISPs would have to scramble for IPv6.

Nobody can turn off IPv4 today; there is always a long tail of people with broken IPv6 stacks. Since IPv4 continues to work, I'm not even sure it's worth setting up IPv6 so that someday you can switch IPv4 off; do work that gets you customers today, switch off of IPv4 when it becomes a crisis. I think the best incentive would be a high price on IPv4-only, but if you do the work to support dual-stack, then that fee is waived. That way, there is savings for doing the technical work today, and you pave the way for a brighter future. Personally, I think I'd pay the fee to not be dual stack these days. Everything in your infrastructure has to now check two things. Your website uptime checker has to probe via both IPv4 and IPv6. You have to maintain two sets of firewall rules. You have to remember to \"ping -6 example.com\" in addition to \"ping example.com\" when checking connectivity. I don't think it's worth the effort, and I say that as someone who first made their website available over IPv6 in like 2008. (I moved providers in 2020 and the new one didn't have IPv6.

The downside is that doesn't work with old IPv4-only software. XLAT is used on mobile phones, and does the translation on the device. It only works for devices where translator can be installed.

    "originLink": "https://blog.opensource.org/the-european-regulators-listened-to-the-open-source-communities/",
    "originBody": "February 2, 2024 Simon Phipps OSI opinion The European regulators listened to the Open Source communities! During 2023, OSI and many others across the Open Source communities spent a great deal of time and energy engaging with the various co-legislators of the European Union (EU) concerning the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). Together with a revision to Europe’s Product Liability Directive (PLD), the CRA will bring the responsibilities of product liability to software for the first time. In the light of the EU’s own research showing the huge impact of Open Source on Europe’s economy, the authors of these legislative instruments sought to ensure that the lifecycle of Open Source software was impacted as little as possible. Indeed, at FOSDEM 2023 the authors of the CRA and PLD said as much in their first-of-a-kind main track appearance. But when we all looked at the details, community members found that was not as true as we hoped. As a range of organizations explained, the CRA was likely to be an existential threat to Open Source development, because instead of placing all the compliance requirements of the CRA on companies deploying Open Source software for profit, the obligations as written potentially fell on developers and Open Source foundations. Reactions To The Final Text Many OSI Affiliates engaged with the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council during 2023. With the welcome coordination of Open Forum Europe, a group met regularly to keep track of progress explaining the issues. Many of us also committed time and travel to meet in-person. As a result of all this effort from so many people, the final text of the CRA mitigated pretty much all the risks we had identified to individual developers and to Open Source foundations. As the Python Software Foundation said in their update: …the final text demonstrates a crisper understanding of how open source software works and the value it provides to the overall ecosystem of software development. And the Eclipse Foundation wrote: The revised legislation has vastly improved its exclusion of open source projects, communities, foundations, and their development and package distribution platforms. It also creates a new form of economic actor, the “open source steward,” which acknowledges the role played by foundations and platforms in the open source ecosystem. As the Apache Software Foundation said: So, all in all, this is mostly good news for volunteers who run and innovate with open source software. Or, more accurately, much better than most of us could have imagined at the end of last summer. This time last year OSI recommended that the CRA: …exclude all activities prior to commercial deployment of the software and … clearly ensure that responsibility for CE marks does not rest with any actor who is not a direct commercial beneficiary of deployment. That recommendation has been accepted and implemented, and the OSI is very grateful to the various experts who took the time to listen. OSI Observations While it’s all much better, and while the burden placed on individuals and charities is minimal, there are still challenges ahead. For example, the concerns that the Debian project articulated give cause for thought. With Open Source projects exempted from the requirement to place a CE certification mark on their software, downstream users will need to pay careful attention to their responsibilities under the CRA as well as to their liabilities to consumers under the PLD. In particular, “digital artisans” using Open Source software at small scale – the main concern of Debian – will need guidance from the European Commission. While the experts we have met have all said that using an Open Source software distribution as part of a commercial activity is unlikely to require CE marking of the distribution itself, the interpretation of the key phrase “making available on the market” will need careful clarification. OSI encourages the Commission to seek expert advice from the Open Source communities as they did last year, and not to rely on outsourced consultants alone in preparing this advice. FOSDEM 2024 There is also the question of how future engagement by legislators should proceed. The effort made by developers and Open Source foundations in 2023 is not sustainable, and the Commission needs to accommodate the Fourth Sector in future deliberations. To get this started, a group of us who have engaged during 2023 got together to organize a unique set of workshops at FOSDEM 2024 on Sunday February 4.

CRA will force many small enterprises and most probably all self employed developers out of business because they simply cannot fulfill the requirements imposed by CRA. Debian and other Linux distributions depend on their work. If accepted as it is, CRA will undermine not only an established community but also a thriving market. CRA needs an exemption for small businesses and, at the very least, solo-entrepreneurs. reply Certhas 20 hours agoparentThat statement was based on the old text, correct? The revised law seems to address this in the opinion of experts OSI spoke to: \"In particular, “digital artisans” using Open Source software at small scale – the main concern of Debian – will need guidance from the European Commission.

Yes it has. The updated text was published on December 20th [1], and does a lot to address these concerns. See also Bert Hubert's analysis [2]. The amount of knee jerking in the comments for this law really brings down the quality of discussion and detracts from remaining issues.

Sadly, there are topics that sometimes come up on HN that makes people have these knee-jerk reactions. Anything related to EU, unions, Tesla, Israel and more tend to bring out the worse from normally reasonable people. I'm probably guilty of it sometimes too, we're all humans after all. reply hcfman 21 hours agoparentprevWell stated. Another thing people can do is to disallow governments to use any software you produce by default. This doesn't change your obligations to the law but it does attach consequences to government decisions. Right now they make sweeping decisions to benefit large players and screw small players, which is like stealing from the poor to give to the rich. And worst, the whole thing is effectively retroactive to all of the people whose collective work gave them all the nice things. Government should learn that decisions should be thought about very carefully and the only way to start a change in thinking is to attach consequences. reply dns_snek 20 hours agorootparentSuch limitation would effectively change the project's license, which would no longer be F/OSS approved. Most people and businesses don't evaluate custom licenses, they'll just skip your project because it doesn't have a well-known, approved license. reply rmbyrro 21 hours agorootparentprevPoliticians don't care about this. It'll only impact the lives of developers working at governamental positions. This is also against the principle of OSS, which is to not discriminate about usage. reply hcfman 15 hours agorootparentSo is that law. Small players would be discriminated against by virtue of not having the money to mitigate the legal risk. reply Karellen 18 hours agorootparentprev> Another thing people can do is to disallow governments to use any software you produce by default. So, instead of having governments become part of an open (software) commons, using software that costs less in taxes[0], which they would then have a stake in supporting and helping to make better, you're proposing that they purchase higher-cost proprietary software from private corporations, supporting their shareholders? Yeah, that'll help. > the only way to start a change in thinking is to attach consequences. That's not how FLOSS has got where it is today, so it is clearly not \"the only way\". FLOSS succeeds by allowing everyone in, in allowing them to reap the benefits first, so that they understand the value first-hand. Then, they come to depend on it, and when they see how much it would cost them to stop using FLOSS, do they realise how much they have invested in the ecosystem. Keeping people out means that they never get entangled in the first place. [0] Or, requires less money to be created, depending on your viewpoint. reply alwayslikethis 20 hours agorootparentprevHow do you expect that to be respected when you have things like illegal surveillance or eminent domain? A well behaving government wouldn't be the target for this, and a badly behaving one wouldn't respect it anyways. reply thfuran 19 hours agorootparentIt tends not to be agencies like the USDA, USGS, VA, etc conducting illegal surveillance, yet they all use computers. And I'm not sure what eminent domain has to do with it. reply hcfman 15 hours agorootparentprevThat’s absolutely true. It’s more symbolic than practical. reply wolverine876 15 hours agorootparentprevDidn't government do what you want in this case? A long deliberative, consultative process, addressing the needs of small players? reply x0x0 14 hours agorootparentNo. They should have started by competently and carefully thinking through the consequences of the liabilities they were about to impose on open source, rather than obligating open source to expend limited resources explaining the obvious consequences. These problems were obvious to anyone competent who spent even a second thinking about it: people who give software away cannot accept liability for doing so, and the act of giving software away can't impose obligations to people who receive nothing or they will obviously have to stop. reply wolverine876 14 hours agorootparentI'd much rather they consult open source people about open source needs, rather than try to guess. IME, you need to talk to the people on the front lines. In fact, unless I talk to people I know best, even family members, I don't really know. reply x0x0 14 hours agorootparentThey didn't consult. They made open source go lobby them to avoid having to block the EU. That's the exact opposite of asking open source, in advance of legislation, what would happen if they did X. reply sunshine-o 21 hours agoparentprev> CRA needs an exemption for small businesses and, at the very least, solo-entrepreneurs. My guess is even medium size businesses will face enormous risk and cost related to this. In the end we might see the worst scenario happening: open source is good, but only if sold by a big company who can afford compliance, risks and lawyers. This will be somehow similar to what happened with GDPR, most small & medium shops cannot spend too much time on this. And ironically it pushed a lot of people in the 3 big public clouds. reply bluGill 20 hours agorootparentI think medium software sized shops - 500 employees are large enough to afford the details and so will be okay. Anything smaller though and this is too much overhead. Of course many projects don't need 500 people. If you use Linux you can buy support from several actors of this size who can afford the overhead (also covering tools like ls that are part of an OS, maybe covering the basic gnome desktop, but not many of the lesser used tools that make linux useful). I'm sure the Apache and FreeBSD foundations will look into this and decide that they are able to handle the overhead by starting (legally this may be finding people to start?) such a company. However I'm not sure OpenBSD is large enough to be worth starting such an organization. There are a lot of tools that are not large/popular enough. Who will support OpenScad, FreeCad, cppcheck, and all the other open source projects that don't have a large company behind them and probably are not interesting to enough companies to be worth starting something to support them just for legal purposes. There are also projects that are supported by a company today, but the company is not large enough - will enough more customers come in to make it worth hiring a dozen laywers - cmake and sqlite come into mind as projects in this category. reply pjmlp 19 hours agorootparentprevIn every other industry business of all sizes, even people selling stuff on the street, have to obey regulations, with exceptions where obeying regulations comes with certain flexibility. Open source is no different from anythig else performed by street artists, food trucks. reply ashildr 20 hours agorootparentprevGDPR is easy as a small organization IF you are not greedy for other people‘s data. Keep your hands clean. I own (part of) a small company that makes software for a small market and we had absolutely no problems with GDPR because we try to not collect any data we don‘t absolutely need. It‘s not very complicated if you just invest some thought into your processes and don’t spy on your customers. Most of the time you don‘t need the data but someone wants to sell you a product to gather it. reply nickpp 19 hours agorootparent> we try to not collect any data we don‘t absolutely need Do you have analytics/telemetry for your products/websites? Do you include 3rd party fonts, libraries or use a CDN or a anti-DDOS service like CloudFlare? Do you have data scrubbing capabilities in all your user-interaction software with a default maximum retention period? Do you answer data removal requests? These are some the requirements for organizations of any size, big or small. reply nottorp 18 hours agorootparentDoes your list qualify as 'data you absolutely need'? Do you assume everything is a web app where you can't control what your 3rd party libraries spy on? reply PaulKeeble 20 hours agoprevThis reminds me very much of the warnings by people like Robert C Martin over a decade ago that unless the software industry adopted better practices for quality and regulated itself regulators would step in. Regulators understand very little about the software process so the laws they are pass are unlikely to be the best way to solve it. Years after those lectures little has changed and now the regulation is coming at an increasing pace. None of this will be good for small software companies, this sort of regulation will entrench the big players as it always does. reply mouse_ 17 hours agoparent\"Big tech must regulate itself lest it become an unstoppable monopoly and crush any new competition.\" This sounds less like a warning and more like a playbook. reply rmbyrro 21 hours agoprevIf you want to entrepreneur in the software industry, move fast, folks. They're closing in and the level of freedom we have today isn't likely to exist in years to come. reply sofixa 18 hours agoparent> level of freedom There are freedoms to and freedoms from. The Cyber Resilience Act is giving freedoms from to consumers that never had them before, at the expense of some freedoms to abuse from software vendors. reply esarbe 19 hours agoparentprevWith \"freedom\", you mean the ability to exploit customers and disregards any responsibility when it comes to protecting customer's private data? Yeah, let's hope so. reply tzs 20 hours agoprevOT: Anyone have a more useful link to the Apache Foundation's statement? All the links to the other statements in the article go to the sites of the organizations they are quoting, but the one for the Apache Foundation goes to something called sandbox-pad.webm.ink. That just gives me an error dialog in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari that says \"sframe-boot.js must only be loaded in a nested context\" then a shield with a keyhole image fads in over it along with \"Loading...\" text, and nothing more happens (at least in the 30 minutes I've had that tab open). reply legobmw99 16 hours agoparenthttps://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/update-on-eu-softwa... This appears to be the article intended. At the very least it contains the quoted sentence reply max_ 18 hours agoprevI don't understand what's going on. Could someone give me a birds eye view of what this is about? - What is the regulation aimed at? - What did the open source community communicate? reply sofixa 18 hours agoparentThe legislation (Cyber Resilience Act) aims to enforce some standards and add liability around software products, to enforce that vendors don't just throw something out, never touch it again and it becomes a problem (customers stuck with paperweights, security holes exploited). The problem is that if you enforce that sort of thing on random open source projects, many will be simply incapable of even trying to follow the legislation because they're a small one-two dev team that cannot navigate complex laws. So, progressively, more and more exceptions have been added to who does the regulation apply to. reply matheusmoreira 16 hours agoparentprevLiability for software developers and vendors. The only problem is they forgot to make an exception for free and open source software developers. It simply makes no sense for me to publish free software out there for free if that can get me sued. reply legobmw99 16 hours agorootparentTFA is about how they did make those exceptions in the final text reply Nostromos 12 hours agorootparentDid they though? The article says that the final text mitigated \"pretty much all\" of the issues. What wasn't mitigated? reply snowpid 21 hours agoprevI think, the CRA might create an incentive for companies not free loading Open Source Software but instead putting money in the open source eco system (though mainly on Security) and that is somehow great! reply xondono 20 hours agoparentI very much doubt it, and it’s probably going to do the opposite. CRA just brings the kind paperwork that physical products have always had to be licensed in the EU (CE marking) to software. Have you seen european companies investing in Open source hardware? The path of least resistance will be to use homegrown alternatives and sell them to potential investors and shareholders as valuable intellectual property that puts them ahead of competitors. Not only because that makes perfect business sense, but because this kind of IP is very hard to value fairly, so it will allow for a variety of accounting and tax avoidance shenanigans. reply snowpid 20 hours agorootparentFor a useful comparison you need to show if open source hardware is more common / more invested in other parts of the world. E. G. Risc V has a growing momentum https://riscv.org/blog/2023/07/the-growing-momentum-of-risc-... reply riffraff 16 hours agorootparentprev> Have you seen european companies investing in Open source hardware? Arduino and RepRap are poster children of open source hardware, and originated in the EU, I think. reply demondemidi 19 hours agorootparentprevReally? Specific security requirements for iot devices “have always” been in existence? I’d really like to know the source for that. I sound snarky because I work in security and am unfamiliar with what you describe. I could also not be very good at my job. reply rcxdude 18 hours agorootparentI think they were speaking more generally: the requirements in the legislation are similar in structure to the kind of safety/serviceability requirements that already exist for hardware being sold in the EU (much of which is just self-certifying you have implemented the relevant standards). Having security requirements and applying them to pure software products is what's new. reply hcfman 14 hours agorootparentprevOne more of the reasons I don’t make hardware. reply hyperpape 20 hours agoparentprevYou haven't given any mechanism that would make this happen. Specifically, some reason that the company would see contributing be beneficial to it. Of course, it benefits from the existence of open-source as a whole, but what material difference does its contribution make? Take a small-medium sized business (say 5 - 50€ million annual revenue). Perhaps it can fund one library that is critical to it, but no contribution it makes will make a material difference to the trajectory of major products like Linux, or Python. reply Certhas 20 hours agorootparentThe mechanism is clear: If you use Open Source software commercially, you are now liable if the software misbehaves. Thus, you have an incentive to make sure the software is correct. For (A)GPL software, you have to publish your contributions. Not a lawyer, but it also seems to me that if you are a small shop, you might decide to pay, e.g. RedHat for taking on the liability. RedHat can pool these resources to make sure their software behaves as advertised. reply hightrix 14 hours agorootparent> If you use Open Source software commercially, you are now liable if the software misbehaves. Thus, you have an incentive to make sure the software is correct. As a software developer at a non-tech firm, I can gaurantee this means we will not be able to use any open source software. If we are granted an exception, it will be such that we must maintain a private version of the open source software. This is simply a no-go for many companies of all sizes. The risk associated here is not something many (any?) legal department will be willing to take on. reply Certhas 10 hours agorootparentYou just ignored the second part of my message? If your company is not willing to pay someone (another company ) for making sure the open source software used is actually working properly (and for assuming liability if it doesn't), then it can't use open source software. But then, what does open source lose when losing for profit users that are not willing to contribute back? reply hcfman 14 hours agorootparentprevWhat is due to some health condition they are incapable of fixing it anymore. Tough! Now the law is discriminating against old people because the risk of health deterioration is higher. Let me guess, tough. Old people shouldn’t be programming anyway and they don’t deserve to earn anything with it. reply pabs3 18 hours agorootparentprev(A)GPL don't require publication, just giving code to your users, who may or may not elect to further distribute the code. reply hcfman 14 hours agorootparentprevWith a fifteen million euro penalty if you don’t. Yeah nice. If only we could also make fifteen million euros. That’s clear. reply snowpid 20 hours agorootparentprevOf course, an SME company will not hire a developer to constantly perform security checks and apply patches for an important library libImportant. What will happen is that company A will hire company B to do this and assume liability for it. If we set the annual cost of this at 100k, the monthly cost is about 8333 EUR. Let's say company B has 20 customers to protect the security of libImportant, that is 416 EUR per month and SME can afford that. There are OS that are of course used more frequently and that scales much better (i.e. cheaper per month). I actually see a new market niche here and perhaps they will find resourceful entrepreneurs. reply bluGill 20 hours agorootparentOnly if there are enough companies interested in the project. Will company B support cppcheck like that? I prefer kde to gnome, but my company won't pay for kde support when gnome already comes from some contract they have - at least kde is large enough that I expect someone to offer support - there are other desktops that are not popular and now have even less hope of breaking in. reply FredPret 16 hours agorootparentprevEntrepreneurs are meant to solve real problems, not self-inflicted bureaucratic ones. reply bluGill 20 hours agorootparentprevMost users of open source don't really care to make a difference to the trajectory. Someone else made the linux drivers I need, that is good enough for me. For linux you will probably be able to buy a certified Linux distribution for similar costs to Windows which is affordable to a medium sized company that needs certification. However that will only cover your basic OS: linux, ls, basic gnome desktop (but not many applications, just the window manager, a file management, and email client) - probably not a web browser. However there are a lot of small projects that are not popular enough for anyone to certify like that. reply hcfman 21 hours agoparentprevVery optimistic. Call me a cynic. reply snowpid 21 hours agorootparentso what would happen instead? The only alternative is using close source (which does have disadvantage, being not cheaper etc.), reply pjc50 20 hours agorootparentAs with CE marking: there's very little enforcement, so people would carry on downloading solutions from outside the EU and ignoring the rules. See the entire Aliexpress market. reply narag 20 hours agorootparentprevOutsourcing any function that needs software outside the EU. reply lars_francke 20 hours agorootparentThe CRA still applies as soon as it is first brought onto the EU market. It might just be the distributor or importer having to do some things instead of the manufacturer. reply narag 20 hours agorootparentI mean the software is never used inside the EU. The final product is built outside and later imported, so you don't know what software was used. An example: EU is approving very restrictive legislation about pesticides for use inside the EU but it happily allows importing food grown in other countries using the very same forbidden substances. reply lars_francke 14 hours agorootparentIf you import a product the CRA applies. And I personally think that's a good thing reply snowpid 18 hours agorootparentprevstill CRA applies. reply FredPret 16 hours agorootparentThis is the weirdest form of colonization. In bygone days, we had to accept European monarchs; now we have to live with the diktats of their bureaucrats. reply narag 15 hours agorootparentprevMaybe you're misunderstanding what I said. Otherwise it would be ridiculous. If I buy a screw made in the USA, no EU authority can know what's the software used in the machine tool. They can control physical properties, packaging, information... but the process used is opaque. reply snowpid 20 hours agorootparentprevMoving out your business out of EU is somehow a non solution. reply bluGill 20 hours agorootparentIf you live in the EU it is hard to move. You have to find a country that will let you in. Most countries restrict immigration and so you are likely to only file a country that is dangerous to live in. You also leave your friends and extended family behind, which is difficult. That assumes it is your company to move in the first place. Which is unlikely. So add find a new job to the list of things you need to do. reply narag 20 hours agorootparentprevI didn't say it's a solution. reply orwin 21 hours agoprev> In particular, “digital artisans” using Open Source software at small scale – the main concern of Debian – will need guidance from the European Commission. Sadly I don't think it will move, the commission doesn't want to weaken the legislation because they don't want to much discrepancy between member states. It will once again be up to individual countries to set up this law with their own interpretation. In my experience with Rgpd, the watchdogs in at least 3 countries (France, Italy, Germany) are extremely helpful in navigating regulations, especially if you are incidentally its target (As a PaaS that hosted health data, we were). I understand that this is both unclear, unknowable and a pretty huge risk (not really factually, but it feels like one): I'm not saying Debian people are wrong to want to clarify, I'm not saying people should take this as a victory, or that EU is perfect : I'm just saying that as a complex federation, with current rules, this law will probably be the best we will get, and sadly, local 'forgiveness' and loose execution is the only thing you can count on. Because in the EU eyes, the law being loose is way, way worse than the local executive power being loose. reply robertlagrant 20 hours agoparent> the watchdogs in at least 3 countries (France, Italy, Germany) are extremely helpful in navigating regulations This is a bad dependency to have. For example, for the new EU medical device regulation, IVDR, a lot of the regulatory infrastructure just isn't ready[0], and many bodies are bowing out due to the complexity. Ironically, the British Standards Institute is one of the few notified bodies to take it on! And that's medical devices, which are a tighter form of software. Regulating software in general seems like a very difficult task. [0] https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/cclm-2021-097... reply WA 12 hours agorootparentI still wonder who enforces the MDR if a company from outside the EU offers their app/software to EU citizens without any certification. There are quite a few health apps that are considered medical devices under MDR, but not in other countries. The EU companies must comply with the regulations, but nobody seems to be responsible for removing non-certified apps made by non-EU companies. That is a huge competitive disadvantage for EU companies. reply orwin 18 hours agorootparentprevYes, I think I was unclear: depending on local governmental watchdogs/agencies goodwill isn't a good solution. It's the one EU choose however. It's weird for Anglo countries, or countries with the Anglo law system, where the legislation might have holes and weak points, but decree and case law fill those holes (the French system work like that too). EU can't do that because it's a federation of countries with different culture and interest. Again, not saying it's good, I'm saying that's how it works. reply mistrial9 19 hours agoprev [–] there are improvements but please, the implementations are the test.

    "originBody": "Mining stakes — Over 2 percent of the US’s electricity generation now goes to bitcoin US government tracking the energy implications of booming bitcoin mining in US. John Timmer - 2/2/2024, 6:52 PM Enlarge / It takes a lot of energy to keep pumping out more bitcoins. Andriy Onufriyenko reader comments 162 What exactly is bitcoin mining doing to the electric grid? In the last few years, the US has seen a boom in cryptocurrency mining, and the government is now trying to track exactly what that means for the consumption of electricity. While its analysis is preliminary, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) estimates that large-scale cryptocurrency operations are now consuming over 2 percent of the US's electricity. That's roughly the equivalent of having added an additional state to the grid over just the last three years. Follow the megawatts While there is some small-scale mining that goes on with personal computers and small rigs, most cryptocurrency mining has moved to large collections of specialized hardware. While this hardware can be pricy compared to personal computers, the main cost for these operations is electricity use, so the miners will tend to move to places with low electricity rates. The EIA report notes that, in the wake of a crackdown on cryptocurrency in China, a lot of that movement has involved relocation to the US, where keeping electricity prices low has generally been a policy priority. One independent estimate made by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance had the US as the home of just over 3 percent of the global bitcoin mining at the start of 2020. By the start of 2022, that figure was nearly 38 percent. The Cambridge Center also estimates the global electricity use of all bitcoin mining, so it's possible to multiply that by the US's percentage and come up with an estimate for the amount of electricity that boom has consumed. Because of the uncertainties in these estimates, the number could be anywhere from 25 to 91 Terawatt-hours. Even the low end of that range would mean bitcoin mining is now using the equivalent of Utah's electricity consumption (the high end is roughly Washington's), which has significant implications for the electric grid as a whole. So, the EIA decided it needed a better grip on what was going on. To get that, it went through trade publications, financial reports, news articles, and congressional investigation reports to identify as many bitcoin mining operations as it could. With 137 facilities identified, it then inquired about the power supply needed to operate them at full capacity, receiving answers for 101 of those facilities. Advertisement If running all-out, those 101 facilities would consume 2.3 percent of the US's average power demand. That places them on the high side of the Cambridge Center estimates. Finding power-ups The mining operations fall in two major clusters: one in Texas, and one extending from western New York down the Appalachians to southern Georgia. While there are additional ones scattered throughout the US, these are the major sites. The EIA has also found some instances where the operations moved in near underutilized power plants and sent generation soaring again. Tracking the history of five of these plants showed that generation had fallen steadily from 2015 to 2020, reaching a low where they collectively produced just half a Terawatt-hour. Miners moving in nearby tripled production in just a year and has seen it rise to over 2 Terawatt-hours in 2022. Enlarge / Power plants near bitcoin mining operations have seen generation surge over the last two years. US EIA These are almost certainly fossil fuel plants that might be reasonable candidates for retirement if it weren't for their use to supply bitcoin miners. So, these miners are contributing to all of the health and climate problems associated with the continued use of fossil fuels. The EIA also found a number of strategies that miners used to keep their power costs low. In one case, they moved into a former aluminum smelting facility in Texas to take advantage of its capacious connections to the grid. In another, they put a facility next to a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania and set up a direct connection to the plant. The EIA also found cases where miners moved near natural gas fields that produced waste methane that would otherwise have been burned off. Since bitcoin mining is the antithesis of an essential activity, several mining operations have signed up for demand-response programs, where they agree to take their operations offline if electricity demand is likely to exceed generating capacity in return for compensation by the grid operator. It has been widely reported that one facility in Texas—the one at the former aluminum smelter site—earned over $30 million by shutting down during a heat wave in 2023. To better understand the implications of this major new drain on the US electric grid, the EIA will be performing monthly analyses of bitcoin operations during the first half of 2024. But based on these initial numbers, it's clear that the relocation of so many mining operations to the US will significantly hinder efforts to bring the US's electric grid to carbon neutrality. reader comments 162 John Timmer John is Ars Technica's science editor.

Bollocks! Unlike other technologies that are incentivized to become more efficient over time, because of how competition over mining rewards works, this technology has the characteristic of consuming more and more energy the more it succeeds. It's designed to waste energy. Even if that was \"green\" energy, it's still just making heat out of electricity for pretend internet money. Energy that other things could be using. reply danhak 14 hours agoparentA crypto enthusiast friend once made that argument to me and it was so baffling. By this logic, we should all leave our lights and air conditioners on while we're at work or on vacation because it will increase demand and hasten the transition to renewables. reply nightski 14 hours agorootparentI'm no crypto enthusiast, but that's not the same argument. You are not moving demand to physical proximity of the renewables in that case, whereas miners claim they can. reply arcticbull 13 hours agorootparentThe correct answer is to connect the energy source to the grid or to do something useful with it at the point of generation. If it's being consumed instead to guess random numbers the economic incentive to do something useful with it is suppressed. reply wkat4242 12 hours agorootparentMiners don't really want to use energy only when it's at a surplus though. Because the equipment is expensive and due to the difficulty increasing it's only viable a short time. So this is an argument that also doesn't really fly (and draws attention to another issue; the e-waste) reply foobarian 13 hours agorootparentprevOn the flipside if all resistive load heaters came with a BTC miner they could get some additional utility from the energy. reply arcticbull 13 hours agorootparentSure, but the gotcha there is that we shouldn't be using resistive load heaters, they're only 100% efficient. Heat pumps are several hundred percent efficient - 300-600% in fact. Whereas resistive heaters convert electricity into heat directly, heat pumps use energy to move heat against a temperature gradient. The idea that you can be paid to waste this power just creates economic incentives against the improvements we actually need to be making. reply danhak 14 hours agorootparentprevFriend in question was mining bitcoin out of his NYC co-op apartment on a master electricity meter. reply yrral 13 hours agorootparentprevLeaving stuff on when you are away is completely different than how bitcoin mining demand response works. Firstly, at regular electricity prices, bitcoin mining is profitable and it is profitable for the utility to run renewables (which in turn means it is/was profitable to build renewables). When there is substantial demand or low supply, then it is profitable for the utility to pay the bitcoin miners to turn off, because the alternative to import power is more expensive. This in turn makes your electricity cheaper. In addition, the additional steady state demand for power allows for more renewables to be built, which further increases the supply during low supply periods. Your AC does not automatically turn off when this happens. I am one of those enthusiasts making \"strange logic\" claims. I've been making this claim well before others but I feel that I keep getting downvoted on them off of people's emotion rather than rational logic. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has altered the environmental impact of additional electricity consumption. Where once any increase in consumption was considered harmful due to its reliance on fossil fuels, the rise of renewables introduces scenarios where the marginal environmental cost of electricity can be beneficial if the demand is flexible. Bitcoin mining has the potential to act as a load balancer for the electricity grid. By increasing its energy consumption during periods when renewable energy production exceeds demand, and reducing consumption during peak demand periods, Bitcoin mining could help stabilize the grid and make renewable energy generation more economically viable. Bitcoin mining's demand for electricity is unique in that it is primarily cost-driven. Renewable energy generation capacity is particularly volatile. Bitcoin mining power usage can be flexible and responsive to the availability and cost of electricity. The ability of Bitcoin mining to consume excess renewable energy when it's available (and potentially at low or negative prices) could improve the financial viability of renewable energy projects by increasing the floor price these new projects can sell electricity at. This can encourage the development of additional renewable energy capacity by providing a reliable demand for their output during otherwise unprofitable periods.

In other words: your scenario is identical to GP's except that someone is paying you to run your AC while you aren't at home, rather than just doing it because you can. The logical question is then to ask why they're paying you to run your AC, and that is the uncompelling part: it's not clear that we should be paying people to burn energy to crack hashes. reply wharvle 13 hours agorootparentPeople’d find it outrageous if beanie baby collectors were sacrificing 2% of US food production on altars to their beanie babies, because doing so made the beanie babies more valuable to other collectors.

Maybe most people. reply ruined 13 hours agorootparentprevand this is where it comes to a point: what can you possibly change about the world to deincentivize that, and make it uninteresting? if you want a transition away from carbon, you have to solve that question. reply p1mrx 13 hours agorootparent> what can you possibly change about the world to deincentivize that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fee_and_dividend This would remove the incentive to mine crypto on any grid that is coincidentally emitting carbon. reply jonahbenton 12 hours agorootparentprevThe why requires a few steps. Money is just another technology. As a technology it has existed in various forms over thousands of years. Technologies see continual innovation and change, with various actors and various motives influencing their use, function, reach. Governments of various forms are our current best method- govern-ance- for managing human-scale assets, resources, and technologies with collective purpose and implication. Moneys- currencies- as a technology are one of those human assets owned and managed by governments, like land, and other resources. There are over 200 distinct currencies in the world. The mechanism for this management is based on the notion of a ledger- the record of balances, of debts, of interest, and the creation- inflation- of money supply in the context of that management. Most governments are poor at this management when measured by how well their implementation of this technology that is money serves the needs of most of their populations. Governments themselves- both \"democratic\" and non- in their current form are fragile and vulnerable, with the powers of governments utilized against portions of theirs and other populations. BTC is a technology, a cryptographically-secured system of record- a ledger- that can be used as a money. It is not under the control of an existing government. By collective agreement of its participants, a complex balance of users playing different roles with different incentives and risks, the rate of creation of assets recorded there is managed to a low level of inflation. As such, as a technology utilized for money, it is a stable \"store of value\" in contrast to the moneys supplied by literally every government. The ledger, the system of record can be preserved- secured- if and only if it is too expensive for attackers to change it. The turning of energy into hash minting is the security for that system of record. That's it. Adopting a mindset where the above argument takes hold involves a kind of leap of faith. It is a belief. Sure, a religion. The game theory/mechanism design behind BTC is a true innovation, the first demonstrated solution to the Byzantine Generals problem. There is an argument- won't people stop believing in it? Maybe? I would suggest evaluating that argument against the lifespans of other innovative beliefs. Is it something that comes and goes, or is it like the eye, an invention of evolution that solves a specific problem and appears distinctly and repeatedly in different organisms once they hit certain levels of complexity. Cheers. reply lolc 1 hour agorootparentOne thing I don't get about the \"store of value\" belief in Bitcoin is: why specifically this chain? It has only network effects going for it. Mindshare is a fickle thing. reply thereisnospork 13 hours agorootparentprev> it's not clear that we should be paying people to burn energy to crack hashes.

Bid for the mining rights (in USD or BTC). reply randomNumber7 13 hours agorootparentThe point of bitcoin is, that you would need to burn the same amount of energy to fake the blockchain. Im not saying this is good, but its the way it works... reply yrral 13 hours agorootparentprevI'm not arguing whether the use of electricity is compelling or not. I'm arguing that the unique energy demand characteristics of bitcoin mining allow it to support building renewable energy projects and balance electricity costs and thus it has effective positive contribution to the environment. Whether it's used to mine bitcoins or cool a house is irrelevant, except that the demand for cooling a house is location and time sensitive, whereas bitcoin mining is cost sensitive. This flexible consumption gives it unique properties that support deployment of renewables. Please explain what you mean by \"false economy\". Is the economy for skins in a game you don't care about \"false\" because you don't like that game? reply woodruffw 13 hours agorootparent> except that the demand for cooling a house is location and time sensitive Not if someone paid me to do it. That's the point. If there was money in hauling ACs around the US and running them on the cheapest electricity the local market could provide, we'd have exactly the same false economy. (Besides: the GP points out that Bitcoin appears to be sufficiently profitable on NYC electricity prices, which are not cheap. They also appear to be sufficiently profitable on \"retiring coal plant\" prices[1], which undermines any kind of unique incentivization of renewals argument.) [1]: https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2023/12/05/c... reply ianai 12 hours agorootparentI think the underlying argument also misses the “willingness to pay” on at least a couple parts of the transaction. Specifically assuming the grid provider is going to pay you to use their electricity. (Transmission is still costly and maybe turning off capacity is a better option.) Further, missing the core “willingness to pay” for btc or any other cryptocurrency. Gold worked as a currency as it was independently verifiable from either side of a transaction. Modern currencies work so long as they’re backed by credible assurances of their value. Ie passing off fakes is dangerous and they may be used as “legal tender.” (That term could itself be further defined via google.) crypto currencies seem to lack this functionality. (Not wanting to abide by any law outside core network mechanics is functionally close to establishing a new form of sovereignty. Only sovereignty doesn’t work like that.) Also note how hyperinflation is dangerous to the assurance of value of a currency. Similarly, any form of instability could shake those assurances. Modern currency is also almost trivially, embarrassingly parallel. reply lostlogin 13 hours agorootparentprevWould you say that bitcoin mining is good for the environment? reply alchemist1e9 13 hours agorootparentBitcoin mining is not just an economic activity but a catalyst for innovation in renewable energy. By inherently seeking the most cost-effective power sources to maximize profitability, Bitcoin miners are driving the demand for, and thus the development of, cheap, renewable energy worldwide. This process aligns perfectly with the goal of expanding humanity’s energy supply, a necessity for continued growth and technological advancement. The decentralized, uncensored nature of Bitcoin provides invaluable financial infrastructure on a global scale, while simultaneously incentivizing the energy sector towards efficiency and sustainability. Viewing Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption as a problem overlooks the broader benefit: it acts as a buffer in energy markets, ensuring there’s always an incentive to increase supply and reduce costs. Criticisms focusing on environmental impacts should address the real issue—regulating harmful energy sources—not curbing the innovative push for more and cheaper energy that Bitcoin mining embodies. Condemning Bitcoin’s energy use echoes failed collectivist approaches, ignoring the potential for positive, market-driven environmental and economic outcomes. reply tsimionescu 12 hours agorootparentThere is a finite amount of energy though, so even if it would be optimal to have infinite supply, we can't. And even if that weren't the case, your argument still makes no sense. Every watt that Bitcoin mining incentivizes is then consumed on Bitcoin mining, it's a zero sum game. It's like building heaters in the desert: if you're willing to spend money for 1GW of electricity to run your heater, someone will build a 1GW plant for you. Now there is nominally one more 1GW plant in the world, but there is 0 extra available power, you're using up all of it to heat the desert. reply alchemist1e9 12 hours agorootparentYour argument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of both energy markets and the role of Bitcoin in the modern economy. Asserting there’s a ‘finite’ amount of energy oversimplifies the issue and ignores the capacity for human ingenuity to tap into ever-more efficient and renewable energy sources. The notion of energy being a zero-sum game is a defeatist and static view that hampers progress. Bitcoin mining, far from the wasteful ‘heating the desert’ analogy you propose, incentivizes the development of excess energy infrastructure that can be redirected or scaled based on demand fluctuations, acting as a catalyst for innovation in energy production and management. Moreover, your argument smacks of a dangerous ‘divide the cake’ mentality, suggesting we should cap our aspirations and limit access to energy and technological advancement to maintain a status quo. Should we tell emerging economies that they must forego the benefits of modern technology because we’ve decided there’s simply no more room for energy growth? That’s not only patronizing but inherently regressive. The beauty of Bitcoin and its underlying energy consumption is that it encourages the search for more efficient, cost-effective, and often greener energy solutions. This is not about wasting resources; it’s about driving forward a future where energy is more abundant, accessible, and sustainable for all. To stifle this under the guise of protecting resources is to deny the very essence of human progress and innovation. reply jcranmer 11 hours agorootparent> ignores the capacity for human ingenuity to tap into ever-more efficient and renewable energy sources > Bitcoin mining, far from the wasteful ‘heating the desert’ analogy you propose, incentivizes the development of excess energy infrastructure that can be redirected or scaled based on demand fluctuations, acting as a catalyst for innovation in energy production and management. You do realize that the article here is directly pointing to evidence that the bulk of large bitcoin mining operations are being driven from existing fossil fuel plants that seemed to be on their way to decommissioning? This is what I don't like about your argument: it's a standard Bitcoin talking point, but people struggle to point to actual examples of Bitcoin mining spurring investment in renewable energy, while it's easy to point to actual examples of Bitcoin mining spurring investment in decommissioned/decommissioning fossil fuel power plants. The facts on the ground just do not support your argument, period. reply alchemist1e9 11 hours agorootparentYes I am aware of the propaganda article contents. Blaming Bitcoin for enabling these fossil fuel plants to continue is a red herring that distracts from the real issues: ineffective global energy policies and the threat Bitcoin poses to centralized financial systems. It’s easier for governments and critics to scapegoat Bitcoin than to admit their failure in promoting renewable energy or to face the uncomfortable truth that Bitcoin challenges their control over monetary policies. The narrative that Bitcoin only supports dirty energy is a convenient oversimplification, ignoring the broader economic incentives at play and the potential for technological innovation to drive a shift toward renewable energy sources. Let’s not mistake symptom for cause; the focus should be on fixing flawed energy policies, not demonizing a technology pushing for decentralization and innovation. reply lostlogin 11 hours agorootparentI’m still stuck on the first bit; you seem to sincerely believe that bitcoin is good for the environment, whilst also acknowledging it’s mainly powered by coal. One can justify all sorts or environmental destruction with this your argument. Pouring oil on the beach is pushing local regulators to act, spurring the creation of less harmful lubricants. The numbers show bitcoin mining is doing harm. reply alchemist1e9 10 hours agorootparentComparing Bitcoin mining to pouring oil on the beach is intellectually lazy. Bitcoin incentivizes the search for the cheapest energy, which increasingly means renewable. Unlike oil spills, Bitcoin’s ‘harm’ is driving a real search for energy innovation, not just cleanup. Moreover, it’s serving a crucial economic function, providing a decentralized financial system that aligns incentives with human progress. Trivializing such a groundbreaking innovation overlooks the broader benefits it offers in terms of both economic freedom and the push towards sustainable energy solutions. reply lostlogin 9 hours agorootparentThe energy isn’t making anything and it’s causing harm mining due to its vast energy usage. Buzz words and greenwashing don’t change that. Scrounging for the cheapest power source doesn’t make it special, everyone wants cheap energy. We have money whether or not you mine crypto and time will tell whether or not its groundbreaking innovations free us. So far it’s been scams, hacks, failures and waste. Let’s see what happens next. reply alchemist1e9 6 hours agorootparentYour dismissal of Bitcoin as mere ‘buzzwords and greenwashing’ overlooks its tangible achievements and real-world impact. Bitcoin is not about ‘scrounging for cheap energy’; it’s about fostering a decentralized financial system with over 100 million users worldwide and a market cap surpassing $900 billion. Beyond finance, Bitcoin’s transparent, immutable ledger offers unparalleled resistance to fraud, censorship, and corruption. Its technological innovations, like the Lightning Network and Taproot, are pioneering advancements in cryptography, economics, and beyond. With an uptime of 99.98% and a network secured by a record-high hashrate, Bitcoin’s resilience and reliability are indisputable. Dismissing it as scams, hacks, and failures not only ignores these significant contributions but also trivializes the global movement towards financial sovereignty and innovation. The real waste is in failing to recognize Bitcoin’s value and potential in driving forward not just financial, but societal progress. reply jcranmer 13 hours agorootparentprevThe issue with your argument is there's no real evidence that Bitcoin mining is spurring investment in renewable power plants, and quite a bit of evidence that it is deterring disinvestment in dirty power plants. Furthermore, the links you point to start out by talking about how Bitcoin miners are being paid to not mine. It's actually rather more like \"we'll rapaciously use energy to bring the grid to its utmost limits, but don't worry, if you pay us lots of money [in some cases, more than we get from our regular business!], we'll happily not use quite enough to actually cause it to buckle and fail.\" Sounds like an extortion racket, doesn't it? reply tsimionescu 13 hours agorootparentprev> Where once any increase in consumption was considered harmful due to its reliance on fossil fuels, the rise of renewables introduces scenarios where the marginal environmental cost of electricity can be beneficial if the demand is flexible. This is a major flawed assumption. Even in a 100% renewable world, every extra watt consumed carries an environmental cost. It is of course less than when burning fossil fuels, but it's still there, and not necessarily even that small. > The ability of Bitcoin mining to consume excess renewable energy when it's available (and potentially at low or negative prices) could improve the financial viability of renewable energy projects by increasing the floor price these new projects can sell electricity at. The world has not run out of useful things to do with energy yet, so this is already a bizarre claim. But even ignoring the uselessness of Bitcoin for a moment, this clearly incentivizes the wrong kind of renewable development. If you need to turn your power to Bitcoin to be profitable, that means you can't afford to store this power even as the technology to do that improves. And if you can't store the power, then you can't be part of a fully renewable grid, so you're essentially building the wrong thing and it's better to leave the resources alone to be used in other projects that can actually be self sustaining. reply arp242 12 hours agorootparentprev> Bitcoin mining has the potential to act as a load balancer for the electricity grid.

New bitcoin from mining is halved every ~4 years, so every four years miners can afford to spend only half as much electricity to mine from that revenue. As revenue from new bitcoins tapers off the work expended will self limit to the value of transactions. If you're charged 1% to include your transaction the value of energy used to mine a block will eventually not exceed the fee for including those transactions. So it doesn't have the characteristic of consuming more and more energy and is self-limiting in how much energy is used. The bitcoin energy problem will take care of itself in time. reply arcticbull 13 hours agorootparent> New bitcoin from mining is halved every ~4 years, so every four years miners can afford to spend only half as much electricity to mine from that revenue. Not exactly. Miners are paid out of the sum of block reward and fees multiplied by the market price of BTC. Every ~4 years the contribution of block reward goes down, but that doesn't mean that the price goes down, or that the contribution of fees stays the same. If it was block reward alone and the \"energy problem solved itself\" then the blockchain would be completely vulnerable to a 51% attack and it would instantly become worthless. The expectation is that the contribution of fees will go up as the block reward goes down, although it remains to be seen how much direct fee the market will bear. Currently the actual cost of a BTC transaction is hundreds of dollars - but most of it is socialized via inflation. It is unclear if the market will bear paying hundreds of dollars in transaction costs instead -- and if not, there's no reason the 21M coin limit can't be raised to continue doing exactly what has been happening so far. reply RealityVoid 13 hours agorootparent> Currently the actual cost of a BTC transaction is hundreds of dollars I thought... huh, this can't be right. So I did some back of the napkin math. We have about 2500 transactions in a block, a block reward is 6,25 BTC. That comes around a cost of 0.0025 BTC per block, or about 112USD. That's without considering the extra tip from the transaction. So, not really hundreads, but damn' close. It makes me think increasing the block size really wasn't a bad idea. > there's no reason the 21M coin limit can't be raised to continue doing exactly what has been happening so far.

The Google results for \"how much power data centers use\" show numbers between 1% and 3% (it's similar numbers whether I specify global or just the US). Let's assume that's at least somewhat accurate. If we believe both statistics, then crypto mining uses roughly as much electricity as all data centers. But data centers drive so many different industries and benefit people in countless ways- entertainment (as you mentioned), financial, education, communication, etc, etc. Crypto is like. Neat? There's some people who benefit greatly from it, sure. But broadly compare how different society would look if crypto didn't exist (not different at all, I'd think?) to how different it would look if data centers didn't exist.

Social media is \"move fast and break things\" on a societal scale. Bitcoin is at worst a speculative asset (no worse than most financial assets) at best a new monetary system in its infancy (unlikely but possible). It is clear to me which technology has more of a raison d'être.

My solar system now has a roi of 6-7 years if everything works out. 2 years in the experiment. I am planning to invest mining profits in other environment friendly projects. Here in Germany you only get 8 cents/kW from the state. Mining doubles that. Sometimes even triple. During the ETH run it was even 5 times more. Fun thing 90% of my overproduction still reaches the grid. My mining rig only uses 300 to 600 watts.

Ownership and Security Bitcoin is the only solution to really \"owning\" your money. Everything in your bank account can be stolen / frozen / or made \"inaccessible\" at a moments notice because of some vague bullshit reason like supporting right extremists or terrorists - even if you donate a single dollar - like it happened in in 2023 Canada / freedom convoy. Everything a bank claims to be secure/safe goes away like a poof of smoke if it really comes down to it. The can't be any safety in our increasingly multi-polar world the political boundaries are redefined daily. Today Russia/China is the enemy, tomorrow it's some other country that will suffer economical sanctions. Or your own country decides to apply punitive measures against some minority group because of political opinion - all the control mechanisms are there and politicians are itching to use them. 2. It's less than our current banking sector Yeah, consuming this much natural resources / electricity sucks. That's the alternative? Do you count how much money is spend on the banking spector as a whole? I assure you it consumes much more then the 2% in capital expenditure - so indirectly it's more (you could have build renewables with the same money) . 3. Scalability About the famous argument that bitcoin does not scale: the 7 transaction per second argument -> this problem is completely solved by the lightning network. Lightning protocol does the same with much lower transaction cost and much less energy usage - something like 100x less. Yes support at major vendors is still a bit lagging behind but that's only temporary. Need a 100% confirmation? Do full transaction (for example for accounting purposes). Small sums and personal funds -> can be completely handled by a lightweight lightning network transaction. Bitcoin is a highly technical solution and there are myriad ways things can be improved upon if scalability really becomes an issue - even if the lightning network would become saturated. reply pyinstallwoes 12 hours agoparentprevThat doesn't change the extreme: \"Taken to the extreme it is an accelerated track to causing a black hole given the incentives of the network and the requirement of computational space having a physical necessity to provide the substrate for it to continue.\" reply hmapple 14 hours agoparentprevWhether or not it’s a worthwhile use of energy is certainly debatable, but it’s not exactly “pretend internet money” when you can trade it for billions worth of USD in a single day with minimal slippage reply arcticbull 13 hours agorootparentIt also doesn't really fit the definition of money, certainly not good money, it's a speculative asset or at best a transaction intermediate. Almost nothing is priced in Bitcoin, it's priced in dollars and converted to a Bitcoin quantity at the time a transaction is to proceed due to extreme volatility. There's no closed-loop economy where pricing is so specified - even in El Salvador - because you then have to sell it to pay your suppliers and your taxes. You don't sell money, if that makes sense. Using the fact you can sell it for minimal slippage, you could call Apple shares money, but they're not. They're shares. Nothing is priced in Apple shares. The attributes of money are: durability, portability, divisibility, uniformity, limited supply, and acceptability. Bitcoin is not accepted basically anywhere (the overwhelming majority of places that claim to, use a service like BitPay that immediately sells it and gives the merchant actual money). It's also not uniform, because each sat carries with it the entire transaction history. It's also not particularly portable because its global transaction count is limited to 7tps and it costs an unbelievable quantity to do so from time to time. It's also not durable because everyone keeps losing their wallets and the lost bitcoin is effectively destroyed. All it has is limited supply and divisibility -- and portability, depending how compelling you find my argument against -- but you really do have to get all 6 to win.

A lot of avenues for financial crime become impossible in a post-dollar world, and said world doesn't really introduce any new avenues compared to cash; that's a strict reduction, and therefore a strict reduction in the need for police on that front. There's also a considerable reduction in demand for police to investigate robberies when there's a lot less to rob. Banks get reduced to loan centers and safe deposit boxes, armored trucks moving cash around stop being a thing, nothing in cash registers to steal at gunpoint... yeah, criminals will probably try to commit robberies, but will quickly find out that the reward ain't worth the risk.

Radio. Television. Internet. They all take a lot longer than people realize. 5) There has been plenty of progress. If you want to be closed to that progress and dig your feet in to defending the existing system, that’s fine. But the idea that there hasn’t been “progress in 15 years” is absurd reasoning. reply acdha 7 hours agorootparentThe early internet or web are often used in cryptocurrency sales pitches to excuse the lack of demand, but the comparison falls apart as soon as you learn any of the history. When the internet dawned, computers were incredibly expensive and slow and networks were even worse – but people went to great lengths to get online because it offered something immediately of value which was unrelated to the business of making or selling internet access. By the 1980s, people were paying for connectivity even at telephone monopoly rates because there were things like email, Usenet, IRC, file transfers, etc. which made your life better. When the first TV station opened in the 1920s, ordinary people went to buy sets because it gave them something they’d never had before. In contrast, Bitcoin has been available globally since it launched and it did so in an era where much of the human population had everything they needed to use it - very much unlike the early internet, or radio, or TV. Tons of speculative money poured in hoping to find demand … but nobody really cares about it because for most it’s not better than what they had before. It isn’t cheaper, faster, or safer and it is much less convenient to use, so even the few people who hold it don’t. The few businesses which accepted it have generally reported very little consumer interest and many have stopped. That just isn’t like the demand curve for those other technologies: as soon as Marconi had his first radio telegraph demo, he had businesses and governments interested and the primary limit was the difficulty of making the technology available, not lack of public interest – anyone could see how it could let them do something they couldn’t do before. That last part is key: I’m all for changes to the financial system, I’ve followed this space since David Chaum was writing in the 90s, but you have to base it on an advantage over the status quo. The problem is not just that they picked an unsuitable data structure but also that it became the community identity, preventing attempts to learn from the mistake. reply davidcbc 13 hours agorootparentprevBut it's not an alternative to the financial system, outside of crime in order to do anything useful with it you have to move it back into the existing financial system. reply happytiger 12 hours agorootparentI literally just answered the question about energy use. Crypto could arguably become a potential alternative financial system. Bitcoin by itself is not. Crime is primarily conducted in USD (by volume). The purpose of financial compliance is not to eliminate crime but to manage it, and arguably the techniques we have used to create exclusionary financial systems have done more harm than good (better the terrorist you know in your financial system than the terrorist who doesn’t even use your financial system that you don’t have any awareness of, aka. The Patriot Act missed the mark). Further, the existing system is working about as well as the war on drugs. Every recommendation I have read is to find ways to shore it up, rather than find new ways to conduct financial crimes oversight, and the primary recommendation for the resulting inevitable escalation is to build a gigantic skynet of information sharing that looks an awful lot like surveillance capitalism. https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/... I personally view Bitcoin as a runaway proof-of-concept. It’s rather insane how successful it’s become considering how it got started. If we look at it from a product / market fit perspective, there is clearly a product / market fit. And that’s in the face of the intact existing financial system, Visa’s volume, the USD, etc. That’s probably a point worth considering. reply johnfernow 12 hours agorootparentprevThe difference is that the existing financial system is used by about 3/4 of the world population (closer to 94% in developed nations) for the exchange of actual goods and services. Bitcoin has significantly fewer users, but more importantly it is almost never used for the actual exchange of goods or services. With my bank (and the accompanying infrastructure that goes along with it), my employer can deposit directly into my account, which I can then use to pay rent online (as opposed to physically traveling to their office), buy groceries at the store, and purchase nearly every legal good or service that is for sale, all while reducing the odds of me being robbed or losing money (e.g. losing my wallet.) If someone or some business scams me, I'm given methods of retrieving my money without confronting them in person. It also allows me to autopay all my bills so I'm never charged for forgetting to pay (and frankly I have very little desire to write and mail several checks each month or travel to various places to pay in cash.) Credit cards, debit cards, direct deposit and money transfers are far more convenient than using cash, and aside from convenience, I imagine they decrease a nation's carbon footprint over using exclusively cash (due to less need to mint, print and transport physical currency, as well as travel in person to pay or receive payment.) They do come at a cost of privacy, but if I wanted privacy for a specific purchase, I can still use cash for those specific transactions. While it may have a higher carbon footprint than digital payments, overall ink and paper tend to have low carbon footprints (though it's probably a bit higher for currency than it is for standard A4 paper.) Still, it's near certainly less carbon intensive than Bitcoin (per purchase, maybe not in total since billions of people actually use paper currency to buy things at least sometimes.) Cryptocurrencies and their accompanying anonymity can bring about good things, so I'm open to at least considering their value — there are countries with authoritarian and oppressive governments, and there have been several democracies that have fallen to dictatorship before and that very well could happen again in the future. As such, being able to anonymously transfer money does have its value, especially in a world with CCTVs and facial recognition. Cryptocurrencies, of course, also can be used for illegal services that are near universally considered immoral and evil. Currently, in most countries (even ones that aren't exactly liberal democracies), this is likely a much larger harm. Balancing freedom from and freedom to is always tricky: neither authoritarianism nor anarchy are appealing — allowing personal freedom while preventing people from encroaching on other people's personal freedoms is difficult to achieve. However, even if I were fully convinced that cryptocurrencies currencies were a net positive on society (open to considering the idea but definitely not convinced yet), I struggle to see how one with such a large carbon footprint is what should be used. reply adamrezich 13 hours agoparentprevyou really think that every credit card reader in the country, every ATM, every computer and piece of electronics at every branch of every bank, and all of Wall Street and everything, adds up to less than the sum total of Bitcoin mining in the country, in terms of energy usage? how could this possibly be the case? I'm not even a Bitcoin guy and this is absurd on its face. reply jcranmer 12 hours agorootparentYes. This article gives an estimate of about 2% of all electricity usage going to bitcoin mining. All data centers in the country combine to a similar ballpark in energy usage (another comment states 1-3%). Finance accounts for 20% of US GDP, so we'll be charitable, round up its usage of datacenters to 50%, to get about 1% of electricity from financial data centers. There are about 6.7 million employees in the financial sector [1]. Assume everyone has a computer with a 600W power supply at full bore for 12 hours a day [2]. That comes out to about 18 billion kWh of electricity a year, which is (checks math) 0.425% of US electricity consumption [3]. Sure, I'm not accounting for all the PoS systems at every retail location in the country, but they're going to use far less energy than even the overspecced numbers I'm using. So overall, this comes out to about 1.5-2% of US electricity usage going to the financial sector, less than Bitcoin mining. Also remember that magically switching everything over to Bitcoin would still require all those PoS systems, not to mention large fractions of Wall Street and bank branches and whatnot, so this isn't really a fair comparison overall. And some amount of the financial sector includes cryptocurrency companies already. [1] https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag52.htm [2] This basically comes out to a decently powerful computer being used at max spec for an 84 hour work week. A generous overestimate, I'd hope you agree.

If you stripped down Visa or whatever to its bare minimum of just processing online transactions, I'm sure it could do it pretty efficiently.

Depending on the time of day and the type of electric source, power plants have excess power to shed. Miners are better situated than other industries to ramp up and down consumption. Some of the largest bitcoin operators in the US are located near hydroelectric power plants - for parts of the year dams literally have to dump water because the river has to flow but there is not enough power demand - and wholesale rates sometimes even go negative. reply viraptor 13 hours agoparentThis effectively disincentives expanding storage which would benefit everyone. Mining is getting rid of the issue of temporary excess power, so now the power plant needs to do more work overall to keep up with demand during other times. reply HeadsUpHigh 11 hours agorootparentIt incentivizes building excess capacity. All you need is dynamic pricing so miners stop when there is grid demand. Texas is using this approach. reply viraptor 10 hours agorootparentYes, but currently building excess capacity is a problem in itself. We can't install enough green energy production in the time we want, even ignoring the BTC demand. The extra capacity will not be fully carbon neutral and even just putting more generation in place creates negative externalities. Given the options of \"more BTC, more energy production\" and \"no BTC, more energy storage and shifting existing production\", we as humans would be better off with the second scenario. reply HeadsUpHigh 2 hours agorootparentWith mining you can reduce the cost basis of solar significantly. reply balderdash 13 hours agoprevI don’t know how you can have this conversation without talking what the marginal utilization of that energy is - do I care if crypto miners want to mine at night in west Texas when wind is generating energy and the wholesale cost is negative (I.e. there is really no marginal productive use for that generation)?

Absolutely not. This is complicated though because power grids can resell that slack capacity further away if there’s a persistent surplus and other users will notice (e.g. cheap power really incentivizes overnight EV charging or even industrial users expanding). If all of the slack is being used for unproductive purposes, those positive feedback cycles will be delayed – unlike useful work, there’s no end of cycles which bitcoin mining can use so the potential power consumption is effectively infinite. reply cwkoss 6 hours agorootparentAren't resistive losses pretty significant for long distance transmission? reply fbdab103 4 hours agorootparentHVDC is something like 3% per 1000km, so not really that bad.

Until people can find economic uses for, say, the immense solar energy produced in a desert, bitcoin will use it all up because it can be deployed practically anywhere. Likewise anywhere there's excess wasted energy, it will use it. So in that respect, bitcoin finances the construction of energy generation where it is generated the cheapest but may have no other market otherwise due to geographic isolation and transportation.

Otherwise miners are buying cheap energy anywhere they can find it, and using waste energy on the grid, of which there's tons. The idea that they're going to spike demand isn't even correct because mining can scale to any level of power generation. Also mining does not cause emissions, mining simply purchases generated power, and emissions are caused by power generation from non-renewables. If mining is emitting GHGs you could say the same thing about EV cars or any other power consumer. But like I said at least bitcoin as a consumer can be ideally placed ANYWHERE especially where energy is plentiful but not easily used otherwise. > Do note that the article mentions that the largest clusters are in, um, Texas and the Appalachians, and their providers of electricity seem to largely be, uh, natural gas and coal power, respectively.

What it is, is a convenient scapegoat for the anti-crypto mobs to complain about.

Why isn't this the primary concern, and we look at a single industry downstream that is completely independent on how clean the energy it uses, and in fact, is more profitable with renewables as I mentioned in a sibling comment?

If goods are imported from a country without an equivalent (or stronger) carbon tax, then those goods would be subject to a fee at the border. The EU is considering is a system like this, which could be very impactful since they're the 2nd largest economy in the world. If the US, the world's largest economy, also implemented such a system, then there would undoubtedly be a large global impact in reducing emissions. Creating the political will to do so is difficult of course. Citizens' Climate Lobby has been working on trying to pass a carbon fee with a border adjustment since 2007, though unfortunately with increasing political polarization it has been difficult. I wouldn't rule out the possibility though — political change can be very slow in the US, but CCL is clearly a group with extreme patience and a focused goal, but is willing to be pragmatic and advocate for any improvements as opposed to taking nothing. Admittedly I haven't volunteered for them in a quite some time, but in the past (at least at where I was at the time), the people I worked with seemed level headed and goal oriented — they may not have always personally liked the Representatives or staff that they were meeting, but they kept personal opinions to themselves and were laser focused on trying to convince them of joining the Climate Solutions Caucus and sponsoring a carbon fee.

In the text, we see the \"over 2%\" (specifically \"2.3%\") number is based on a survey and the conjecture \"if [those facilities were] running all-out\". But they don't run all-out! The article itself mentions facilities that shut down when grids under peak load. But also, if you click through to the linked US EIA study the article reports about – https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364 – you get the following verbatim undistorted information: \"Our preliminary estimates suggest that annual electricity use from cryptocurrency mining probably represents from 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.\" – that is: not necessarily or truly \"over 2%\" as implied by ArsTechnica's deceptive headline & spin. Perhaps as low as 0.6%! \"In addition, cryptocurrency miners in areas with fluctuating power prices have reduced their electricity use in response to periods of high prices in wholesale power markets, given the sensitivity of their operational profitability to electricity prices.\" \"In practice, cryptocurrency mining facilities frequently run at less than their maximum designed capability.\" Bitcoin mining is specifically drawn to just those times & places where electricity is especially cheap, and stops on a dime the moment rates surge over what's mining-profitable, due to other peaking demand or sagging supply. Thus the strained assumption of always-running-full that's required for the \"over 2%\" headline is false. The EIA reports they \"lack the data to provide a well-sourced estimate\" of actual utilization, but at one point hand-waves a guess \"80%\". I suspect it's even lower, but even at EIA guess: 80% of 2.3% is less than, not \"over\", 2%. Ultimately, though any negative externalities of Bitcoin's energy consumption can and should be addressed by adding our best estimates of the cost of such externalities into the electric rates paid by miners – & all other electricity consumers. That solves not just Bitcoin's externalities – but those of every other energy user. Further, the way proof-of-work mining works, & difficulty adjusts, forces only those with the lowest-cost electricity to be profitable, in the long run. Difficulty rises to erase the profitability of everyone else. And in any sane energy system, the lowest-cost electricity will tend to be from sagging demand at mismatched-generation places & times: excess wind/nuclear/hydro power at night, excess solar power at peak daylight. That is: electricity that isn't (& for the moment couldn't) be used for other things, and is even sometimes sold at negative prices when grid/generation stability requires someone to take the load. In an ideal & rational generation grid, these regional/diurnal cycles could mean tons of electricity – far more than 2% of annual usage, by raw KWh, but not price paid – could be soaked up with countercyclical users like Bitcoin mining. And in so helping with utilities' fixed-costs & demand-smoothing, that consumption would primarily benefit other grid users' costs and reliability. It also provides de facto subsidies to cleaner-but-spikier generation (wind/solar) or cleaner-but-harder-to-adjust generation (nuclear/hydro) – relative to traditional fossil-fuels. That is, no surprisingly high \"X%\" (X\"The best data on IT’s energy and emissions characteristics are closely held proprietary secrets among tech companies, which compounds these problems.\" (2021) \"Does not compute: Avoiding pitfalls assessing the Internet's energy and carbon impacts\", Koomey & Masanet, Joule https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00211-7 Additionally, whenever you see these kind of estimates you really want the data acquisition method applied across the entire sector in a uniform fashion, to avoid someone trying to cook the data a bit in their favor. This is a very common problem in the energy sector, e.g. energy input/cost estimates for building and operating solar/wind/nuclear/gas/etc power plants tend to suffer from this agenda-driven skewing. Thus, you'd also want to see energy use estimates for all the AWS and Google etc data centers (NSA Utah?) side by side with the bitcoin miners and the high-frequency traders and the industrial manufacturing centers and households etc, and then check that the sum of estimates from different sources obtained via the same method islet’s examine the hypocrisy of singling out bitcoin specifically It isn't being singled out though. There's widespread concern across a broad set of cases where energy is being used. Also, if you recognize that the use of energy isn't always bad, but it's the overuse of energy that is problematic, it's natural to prioritize: you want more of the energy usage to be on the more beneficial things and less on the less beneficial things. So you might target bitcoin on its merits, not because of hypocrisy. The problem with your argument is that it means either everything should be addressed simultaneously in any discussion of energy usage or nothing should be, since you can make the same argument no matter what the specific topic is. reply Scarblac 12 hours agoparentprevBecause what we get in return is so incredibly tiny with Bitcoin.

How would you feel if someone bought 2 billion gallons of gasoline just to burn it in the middle of a desert biggest fire humanity has ever seen? reply everfree 13 hours agorootparentI would want to make sure their purchase were taxed at a high enough rate to replace that gasoline with renewable energy, on top of the usual sales taxes. If that were the case, I would tell them to go for it, as their purchase would be a net benefit to society. If the energy used by bitcoin mining is irreplaceable, that just means we're not taxing it enough to replace it properly with renewables. The solution is simple, just tax industrial energy use so that it's not underpriced relative to t",

Over the course of news cycles it paints the picture of a superman not unlike the absurd hyperbole in descriptions of North Korea’s Dear Leader. In the US, I am not sure whether it can be attributed to laziness or to the calculus of the news establishment, but regardless it is poor journalism. reply oooyay 12 hours agoparentIt's an election year. Party constituents eat polarizing rhetoric and outlandish takes like it's a breakfast bar. Journalists are happy to stock that bar. fwiw, it wasn't Biden that created the court it was Merrick Garland: https://www.justice.gov/opcl/redress-data-protection-review-... Also, not exactly a secret given that it had a PR release and the judges are known. Maybe the secret part is getting in front of them. reply smcin 11 hours agorootparentThe court's functioning is absolutely still a secret to its plaintiffs [EU residents]; its location is a secret, the DOJ refuses to say if it has taken a case yet, or when it will. [That implies it has not published any rulings, or maybe it will never publish rulings]. Its decisions will also be kept a secret, from both the EU residents petitioning the court and the federal agencies tasked with following the law. Plaintiffs [EU-residents] are not allowed to appear in person [not even remotely by Zoom, it sounds like?] and are represented by a special advocate, appointed by the U.S. Attorney General. I can't see US citizens being told to just trust a secret European court whose deliberations aren't known, yet affects their lives, visas, travels, finances etc. \"Maybe the secret part is getting in front of them.\" No, they already stated that the EU plaintiffs don't have the right to appear before the court. So they don't get in front of them. On the \"Animal House\" taxonomy of double-secret, it's up there. reply oooyay 11 hours agorootparentI think your points are fair and I largely agree with you, but I'd probably use the word \"opaque\" rather than secretive. Sometimes opaque systems do serve a purpose, other times they're an excuse to undermine rights and liberties. This court deals entirely in classified information (from its mandate) and only produces classified rulings. I linked both of the sources (.gov websites) in another comment. Whether or not that's good enough to remain opaque I don't know. I do know that I'm not a fan of any surveillance state and I'm not confident in the ability of intergovernment watchdogs to spot violations, even gross ones. reply HeatrayEnjoyer 10 hours agorootparentGovernments shouldn't be able to prosecute people with secret evidence and secret processes in secret locations. You can keep your classified materials secret or you can prosecute someone, but you shouldn't be able to do both. Anything else is categorically incompatible with the liberal democratic principles of accountable government. As it's said, \"Put up, or shut up.\" reply nl 10 hours agorootparentI don't think absolute statements like this are useful. There clearly are cases where it is appropriate to prosecute someone with classified evidence. Spying cases are a good example. The problem is that these exemptions are used too often. reply leereeves 10 hours agorootparentprevThis \"court\" doesn't prosecute anyone. It's an internal review board for the intelligence agencies. Its function is (purportedly) to prevent the intelligence agencies from abusing their power. reply kyleee 5 hours agorootparentGreat, so it’s a police department Internal Affairs office on a whole lot of steroids. I’m sure it’s on the up and up reply cqqxo4zV46cp 10 hours agorootparentprevThe thought of US citizens being even for a second treated like how the US government treats non-US-residents is absolutely hilarious. What an utter rude shock. reply leereeves 11 hours agorootparentprev> fwiw, it wasn't Biden that created the court it was Merrick Garland But Merrick Garland is a Biden appointee. Don't you think leaders should be held accountable for the actions of their administration? Of course, as vjulian points out, they aren't masterminding everything that their subordinates do, but they do choose who to appoint and have the power to reverse anything they disapprove of once they learn about it. reply vjulian 10 hours agorootparentYour comment only serves to further illustrate the mystic of the US Office of Dear Leader. To what degree, if at all, did Biden drive the profiling, search, evaluation and selection processes? I feel fairly confident in guessing that you don’t know. Unelected long-tenure “officials” run the US government to a degree that you’re perhaps not appreciating. Journalists not reporting on them or their actions, and instead maintaining a ruse is shoddy and shady. reply oooyay 11 hours agorootparentprev> Don't you think leaders should be held accountable for the actions of their administration? Color me cynical, but people only mutter this when it's someone on the other team. So, in general do I think we should follow that principle? Yes. Do I think people widely believe that enough to hold their own self-interest-adjacent parties accountable? Certainly not. If you want to be very picky, the rule Mr Garland invented was in response to a Biden executive order [1] [2]. The executive order is long, but section 3 is pretty succinct and clear. If Mr Garland implemented an opaque system then I can predict one of two scenarios occurred, maybe both: 1. All of the information the court receives is classified and should never have been leaked in the first place, so no one should know. That means the way someone does know is because of the watchdogs inside the intelligence community. 2. Mr Garland is openly defying the President through process and appeasing someone (maybe the intelligence community). 1: https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/14/2022-22... 2: https://www.state.gov/executive-order-14086-policy-and-proce... reply leereeves 10 hours agorootparentThanks for the link to the executive order. Now that I've read it, I'd say that an opaque system seems to be exactly what Biden wanted. The EO repeatedly says that results and procedures will be \"classified\" and \"consistent with the protection of intelligence sources or methods\". And the complainant not being able to represent themselves is mandated by the EO: \"a special advocate will be selected by the Data Protection Review Court to advocate regarding the complainant's interest in the matter\". reply ThinkBeat 8 hours agoparentprevIn this case I do not understand your point. President Biden created this court via his executive order privilege in October 2022¹. \"\" By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: \"\" Did he write it all. Did he come up with it all. Probably not. If the criteria is that you cannot hold a politician responsible unless he or she has written the laws or orders themselves that they vote on, then no single politician in at least a western democracy can be held responsible for anything. It is their responsibility, as democratically elected representatives, to take responsibility for how they vote, what the sign and whatever orders they are issuing. ¹ https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-14... reply smcin 11 hours agoparentprevYour comment is related to the Politico articled cited, not the actual techdirt article, right? (the techdirt article has 0 named mentions of Biden or Obama, and only one of 'former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page'). Yeah, Politico's use of \"Biden's court... Biden's proposal\" is annoyingly lazy DC shorthand for \"the Biden-era DOJ/DHS/FTC/etc.\" reply vjulian 11 hours agorootparentCorrect. I saw that someone had linked the original article and therefore skipped directly there. reply gsk22 10 hours agoparentprevHow is this a false attribution?

What is the appeals process, and which real federal court does it end up in? reply zerocrates 13 hours agoparentI imagine that since this is an executive-branch \"court,\" the theoretical recourse would be something like the Administrative Procedure Act's general provision for challenging \"agency action.\" Or otherwise, directly filing suit as before. Regardless of the theoretical vehicle, you'd have the same problems in the way of success as prior attempts in the courts have had, where you can't get the information needed to have your claim survive in the first place. reply typeofhuman 8 hours agorootparentLet's hope the Chevron doctrine gets overturned.

Couldn’t he choose judges that would let him spy on his political enemies without blowback? I’m genuinely asking. The Politico article is really fuzzy about the appointments.

We have a Constitution, laws, regulations, etc., but they do not cover every possible situation and, instead, there are holes. (2) New. In particular, things that are new in tech, science, math (even math, e.g., RSA encryption), etc. can create \"situations\" not covered by (1). That is, in principle the \"holes\" were already there and not being exploited or causing problems, but then something \"new\" comes along and, using \"holes,\" creates new situations and new problems. (3) F'get about it. Typically a \"new problem\" has comparatively small effect with only a few people concerned about the effects. Then, usually the attitude is f'get about it. E.g., the \"situation\" may not have common sense, justice, equity, etc. (4) Squeaks and Grease. Yup, \"The wheel that squeaks gets the grease.\" Or, when in some sense the problem is big enough, then it gets attention -- deals, lawsuits, Congress, the Executive Branch, elections, ..., the Constitution. (5) Point. Virginia, here is the point: The \"attention\" in (4) can take big time, money, and effort, e.g., for time, years, maybe decades. In particular, Virginia, if reality is like a boat, even if it is not leaking now, actually, unfortunately it is NOT fully water-tight and in some new weather, situations, can LEAK. What to do? Try to avoid situations where need to depend on justice, good common sense, no holes, no \"leaks\", lawyers, laws, Congress, elections (e.g., politics), the Constitution, etc. reply doublerabbit 11 hours agoprevCan we just get to the point and admit the world, all countries are corrupt and that evil is the entity that's in control?
