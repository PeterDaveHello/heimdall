A product like a smart cane may not be as useful as a regular cane due to issues like cost, the natural wear and tear, and negative impact on usability. Copycat competition could assist in lowering prices, but margins are already low and the market is limited, so it may cause companies to leave the space. Ambidextrous vertical mice like the Penguin mouse have the potential to help people avoid wrist strain. Overall, there is a need for more accessible tech at lower costs, but the industry needs to balance it carefully.Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder are developing a device called the \"MouthPad\" that allows people to control computers and smartphones using their tongue. While primarily targeted at quadriplegics who have lost the ability to use their arms, the researchers also see a wider potential to help people with disorders that diminish their motor skills. By using their tongue to press a sensor on the MouthPad, users can simulate pressing a button on a keyboard or touchscreen. The group said they aim to make the device as affordable as possible, by keeping manufacturing costs down.Augmental's new MouthPad^ input modality enables hands-free digital accessibility via one's tongue and mouth, with applications for people with disabilities and reduced abilities, along with use cases like gaming and mobile computing. The device uses Bluetooth technology, and a USB/wired prototype has been created with gaming latency in mind. Power-saving techniques are being optimized to improve battery life, and the MouthPad^ can be used with alternate control devices like Tobii's eye-tracking glasses. Though training may be required, the tongue muscle can be used for precise movements like inputting text.Researchers have created a device that allows users to operate a computer or head-mounted display with their tongue. This device is aimed at people with full or partial paralysis and motor impairment in their hands, but could also have broader use cases such as keeping your hands on the keyboard while moving the pointer around. The tongue is seen as an ideal input method as it lacks many of the issues that brain-computer interfaces normally bring up, such as the difficulty of inhibiting random electrical signals in the brain. The device is in early stages, as no price is listed, and requires a 3D dental scan to mould it.The MouthPad is a custom-designed device for an initial 3D intraoral dental scan that can be used to navigate smart devices with your mouth; it can be used as a complementary tool to voice-control systems, which can come in handy for people with disabilities. Invisalign and Smile Direct scans might offer similar features but not custom-designed devices. This device uses nRF52840 software and might potentially have general input device applications, use with AR glasses, and subvocalizations recognition with open-source products. The MouthPad also does not affect the user's speech.-Applications for YC Summer 2023 are now open \n-Some commenters express excitement about Kyle Machulis's potential involvement \n-Some irrelevant or crude comments present, but nothing of significant value in the post content",

        "content": "CategoriesENCRYPTION THREATSNEWSGlobal Encryption Coalition Steering Committee Statement on EU-US Cooperation on Turning Public Opinion Against EncryptionPost authorBy GEC adminPost date06 April 2023The members of the Global Encryption Coalition\u2019s Steering Committee \u2014 the Center for Democracy & Technology, Internet Society, Global Partners Digital, Mozilla Corp. and the Internet Freedom Foundation \u2014 issued the following statement on the EU-US collaboration against encryption on April 5, 2023: Among the troubling strategies of those who are threatening the right to privacy, whatever their stated motives, overtly shaping public opinion against encryption is once again rearing its head. Recent media reports state that senior government officials in the US and EU agreed to cooperate on measures to shape public opinion with the goal of legitimising the demands of law enforcement agencies to access encrypted communications. This occurred at the EU-US Senior Officials Meeting on Justice and Home Affairs, held in Stockholm on 16 and 17 March, the minutes of which are now available. The delegations \u201c\u2026 concurred on the need to mirror privacy by design with lawful access by design\u2026,\u201d apparent code language for mandating the undermining or removal of strong encryption practices. The Internet Society, Global Partners Digital, the Center for Democracy & Technology (CDT), Mozilla, and the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF), members of the Steering Committee of the Global Encryption Coalition, issued the following joint statement in response:\u201cThis development is a worrying rehash of previous attempts to influence public opinion against encryption, placing the security of the private information of billions of people at risk. The overwhelming benefits of encryption cannot be contested, as is clear from the widespread deployment of encryption by default across the technology landscape. In fact, it is a glaring indication of this reality that discourse manipulation is now being used to undermine it.Encryption keeps information confidential, preventing unauthorised third parties from accessing private content. It is now deployed on over 90% of web traffic, on most of the commonly used messaging applications, and it protects user data in all prominent operating systems. Encryption also protects information in cellular networks, business and government communications, financial transactions, and a limitless list of other use cases that are fundamental to modern commerce and a digital society.As we have stated in the past, there is no effective way to weaken encryption for some use cases such as law enforcement while keeping it strong for others. Any weakness designed to facilitate law enforcement access can equally be exploited by malicious actors, putting anyone using that kind of encryption at greater risk of harm, often beyond just individual services. Forcing software vendors to build backdoors or preventing them from implementing end-to-end encryption puts the safety of society at large at increased risk. The general public is often a beneficiary of encryption multiple times a day \u2013 from visiting websites, using cell phones, making payments \u2013 without even realising its presence. This is testament to the quality of the tremendous work it has taken to make encryption ubiquitous. It is at the heart of a trusted internet, an enabler of both economic benefits and human rights. With ill-considered legislations like the EU\u2019s CSAM directive and the UK\u2019s Online Safety Bill barrelling through legislative processes, the consequences of such public discourse manipulation against encryption could be dire for data security world-wide.Moreover, while web platforms have \u2013 as key stakeholders \u2013 engaged in relevant lawmaking processes, their engagement in this instance has consistently been to protect clients and users, which requires resisting all attempts to undermine encryption. This should not be understood as \u2018hypocrisy\u2019 (as was reportedly claimed at the meeting), but rather as the uniform application of their corporate responsibilities to protect human rights regardless of jurisdiction.Rather than seeking to undermine encryption, governments should instead focus on leveraging the wide ranging powers law enforcement agencies already have. They should reject ideas like client-side scanning, which falsely purports to preserve encryption while instead creating an automated, on-device censor that violates the entire purpose of encryption. We will continue to monitor these developments closely and defend encryption around the world.\u201d###The Global Encryption Coalition is a three-year old coalition with over 330 members in 99 countries around the world who are dedicated to protecting and promoting the use of encryption.Tagsstatement\u2190Mozilla and Internet Freedom Foundation Join Global Encryption Coalition Steering Committee\u2192Over 40 organizations and cybersecurity experts call on the Turkish government not to undermine end-to-end encryption",

The court largely upheld the district court\u2019s earlier ruling related to Epic Games\u2019 antitrust claims in favor of Apple, but it also upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment in favor of Epic under California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law.The mobile game maker had hoped to prove in its appeal that Apple had acted unlawfully by restricting app distribution on iOS devices to Apple\u2019s App Store which required payments to go through its own processor while preventing developers from communicating to customers about alternative ways to pay.The court\u2019s ruling was first reported by Bloomberg.Apple has issued the following statement:Today\u2019s decision reaffirms Apple\u2019s resounding victory in this case, with nine of ten claims having been decided in Apple\u2019s favor. For the second time in two years, a federal court has ruled that Apple abides by antitrust laws at the state and federal levels. The App Store continues to promote competition, drive innovation, and expand opportunity, and we\u2019re proud of its profound contributions to both users and developers around the world. We respectfully disagree with the court\u2019s ruling on the one remaining claim under state law and are considering further review.The ruling is a major setback for Epic Games and other developers who hoped the ruling could set precedent for further antitrust claims and require Apple to open iOS devices to third-party app stores and payment systems.Epic originally sued Apple in 2020, after forcing Apple to remove Fortnite from the App Store after it intentionally violated the App Store terms over in-app purchases. Though Apple had largely won the lawsuit when the judge declared Apple was not acting as a monopolist, the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple\u2019s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases. It said that Apple would no longer be able to prohibit developers from pointing users to other means of payment.Both Apple and Epic appealed the ruling \u2014 Apple over the required changes to App Store policies related to external links and Epic to try its antitrust case again.In today\u2019s decision, the appeals court panel affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of antitrust liability and its corresponding rejection of Epic\u2019s illegality defense to Apple\u2019s breach of contract counter-claim, the ruling said. However, it also noted that the district court had erred in defining the relevant antitrust market and in holding that Apple\u2019s DPLA (Developer Program Licensing Agreement) fell outside of the scope of the antitrust law known as the Sherman Act.But it said those errors were ultimately \u201charmless\u201d and that Epic, regardless, had \u201cfailed to establish, as a factual matter, its proposed market definition and the existence of any substantially less restrictive alternative means for Apple to accomplish the procompetitive justifications supporting iOS\u2019s walled- garden ecosystem.\u201dIn other words, while these types of contracts can be within the scope of a Sherman Act claim, that wasn\u2019t relevant to the court\u2019s decision in this case.The panel also upheld the district court\u2019s ruling in favor of Epic Games within the scope of California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law.\u201cThe district court did not clearly err in finding that Epic was injured, err as a matter of law when applying California\u2019s flexible liability standards, or abuse its discretion when fashioning equitable relief,\u201d the ruling stated.That would mean the anti-steering changes the district court previously decided on would once again be required.Apple hasn\u2019t yet issued an appeal for this part of the decision. It will likely weigh its options before making that determination.In another bright spot for Apple, the appeals court ruled that the district court had erred when it ruled that Apple wasn\u2019t entitled to attorney fees related to the DPLA breach of contract claims.Epic Games responded to a request for comment by pointing to founder and CEO Tim Sweeney\u2019s statement, shared on Twitter.\u201cApple prevailed at the 9th Circuit Court,\u201d Sweeney wrote. \u201cThough the court upheld the ruling that Apple\u2019s restraints have \u2018a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers,\u2019 they found we didn\u2019t prove our Sherman Act case.Fortunately, the court\u2019s positive decision rejecting Apple\u2019s anti-steering provisions frees iOS developers to send consumers to the web to do business with them directly there. We\u2019re working on next steps.\u201dApple prevailed at the 9th Circuit Court. Though the court upheld the ruling that Apple's restraints have \"a substantial anticompetitive effect that harms consumers\", they found we didn't prove our Sherman Act case.\u2014 Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) April 24, 2023Updated 4/23/23, 4:35 pm et with Epic Games\u2019 commentMore TechCrunchSnapchat sees spike in 1-star reviews as users pan the 'My AI' feature, calling for its removalWhy a fast-growing climate tech startup raised its second Series B in 13 monthsThe D'Amelio family won't buy TikTok, but they thought about it10 years of fintech failure: 3 more ideas that failed to live up to the initial hypeTechCrunch DisruptSept 19-21 San Francisco, CARegister NowSign up for NewslettersSee all newsletters(opens in a new window)DailyWeek in ReviewStartups WeeklyEvent UpdatesAdvertising UpdatesTechCrunch+ AnnouncementsTechCrunch+ EventsTechCrunch+ RoundupEmailSubscribetwitter(opens in a new window)facebook(opens in a new window)linkedin(opens in a new window)reddit(opens in a new window)mail(opens in a new window)Copy Share LinkCopyTagsantitrustapp-storeAppleCourtEpic Gameslawlegal",

        "hn_content": "An appeals court ruled in favor of Apple in its antitrust case with Epic Games, upholding lower court rulings. Epic Games argued that Apple's iOS was the relevant market for the case, but the court disagreed and defined the market as \"digital mobile gaming transactions.\" Apple was found to have a 52-57% share in this market, but not enough to have monopoly power. The court also noted that defining the relevant market is a crucial element in antitrust cases. Comments in the thread touched on factors that keep users loyal to Apple, such as app quality, build quality, and side effects of privacy.Comments on a news story about Apple's alleged spying on users, the court case with Epic Games on app store commission, and accusations of Google's monopoly in web search. \n\n- Some argue that Apple is spying on users because of its advertising business.\n- iOS users don't usually spend money on the app store.\n- Apple and Google have a duopoly over the mobile OS market and are accused of favoring their own products.\n- The court ruled in favor of Apple in the Epic Games case because they failed to make their case.\n- Market definition and competitive alternatives matter for antitrust purposes.\n- Google is accused of having a monopoly in web search, which they leverage to gain dominance in other areas.\n- Being the default choice can contribute to a company's dominance. \n- Some think that using an alternative search engine is not as easy as it seems.\n- The ease of switching, market share, and anti-competitive practices are factors to consider in determining a monopoly.The post discusses the topic of antitrust laws in relation to tech companies, particularly Apple and Google's duopoly over mobile OS. The conversation raises concerns about companies abusing their position, while others argue that there is still competition, just not as much variety as consumers would prefer. The thread also touches on the topic of monopolies, collusion, and the definition of a free market. Some commenters argue for government regulation and the need for companies to not overstep their bounds in areas like chat history and email. Lastly, the conversation mentions Google's monopolization of web search and the availability of other free search engines.- Free search engines have existed since the early 1990s\n- Paid online information search services date back to the 70s\n- Anti-trust law focuses on monopolies and not duopolies or oligopolies\n- Google has a 93% market share of web search but this does not necessarily constitute a monopoly\n- iOS and Google's Android have a duopoly over the mobile OS market, which some argue is monopolistic power\n- A company can have monopoly power without technically having a monopoly\n- Discriminatory practices are necessary conditions to prove monopoly power in court\n- The laws defining and regulating monopolistic power in the digital age may need to be updated.A debate on Apple's market share and monopoly power ensues in the comments section. One commenter questions whether Apple's App Store has its own market or is merely a package manager for iDevices. Another notes that Apple has a 52-57% market share in the \u201cdigital mobile gaming transactions\u201d market. A few respondents argue that Apple has gotten better since day one but other operating systems could have taken Android's place. The comment section debates the definition of relevant markets in antitrust law and the need for legislation defining anti-competitive behavior for platforms and aggregators. Chokepoint capitalism, a concept popularized by tech author Cory Doctorow, is discussed as a way to define monopolistic and monopsonistic behavior by gatekeepers.- Antitrust is when one party has more leverage than any other party, either in buying or selling, based on units or market revenue.\n- Defining the market is essential to avoid ambiguity and prevent platforms from escaping straightforward definitions of market share.\n- Apple's App Store promotes competition by allowing developers to promote and advertise their own apps to be purchased and loaded onto iPhones, expanding opportunities for developers globally.\n- Switching to third-party mobile platforms is difficult as software licenses aren't portable, and iOS software doesn't have an Android version and vice versa.\n- Interoperability laws should be introduced to break down walled gardens and encourage systems to be more interoperable.\n- Apple Music is pre-installed and has special features compared to other music apps, similar to what Microsoft did with Netscape.\n- The complaint about walled gardens is not about monopoly but a lack of open access, as most Apple users do not care about these issues.\n- The EU considers iOS alone as a relevant market and regulates it with DMA, and some experts believe that Apple is not in a very safe position.- Apple and Google dominate the mobile app store market with a duopoly.\n- Apple is a strict monopoly on its platform and hardware, while Android's strategy is more open.\n- You can sideload apps on both iOS and Android in Europe, but it's not possible in the US.\n- Apple's monopoly on its platform allows them to charge developers a 30% tax, and there are limited options for sideloading apps.\n- While it's not impossible to compete with behemoth companies like Apple and Google, it would take significant time and resources.\n- The mobile app store market gives Apple and Google a significant advantage, which has led to antitrust lawsuits and controversies.Amidst discussions of antitrust laws, users debate whether hard work justifies market dominance. The court defines the market within the context of mobile gaming transactions, but some argue the definition could have been broader. Users argue over Apple's history with sideloading, with one party arguing it was a feature Apple possessed at the beginning, and another saying it was never Apple's intention. The competition is said to be one of being an App Store compared to companies like Google and Amazon. Some users claim that Apple's curated App Store gives them an unfair advantage over competitors. A user reports having an app update rejected due to mentioning an Android version of the app in the release notes, which prompts discussions of consistency in marketing and company practices.A discussion about a court ruling and antitrust law regarding Apple's App Store. Some argue that Apple has a legal monopoly on iOS apps, while others say there is competition from Android and Windows. The requirement for a legal monopoly has been refined by decades of case law. A ruling can be overturned by higher courts. There may be a legal differentiation between a smartphone and a game console, but this is not straightforward. Epic Games, Unreal, and console makers have also been mentioned. The concept of \"privacy-friendly phones\" is ill-defined with no legal standard.Apple has a monopoly on phones with Lightning ports, not on privacy-friendly phones, for which alternatives exist. Having a monopoly is legal, it's the abuse of the monopoly that isn't. There's no legally recognized market for \"privacy-friendly phones.\" Apple's App Store promotes competition. Defining the market is crucial in antitrust cases. Apple's grip on its platforms stifles innovation but isn't a monopolistic issue. Innovation is hard to come by for smaller companies when competing with big dogs like Apple. Billions of dollars are needed to compete in the smartphone space. Apple's products interoperate well with each other, but not with non-Apple products.Apple's closed ecosystem and vertical integration offer a better user experience for customers, which is why they are willing to pay a higher price for it. Airdrop's proprietary protocol is locked down with Apple signatures to keep competitors out, giving them a competitive advantage. It doesn't take \"billions\" of dollars to become an Android OEM and use AOSP, but it is pricey. Apple has the capital to buy suppliers' exclusive output on new processes for years, making it difficult for open source platforms to compete. Android dominates globally, but Apple's strategy behind text and data costs made SMS the default messaging app in the US until iMessage launched in 2011.Google's OS, Android, is free for phone makers, so using it is less expensive than developing an alternative. However, Android comes with the Google Play Store, so phone makers must contribute to Google's market dominance or forego Google services and risk alienating consumers. Companies stopped developing alternatives to Android because of the significant amount of money it would require. Apple, with its closed App Store ecosystem, has a significant advantage over Android. Many commenters argue that Apple's grip on its platforms stifles innovation and negatively impacts competition, calling for antitrust regulations.",

It\u2019s also the primary entry point for risks, making it important to protect.We make signing into Google, and all the apps and services you love, simple and secure with built-in authentication tools like Google Password Manager and Sign in with Google, as well as automatic protections like alerts when your Google Account is being accessed from a new device. We released Google Authenticator in 2010 as a free and easy way for sites to add \u201csomething you have\u201d two-factor authentication (2FA) that bolsters user security when signing in. While we\u2019re pushing towards a passwordless future, authentication codes remain an important part of internet security today, so we've continued to make optimizations to the Google Authenticator app.One major piece of feedback we\u2019ve heard from users over the years was the complexity in dealing with lost or stolen devices that had Google Authenticator installed. Since one time codes in Authenticator were only stored on a single device, a loss of that device meant that users lost their ability to sign in to any service on which they\u2019d set up 2FA using Authenticator. With this update we\u2019re rolling out a solution to this problem, making one time codes more durable by storing them safely in users\u2019 Google Account. This change means users are better protected from lockout and that services can rely on users retaining access, increasing both convenience and security.In addition to one-time codes from Authenticator, Google has long been driving multiple options for secure authentication across the web. Google Password Manager securely saves your passwords and helps you sign in faster with Android and Chrome, while Sign in with Google allows users to sign in to a site or app using their Google Account. We\u2019ve also been working with our industry partners and the FIDO Alliance to bring even more convenient and secure authentication offerings to users in the form of passkeys. To try the new Authenticator with Google Account synchronization, simply update the app and follow the prompts. Making technology for everyone means protecting everyone who uses it. We\u2019re excited to continue building and sharing convenient and secure offerings for users and developers across the web.

        "hn_content": "Google has added a \"match the numbers in the app\" style 2FA to YouTube but it is the default, with no apparent way to change or even turn it off, and it doesn't work; It opens in the YouTube app and loads forever. The community support forums aren't well named as they are intended for users to answer other user's questions; for actual support, you need a paid account. Google Authenticator now supports Google Account synchronization. Google's TOTP is not as good as it could be, and WebAuthn with a hardware device is less prone to losing and compromising secrets.Users have discussed the pros and cons of using YouTube's mobile app versus the web version, with some preferring the app's features such as better battery life, whereas others prefer the web version for ad-blocking and absent features from the app. Users have also discussed the issues of forgetting 2 factor authentication recovery codes as well as the potential solution of creating a separate YouTube account with 2FA disabled for extra security. Finally, there was debate around the practicality of expecting people to keep basic recovery codes for their Google accounts safe for years.A Tech Times forum discusses the issues that people face with passwords, with some suggesting a \"notarized factor\" for secure authentication in the modern world. It's argued that abstract separation of devices and passwords doesn't compute for some users, who don't understand what's being asked of them. It's also noted that SMS as a second factor can be practical for ordinary people but has potential security issues, while passkeys would be beneficial from a usability perspective. Finally, storing passwords on an encrypted thumb drive is promoted, rather than keeping a hastily written piece of paper.Users on a thread express frustration over Google's 2FA recovery key being difficult to store securely.\n\nUsers express concern that storing recovery keys in a safe is not a feasible solution for many, and Google puts the responsibility of storage on the user.\n\nComments discuss the prevalence of all-caps license agreements and the difficulty of balancing security and convenience for non-technical users.\n\nSome users argue that users need to take responsibility for their own security and decision-making.\n\nThere is no significant new release, but the discussion highlights broader industry issues with user experience and security.This is a discussion thread on the effectiveness of home safes, with some users sharing personal experiences and views. Key points include: \n- Home safes are primarily used for fire protection, with some added level of security against physical break-ins\n- Safes can be bolted down for extra security, making them harder to carry away\n- The effectiveness of safe protection depends on the individual's threat model\n- Back-up codes for two-factor authentication can be stored securely in a variety of ways, including wallets and RFID stickers\n- Decent safes are not trivial to pick or drill through, but cheaper home safes can be drilled/sawed through with some noise \nOverall, this post is a casual discussion that doesn't offer any new or exciting insights into technology.Google has released an update to its Authenticator app, enabling users to synchronise their Google Accounts across multiple devices. Previously, account recovery on the app would be impossible if the user lost their device or deleted the app. The QR code for the two-factor authentication (2FA) aspect of accounts was not easy for many users to back-up, leading some to suggest using alternatives to the app. Google has an online support page for users to follow when trying to use the new feature.Some users have expressed concern about using Google Authenticator, saying that it puts their security at risk; one user mentioned that the app can be banned, leaving users unable to access their important accounts. Others mentioned using alternative tools like Authy or 1Password as backups. Some highlighted the risk of losing access to accounts if a device is lost or damaged, and the need for offline backups. Some debate ensued about the security of TOTP codes, with some arguing that they don't offer much additional security beyond strong, unique passwords. Others emphasized the importance of protecting against keyloggers, and Token binding was offered as an example of a tool that adds more protection.Users discuss the security risks of storing passwords and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) in the same tool, such as 1Pass. Google Authenticator's lack of recovery options and migration issues in the past drew criticism, but later versions offer an export feature via QR code. Users debate the importance of levels of account security, the risks of cloud-based tools, and the annoyance caused by Google's preference over using its own proprietary authenticator over TOTP. The discussion also touches on the convenience and support issues related to two-factor authentication in general, and newer passkeys as a potential solution.This post discusses the use of different authentication methods like FIDO, Google Authenticator, and Okta. There is confusion about the differences between Google Authenticator and Google's push-notification based auth checks. Apple users can store TOTP codes in the vanilla iOS. The use of iCloud keychain must be careful because it can be fully hijacked using one factor only, the device passcode. Spying out iPhone's passcode can allow hijacking other accounts synchronized with it, including critical things such as PayPal and Apple Pay payments.",

        "hn_content": "DuckDuckGo has removed the ability to filter search results, making it difficult to find what users are looking for. Kagi, a paid search engine, offers features like site blocking and prioritizes user needs over advertisers. However, users have voiced concerns about Kagi's recent price increase and the reliability of its search results. Some users have turned to Brave search as an alternative, which uses its index to provide what users feel are better search results. The discussion also touches on the value of investing in a good search engine and the challenges of creating a compelling product that is not based on advertising.Users discuss various search engines, with some mentioning Brave Search and phind.com as good options, while others mention Kagi and its recent price increase. A user mentioned Bing Chat's strength in answering programming-related questions due to Microsoft's optimization of querying a vector database. Some users note the importance of customizable search results and the weeding out of SEO-optimized sites. There is also discussion about the resistance towards paid search and the attractiveness of free alternatives.A discussion on the value of paid vs. ad-supported search engines, specifically regarding Kagi, a new paid search engine. Some users express concern about exceeding the search limit and the price model, but overall users find the search results to be high quality with better ranking than Google, and Kagi is responsive to user feedback. The discussion brings up the issue of customer satisfaction, with some arguing that companies motivated by customer satisfaction will prioritize implementing user feedback. However, others express skepticism, noting that no company is purely motivated by customer satisfaction.Users discuss search engines Kagi and DuckDuckGo on Hacker News, with some praising Kagi for being a paid service, with no ads, and focused on user needs, while others express concern that paying subscribers are a potential audience for advertising. Meanwhile, some users claim that non-tech users don't care about privacy, while others disagree, saying that privacy can be a superficial selling point for those users. Users also discuss ways to maintain anonymity while using search engines, such as using a VPN and anonymous payment methods.Users discuss their experiences with different search engines and privacy concerns. One user recommends Kagi as a paid search engine with features like the ability to block whole sites and avoid SEO-optimized content. Others mention the high cost of Kagi's pricing scheme and the desire for anonymous payment options. Some have noticed a decline in quality of DDG searches and express interest in trying out Kagi.Kagi Search, a paid subscription search engine, charges $14.50/month for 1,000 searches, which equates to a profit of around $624,000 a year with its current user base of approximately 2,600 customers. Kagi\u2019s pricing model has sparked debate among users, as some find it expensive while others feel it offers reasonable rates for its service that includes traditional search indexes, like Google and Bing, and data sources such as Wikipedia and DeepL. Some users suggest considering other options like You.com and SearXNG that offer customization and privacy features. Concerns about Kagi\u2019s trustworthiness include the collection of data on users and limited legal liability.Users have been discussing Kagi's payment collection being non-privacy friendly and lacking simplicity. Meanwhile, the CEO of DuckDuckGo clarified that search syntax filters are still available and have not been deactivated, though the search engine has been addressing inconsistencies. Users have also been complaining about declining search engine quality, with some suggesting it is intentional.People are turning to LLMs like ChatGPT for search results due to a decline in search engine quality caused by ads/sponsored results and the competitive nature of SEO. However, LLMs may harm discoverability of unique information. Users are experiencing frustration with current search engines due to the prevalence of sponsored results. A public good index of the web free of race-to-the-bottom dynamics and adtech would be ideal. Bing's API access prices have increased, affecting search engines like DuckDuckGo, which may result in lower quality service. Companies cater to the 10x bigger market, making less technically savvy customers more valuable to advertisers.The comments section discusses the benefits and potential drawbacks of adding search operators to privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo. Some argue that adding options isn't free and could lead to confusion for users, while others point out that the homepage of DuckDuckGo contains information about its products and could include a list of search operators to educate users. The discussion also touches on the demographic that uses such features, and the relevance of power user recommendations in product uptake. Overall, the commentary explores the role and value of customization in UX design.Discussion on the accessibility and competition in the search engine market. Despite the recent changes to search engine DuckDuckGo's user data handling, users don't have many options for alternative search engines that prioritize privacy. While there are niche search alternatives, Google remains the dominant search engine with limited competition. Other tech products like social media and operating systems also have limited competition. However, there are still viable alternatives for operating systems like Linux and web browsers like Firefox.- Linux's low market share is because hardly anyone pays for it, so market surveys don't reflect its true usage \n- Niche products such as Mastodon, Diaspora, and Lemmy have viable alternatives to more popular social media platforms \n- Cloudflare is causing issues for Mozilla users, which they need to address \n- DuckDuckGo's search engine API pricing from Microsoft has gone up, which may impact the complexity of queries \n- There have been reports of poor DDG results with broken search queries and illegitimate sites showing up \n- DDG removed operators like - and +, and it's not clear when this happened \n- Users may consider paid search options like Kagi if the free options are not satisfactory \n- Paid search engines may prioritize users' needs over advertisers, unlike free search options.Users of DuckDuckGo and Ecosia have reported issues with the search filters not working, potentially due to underlying Bing API limitations or changes. Other users in the discussion suggest alternative search engines, such as Kagi, which charges users for searches and has had to adjust pricing plans due to changes in the search market. Some users express frustration with the state of search engines in general, particularly with regards to advertising. Despite these challenges, there are still alternatives available for those who value search filtering capabilities.Kagi, a search engine that offers customized ranking, is being discussed on Hacker News with users debating its pricing plans, which range from $5/month for 200 searches to $25/month for unlimited. Users discuss the value of paying for search and justify the expense based on the quality of results and time saved using Kagi instead of other search engines. Some suggest alternatives like Google with a browser plugin or self-hosting a search engine. Others suggest changes to Kagi's pricing model, such as charging per 100 searches instead of 15 cents per search or allowing for annual billing.",

While this UX element (from companies such as Crazy Egg and Rooster) has great potential, I\u2019ve found it far too common that websites use this to overlay huge pop-ups across the entire screen as a last-ditch effort to convert users.The exit-intent overlay has to have been popularized by people siloed off from user experience design, because it becomes clear quite quickly that these exit-intent overlays (1) arguably do a poor job of serving the initial intent of increasing conversions, and (2) work against the user\u2019s goals, which exist [gasp!] outside that website.Let me explain:Does a poor job of increasing conversions. A person opens a blog post about the psychology of color in marketing. The first paragraph looks promising and she moves her cursor to the top right to access the scrollbar. This then triggers the exit-intent overlay, obscuring her view of the rest of the article. \u201cSign up for our newsletter!\u201d the overlay implores. If time on page and the amount a person scrolls down a page are positive engagement metrics, why has the site just stopped her from engaging with the rest of the article? If \u201cthe rule of seven\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200athat a customer needs to interact seven times before buying\u200a\u2014\u200ais marketing 101, why does the site demand a newsletter conversion before a new user has even finished reading one article?Works against user goals. At the end of my workday, I usually open a row of new tabs of that day\u2019s UX-related tweets that pique my interest\u200a\u2014\u200amany people engage in this kind of parallel browsing and page parking (keeping many tabs open to multi-task, and opening multiple tabs at once to research a particular topic). Sites that trigger exit overlays when I switch tabs, or after a specified amount of time, guarantee that I must close the overlay before I interact with their content for the first time. Some overlays even insult my intelligence by making me click a button that says \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want free things\u201d or \u201cI hate good advice\u201d before I interact with their content for the first time.A variety of companies will try to convince you that exit overlays are great, or at least that you can use them responsibly. I\u2019ll grant that some websites may see increased newsletter conversions, but at what long-term cost to their brand? While some users may sign up for the newsletter willingly, many others may feel bullied into signing up or even leave in disgust. As a research psychologist recently transitioned to UX, I recognize this aggressive persuasion technique as an example of dark design patterns and needy design patterns. With some reworking, perhaps mouse-out trackers can help users and companies achieve aligned goals\u200a\u2014\u200alike how Google Calendar sends notifications to my phone when it knows I do not have Calendar opened in my browser. When it comes to conversions, however, there are no magic bullets and there are no short-cuts.

The author suggests that measuring which emails lead to more clicks can help create more relevant content for subscribers. Discussion in the comments section suggests that some media companies prioritize gaining subscribers over user experience, with some users finding pop-ups and aggressive subscription prompts disruptive to their browsing experience.A website owner defends the use of popups to gather email addresses and argues that it is an effective tactic supported by data, despite complaints from some users on HN. The owner reports that ~6% of people fill out the popup and that the overwhelming majority of users do not find it slimy or manipulative.

Some suggest alternative methods like adding a signup field further into the article or using non-blocking prompts. Others argue that capitalism is the root of the problem with the web and suggest using new protocols like Gemini to resist commercialization. Google is accused of purposely creating website layouts that prioritize revenue over user experience. Some offer personal experiences with email popups, with one individual using a substack email list for communication related to a conference with a 50% open rate and high engagement.Pop-up forms on websites, such as cookie banners and paywalls, are considered an easy way to add new garbage while separating from content. Despite their annoyance to some users, they work for businesses as they increase conversions. Losing some annoyed users is considered an acceptable trade-off if the net result is an increase in conversions. 'The rule of seven' is a principle that suggests more interactions can increase business revenue. Pop-ups can also address visitors' long-term goals. Finally, pop-ups serve business goals as most of these websites exist only thanks to their revenue.Pop-up forms may actually be effective in increasing conversions despite being disliked by end-users. Analytics and A/B testing are constantly run to determine which methods work best. However, some argue that prioritizing conversions over user experience may ultimately harm the company in the long run. Companies like Apple and Stripe may not need to use pop-up forms due to their established reputation, whereas smaller online blogs may have to rely on them. Newsletters are important because they are traffic that businesses actually own, unlike social media algorithms over which they have no control.A discussion thread on Hacker News covers the challenges with low contrast text, which some find difficult to read.

This is not the first time the UK has proposed such a bill; in 2000, a similar bill was discussed but eventually dropped. Although the discussion on key escrow raged on, the bill that passed explicitly prohibited the requirement for key escrow. There are concerns about the cybersecurity implications of having all cryptographic keys in the entire United Kingdom stored in one place, as it would be an infinitely lucrative cyberattack target. The discussion has reignited debates on the importance of cybersecurity and privacy.The conversation is about bias in the BBC's reporting. There are varying opinions on whether the BBC is biased towards left-leaning or right-leaning views. Some individuals have cited examples of stories or topics where the BBC showcases bias. Others countered that, irrespective of bias, everything has an editorial line that governs the opinions allowed. Regardless, the BBC remains a significant news source, although some people have criticized it for being funded by the state and thus affiliated with the government.Vendors have issued a critical update blocking that CA certificate, causing chaos. The internet relies on rules like DNSSEC to keep everyone safe. Multiple countries cooperate in defense of cybersecurity through Five Eyes or NATO. The fact that every \"democratic\" superpower seeks to criminalize or prohibit E2EE suggests some collaboration between states.

It's hard to get complete numbers as most of this process happens in secret.The text does not contain any meaningful content related to technology or science.There is a debate about the extent of power held by the British monarchy. Contrary to popular belief, the monarch has significant power, including weekly meetings with the Prime Minister, the ability to influence laws, veto bills, and grant Royal Assent, and King's Consent. However, the monarchy's interference is relatively minor, and the UK's political establishment, with the public's support, would prevent any significant interference with the democratic system. The monarch also holds power as the Command-in-Chief of the UK, Canadian, and Australian militaries. Finally, a bill was proposed in 2006 to transfer the power to authorize military strikes from the monarch to Parliament.The post discusses the exercise of royal prerogative executive power by the Prime Minister instead of the Monarch. While some argue this is undemocratic, others note that Parliament is sovereign, and the UK is a democracy. The conversation devolves into discussions around lobbying and the power of different actors in both the UK and the US. The content is primarily political in nature and does not discuss new or exciting technological advancements.The comments section is a discussion about encryption and government surveillance. It's suggested that there may be systemic coordination between governments, but not necessarily conspiracies. It's noted that governments generally want power and surveillance capabilities over their citizens. One person questions the competency of elected officials to understand tech issues, while others express concerns about potential harm to e-commerce and secure banking if end-to-end encryption is outlawed. Some commenters disagree on the definition of end-to-end encryption.The discussion revolves around the definition of end-to-end encryption (E2EE), with some commenters arguing that TLS is not E2EE due to the involvement of a third-party certificate authority. Others argue that HTTPS connections can still be considered E2EE as intermediate ISPs cannot access the contents. There are concerns that the UK government may threaten E2EE legislation, prompting suggestions that the tech community and employers should collectively retaliate and boycott the country. However, it is believed that any such move could result in massive public backlash, and the ban could be unenforceable anyway.The UK government is proposing a new law that would require platforms hosting user-generated content to feed messages into a government-approved system for monitoring, leading to a greater risk of detection and punishment. The law would make people within user-generated content companies criminally liable for breaches. The bill does not ban maths or e2ee for communications, but would require instant messaging platforms to implement a lawful intercept capability so targeted users could have their communications read. However, this could be done by court order and limited to users suspected of criminal activity. Concerns have been raised over restrictions to privacy.The article discusses the debate around fictional portrayals of child sexual assault and its moral perspective or utility. The emotional response from most people is negative, but there are hard questions to consider. Possession of synthesized child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is already illegal in the UK.

I've actually been playing with QEMU internals a lot recently. Specifically with the multi-process experimental features. Although I can't seem to find any consistency on where the main project is headed. They admit that the documentation pages can be well out-of-date with the upstream implementations, but they seem split-brained even within the code.The main project ships with the multi-process qemu approach, mostly defined in their docs: https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/multi-process.html https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/devel/multi-process.htmlBut I saw some update buried in a mailing list that development of the multi-process system has been superseded by vfio-user, mostly led by nutanix: https://github.com/nutanix/libvfio-userThe nutanix repo refers to an oracle-led fork of qemu with the full vfio-user implementation built-in: https://github.com/oracle/qemuSo, they're still separate projects, right? Well, kinda. the mainline project has the vfio-user-server implementation merged in: https://github.com/qemu/qemu/blob/ac5f7bf8e208cd7893dbb1a952...But not the client side (vfio-user-pci). So, the feature is half-baked in the mainline project.I don't know if any of the qemu devs browse HN but it would be nice to hear more about the plans for vfio-user.replyorra 18 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]> x86: support for Xen guests under KVM with Linux v5.12+Clearly I haven't been keeping up, because this is a bit of a surprise. Xen under KVM? Those things are polar opposites!replymonocasa 18 hours ago | parent | next [\u2013]Support for Xen guests by supporting the Xen hypercalls. This was added to KVM proper to support Amazon's proprietary vmm running ancient AMIs on newer systems but it seems it's finally getting qemu support too.replygwd 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I haven't looked at this work in detail, but you need more than just hypercalls to run those ancient guests; those guests are expecting to see xenstore, disk and block backends, and so on. Those would be a lot harder to emulate in the kernel (and probably a bad idea to try anyway).replymonocasa 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I mean, sure, this specific work is in qemu, not the kernel. Some hypercalls are trapped by the kernel, some trap out to a vmm like qemu. Support for pv devices mainly lives in the vmm. But A) even the hypercalls the kernel handles needs to be manually enabled by the vmm, and B) the pv device support ultimately is exposed as in guest memory tables and hypercalls (now partially emulated by qemu).replyrbanffy 11 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I always looked at Xen as something similar to a plain VM image with lots and lots of virtio-like stuff. I'd even assume they'd perform better if they are a thinner layer of virtual machine on top of the host.replywmf 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Xen is kind of dead so people are migrating to KVM but they don't want to update their images.replygwd 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]People have been saying \"Xen is dead\" for over 15 years; and yet here we are. :-)Xen and KVM are different beasts with different advantages. (Some of Xen's I detailed in a comment here [1].) KVM in particular has some advantages in the \"vanilla server virt\" space, which is why KVM often ends up being the default in the Linux distro world. But we're not going away any time soon.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32607837replyactionfromafar 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]I used Xen a lot in late 2000s, when it was a great alternative to spinning up more physical machines. Had a lot of fun with the office servers, running all disks with RAID some-number-or-other on a machine with an NBD[0] server on gigabit Ethernet, and then a couple of physical machines hosting all the XEN machines.XEN felt fast and, though not exactly easy to setup, fairly straight-forward.0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_block_devicereplygeneralizations 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Since when is Xen dead? I liked the design better than kvm.replyorra 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Don't know but it's a shame. IIRC Qubes uses Xen, because Xen has a small Trusted Computing Base (TCB).replysoraminazuki 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Xen has a smaller TCB only if you consider Dom0 not part of the TCB. But since a compromised Dom0 would lead to the compromise of the whole system, I think it makes more sense to view Dom0 as part of the TCB.replyluckyobserver 18 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]Doesn't AWS run on a modified Xen setup?replymonocasa 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They used to, but they run mainly on KVM now with a custom vmm.replyusr1106 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]First web hit I get on that topic ishttps://www.freecodecamp.org/news/aws-just-announced-a-move-...(I read only the headline and the date now. From Xen towards KVM starting in 2019. So I guess at AWS scale that's still a relatively new thing.)replymonocasa 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They started the transition back in 2017. https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/07/aws_writes_new_kvm_ba...replyusr1106 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Calling  systemd-detect-virton the 2 first AWS machines of different type I have access to: Result is  xenon one of them and  amazonon the other.replymonocasa 17 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]This qemu support comes after Amazon added support to the kernel to emulate Xen when combined with their custom vmm. A key component of that is the hypervisor lying when it's asked by a guest to describe itself.There's a good chance that 'xen' box is actually KVM and Amazon's proprietary vmm.replysilverwind 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]Sounds like they developed a `user-agent` situation.Apparently, one must never ask popular software what it is.replymonocasa 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain (ie. last vestiges languishing as a compat shim that even the developers who support you wish they could finally deprecate and remove).replywmf 17 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]You're using very obsolete instances.replyusr1106 16 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]They are neither brand new nor 10+ years old legacy types. Somewhere in the middle.replydavidjfelix 18 hours ago | parent | prev | next [\u2013]My interpretation of this:You have an x86 machine running Linux v5.12 which is running QEMU using KVM accelerations. Using this setup, you're able to emulate a machine that can run Xen. Since Xen is a type 1 hypervisor, you would then run a Dom0 and perhaps many DomU machines inside it, let's say Linux here for both.Hardware > Linux KVM > QEMU > Xen guest > Linux Dom0 guest, Linux DomU guestreplymonocasa 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]My understanding is that this work is designed to run DomU images more or less directly. Qemu itself more or less fills the role of Dom0 here.replydavidjfelix 18 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That makes more sense.replysureglymop 16 hours ago | root | parent | prev | next [\u2013]I hope so because it might finally allow me to run Qubes OS as a vm to check it out.replybonzini 14 hours ago | root | parent | next [\u2013]That's nested virtualization and it's completely unrelated.replykissiel 17 hours ago | prev | next [\u2013]\"Since version 3.0.0, QEMU uses a time based version numbering scheme: major incremented by 1 for the first release of the year minor reset to 0 with every major increment, otherwise incremented by 1 for each release from git master micro always 0 for releases from git master, incremented by 1 for each stable branch release\" If I'm reading this right, \"master\" has more significant part than stable... This feels wrong.
