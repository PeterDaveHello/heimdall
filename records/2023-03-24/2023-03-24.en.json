The plugins allow language models to access and retrieve up-to-date information, while running computations or utilising third-party services. Initially, OpenAI is rolling out the functionality to a small number of users, but plans to expand access for other developers over time. Plugin developers on OpenAI's waitlist will be able to design plugins for ChatGPT and make them available in the prompt shown to the language model. The plugins allow developers to customise and perform a range of functions, including text summarisation and translation, and offer the opportunity for OpenAI to expand its capabilities.",

This morning, it announced a notice of proposed rulemaking it dubs \u201cclick to cancel,\u201d requiring companies to make ending a subscription equivalently simple to signing up for one. That includes letting people use the same method for both actions \u2014 so a business can\u2019t, for instance, let someone sign up for a service online but make them call a phone number to cancel.The rule has a couple of other provisions. Many companies try to keep subscribers by offering special deals or perks, and they\u2019re still allowed to do that, but they must offer an up-front opt-out that lets customers bypass the sales pitches. They also have to annually remind consumers that they\u2019re enrolled in what are dubbed \u201cnegative option\u201d programs, or programs where failing to cancel something is considered an agreement to keep paying, for anything but physical goods. Now, the agency has opened a public comment period for the proposal, after which it will potentially make revisions and pass the final regulation.\u201cCompanies should not be able to manipulate consumers into paying for subscriptions that they don\u2019t want,\u201d FTC chair Lina Khan told reporters in advance of the announcement. \u201cWe get countless complaints about this.\u201d\u201cWe get countless complaints about this.\u201dThat likely includes complaints for such popular services as Amazon Prime, which had to simplify its cancelation process last year in the EU under regulatory pressure. It\u2019s also been a perennial irritation for people who start paying for The New York Times, gym memberships, cable service, and countless other subscription categories. Khan said it likely wouldn\u2019t apply to non-commercial services like recurring political donations, which have also left some donors feeling scammed and tricked.The FTC already considered what some critics dub \u201croach motel\u201d practices unlawful under bans on unfair or deceptive business practices, and under Khan, it\u2019s gone after companies employing \u201cdark patterns\u201d \u2014\u00a0a blanket term for interfaces that deceive or manipulate people. Among other incidents, last year, it settled a $100 million lawsuit with telecom provider Vonage, which the FTC alleged created an artificially difficult cancellation process to lock people into subscriptions.But a formal ban sets a codified standard for what\u2019s unlawful and gives the FTC more flexibility to demand restitution from companies that break the rule. The agency can recover around $50,000 per individual violation of a consumer\u2019s rights, and consumer lawsuits can recover damages for lost funds and potentially wasted time. And formal standards are increasingly relevant as more and more companies push ongoing service models over ownership. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen over the last few years in particular a shift that companies are making more and more to subscription models,\u201d Khan says. \u201cThat shift to greater subscriptions has created more opportunity for mischief.\u201dCommentsMost PopularThe Linus Tech Tips YouTube hack is the latest in a line of crypto scam breachesOpenAI is massively expanding ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities to let it browse the web and moreIs Jack Dorsey going to get blown up by Hindenburg Research?Tesla\u2019s Wireless Charging Platform does what AirPower couldn\u2019tValve announces Counter-Strike 2, a free replacement for CS:GOVerge Deals / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.Email (required)Sign upBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Below figures are non-interactive snapshots from the research article for iPhone 13 with iOS16.0 installed:\n\nTutorial: Optimized Deployment of Hugging Face distilbert\nThis tutorial is a step-by-step guide to the model deployment process from the case study in our research article. The same code is used to generate the Hugging Face distilbert performance data in the figures above.\nIn order to begin the optimizations, we initialize the baseline model as follows:\nimport transformers\nmodel_name = \"distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english\"\nbaseline_model = transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(\n    model_name,\n    return_dict=False,\n    torchscript=True,\n).eval()\nThen we initialize the mathematically equivalent but optimized model, and we restore its parameters using that of the baseline model:\nfrom ane_transformers.huggingface import distilbert as ane_distilbert\noptimized_model = ane_distilbert.DistilBertForSequenceClassification(\n    baseline_model.config).eval()\noptimized_model.load_state_dict(baseline_model.state_dict())\nNext we create sample inputs for the model:\ntokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\ntokenized = tokenizer(\n    [\"Sample input text to trace the model\"],\n    return_tensors=\"pt\",\n    max_length=128,  # token sequence length\n    padding=\"max_length\",\n)\nWe then trace the optimized model to obtain the expected input format (Torchscript) for the coremltools conversion tool.\nimport torch\ntraced_optimized_model = torch.jit.trace(\n    optimized_model,\n    (tokenized[\"input_ids\"], tokenized[\"attention_mask\"])\n)\nFinally, we use coremltools to generate the Core ML model package file and save it.\nimport coremltools as ct\nimport numpy as np\nane_mlpackage_obj = ct.convert(\n    traced_optimized_model,\n    convert_to=\"mlprogram\",\n    inputs=[\n        ct.TensorType(\n                f\"input_{name}\",\n                    shape=tensor.shape,\n                    dtype=np.int32,\n                ) for name, tensor in tokenized.items()\n            ],\n            compute_units=ct.ComputeUnit.ALL,\n)\nout_path = \"HuggingFace_ane_transformers_distilbert_seqLen128_batchSize1.mlpackage\"\nane_mlpackage_obj.save(out_path)\nTo verify performance, developers can now launch Xcode and simply add this model package file as a resource in their projects. After clicking on the Performance tab, the developer can generate a performance report on locally available devices, for example, on the Mac that is running Xcode or another Apple device that is connected to that Mac. The figure below shows a performance report generated for this model on an iPhone 13 Pro Max with iOS 16.0 installed.\n\nBased on the figure above, the latency is improved by a factor of 2.84 times for the sequence length of 128 and batch size of 1 that were chosen for the tutorial. Higher sequence lengths, such as 512, and batch sizes, such as 8, will yield up to 10 times lower latency and 14 times lower peak memory consumption. Please refer to Figure 2 from our research article for detailed and interactive performance data.\nNote that the load and compilation times increase due to the number of operations increasing in the optimized model but these are one-time costs and user experience will not be affected if the model is loaded asynchronously.\nNote that 4 of the 606 operations in the optimized model are executed on the CPU. These are the embedding lookup related operations and they are more efficient to do on the CPU for this particular model configuration.\nA Note on Unit Tests\nThe unit tests measure, among other things, the ANE speed-up factor. Since the device spec for this reference implementation is M1 or newer chips for the Mac and A14 and newer chips for the iPhone and iPad, the speed-up unit tests will print a warning message if executed on devices outside of this spec. Even if the model is generated using an out of spec Mac, the model should work as expected on in-spec devices.\nInstallation & Troubleshooting\n\nFastest: pip install ane_transformers\nLocally editable: pip install -e .\nIf installation fails with ERROR: Failed building wheel for tokenizers or error: can't find Rust compiler, please follow this solution\n\nAbout\n\n      Reference implementation of the Transformer architecture optimized for Apple Neural Engine (ANE)\n    \nResources\n\n      Readme\n \nLicense\n\n     View license\n    \n\nCode of conduct\n\n      Code of conduct\n    \n\nStars\n\n1.6k\n    stars\n\nWatchers\n\n39\n    watching\n\nForks\n\n49\n    forks\n\n    Releases\n      3\n\nv0.1.3\n\n          Latest\n \nAug 9, 2022\n\n \n\n        + 2 releases\n\n    Packages 0\n\n        No packages published \n\nLanguages\n\nPython\n99.7%\n\nMakefile\n0.3%\n\nFooter\n\n \n        \u00a9 2023 GitHub, Inc.\n        \n\nFooter navigation\n\nTerms\nPrivacy\nSecurity\nStatus\nDocs\nContact GitHub\nPricing\nAPI\nTraining\nBlog\nAbout\n\n    You can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n  \n\nYou signed in with another tab or window.

One such model, OpenAI's Codex, has been used in about a hundred academic papers1. Codex, like other OpenAI models, is not open source, so users rely on OpenAI for accessing the model.\u00a0On Monday, OpenAI announced that it would discontinue support for Codex by Thursday. Hundreds of academic papers would no longer be reproducible: independent researchers would not be able to assess their validity and build on their results. And developers building applications using OpenAI's models wouldn't be able to ensure their applications continue working as expected.OpenAI asked users to switch to GPT 3.5 with less than a week's notice. Source.The importance of reproducibility\u00a0Reproducibility\u2014the ability to independently verify research findings\u2014is a cornerstone of research. Scientific research already suffers from a reproducibility crisis, including in fields that use ML.\u00a0Since small changes in a model can result in significant downstream effects, a prerequisite for reproducible research is access to the exact model used in an experiment. If a researcher fails to reproduce a paper\u2019s results when using a newer model, there\u2019s no way to know if it is because of differences between the models or flaws in the original paper.\u00a0\u00a0OpenAI responded to the criticism by saying they'll allow researchers access to Codex. But the application process is opaque: researchers need to fill out a form, and the company decides who gets approved. It is not clear who counts as a researcher, how long they need to wait, or how many people will be approved. Most importantly, Codex is only available through the researcher program \u201cfor a limited period of time\u201d (exactly how long is unknown).OpenAI regularly updates newer models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, so the use of those models is automatically a barrier to reproducibility. The company does offer snapshots of specific versions so that the models continue to perform in the same way in downstream applications. But OpenAI only maintains these snapshots for three months. That means the prospects for reproducible research using the newer models are also dim-to-nonexistent.Researchers aren't the only ones who could want to reproduce scientific results. Developers who want to use OpenAI's models are also left out. If they are building applications using OpenAI's models, they cannot be sure about the model's future behavior when current models are deprecated. OpenAI says developers should switch to the newer GPT 3.5 model, but this model is worse than Codex in some settings.LLMs are research infrastructureConcerns with OpenAI's model deprecations are amplified because LLMs are becoming key pieces of infrastructure. Researchers and developers rely on LLMs as a foundation layer, which is then fine-tuned for specific applications or answering research questions. OpenAI isn't responsibly maintaining this infrastructure by providing versioned models.Researchers had less than a week to shift to using another model before OpenAI deprecated Codex. OpenAI asked researchers to switch to GPT 3.5 models. But these models are not comparable, and researchers' old work becomes irreproducible. The company's hasty deprecation also falls short of standard practices for deprecating software: companies usually offer months or even years of advance notice before deprecating their products.You\u2019re reading AI Snake Oil, a blog about our upcoming book. Subscribe to get new posts.SubscribeOpen-sourcing LLMs aids reproducibilityLLMs hold exciting possibilities for research. Using publicly available LLMs could reduce the resource gap between tech companies and academic research, since researchers don't need to train LLMs from scratch. As research in generative AI shifts from developing LLMs to using them for downstream tasks, it is important to ensure reproducibility.\u00a0OpenAI's haphazard deprecation of Codex shows the need for caution when using closed models from tech companies. Using open-source models, such as BLOOM, would circumvent these issues: researchers would have access to the model instead of relying on tech companies. Open-sourcing LLMs is a complex question, and there are many other factors to consider before deciding whether that's the right step. But open-source LLMs could be a key step in ensuring reproducibility.1We searched CS arxiv papers with the term Codex in their abstracts written after August 2021. This resulted in 96 results. This is likely an undercount: it ignores papers submitted to venues other than arxiv and papers still being drafted.9Share this postOpenAI\u2019s policies hinder reproducible research on language modelsaisnakeoil.substack.comCopy linkTwitterFacebookEmail9 CommentsW. JamesMar 23\u00b7edited Mar 23Liked by Sayash Kapoor, Arvind NarayananIts not merely researchers that this would impact. That also seems like a problem for commercial applications that were built using a certain model that was good enough for their purposes. I'm new to LLMs and hadn't built anything using them yet, but I gather they can be used to get   a vector embedding for pieces of text for use in things like classification. It seems being forced to change models would  lead to a different embedding vector for everything they've classified, and a need then to re-classify everything from scratch, even if the old model was good enough for their purposes. Its unclear if they simply aren't thinking about the needs of other commercial users since they have Microsoft's $, or cynically Microsoft would prefer they scare   off any other commercial user of OpenAI (so they need to wait and see if Microsoft offers the model on its systems, so they get paid directly, perhaps with it tweaked so it has different embeddings).Expand full commentReply1 replyAlWrites  Al\u2019s Newsletter Mar 23It should surprise nobody. This is the company, after all, that started with this mission statement: \u201eAs a non-profit, our aim is to build value for everyone rather than shareholders. Researchers will be strongly encouraged to publish their work, whether as papers, blog posts, or code, and our patents (if any) will be shared with the world. We\u2019ll freely collaborate with others across many institutions and expect to work with companies to research and deploy new technologies.\u201c And then promptly became a closed source, very much for profit arm of Microsoft.

    "content": "Juice refers to non-essential visual, audio, and haptic effects that enhance a player's experience. It reinforces game objectives by using delightful sounds and gives the player small rewards to encourage them to play. Juicing involves providing bountiful user feedback and a sense of control to make the player feel powerful. The key is to focus on mundane tasks that form the foundation of the software to make the experience more enjoyable, immersive, and memorable. To create a soulful experience, designers must prioritize emotional needs and ask how to make the user feel. Juicing examples include button hover that shows keyboard shortcuts, using tweening for animations, and triggering scripted sequences to teach and entertain in video games.According to Valve's Ken Birdwell, players should always blame themselves for failure in video games as it encourages them to try harder. If a game kills them off without warning, players are likely to blame the game and lose interest, but if there are hints of danger and an opportunity to escape and they still fail, they will feel like they let the game down and try harder. Rewarding players with treats like special effects or sequences also encourages them to continue playing. The TV show Game of Thrones had a complex storyline with many characters and locations, which was solved by juicing the title sequence with a map and labelled locations to help viewers understand geography and remember previous events, improving engagement with the story. Various other techniques are also used to juice up video games, including particles, screen shake, and objects that obey physics.",

    "content": "In a blog post, software engineer Steve Yegge argues that large language models (LLMs) are the biggest change in software engineering since the World Wide Web. Yegge gives examples of demos that turned into massive technology industries and illustrates how LLM-based programming assistants, which can write and explain code, diagnose issues, and perform other IDE tasks, can increase productivity by up to 500%. Despite this potential, many engineers haven't fully realized the power of LLMs and are skeptical. However, Yegge argues that skepticism is misplaced, pointing out that software engineering is an industry that exists because code can't be trusted and is constantly being tweaked by human reviewers.LLM-based coding assistants have a chat interface and can draft emails and answer various code-related questions. They can be fine-tuned on a code base or incorporate a search engine to answer queries faster and more effectively. However, due to the limited context window, what goes on it is vital to the quality of the LLM's output. Therefore, coding assistants need a data moat, or access to data other assistants do not have, to differentiate themselves in the LLM-based coding assistant space. Sourcegraph's platform provides a data moat and powers a new coding assistant called Cody, which is a VSCode plugin and has templated actions, code completions, and a chat interface.Sourcegraph has built a scalable, precise and comprehensive code intelligence platform powered by a world-class search engine and code knowledge graph, resulting in an unfair advantage over others. They have a team of coding assistants, called Cody, that help save time by providing cheat sheets and data moats. The introduction of LLMs (Language Model Miners) in the next year will feel like cheating but help with productivity. The company is open to hiring new team members, including a Head of AI. Users can try Sourcegraph on their code or search millions of open source repositories.",

He joined Starbucks in October, spending months learning the business. That included 40 hours of barista training and donning the baristas' iconic green apron.But he's not hanging up the apron just yet.\"To keep us close to the culture and our customers, as well as to our challenges and opportunities, I intend to continue working in stores for a half day each month, and I expect each member of the leadership team to also ensure our support centers stay connected and engaged in the realities of our stores for discussion and improvement,\" he wrote in a letter to employees Thursday morning.His pledge comes at a rocky time for the company's relationship with its baristas. As of Friday, more than 190 company-owned Starbucks locations have voted to unionize, according to National Labor Relations Board data. Workers have cited unsafe working conditions, understaffing and unreliable scheduling as some of the reasons why they're in favor of a union.Before joining Starbucks, Narasimhan was chief executive of Reckitt, which owns brands like Lysol and Durex. Previously, he worked at PepsiCo and McKinsey.TVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenTVWATCH LIVEWATCH IN THE APPUP NEXT |   ETListenSubscribe to CNBC PROLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSelect Personal FinanceCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelSupply Chain ValuesSelect ShoppingClosed CaptioningDigital ProductsNews ReleasesInternshipsCorrectionsAbout CNBCAd ChoicesSite MapPodcastsCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

    "content": "Jaron Lanier, the godfather of virtual reality, believes that the danger of artificial intelligence (AI) isn't that it will destroy humanity, but that it will drive us insane. In his opinion, the use of technology and AI could cause people to become \"mutually unintelligible\" or \"insane\" by spreading misinformation and causing political upheaval. Lanier doesn't like the term \"artificial intelligence\" and disapproves of the idea that AI will surpass human intelligence. He states that the use of AI algorithms to choose what videos or posts we see on social media platforms diminishes choice and reduces critical thinking. Lanier hopes that future chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard, could challenge this and provide a more varied choice.Jaron Lanier, the \"father of virtual reality\" and a pioneer in technology, has warned that AI has the potential to cause humanity's extinction, especially when it comes to the creation of fake news on a massive scale. While some aspects of the internet are \"cool\", Lanier thinks platforms such as TikTok should be banned due to their Chinese ownership and the \"horrible tactical uses they could be put to\". Social media has \"brought out the worst in us\" and turned users into \"phonies who are self-concerned but lose empathy\" for others, he said. Lanier calls for a focus on the \"mystical interiority to people\" and our humanness to ensure AI and technology serve society.",

For example, it survived Max-Q \u2014\u00a0the part of flight during which the structural loads are highest on a rocket \u2014 and its first and second stages separated successfully. But something went wrong shortly thereafter, at around three minutes into the flight, when the rocket failed to reach orbit.\"No one's ever attempted to launch a 3D-printed rocket into orbit, and, while we didn't make it all the way today, we gathered enough data to show that flying 3D-printed rockets is viable,\" Relativity Space's Arwa Tizani Kelly said during the company's launch webcast on Wednesday night.\"We just completed a major step in proving to the world that 3D-printed rockets are structurally viable,\" she added.Video: Relativity Space CEO Tim Ellis on 3d-printed rockets and the futureImage 1 of 2Relativity Space's first Terran 1 rocket streaks toward space in this long exposure view of its debut test launch from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on March 22, 2023.

(Image credit: Relativity Space)Indeed, Relativity Space is likely celebrating at the moment. Rockets rarely perform perfectly on their first-ever liftoff; Japan's new H3 rocket failed during its debut flight earlier this month, for example. And Relativity Space co-founder Tim Ellis said before launch that getting through Max-Q was \"the key inflection\" for the GLHF mission.\"This will essentially prove the viability of using additive manufacturing tech to produce products that fly. We already effectively did this in ground testing, pushing and prodding well above this max stress successfully on both stages in a simulated worst-case flying environment, and have tested over 12,000 seconds of engine hot fires across dozens of articles \u2014 so I think we've done this already, but in flight of course is the most visceral proof,\" Ellis tweeted on March 7 (opens in new tab).The second stage of Relativity Space's first Terran 1 rocket comes to life briefly after stage separation during a test launch on March 22, 2023. It failed to reach orbit. (Image credit: Relativity Space)Relativity Space, which Ellis and fellow Blue Origin alum Jordan Noone founded in 2016, aims to launch relatively small payloads with the expendable, two-stage Terran 1. The 110-foot-tall (33 meters) rocket is capable of delivering up to 2,756 pounds (1,250 kilograms) to low Earth orbit, according to Relativity Space (opens in new tab), which is selling Terran 1 launches for $12 million apiece.But the rocket didn't carry an operational payload on GLHF \u2014 just a 3D-printed ring that serves as a memento. (This first Terran 1 rocket was about 85% 3D-printed material by mass, but the company aims to get that number up to about 95% on future vehicles.)Relativity Space will build off GLHF's milestones, if all goes according to plan. The company has already inked $1.65 billion's worth of customer launch contracts.Some of that money booked Terran 1 flights, but the vast majority, Ellis said in another March 7 tweet (opens in new tab), is earmarked for launches of the Terran R. That latter rocket is a bigger, more powerful and reusable vehicle that Relativity Space plans to start flying as early as next year.The 216-foot-tall (66 m) Terran R, which is also built via 3D printing, will be capable of lofting up to 44,000 pounds (20,000 kg) to LEO. The rocket's development will be aided considerably by GLHF, according to Relativity Space.The nine engines of Relativity Space's Terran 1 rocket first stage leave a blue exhaust plume from its liquid methane fuel.

Terran 1 is fueled by liquid methane and liquid oxygen, for example, and it tried to become the first such \"methalox\" rocket to reach orbit (in addition to the first 3D-printed vehicle to do so).\u00a0The methalox combo is favored by Mars exploration advocates, as both methane and oxygen can be sourced locally on the Red Planet. For example, SpaceX's giant next-gen Starship vehicle, which Elon Musk believes could make Mars colonization economically feasible, is a methalox rocket as well..\u00a0Wednesday's launch was Relativity Space's third try at a debut liftoff for the Terran 1. An attempt on March 8 was\u00a0scrubbed due to issues with fuel temperatures\u00a0in the rocket's upper stage, and another on March 11 was foiled by weather and range safety delays and two separate aborts.Space.com writer Elizabeth Howell contributed to this story.Mike Wall is the author of \"Out There (opens in new tab)\" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), a book about the search for alien life.

    "content": "\n\n    Introducing Butler Virtual Operating System \u2013 Tristan's Zettelkasten\n  \n\n      Blog\n    \n\n      Tristan de Cacqueray\n    \n\n    Introducing Butler Virtual Operating System\n  \n\n      This post introduces haskell-butler, a virtual operating system that runs multi-players applications on the web. In two parts, I present:\n    \n\n          The project\u2019s overview, and,\n        \n\n          A motivating use-case; a remote desktop that looks like this:\n        \n\nHobby Project\n\n      Before I begin, let me set the expectations. Butler is a hobby project inspired by the SerenityOS project. I am working on it on my free time as a challenge and learning experience. Moreover I am considering alternative runtimes and protocols. Therefore the implementation is subject to change.\n    \n\n      That being said, the project reached a point where it is now enjoyable, and I\u2019m happy to share its current state with you.\n    \nModular Operating System\n\n      Butler\u2019s goal is to implement a virtual operating system with a strong focus on concurrency. Butler is not a computer hardware operating system. Instead, Butler is an application environment that runs on top of an existing system.\n    \n\n      Thus I created the following modules:\n    \n\n      Starting with the Core layer, I designed low level interfaces for the host system:\n    \n\nProcess for thread management, powered by the ki library.\n        \n\nPipe for inter-process communication using stm.\n        \n\nFile for directory and file objects.\n        \n\nNetwork to serve Web Application Interface wai.\n        \n\n      Then in the Main layer, I implemented higher level interfaces on top of the Core primitive:\n    \n\nScheduler for the process hierarchy and supervision.\n        \n\nDisplay for graphical user interfaces.\n        \n\nSession for users.\n        \n\nFrame for the a data exchange format.\n        \n\n      Finally, the App layer provides the application environment:\n    \n\nWindow for app instance.\n        \n\nCursor for user pointer.\n        \n\nSound to produce and receive audio.\n        \n\nAgent to forward local agent.\n        \n\n      I find it valuable to model these APIs after regular operating system constructs. They are available through a single top level Butler module. The next section introduces the application environment.\n    \nApplication Actor\n\n      Butler applications are implemented as standalone processes that operate a AppEvent pipe. Checkout the App definition. Applications start with a AppContext provided by the display.\n    \n\n      In order to run multiple application concurrently, Butler features a data exchange format to share a single socket per client. Applications output:\n    \n\n          HTMX payload, by suffixing the application id. For example the UI are mounted on: <div id=\"w-$pid\">.\n        \n\n          Binary payload, by encoding the application id at the beginning of the buffer: | $pid | server-data |\n\n      Applications receive:\n    \n\n          HTMX trigger, by suffixing the trigger name with the application id: {\"HEADERS\": {\"HX-Trigger\": \"$trigger-$pid\"}}\n\n          Binary payload, using the same application id encoding: | $pid | client-data |\n\n      The key design is that clients are dumb terminals and the state is controlled server side. A good example is the text editor app named Noter. This app leverages the whole application environment to implement an etherpad like text editor.\n    \nHaskell RunTime System\n\n      In this section I explain the choice of using Haskell. Beyond the language\u2019s common features, here are two reasons for using Haskell:\n    \n\n          The language lets you break down any problem into smaller chunks, using let or where bindings. I find this syntax and way of thinking very helpful for simplifying complex software.\n        \n\n          The REPL evaluates modification almost instantaneously. I run development code through ghcid, and thanks to a simple client\u2019s reconnect handler, the services are hot reloaded in milliseconds when the source changes.\n        \n\n      However, even though the Haskell ecosystem is quickly improving, it is not a mainstream language, and it can be rough around the edges. Here are a couple of alternative languages that I am also considering:\n    \n\nRust, because it is very similar to Haskell. Though it can be more complicated: for example, some expressions don\u2019t seem to be decomposable into sub expressions without triggering the borrow checker. And the lack of REPL to evaluate the code interactively is frustrating.\n        \n\nGleam, because it leverages the BEAM virtual machine, which is a great fit for application actors.\n        \n\n      That being said, Haskell works great for Butler. So far I have only used its most basic features, and the project source is only 5k lines of code according to polyglot.\n    \nHTML5 Graphical User Interface\n\n      In this section I explain the choice of using HTML5 for the GUI. I choose HTML5 because it is an ubiquitous standard and the Web API offers a fully featured application environment. Thanks to the hypermedia paradigm enabled by htmx, it is a great fit for Butler.\n    \n\n      Though it would be interesting to investigate morphdom and rich client alternatives, such as Web GPU or Flutter.\n    \nApplication Demos\n\n      Here is a list of demos I am using to validate the core implementation:\n    \n\nButler.App.Noter: a text editor.\n        \n\nButler.App.FileManager: a file manager.\n        \n\nButler.App.Mumbler: a voice chat.\n        \n\nButler.App.Tabletop: a free form tabletop simulator.\n        \n\nButler.App.Terminal: a legacy terminal.\n        \n\nButler.App.NoVnc: a VNC client.\n        \n\n          And a few other system applications you can find in the Butler.App directory.\n        \n\n      I am mostly focusing on the desktop use-case, but I also helped my colleague fboucher use Butler to create a game named HazardHunter.\n    \nRoad-map\n\n      A terminal and VNC client are already provided to access non Butler applications, and perhaps it is possible to re-implemented these legacy system as Butler native applications. For example, I am looking forward adding:\n    \n\n          Programming REPL.\n        \n\n          Media player named \u201cAmpler\u201d.\n        \n\n          IRC and Matrix client.\n        \n\n          Agenda and calendar.\n        \n\n          More video games.\n        \n\n      Moreover, I would like to develop the Butler APIs to include:\n    \n\n          Application testing framework, to simulate actor\u2019s inputs and validate the outputs.\n        \n\n          User\u2019s mailbox and notification system.\n        \n\n          Application debugging strace.\n        \n\n          External identity providers.\n        \n\n          Authorization system.\n        \n\n      Finally, it would be interesting to investigate if and how an app registry could be implemented. For example as a list of packages that could be dynamically loaded/unloaded into a running instance.\n    \nConclusion\n\n      The actor framework looks like a great solution for web applications, and I am quite happy with the Butler\u2019s implementation. Moreover, I am excited about the community discussion for moving Towards an actor framework for Haskell. My implementation is rather limited, and I would be happy to use a common library similar to the erlang/otp.\n    \n\n      Butler may sound like a crazy project, but I believe it is important to pursue fun goals that appear impossible. I would like to quote the author of SerenityOS Andreas Kling: \u201cNever underestimate the power of a bunch of nerds building something just for fun.\u201d\n    \n\n      Finally I would like to thank elmiko for his early feedback and encouragement.\n    \n\n      Cheers!\n    \n\n        #blog\n        \n\n        #haskell\n        \n\n        #butler\n        \n\n      This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License\n\nHacker News\n\n Hacker News\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\nreload\n\n",

Spankchain started development around 2017, and SpankPay launched in 2019.Wyre Payments, the company\u2019s upstream payment processor, terminated SpankPay\u2019s account because Wyre\u2019s new payment processor, Checkout.com, doesn\u2019t allow processing for payments related to sexual businesses, SpankPay said.\u00a0In February, payments through SpankPay were suspended because Wyre indefinitely terminated Spankpay, alleging it was in violation of \u201cthird-party payment processor or network rules,\u201d according to a legal letter sent from Wyre that SpankPay posted to Twitter.\u201cOperating SpankPay in a hostile banking environment has always been challenging, but the escalating attacks have become untenable for our small team and the niche market we serve,\u201d SpankPay tweeted in February.The feeling of waking up to news that payment processors have dumped the company is not an unfamiliar one to Allie Eve Knox, a sex worker and advisor to SpankPay. Knox has been banned from every mainstream payment app available today, including PayPal, Square, Circle, Cashapp, and Venmo, and uses crypto as a way to continue to live and pay the bills. Sex workers face near-constant deplatforming, loss of income, and instability in their work as a result of discriminatory financial institutions and laws. Some have turned to crypto in recent years as a way around discrimination from traditional banks, and as a necessity as their options for finances online dwindle.Advertisement\u201cWe just have to keep going,\u201d Knox said. \u201cAnd it's you know, that's the common song and dance that the whores do. \u2018Okay, we were fucked yesterday, we get up tomorrow, and fix it.\u201d\u00a0In December, Knox and Ameen Soleimani, co-founder of Spankchain, joined adult industry advocacy group The Free Speech Coalition on Congressional visits to discuss financial discrimination against sex workers with legislators.\u00a0\u201cWith so many recent conversations about the banking system and crypto, it was critical to have people who could talk specifically to the mechanics of the discrimination as well as its impact,\u201d Mike Stabile, spokesperson for FSC, told Motherboard. \u201cWe met with Senate and House offices and committees, and were shockingly well received by both sides of the aisle. While the loss of SpankPay is a tragedy for adult businesses and creators, I can only hope that it spurs Congress to take more immediate action.\u201d\u00a0Knox told Motherboard that following SpankPay\u2019s announcement, the sex worker community has been supportive.\u201cWe were seeing so much love yesterday, we were just like, fuck, we're onto something\u2014we still need this, we haven't changed our opinion on crypto,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still believe in this. This is still a solution. We just have to fix some of these issues.\u201dWyre and Checkout.com did not reply to requests for comment.Tagged:sex workbankingORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.Your Email: SubscribeBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy & to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.AdvertisementAbout JobsPartnerVICE VoicesContent Funding on VICESecurity PolicyPrivacy & TermsAccessibility Statement\u00a9 2023 VICE MEDIA GROUP\n\nHacker News\n\n Hacker News\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\nreload\n\n",

The author notes that the React landscape is constantly changing, and new developments may shift the recommendations in the future.React's new \"Start a New React Project\" documentation may be difficult for beginners, as it recommends using Vite instead of Next, which has caused confusion among developers. Previously, beginners were directed towards old documentation and told to use Function Components with Hooks instead. While educators suggest a simpler starting point for React beginners, the new documentation raises the hurdle for them. The change in React starter projects may be rushed, according to a solo developer, and may be seen differently in 2024 when all fundamentals are available.

    "content": "\n\nGoogle Suspends Chinese E-Commerce App Pinduoduo Over Malware \u2013 Krebs on Security\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkip to content\n\nHomeAbout the Author\nAdvertising/Speaking\n\nGoogle Suspends Chinese E-Commerce App Pinduoduo Over Malware\n\nMarch 22, 2023\n\n12 Comments\n \n\nGoogle says it has suspended the app for the Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo after malware was found in versions of the software. The move comes just weeks after Chinese security researchers published an analysis suggesting the popular e-commerce app sought to seize total control over affected devices by exploiting multiple security vulnerabilities in a variety of Android-based smartphones.\nIn November 2022, researchers at Google\u2019s Project Zero warned about active attacks on Samsung mobile phones which chained together three security vulnerabilities that Samsung patched in March 2021, and which would have allowed an app to add or read any files on the device.\nGoogle said it believes the exploit chain for Samsung devices belonged to a \u201ccommercial surveillance vendor,\u201d without elaborating further. The highly technical writeup also did not name the malicious app in question.\nOn Feb. 28, 2023, researchers at the Chinese security firm DarkNavy published a blog post purporting to show evidence that a major Chinese ecommerce company\u2019s app was using this same three-exploit chain to read user data stored by other apps on the affected device, and to make its app nearly impossible to remove.\nThe three Samsung exploits that DarkNavy says were used by the malicious app. In November 2022, Google documented these three same vulnerabilities being used together to compromise Samsung devices.\nDarkNavy likewise did not name the app they said was responsible for the attacks. In fact, the researchers took care to redact the name of the app from multiple code screenshots published in their writeup. DarkNavy did not respond to requests for clarification.\n\u201cAt present, a large number of end users have complained on multiple social platforms,\u201d reads a translated version of the DarkNavy blog post. \u201cThe app has problems such as inexplicable installation, privacy leakage, and inability to uninstall.\u201d\nOn March 3, 2023, a denizen of the now-defunct cybercrime community BreachForums posted a thread which noted that a unique component of the malicious app code highlighted by DarkNavy also was found in the ecommerce application whose name was apparently redacted from the DarkNavy analysis: Pinduoduo.\nA Mar. 3, 2023 post on BreachForums, comparing the redacted code from the DarkNavy analysis with the same function in the Pinduoduo app available for download at the time.\nOn March 4, 2023, e-commerce expert Liu Huafang posted on the Chinese social media network Weibo that Pinduoduo\u2019s app was using security vulnerabilities to gain market share by stealing user data from its competitors. That Weibo post has since been deleted.\n\nOn March 7, the newly created Github account Davinci1010 published a technical analysis claiming that until recently Pinduoduo\u2019s source code included a \u201cbackdoor,\u201d a hacking term used to describe code that allows an adversary to remotely and secretly connect to a compromised system at will.\nThat analysis includes links to archived versions of Pinduoduo\u2019s app released before March 5 (version 6.50 and lower), which is when Davinci1010 says a new version of the app removed the malicious code.\nPinduoduo has not yet responded to requests for comment. Pinduoduo parent company PDD Holdings told Reuters Google has not shared details about why it suspended the app.\nThe company told CNN that it strongly rejects \u201cthe speculation and accusation that Pinduoduo app is malicious just from a generic and non-conclusive response from Google,\u201d and said there were \u201cseveral apps that have been suspended from Google Play at the same time.\u201d\nPinduoduo is among China\u2019s most popular e-commerce platforms, boasting approximately 900 million monthly active users.\nMost of the news coverage of Google\u2019s move against Pinduoduo emphasizes that the malware was found in versions of the Pinduoduo app available outside of Google\u2019s app store \u2014 Google Play.\n\u201cOff-Play versions of this app that have been found to contain malware have been enforced on via Google Play Protect,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters, adding that the Play version of the app has been suspended for security concerns.\nHowever, Google Play is not available to consumers in China. As a result, the app will still be available via other mobile app stores catering to the Chinese market \u2014 including those operated by Huawei, Oppo, Tencent and VIVO.\nGoogle said its ban did not affect the PDD Holdings app Temu, which is an online shopping platform in the United States. According to The Washington Post, four of the Apple App Store\u2019s 10 most-downloaded free apps are owned by Chinese companies, including Temu and the social media network TikTok.\nThe Pinduoduo suspension comes as lawmakers in Congress this week are gearing up to grill the CEO of TikTok over national security concerns. TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, said last month that it now has roughly 150 million monthly active users in the United States.\nA new cybersecurity strategy released earlier this month by the Biden administration singled out China as the greatest cyber threat to the U.S. and Western interests. The strategy says China now presents the \u201cbroadest, most active, and most persistent threat to both government and private sector networks,\u201d and says China is \u201cthe only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do so.\u201d\n\n\r\n         This entry was posted on Wednesday 22nd of March 2023 07:11 PM \r\n         \nA Little Sunshine Data Breaches Latest Warnings Web Fraud 2.0\nBreachForums ByteDance DarkNavy google Liu Huafang PDD Holdings Pinduoduo Project Zero Temu Tiktok Weibo\n\nPost navigation\n\u2190 Why You Should Opt Out of Sharing Data With Your Mobile Provider\n\n\r\n\t\t\t12 thoughts on \u201cGoogle Suspends Chinese E-Commerce App Pinduoduo Over Malware\u201d\t\t\n\nKGIII March 22, 2023 \n\n\u201cTikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, said last month that it now has roughly 150 million monthly active users in the United States.\u201d\nThis figure makes me curious\u2026 That can\u2019t be unique users, can it? Does something approximating 50% of the US population use TikTok? Are those \u2018users\u2019 or \u2018unique users\u2019? \nNote: I have never used said application. I am aware of its existence. I do not live under a rock, after all.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nEd March 23, 2023 \n\nWell if course it\u2019s not unique users. Just today I was helping a poor chap out who was sold another phone with a new contract that he didn\u2019t need. Instead of getting a dual SIM model to allow him to use two networks, he simply bought a new phone and set up a new Gmail account for it. Same user\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nKGIII March 23, 2023 \n\nIt\u2019d be amazing if it was unique users. I ask \u2019cause I have no idea how popular it is. That many unique users would be like Google/Facebook territory, or at least somewhere near the top of the traffic pyramid. \nYour comment about the dude just getting a second phone, I wonder how many are \u2018alts\u2019 and \u2018bots\u2019? I don\u2019t suppose we\u2019ll ever know the real numbers.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nConcerned March 23, 2023 \n\nAnd since tiktok is basically a Chinese psy-op tool at heart \u2013 directing users to items that express hatred of their countries, governments, other peoples, love of China or the Chinese government or their philosophies, and other decision-clouding information \u2013  that \u201c150 million\u201d number is troubling.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nThe Sunshine State March 23, 2023 \n\ni  wouldn\u2019t trust  the Chinese   in just  about  anything.

What is anyone supposed to do with the information?\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nConcerned March 23, 2023 \n\nStop using apps. Get rid of these self-immolating, narcissist-enabling tracking devices and go back to using regular telephones. Of course that will never happen, so you get to deal with the problems.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\ntimeless March 23, 2023 \n\nThe point was to encourage users to either upgrade or replace their phones.\nIf there\u2019s an exploit available for a device, it doesn\u2019t matter who is *currently* exploiting the device, but the fact that *anyone* _could_ exploit the device.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nan_n March 23, 2023 \n\nAuthoritarian kleptocratic regimes deserve no place in open markets.\nChina based companies should be blocked entirely in all app stores.\nKick them out for good, let them divest internationally if they want in.\nThis is exactly what they already do to outsiders in their markets.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nHoward March 23, 2023 \n\nI agree with some of the comments. What good is warning people about an app but refusing to name it? Had I installed this app and read the warning I wouldn\u2019t be doing anything to remove it. May as well issue no warning at all. \nThe company responsible should be barred from releasing apps ever again, and in a perfect world, people arrested. The ladder won\u2019t happen because it\u2019s China after all. Not to say many countries (including the U.S.) wouldn\u2019t participate in the same garbage.\n\nReply \u2192 \n\nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo12March 23 (Reuters) - Accenture Plc lowered its annual revenue and profit forecasts and decided to cut about 2.5% of its workforce, or 19,000 jobs, the latest sign that the worsening global economic outlook was sapping corporate spending on IT services.More than half of the jobs to be cut will be in its non-billable corporate functions, Accenture said on Thursday, sending its shares up 6.4%.Since late last year, the tech sector has laid off hundreds of thousands employees due to a demand downturn caused by high inflation and rising interest rates.Rival Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH.O) last month pointed to \"muted\" growth in bookings, or the deals IT services firms have in the pipeline, in 2022 and forecast quarterly revenue below expectations.IBM Corp (IBM.N) and India's top IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS.NS) have also flagged weakness in Europe, where the Ukraine war has affected client spending.Accenture now expects annual revenue growth to be between 8% and 10%, compared with its previous projection of a 8% to 11% increase.Earnings per share is expected in the range of $10.84 to $11.06 compared with $11.20 to $11.52 previously. The company expects to incur $1.2 billion in severance costs through fiscal 2023 and 2024.\"Companies remain focused on executing compressed transformations,\" Chief Executive Julie Sweet said in a post-earnings call referring to how businesses were trying to become leaner in the turbulent economy.A survey of more than 1,000 IT decision makers by U.S.-based Enterprise Technology Research said they plan to reduce their 2023 budget growth. The growth expectations are now 3.4%, down from 5.6% increase captured in October 2022.\"In short, the data indicates a very difficult environment ahead for consulting firms,\" said Erik Bradley, chief engagement strategist at the technology market research firm.Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Arun KoyyurOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read NextGalleryFuture of MoneycategoryAnalysis: Coinbase, SEC on collision course for 'existential' clash over crypto industry, article with gallery2:10 PM UTCDisruptedcategoryDatabricks pushes open-source chatbot as cheaper ChatGPT alternative, article with image12:02 PM UTCVideoTechnologycategoryFactbox: Why a broad US TikTok ban is unlikely to take effect soon, article with videoMarch 23, 2023DisruptedcategoryVenture capitalists race to land next AI deal on Big Tech's turf, article with image11:08 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world\u2019s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

But in a basement studio, Lee Seung-gi is a master of low-tech tools. Mr Lee, who spent eight years in the film industry, makes sound effects. To conjure the noise of a skeletal monster rising from the ground, he crunches crab shells. For a laser gun, he hooks a slinky to the back of a chair and flicks it: peeoww! Hardest, he says, are simple footsteps, recorded in a tray of gravel: the trudge of a sad character sounds different from the light step of one in love.Listen to this story.

As technology lets games grow larger and more lifelike, they have taken on Hollywood-style budgets and timetables. And as the line between film and digital games blurs, that has two effects. One is that labour markets and production techniques for gaming converge with those of the film business, to the point where some envisage a single production process. The other is that game studios become more focused even than film studios on monetising a few successful franchises.When Allen Adham and two college chums founded what is now Blizzard Entertainment in 1991, making a game didn\u2019t require many people. \u201cRock n\u2019 Roll Racing\u201d, one of Blizzard\u2019s early hits, had a development team of ten, he recalls. Today at Blizzard\u2019s campus, south of Los Angeles, some games are developed by teams of over 500. Leaps in graphical fidelity have created jobs that did not exist; six or more people might work only on lighting effects. In some ways creating a game is harder than making a film, says Rod Fergusson, who is in charge of Blizzard\u2019s \u201cDiablo\u201d series. \u201cMovies have a language and a process that everyone understands,\u201d he says. With games, \u201cyou have to reinvent the camera every time.\u201dAcross the industry, an AAA game (the highest-fidelity sort) might take anything between three and seven years to make. Budgets are kept quiet, but \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d, one of the biggest releases of 2020, was said by its Polish developer, CD Projekt, to have cost 1.2bn zlotys ($275m), which represents a chunky amount even by Hollywood standards.As games become more like films, movie people move in. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crossover now with these various labour markets\u2026the skill set is very interchangeable,\u201d says Asad Qizilbash, head of PlayStation Productions, which makes films and TV series based on Sony\u2019s games. Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog, who created \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d, a hit PlayStation game, co-wrote a TV adaptation released by HBO in January; HBO\u2019s cinematographer paid a return visit to Naughty Dog to share TV techniques. In Los Angeles actors and writers increasingly divide their time between filmed and interactive entertainment: Keanu Reeves had a role in \u201cCyberpunk 2077\u201d, and George R.R. Martin, creator of the Game of Thrones series, wrote the backstory for \u201cElden Ring\u201d, one of last year\u2019s biggest games. The only bit of Hollywood that hasn\u2019t translated to gaming is comedy, which one developer attributes to games\u2019 long gestation periods: \u201cNo joke is funny for three years.\u201dAs the video-game industry sucks in movie talent, Hollywood feeds off games\u2019 intellectual property (IP). Film adaptations of games have a poor record (\u201cOne of the worst movies I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d is the verdict of one gaming boss on Hollywood\u2019s interpretation). But things are changing. Sega\u2019s \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 2\u201d and Sony\u2019s \u201cUncharted\u201d were among last year\u2019s highest-grossing films. A new \u201cMario\u201d movie from Nintendo is due in April and a \u201cGran Turismo\u201d film from Sony in August. Netflix has dozens of game adaptations out or in the works; future ones include spin-offs of \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d, \u201cSplinter Cell\u201d and \u201cBioshock\u201d.More sophisticated games make better material for film adaptation, notes Mr Qizilbash. Today\u2019s producers, who grew up with games, are keen. \u201cIf you talk with Hollywood people, they\u2019re big fans of gaming. They know all our IPs,\u201d says Utsumi Shuji of Sega, who likens his company to a \u201ctreasure island\u201d of properties that are ripe for exploitation. Julia Alexander of Parrot Analytics, a research firm, says \u201cGaming will be in the 2020s what comics IP was in the \u201900s and \u201910s.\u201dTurning games into films and vice-versa is becoming easier as the two use the same technology. Game \u201cengines\u201d, 3D-modelling tools used to make realistic playable environments, can also make virtual sets for TV productions such as \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d, a Star Wars spinoff made by Disney with the help of Epic Games\u2019 Unreal Engine. For the \u201cGran Turismo\u201d movie, digital models from the PlayStation game rehearsed stunts and shots, says Mr Qizilbash. The process works in reverse: Sony plans to scan cars from the movie and put them in the next update of the game.The same digital \u201cassets\u201d (sets, cars, etc) could one day be shared between games and movies. For now, a game\u2019s environment is more interactive than a film\u2019s; and films\u2019 backdrops are higher fidelity than games\u2019. But the two production processes are converging from the gaming side. \u201cThe gamemakers have a more demanding set of requirements for these virtual worlds than the film-makers do. So somebody\u2019s going to invest in a [gaming] simulation that\u2019s photo-realistic. And then they\u2019re going to shoot a movie in it,\u201d says one Hollywood executive. \u201cIt will happen. And it\u2019s probably not too far away.\u201dCompanies that span films and games are well placed. Sony has sat out video \u201cstreaming wars\u201d, declining to launch its own version of Disney+. But it has a pilot in Poland where subscribers to its PlayStation Plus gaming service get access to Sony movies. Such a service could one day let customers watch films like \u201cGran Turismo\u201d before seamlessly switching to a game, or vice-versa.Gamemakers have found different new ways to wring money from old hitsThe growing cost of gamemaking makes them like Hollywood in another way: repetitiveness. Many film fans complain that the box office is overrun with sequels and remakes, as studios become less willing to risk blockbuster budgets on unknown products. All of 2022\u2019s ten highest-grossing movies in America were part of a franchise, from \u201cAvatar\u201d to \u201cThe Batman\u201d. Games, whose lead time makes it even riskier to try new things, have become more predictable. Seven of last year\u2019s ten most-played games on PCs and consoles featured in the previous year\u2019s top ten, says Newzoo, a data company, which studied 37 mainly rich markets. One of this year\u2019s big releases is the 16th instalment of Square Enix\u2019s \u201cFinal Fantasy\u201d, a Japanese series running since 1987.Subscriber modelsWhere movies are locked in endless sequels and prequels, game-makers have found different new ways to wring money from old hits. Developers used to finish making a game and go on holiday. Today, \u201cShipping the game is just the beginning. The real work starts after that,\u201d says Mr Adham. Rather than merely release sequels, Blizzard has turned \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d into a subscription service, with regular updates to maps, missions and characters for those willing to pay. This setup, which is known as \u201cgames as a service\u201d, keeps gamers engaged (and spending) year after year.The model has proved itself. Take \u201cPUBG\u201d, a \u201cbattle royale\u201d shooting game released by Krafton, a South Korean publisher, in 2017. In its first four years the game sold 75m copies at $30 each. But, facing competition from rivals such as \u201cFortnite\u201d, it went free in January 2022, instead charging players for extra features. \u201cTo get more users we went free-to-play, because more users is more fun,\u201d says Kim Chang-han, Krafton\u2019s chief executive. It is also lucrative. Last year the mobile version of \u201cPUBG\u201d, which has been free to play since 2018, was the second-highest grossing mobile game in the world, generating revenue of $2.1bn, says Sensor Tower, a data firm. In the past five years, updates and new features have persuaded \u201cPUBG Mobile\u201d users to part with more than $9bn.\u201cGames are no longer simply consumer packaged goods. They have become live services. That means the name of the game is no longer just to attract players, but to retain them,\u201d says Jack Buser, who runs gaming at Google Cloud. Having failed to crack the game-streaming business with its defunct Stadia platform, Google has repositioned itself to focus on helping developers run live-service games. A live platform needs servers, scalable databases and analytics tools, says Mr Buser. His pitch to developers is: \u201cLet us solve the hard computer-science problems\u2026and that means you can focus on building the world\u2019s best game.\u201dLive-service games have made the industry less hit-driven, says Strauss Zelnick of Take-Two Interactive. His company releases blockbuster sequels to franchises like \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d (GTA). But it also runs \u201cGTA Online\u201d, a game with continually refreshed content. Last year it launched GTA+, a $6-a-month subscription giving players access to more in-game features. It has similar online versions of games like \u201cRed Dead\u201d and \u201cNBA 2K\u201d. These bankable properties keep revenue coming between sequels, making the business less lumpy. \u201cIt used to be a much more volatile business than it is today,\u201d says Mr Zelnick. \u201cIf you want to use an old media analogy, we looked a lot more like the movie business\u2014and now it\u2019s much more like the television business.\u201d\u25a0This article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under the headline \"Mouse, keyboard, action\"From the March 25th 2023 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contents Explore the editionShareReuse this contentSubscribeGroup subscriptionsReuse our contentThe Trust ProjectHelp and contact usKeep updatedFacebookInstagramTwitterLinkedInYouTubeRSSPublished since September 1843 to take part in \u201ca severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress.\u201d The EconomistAboutAdvertisePress centreThe Economist GroupThe Economist GroupEconomist IntelligenceEconomist ImpactEconomist EventsWorking HereEconomist Education CoursesWhich MBA?Executive JobsExecutive Education NavigatorTerms of UsePrivacyCookie PolicyManage CookiesAccessibilityModern Slavery StatementSitemapCalifornia: Do Not Sell My Personal InformationCopyright \u00a9 The Economist Newspaper Limited 2023.

Our friend Simon Ryu (aka @cloneofsimo) applied the LoRA technique to Stable diffusion, allowing people to create custom trained styles from just a handful of training images, then mix and match those styles at prediction time to create highly customized images.\nFast-forward one month, and we\u2019re seeing LoRA being applied elsewhere. Now it\u2019s being used to fine-tune large language models like LLaMA. Earlier this month, Eric J. Wang released Alpaca-LoRA, a project which contains code for reproducing the\u00a0Stanford Alpaca results using\u00a0PEFT, a library that lets you take various transformers-based language models and fine-tune them using LoRA. What\u2019s neat about this is that it allows you to fine-tune models cheaply and efficient on modest hardware, with smaller (and perhaps composable) outputs.\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll show you how to use LoRA to fine-tune LLaMA using Alpaca training data.\nPrerequisites\n\nGPU machine. Thanks to LoRA you can do this on low-spec GPUs like an NVIDIA T4 or consumer GPUs like a 4090. If you don't already have access to a machine with a GPU, check out our guide to getting a GPU machine.\nLLaMA weights. The weights for LLaMA have not yet been released publicly. To apply for access, fill out\u00a0this Meta Research form.\n\nStep 1: Clone the Alpaca-LoRA repo\nWe\u2019ve created a fork of the original Alpaca-LoRA repo that adds support for Cog. Cog is a tool to package machine learning models in containers and we're using it to install the dependencies to fine-tune and run the model.\nClone the repository using Git:\ngit clone https://github.com/daanelson/alpaca-lora\ncd alpaca-lora\n\nStep 2: Get LLaMA weights\nPut your downloaded weights in a folder called\u00a0unconverted-weights. The folder hierarchy should look something like this:\nunconverted-weights\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 7B\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 checklist.chk\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u251c\u2500\u2500 consolidated.00.pth\n\u2502\u00a0\u00a0 \u2514\u2500\u2500 params.json\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tokenizer.model\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tokenizer_checklist.chk\n\nConvert the weights from a PyTorch checkpoint to a transformers-compatible format using this command:\ncog run python -m transformers.models.llama.convert_llama_weights_to_hf \\\n  --input_dir unconverted-weights \\\n  --model_size 7B \\\n  --output_dir weights\n\nYou final directory structure should look like this:\nweights\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 llama-7b\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 tokenizermdki\n\nStep 3: Install Cog\nsudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L \"https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m)\"\nsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog\n\nStep 4: Fine-tune the model\nThe fine-tuning script is configured by default to work on less powerful GPUs, but if you have a GPU with more memory, you can increase MICRO_BATCH_SIZE to 32 or 64 in finetune.py .\nIf you have your own instruction tuning dataset, edit DATA_PATH in finetune.py to point to your own dataset. Make sure it has the same format as alpaca_data_cleaned.json.\nRun the fine-tuning script:\ncog run python finetune.py\n\nThis takes 3.5 hours on a 40GB A100 GPU, and more than that for GPUs with less processing power.\nStep 5: Run the model with Cog\n$ cog predict -i prompt=\"Tell me something about alpacas.\"\nAlpacas are domesticated animals from South America. They are closely related to llamas and guanacos and have a long, dense, woolly fleece that is used to make textiles. They are herd animals and live in small groups in the Andes mountains. They have a wide variety of sounds, including whistles, snorts, and barks. They are intelligent and social animals and can be trained to perform certain tasks.\n\nNext steps\nHere are some ideas for what you could do next:\n\nBring your own dataset and fine-tune your own LoRA, like Cabrita: A portuguese finetuned instruction LLaMA, or Fine-tune LLaMA to speak like Homer Simpson.\nPush the model to Replicate\u00a0to run it in the cloud.

    "content": "\n\nFascination of AWK | Volodymyr Gubarkov\n\nVolodymyr Gubarkov\n\nFascination of AWK\nMarch 2023\nAWK is a delightful mini-language almost unchanged for decades.\nA bare minimum of features includes strings, numbers, functions, associative arrays, line-by-line I/O and shell invocation. Perhaps, if it had fewer features, it would be impossible to program in it at all.\nThere is an opinion that AWK is not suitable for writing serious programs. Even Brian Kernighan (the K in AWK) is convinced that his language is only good for small one-liners. However, this does not prevent enthusiasts from creating rather voluminous programs in AWK:\n\nTranslate shell\nCHIP-8 emulator\nGit Graph Generator\nBibliography manager\nSimple yet powerful command runner (my creation)\n\nThe following experiments are also of interest:\n\nGit Implementation\nAwklisp\nAwkprolog\nGron in Awk (my creation)\n\nThere is a simple explanation for this. A minimum of features liberates creativity. When there is only one way to do something, you don\u2019t spend a lot of time choosing that very way. You concentrate on implementing a pure idea. There is no temptation to add (often) unnecessary abstractions, simply because with such restrictions it is almost impossible to implement them. In addition, there is a sporting interest \u2013 is it really possible to write something functional even in such a language?\nSurprisingly, you can actually get very far with AWK most of the time. Many who tried said they were surprised how well the AWK prototype worked. So, there was not even much point in rewriting it into some more traditional programming language. I don\u2019t think this is an exception, but rather a consistent pattern, due to the true genius of the AWK authors.\n\nI wrote a compiler in awk!\nTo bytecode; I wanted to use the awk-based compiler as the initial bootstrap stage for a self-hosted compiler. Disturbingly, it worked fine. Disappointingly, it was actually faster than the self-hosted version. But it\u2019s so not the right language to write compilers in. Not having actual datastructures was a problem. But it was a surprisingly clean 1.5kloc or so. awk\u2019s still my go-to language for tiny, one-shot programming and text processing tasks.\n\nIn principle, I am inclined to share this opinion. I am even ready to go as far as to say that what can be scripted with AWK, should be scripted with AWK (over Python, Ruby, Node.js, etc.). I\u2019m not saying that you should write large applications, but for medium scripts, AWK is an absolutely fine alternative to mainstream scripting languages with many benefits. A good programmer chooses the most powerful tool for the job, the best programmer chooses the least powerful tool to do the job.\nPersonally, I\u2019ve found that AWK is also a surprisingly good replacement for larger than average shell scripts.\nWhy?\n\nPortability (AWK is a part of the POSIX standard). Probably, Python in this sense is the most expressive opposite. Shells are not a silver bullet either. Often, to be on the safe side you stick to POSIX shell instead of more feature-rich alternatives. However, if you take this article, which promotes writing POSIX shell, you\u2019ll notice that all of its arguments apply equally or even better to AWK.\nVery clean C-like syntax\nPowerful associative arrays\nPowerful string functions\nThe language is very minimalistic and non-redundant\nEasy interoperability with the shell. While the AWK core is very small, the full power of the standard *nix utilities is at your disposal.\nThe language is very stable. If you read the canonical book on AWK, published back in 1988 (a masterpiece!), you can be sure that you know the whole language. It is unlikely that anyone would dare to say the same even about POSIX shell.\n\nI also want to cite a programmer Vladimir Dinev, who also creates some interesting projects with AWK:\n\nWhy shell + awk?\nMainly because of this serendipitous observation:\nThe shell takes as input a string, executes one or more commands based on that string, and these commands output more strings as their result. awk is really good at working with strings. It can read them, write them, split them, compare them, match a regex, mostly anything you would want to do with a string. With the added bonus of doing math. The shell can call awk and awk can call the shell. The shell can execute any process, thus awk can execute any process. Therefore, awk can provide any input you can provide to the shell and make sense of any result. The shell and awk are best friends. With their help the Unix environment turns into this huge high level API. The equivalent of a function call is now running a process and all data gets a uniform representation - the string. Which is perfectly readable and writable by humans as well as by awk. Any script is now possible, all tedium begone!\nBut wait - there\u2019s more. awk gives you the string, which can represent any scalar value. It also gives you the hash table, which can represent any object and data structure. It gives you a runtime stack, so you have recursion. It gives you pass by reference, so you can return more than a single value. So as long as your input and your output are text, any and all processing is possible. And what\u2019s made out of text? Source code. You got everything you need to read source, process source, and write source. And what can you do with that? Create a language, of course. And that language could as well be able to call the shell, which can call awk, which can call the shell, which\u2026\nP.S. Also, bash and awk come with virtually any Unix environment, so that\u2019s pretty nice as well.\n\nNow, with my intellij-awk, which adds native AWK support to IntelliJ IDEA, it becomes justifiable to write even larger AWK scripts without much concern.\nLinks\n\nWhy Learn AWK? \u2013 great article by\nJonathan Palardy conveying similar ideas\nPython vs. awk \u2013 a remarkable case of replacing a 50 line Python script with 5 lines of AWK\nThe AWK Programming Language \u2013 the book by the AWK creators, a must-read!\n\nHacker News\n\n Hacker News\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\nreload\n\n",

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an\nunprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our\ninvestigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active\ndevelopment by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of\na new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that\nexhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the\nrising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that,\nbeyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that\nspan mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without\nneeding any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's\nperformance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly\nsurpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's\ncapabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet\nstill incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.\nIn our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its\nlimitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper\nand more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for\npursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude\nwith reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and\nfuture research directions.\n\n    \n\nSubjects:\n\nComputation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)\n\nCite as:\narXiv:2303.12712 [cs.CL]\n\n\u00a0\n(or \narXiv:2303.12712v1 [cs.CL] for this version)\n          \n\n\u00a0\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.12712\n\nFocus to learn more\n\n                arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite\n              \n\nSubmission history From: Sebastien Bubeck [view email]\n      [v1]\nWed, 22 Mar 2023 16:51:28 UTC (13,667 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\nDownload:\n\nDownload a PDF of the paper titled Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4, by S\\'ebastien Bubeck and 13 other authors\nPDF\nOther formats\n\n    Current browse context: cs.CL\n\n<\u00a0prev\n\n\u00a0 | \u00a0\n\nnext\u00a0>\n\nnew\n | \nrecent\n | \n2303\n\n    Change to browse by:\n    \ncs\ncs.AI\n\nReferences & Citations\n\nNASA ADSGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\n\na\nexport bibtex citation\nLoading...\n\nBibtex formatted citation\n\u00d7\n\nloading...\n\nData provided by: \n\nBookmark\n\nBibliographic Tools\n\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\n\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n\nLitmaps Toggle\n\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n\nscite.ai Toggle\n\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n\nCode, Data, Media\n\nCode, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nDagsHub Toggle\n\nDagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n\nLinks to Code Toggle\n\nPapers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n\nScienceCast Toggle\n\nScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n\nDemos\n\nDemos\n\nReplicate Toggle\n\nReplicate (What is Replicate?)\n\nSpaces Toggle\n\nHugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n\nRelated Papers\n\nRecommenders and Search Tools\n\nLink to Influence Flowers\n\nInfluence Flowers (What are Influence Flowers?)\n\nConnected Papers Toggle\n\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n\nCore recommender toggle\n\nCORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n\nAuthor\nVenue\nInstitution\nTopic\n\n        About arXivLabs\n      \n\narXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

My intention is to keep this Complexity Series as readable and digestible by anyone regardless of their technical background.\nIn order for us to understand how the current trends came about and why the computer science community is so focused on A.I. and complex systems in general, we first need to understand the underlying problem(s) that the community is trying to address. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll kick this series off by introducing the topic of Computational Complexity and specifically a problem known as P vs. NP. From there, we\u2019ll dive into the specifics of A.I. in the next chapter and what type of advancements we can expect moving forward. So let\u2019s start this series with a fun little thought experiment.\nIntroducing the problem: The Ultimate Offer\nImagine the following scenario: The powers that be offer you endless amounts of money and fame if you could solve 4 simple math problems that any 12 year old gets to work on in school. There are only two caveats:\n\nYou must do the calculations by hand. No calculators or external aid of any kind.\nYou have a time limit of 20 minutes to solve all 4 problems.\n\nYou think to yourself: \u201cHeck yea, why not? That sounds like a great deal. I\u2019ll do it!!\u201d\nProblem #1:\nQuestion: What is the product of 111 x 133?Your answer: 111 x 133 = 14763\nThis took you 15 seconds to solve and check for errors. The test administrator verifies your answer and congratulates you on your success!\nProblem #2:\nQuestion: Which two integers (factors) multiply to produce 121? You cannot use 1 x 121 as it is considered cheating!Your answer: 121 = 11 x 11\nIt took you 15 seconds to solve and check for errors. The test administrator verifies your answer and congratulates you on your success!\nProblem #3:\nQuestion: What is the product of 654151 x 943343?Your answer: 654151 x 943343 = 617088766793\nThis took you ~3 minutes to solve and double check for errors. The test administrator once again verifies the answer and congratulates you. On to the fourth and final problem.\nProblem #4:\nQuestion: Which two integers (factors) multiply to produce 201863? You cannot use 1 x 201863 as it is considered cheating!\nYou take a few minutes to think things through and come to the realisation that you don\u2019t know of any easy way to solve this problem. The only thing that comes to mind is the \u201cguess and check\u201d method. So you grab your pen and paper and get to work:\n2 is not a viable factor because 201863 / 2 = 100931.5 which is not an integer.3 is not a viable factor because 201863 / 3 = 67287.66 which is not an integer...67 is not a viable factor because 201863 / 67 = 3012.88 which is not an integer..\nBefore you know it, time is up. 20 minutes passed and you\u2019ve unfortunately failed to generate the right answer in time. So what went wrong?\nFor the #1st problem, multiplying two 3-digit numbers took you 15 seconds, meanwhile multiplying two 6-digit numbers in the #3rd problem took you 3 minutes. It is obviously the case that as the numbers scale and grow larger, more time and work/effort is required to solve them. But even then, 3 minutes was a pretty decent time.\nFor problems #2 and #4, going from 3-digit number (121) to a 6-digit number (201863) resulted in a much bigger increase in the amount of work/effort required. This is because while these two problems, multiplication and factorization, may seem similar, they are actually very very different in nature.\nAll problems are not born equal: P vs. NP\nIn the early days of computing, scientists were busy grouping problems by their scaling difficulty. Some problems, like multiplication, seemed to have algorithms (like the ones you learn in school) that we\u2019ve discovered to solve for them in a relatively short amount of time. As the number of digits grows and the problem gets harder, our algorithms seem to keep up. Other problems, like factorization, seem to elude us. In spite of our best efforts, we can\u2019t figure out good algorithms for solving them quickly.\nSo, in order to formalise these observations and get a better handle on the situation, computer scientists and mathematicians created classes (buckets) of problems. When we encounter a computational problem, we look at how difficult it is to solve at scale, and based on that difficulty we place it into one of the classes/buckets. Initially the following classes were created:\n\nVerifiability, the act of being able to prove the correctness of an answer, turned out to be just as important as being able to generate the answer itself. If I were to ask you what the product of 111 x 133 is, you could compute that in a short period of time as you did in Problem #1. The test administrator verified your answer by doing that same multiplication and compared the results in order to check for mistakes. That\u2019s exactly what all techers do for their students;\u00a0 They compute and compare in order to verify. The fact that the multiplication problem is so easily solvable is what also made it possible for the test administrator to check your solution for mistakes.\nIn the #4th problem however (factoring 201863), it took you a long time and you still did not manage to produce a solution. Yet, if I were to tell you that 201863 has the factors 337 and 599, you could easily check my work by multiplying the two factors to see if they actually produce the right number. In other words, for the factorization problem, checking an answer for errors is easier than finding the two numbers. This is the difference between P and NP.\nP is a class of problems that are easy to solve and easy to verify. For the sake of simplicity we can define \u201ceasiness\u201d as: being solvable in a reasonable amount of time.\nNP, on the other hand, is a class of problems that are hard to solve yet easy to verify.\nEXP is a class of problems that are hard to solve and hard to verify.\u00a0A classic example of an EXP problem would be a generic chess game. Think of a randomly generated chess board configuration with pieces all over the place, what\u2019s the best move to make there? What algorithm do you even use to find out what the best move is? How can you even verify the correctness of any given suggestion?\nIt all boils down to scale. As you scale things up (in our math test we scaled the number of digits), certain problems grow much faster in difficulty than others and quickly become out of reach. And while we\u2019re currently discussing algorithms and math questions, the same actually applies for any given problem we might face. Cooking dinner for two people is not the same as running a restaurant \u2013 even though the act of cooking might be the same. Scale is, and will always be, the fundamental challenge we have to overcome when solving important generalised problems of any kind.\nEvery decade or so we come across an algorithm that takes a problem from the NP domain to the P domain. This happens because some clever person makes a breakthrough that solves that problem much faster than we previously thought was possible. So the question now remains: is every NP-problem a P-problem in hiding? or are these classes fundamentally different and NP problems will forever be hard to solve?\u00a0\nWhy is this so important?\u00a0\nThere is a whole host of problems in NP that are extremely important for us to solve. They range from problems in encryption/security and cryptocurrency mining to computational biology (ex. cancer research) and language. A subset of these problems are known as NP-Complete. That means that finding a solution that lets us solve any one of those problems will immediately help us solve all of them.\nAn example of this would be if you can find a fast algorithm for playing an N x N size sudoku (yes sudoku the game an NP problem), you\u2019ve essentially rendered most online encryption systems completely useless because those are based on NP problems as well. You can use that sudoku algorithm to break into peoples\u2019 bank accounts. You can apply that solution to the protein folding problem which could help us find cures for diseases and thereby extending the average human lifespan. Heck, you could even use that algorithm to cause a lot of global political turmoil if you wanted to.\nThis is why the P vs NP question is so important. Hard to solve problems (NP/EXP/etc.) are the next frontier for us to conquer. Artificial Intelligence systems are actually nothing more than a way for us to try to approximate solutions for these hard to solve problems. And while A.I. may at first glance seem unrelated to the P vs NP problem, nothing could be further from the truth.\nThis first article was meant to set the stage. In part 2 of this series I\u2019ll be diving into A.I. specifically and why what you\u2019re seeing should both terrify as well as excite you. So stay tuned for the next one!\nIn the meantime, here is a phenomenal video for those of you that would like to learn more about P vs NP.\n\nShare this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading...\n\nAIComplexityComputational ComplexityP vs Np \n\nPost navigation\nPrevious Post: Due Diligence Advice For Founders\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2 comments\t\t\t\t\n\n Carty says: \n\nMarch 24, 2023 at 1:31 pm \n\nnicely done, thanks\nLikeLike\n\nReply \n\n\t\t\t\tPingback: Introduction to P vs. NP by wesammikhail - HackTech \n\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\n\nEnter your comment here...\n\nFill in your details below or click an icon to log in:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nEmail (required) (Address never made public)\n\nName (required)\n\nWebsite\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t(\u00a0Log\u00a0Out\u00a0/\u00a0\n\t\t\t\tChange\u00a0)\n\t\t\t\n\nCancel\nConnecting to %s\n\n Notify me of new comments via email.

This can be frustrating if you want to keep track of a particular conversation, as you constantly have to seek through the tree to find the latest comment.\nI solved this problem in three different ways today. I'll detail them in increasing orders of complexity (which frustratingly is the reverse order to how I figured them out!)\nThe easiest way: Algolia search\nThe official Hacker News search uses Algolia, with a constantly updated index.\nIf you search for story:35111646, filter for comments and then order by date you'll get the comments for that particular story, most recent at the top. Problem solved!\nHere's the URL - edit the story ID in that URL (or on the page) to view comments for a different story.\nhttps://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&page=0&prefix=false&query=story:35111646&sort=byDate&type=comment\n\nThe Algolia search_by_date API\nThe Algolia Hacker News API is documented here: https://hn.algolia.com/api\nNote that this is a separate system from the official Hacker News API, which is powered by Firebase, doesn't provide any search or filtering endpoints and is documented at https://github.com/HackerNews/API\nTo retrieve all comments on a specific story ordered by date, most recent first as JSON you can hit this endpoint:\nhttps://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=comment,story_35111646&hitsPerPage=1000\nThe tags= parameter does all of the work here - we're asking it for items of type comment that have been tagged with story_35111646.\nThis returns 20 results by default. I've added &hitsPerPage=1000 to get back the maximum of 1,000.\nThis gives you back JSON, but how can we turn that into something that's more readable in our browser?\nLoading that into Datasette Lite\nI'm going to use Datasette Lite, my build of Datasette running directly in the browser using Python compiled to WebAssembly. More on how that works here.\nThis is possible because the Algolia API returns JSON with a access-control-allow-origin: * CORS header, allowing that data to be loaded by other web applications running on different domains.\nIf you pass Datasette Lite a ?json= parameter with the URL to a JSON file that returns a list of objects, it will use sqlite-utils to load that JSON into a SQLite table with a column for each of the keys in those objects.\nThis URL loads that data:\nhttps://lite.datasette.io/?json=https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=comment%2Cstory_35111646\nWe can navigate to the search_by_date table to browse and filter the comments.\n\nLet's make some improvements to how it's displayed using a custom SQL query and some Datasette plugins.\nDatasette Lite supports some Datasette plugins - you can add ?install=name-of-plugin to the URL to install them directly from PyPI.\nI'm going to load two plugins:\n\ndatasette-simple-html adds SQL functions for escaping and unescaping HTML text and stripping tags\n\ndatasette-json-html provides a mechanism for outputting custom links in column results\n\nHere's a URL that loads those two plugins:\nhttps://lite.datasette.io/?install=datasette-simple-html&install=datasette-json-html&json=https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search_by_date?tags=comment%2Cstory_35111646%26hitsPerPage=1000\nNow here's a custom SQL query that makes the comments a bit nicer to read when they are displayed by Datasette:\nselect\n  created_at,\n  author,\n  html_unescape(\n    html_strip_tags(comment_text)\n  ) as text,\n  parent_id,\n  _tags\nfrom\n  search_by_date\norder by\n  created_at desc\nThis link will execute that SQL query against the data in Datasette Lite.\nOne last trick: it would be neat if we could click through from the results to the comment on Hacker News. Here's how to add that, using a trick enabled by datasette-json-html:\nselect\n  json_object(\n    'label', objectID,\n    'href', 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=' || objectID\n  ) as link,\n  created_at,\n  author,\n  html_unescape(\n    html_strip_tags(comment_text)\n  ) as text,\n  parent_id,\n  _tags\nfrom\n  search_by_date\norder by\n  created_at desc\nSee the results of that here.\nThis adds link to each comment as the first column in the table.\nIt works by building a JSON string {\"label\": \"35123521\", \"href\": \"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35123521\"} - the plugin then renders that as a link when the table is displayed, using Datasette's render_cell() plugin hook.\n\nThe most complicated solution, with json_tree()\nMy first attempt at solving this was by far the most complex.\nBefore I explored the search_by_date API I spotted that Algolia offers a items API, which returns ALL of the content for a thread in a giant nested JSON object:\nhttps://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/35111646\nTry that now and you'll see that the top level object has this shape {\"id\": ..., \"children\": [...]} - with that `\"children\" array containing a further nested array of objects representing the whole thread.\nDatasette Lite's ?json= parameter expects an array of objects. But... if you give it a top-level object which has a key that is itself an array of objects, it will load the objects from that array instead.\nWhich means passing it the above URL results in a table with a row for each of the top-level comments on that item... plus a children column with the JSON string of each of their descendents.\nYou can try that here:\nhttps://lite.datasette.io/?json=https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/35111646\nSQLite has a robust suite of JSON functions, plus the ability to execute recursive CTEs - surely it would be possible to write a query that flattens that nested structure into a table with a row for each comment?\nI spent quite a bit of time on this. Eventually I realized that you don't even need a recursive CTE for this - you can use the json_tree() function provided by SQLite instead.\nHere's the query I came up with:\nwith items as (select * from [35111646]),\nresults as (\nselect\n  json_extract(value, '$.id') as id,\n  json_extract(value, '$.created_at') as created_at,\n  json_extract(value, '$.author') as author,\n  html_strip_tags(html_unescape(json_extract(value, '$.text'))) as text,\n  json_extract(value, '$.parent_id') as parent_id\nfrom\n  items, json_tree(items.children) tree\nwhere\n  tree.type = 'object'\nunion all\nselect id, created_at, author, html_strip_tags(html_unescape(text)) as text, parent_id\nfrom items\n)\nselect\n  json_object('label', id, 'href', 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=' || id) as link,\n  *\nfrom results order by created_at desc\nTry that out here.\n\nThe key to understanding the above is to understand how json_tree() works. Given a JSON value it returns a huge virtual table representing every node in that tree as a flat list.\nHere's a simple example:\nselect * from json_tree('[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"A\",\n    \"children\": [\n      {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"name\": \"B\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 3,\n    \"name\": \"C\"\n  }\n]')\nTry that against Datasette. The output looks like this:\n\nkey\nvalue\ntype\natom\nid\nparent\nfullkey\npath\n\n[{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"A\",\"children\":[{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"B\"}]},{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"C\"}]\narray\n\n0\n\n$\n$\n\n0\n{\"id\":1,\"name\":\"A\",\"children\":[{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"B\"}]}\nobject\n\n1\n0\n$[0]\n$\n\nid\n1\ninteger\n1\n3\n1\n$[0].id\n$[0]\n\nname\nA\ntext\nA\n5\n1\n$[0].name\n$[0]\n\nchildren\n[{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"B\"}]\narray\n\n7\n1\n$[0].children\n$[0]\n\n0\n{\"id\":2,\"name\":\"B\"}\nobject\n\n8\n7\n$[0].children[0]\n$[0].children\n\nid\n2\ninteger\n2\n10\n8\n$[0].children[0].id\n$[0].children[0]\n\nname\nB\ntext\nB\n12\n8\n$[0].children[0].name\n$[0].children[0]\n\n1\n{\"id\":3,\"name\":\"C\"}\nobject\n\n13\n0\n$[1]\n$\n\nid\n3\ninteger\n3\n15\n13\n$[1].id\n$[1]\n\nname\nC\ntext\nC\n17\n13\n$[1].name\n$[1]\n\nThis is pretty useful! The complex nested object has been flattened for us. Most of these rows aren't relevant... but if we filter for type = 'object' we can get hold of just the nested items within that structure that are complete JSON objects.\nSo that's what my bigger query does.

    "content": "\nPractical libc-free threading on Linux\n\nPractical libc-free threading on Linux\n\n    March 23, 2023\n  \n\n    nullprogram.com/blog/2023/03/23/\n  \nSuppose you\u2019re not using a C runtime on Linux, and instead you\u2019re\nprogramming against its system call API. It\u2019s long-term and stable after\nall. Memory management and buffered I/O are easily\nsolved, but a lot of software benefits from concurrency. It would be nice\nto also have thread spawning capability. This article will demonstrate a\nsimple, practical, and robust approach to spawning and managing threads\nusing only raw system calls. It only takes about a dozen lines of C,\nincluding 4 or so inline assembly instructions.\nThe catch is that there\u2019s no way to avoid using a bit of assembly. Neither\nthe clone nor clone3 system calls have threading semantics compatible\nwith C, so you\u2019ll need to paper over it with a bit of inline assembly per\narchitecture. This article will focus on x86-64, but the basic concept\nshould work on all architecture supported by Linux. The glibc clone(2)\nwrapper fits a C-compatible interface on top of the raw system call,\nbut we won\u2019t be using it here.\nBefore diving in, the complete, working demo: stack_head.c\nThe clone system call\nOn Linux, threads are spawned using the clone system call with semantics\nlike the classic unix fork(2). One process goes in, two processes come\nout in nearly the same state. For threads, those processes share almost\neverything and differ only by two registers: the return value \u2014 zero in\nthe new thread \u2014 and stack pointer. Unlike typical thread spawning APIs,\nthe application does not supply an entry point. It only provides a stack\nfor the new thread. The simple form of the raw clone API looks something\nlike this:\nlong clone(long flags, void *stack);\n\nSounds kind of elegant, but it has an annoying problem: The new thread\nbegins life in the middle of a function without any established stack\nframe. Its stack is a blank slate. It\u2019s not ready to do anything except\njump to a function prologue that will set up a stack frame. So besides the\nassembly for the system call itself, it also needs more assembly to get\nthe thread into a C-compatible state. In other words, a generic system\ncall wrapper cannot reliably spawn threads.\nvoid brokenclone(void (*threadentry)(void *), void *arg)\n{\n    // ...\n    long r = syscall(SYS_clone, flags, stack);\n    // DANGER: new thread may access non-existant stack frame here\n    if (!r) {\n        threadentry(arg);\n    }\n}\n\nFor odd historical reasons, each architecture\u2019s clone has a slightly\ndifferent interface. The newer clone3 unifies these differences, but it\nsuffers from the same thread spawning issue above, so it\u2019s not helpful\nhere.\nThe stack \u201cheader\u201d\nI figured out a neat trick eight years ago which I continue to use\ntoday. The parent and child threads are in nearly identical states when\nthe new thread starts, but the immediate goal is to diverge. As noted, one\ndifference is their stack pointers. To diverge their execution, we could\nmake their execution depend on the stack. An obvious choice is to push\ndifferent return pointers on their stacks, then let the ret instruction\ndo the work.\nCarefully preparing the new stack ahead of time is the key to everything,\nand there\u2019s a straightforward technique that I like call the stack_head,\na structure placed at the high end of the new stack. Its first element\nmust be the entry point pointer, and this entry point will receive a\npointer to its own stack_head.\nstruct __attribute((aligned(16))) stack_head {\n    void (*entry)(struct stack_head *);\n    // ...\n};\n\nThe structure must have 16-byte alignment on all architectures. I used an\nattribute to help keep this straight, and it can help when using sizeof\nto place the structure, as I\u2019ll demonstrate later.\nNow for the cool part: The ... can be anything you want! Use that area\nto seed the new stack with whatever thread-local data is necessary. It\u2019s a\nneat feature you don\u2019t get from standard thread spawning interfaces. If I\nplan to \u201cjoin\u201d a thread later \u2014 wait until it\u2019s done with its work \u2014 I\u2019ll\nput a join futex in this space:\nstruct __attribute((aligned(16))) stack_head {\n    void (*entry)(struct stack_head *);\n    int join_futex;\n    // ...\n};\n\nMore details on that futex shortly.\nThe clone wrapper\nI call the clone wrapper newthread. It has the inline assembly for the\nsystem call, and since it includes a ret to diverge the threads, it\u2019s a\n\u201cnaked\u201d function just like with setjmp. The compiler will\ngenerate no prologue or epilogue, and the function body is limited to\ninline assembly. It cannot even reliably reference its parameters by name.\nLike clone, it doesn\u2019t accept a thread entry point. Instead it accepts a\nstack_head seeded with the entry point. The whole wrapper is just four\ninstructions:\n__attribute((naked))\nstatic long newthread(struct stack_head *stack)\n{\n    __asm volatile (\n        \"xchg   %%rdi, %%rsi\\n\"\n        \"syscall\\n\"\n        \"mov    %%rsp, %%rdi\\n\"\n        \"ret\\n\"\n        :\n        : \"a\"(SYS_clone), \"S\"(0x50f00L)\n        : \"rdi\", \"rcx\", \"r11\", \"memory\"\n    );\n}\n\nOn x86-64, both function calls and system calls use rdi and rsi for\ntheir first two parameters. Per the reference clone(2) prototype above:\nthe first system call argument is flags and the second argument is the\nnew stack, which will point directly at the stack_head. However, the\nstack pointer arrives in rdi. So I load the flags (0x50f00L) into\nrsi, then exchange (xchg) the registers in the inline assembly,\npreparing both system call arguments at once.\nWhere does that 0x50f00L come from? That\u2019s the bare minimum thread spawn\nflag set expressed as a constant. If any flag is missing then threads will\nnot spawn reliably \u2014 as discovered the hard way by trial and error across\ndifferent system configurations, not from documentation. Give it a name if\nyou like, but don\u2019t use an automatic local variable because it\u2019s a naked\nfunction.\n    long flags = 0;\n    flags |= CLONE_FILES;\n    flags |= CLONE_FS;\n    flags |= CLONE_SIGHAND;\n    flags |= CLONE_SYSVSEM;\n    flags |= CLONE_THREAD;\n    flags |= CLONE_VM;\n\nWhen the system call returns, it copies the stack pointer into rdi, the\nfirst argument for the entry point. In the new thread the stack pointer\nwill be the same value as stack, of course. In the old thread this is a\nharmless no-op because rdi is a volatile register in this ABI. Finally,\nret pops the address at the top of the stack and jumps. In the old\nthread this returns to the caller with the system call result, either an\nerror (negative errno) or the new thread ID. In the new thread\nit pops the first element of stack_head which, of course, is the\nentry point. That\u2019s why it must be first!\nThe thread has nowhere to return from the entry point, so when it\u2019s done\nit must either block indefinitely or use the exit (not exit_group)\nsystem call to terminate itself.\nCaller point of view\nThe caller side looks something like this:\nstatic void threadentry(struct stack_head *stack)\n{\n    // ... do work ...\n    __atomic_store_n(&stack->join_futex, 1, __ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);\n    futex_wake(&stack->join_futex);\n    exit(0);\n}\n\n__attribute((force_align_arg_pointer))\nvoid _start(void)\n{\n    struct stack_head *stack = newstack(1<<16);\n    stack->entry = threadentry;\n    // ... assign other thread data ...\n    stack->join_futex = 0;\n    newthread(stack);\n\n    // ... do work ...\n\n    futex_wait(&stack->join_futex, 0);\n    exit_group(0);\n}\n\nDespite the minimalist, 4-instruction clone wrapper, this is taking the\nshape of a conventional threading API. It would only take a bit more to\nhide the futex, too. Speaking of which, what\u2019s going on there? The same\nprincipal as a WaitGroup. The futex, an integer, is zero-initialized,\nindicating the thread is running (\u201cnot done\u201d). The joiner tells the kernel\nto wait until the integer is non-zero, which it may already be since I\ndon\u2019t bother to check first. When the child thread is done, it atomically\nsets the futex to non-zero and wakes all waiters, which might be nobody.\nCaveat: It\u2019s not safe to free/reuse the stack after a successful join. It\nonly indicates the thread is done with its work, not that it exited. You\u2019d\nneed to wait for its SIGCHLD (or use CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID). If this\nsounds like a problem, consider your context more carefully: Why do\nyou feel the need to free the stack? It will be freed when the process\nexits. Worried about leaking stacks? Why are you starting and exiting an\nunbounded number of threads? In the worst case park the thread in a thread\npool until you need it again. Only worry about this sort of thing if\nyou\u2019re building a general purpose threading API like pthreads. I know it\u2019s\ntempting, but avoid doing that unless you absolutely must.\nWhat\u2019s with the force_align_arg_pointer? Linux doesn\u2019t align the stack\nfor the process entry point like a System V ABI function call. Processes\nbegin life with an unaligned stack. This attribute tells GCC to fix up the\nstack alignment in the entry point prologue, just like on Windows.\nIf you want to access argc, argv, and envp you\u2019ll need more\nassembly. (I wish doing really basic things without libc on Linux\ndidn\u2019t require so much assembly.)\n__asm (\n    \".global _start\\n\"\n    \"_start:\\n\"\n    \"   movl  (%rsp), %edi\\n\"\n    \"   lea   8(%rsp), %rsi\\n\"\n    \"   lea   8(%rsi,%rdi,8), %rdx\\n\"\n    \"   call  main\\n\"\n    \"   movl  %eax, %edi\\n\"\n    \"   movl  $60, %eax\\n\"\n    \"   syscall\\n\"\n);\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp)\n{\n    // ...\n}\n\nGetting back to the example usage, it has some regular-looking system call\nwrappers. Where do those come from? Start with this 6-argument generic\nsystem call wrapper.\nlong syscall6(long n, long a, long b, long c, long d, long e, long f)\n{\n    register long ret;\n    register long r10 asm(\"r10\") = d;\n    register long r8  asm(\"r8\")  = e;\n    register long r9  asm(\"r9\")  = f;\n    __asm volatile (\n        \"syscall\"\n        : \"=a\"(ret)\n        : \"a\"(n), \"D\"(a), \"S\"(b), \"d\"(c), \"r\"(r10), \"r\"(r8), \"r\"(r9)\n        : \"rcx\", \"r11\", \"memory\"\n    );\n    return ret;\n}\n\nI could define syscall5, syscall4, etc. but instead I\u2019ll just wrap it\nin macros. The former would be more efficient since the latter wastes\ninstructions zeroing registers for no reason, but for now I\u2019m focused on\ncompacting the implementation source.\n#define SYSCALL1(n, a) \\\n    syscall6(n,(long)(a),0,0,0,0,0)\n#define SYSCALL2(n, a, b) \\\n    syscall6(n,(long)(a),(long)(b),0,0,0,0)\n#define SYSCALL3(n, a, b, c) \\\n    syscall6(n,(long)(a),(long)(b),(long)(c),0,0,0)\n#define SYSCALL4(n, a, b, c, d) \\\n    syscall6(n,(long)(a),(long)(b),(long)(c),(long)(d),0,0)\n#define SYSCALL5(n, a, b, c, d, e) \\\n    syscall6(n,(long)(a),(long)(b),(long)(c),(long)(d),(long)(e),0)\n#define SYSCALL6(n, a, b, c, d, e, f) \\\n    syscall6(n,(long)(a),(long)(b),(long)(c),(long)(d),(long)(e),(long)(f))\n\nNow we can have some exits:\n__attribute((noreturn))\nstatic void exit(int status)\n{\n    SYSCALL1(SYS_exit, status);\n    __builtin_unreachable();\n}\n\n__attribute((noreturn))\nstatic void exit_group(int status)\n{\n    SYSCALL1(SYS_exit_group, status);\n    __builtin_unreachable();\n}\n\nSimplified futex wrappers:\nstatic void futex_wait(int *futex, int expect)\n{\n    SYSCALL4(SYS_futex, futex, FUTEX_WAIT, expect, 0);\n}\n\nstatic void futex_wake(int *futex)\n{\n    SYSCALL3(SYS_futex, futex, FUTEX_WAKE, 0x7fffffff);\n}\n\nAnd so on.\nFinally I can talk about that newstack function. It\u2019s just a wrapper\naround an anonymous memory map allocating pages from the kernel. I\u2019ve\nhardcoded the constants for the standard mmap allocation since they\u2019re\nnothing special or unusual. The return value check is a little tricky\nsince a large portion of the negative range is valid, so I only want to\ncheck for a small range of negative errnos. (Allocating a arena looks\nbasically the same.)\nstatic struct stack_head *newstack(long size)\n{\n    unsigned long p = SYSCALL6(SYS_mmap, 0, size, 3, 0x22, -1, 0);\n    if (p > -4096UL) {\n        return 0;\n    }\n    long count = size / sizeof(struct stack_head);\n    return (struct stack_head *)p + count - 1;\n}\n\nThe aligned attribute comes into play here: I treat the result like an\narray of stack_head and return the last element. The attribute ensures\neach individual elements is aligned.\nThat\u2019s it! There\u2019s not much to it other than a few thoughtful assembly\ninstructions. It took doing this a few times in a few different programs\nbefore I noticed how simple it can be.\n\nc\noptimization\nlinux\nx86\n\nHave a comment on this article?

London, 1695.\n\nCollection History\nPart of Cornell University Library\u2019s Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell\u2019s Witchcraft Collection contains over 3,000 titles documenting the history of the Inquisition and the persecution of witchcraft, primarily in Europe.\nThe majority of the Witchcraft Collection was acquired in the 1880s through the collaborative efforts of Andrew Dickson White, Cornell\u2019s first President, and his first librarian, George Lincoln Burr. The collection documents the earliest and the latest manifestations of the belief in witchcraft as well as its geographical boundaries, and elaborates this history with works on canon law, the Inquisition, torture, demonology, trial testimony, and narratives. The collection focuses on witchcraft not as folklore or anthropology, but as theology and as religious heresy.\nIt features many early texts from the period when the theory of the heresy of witchcraft was being formulated, including fourteen Latin editions of the Malleus maleficarum, which codified church dogma on heresy. Four of these Latin editions were printed in the fifteenth-century, most notably the scarce first edition printed before April 14, 1487. The collection also contains other defining texts of the doctrinal discussion of demonology, such as Jean Bodin\u2019s De la Demonmanie des sorciers (1580), Nicolas Remi\u2019s Daemonlatreiae (1595), Henri Boguet\u2019s Discours des sorciers(1602) and Pierre de Lancre\u2019s Tableau de I\u2019inconstance des mauvais anges (1612). \n\nTranscript of Trial of Maria Renata S\u00e4nger von Mossau, 1749. Open to her Inquisition sentencing.\n\nSignificant in the collection are a small and extremely rare number of works by theologians who opposed the Inquisition, such as those of Cornelius Loos, the first theologian in Germany to write against the witch hunts. The most important materials in the Witchcraft collection, however, are the court records of the trials of witches, including original manuscript depositions taken from the victims. These documents, in both original manuscript and in print, reveal the harsh outcome of the more remote doctrinal disputes. Perhaps the most significant of all manuscripts in the Witchcraft collection is the minutes of the witchcraft trial of Dietrich Flade, a sixteenth-century city judge and rector who spoke out against the cruelty and injustice of the persecutions in the 1580s. These and other trial documents are listed in the collection\u2019s finding aid. \nIn the 21st century, curators began building on AD White\u2019s witchcraft collection by acquiring modern materials such as posters and publicity for films featuring witches or sorcery, and newsletters on the activities of contemporary Wiccan and Pagan communities. \n\nSearch/Browse Digitized Witchcraft Books in English\nWhile the entire physical Witchcraft Collection is available for in-person research in Cornell Library\u2019s Rare and Manuscript Division, 104 English language books from the collection can be read online in the Digital Witchcraft Collection. These titles were digitally scanned from microfilm by Primary Source Media in 1998. The resulting full text scans were later made available to Cornell University Library to enable free public access.\nSearch/Browse the collection\n\nLibrary Resources:\u00a0Library Website / Search / Catalog / Articles & Full-Text / Databases / E-Journal Titles / Images\n\u00c2\u00a92020 Division of Rare & Manuscript Collections, Cornell University Library.\nIf you have a question or comment, please contact us. | Privacy | Web Accessibility Assistance\n\nHacker News\n\n Hacker News\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\nreload\n\n",

    "content": "The Internet Computer repository, which consists of around 600,000 lines of Rust code, migrated to Bazel as its primary build system in 2022. This was due to dissatisfaction with the limitations of the Rust package manager, Cargo, as the project size increased. Cargo is not a build system and has poor caching and dependency tracking. Various tools were used to mitigate these limitations, but they were unsuccessful or proved clumsy. Bazel was chosen for its extensibility and aggressive caching, among other features. The migration process took several months and involved creating a prototype, running CI early, and converting packages to Bazel rules gradually. The new build system simplifies and unifies the development and CI environments while significantly improving cache hit rates.The article details how the team at Dropbox migrated their Rust codebase from Cargo to Bazel build system. Manual treatment was required for many packages, and the generated BUILD file was far from optimal, but the script boosted the conversion process significantly. A team member wrote a utility that visualized the migration progress by inspecting the cargo dependency graph and searching for packages with and without BUILD files, which had a tremendous effect on morale. Eventually, the team could build and test every piece of their Rust code with Bazel. They also ensured test parity with a utility, but Bazel does not yet replicate some cargo features related to developer flow, and many helpful tools in the cargo ecosystem don't yet have an analog in the Bazel world.",

Therefore, we propose Sushi DAO make available a legal defense fund of 3M USDT. This fund will cover legal costs regarding inquiries, litigation, and other issues targeting core contributors. As proposed in March '22, Sushi (Sushi Legal Structure) sought to establish a legal entity to reduce liability for contributors and the DAO. Yet, it has become evident funds must be available to handle legal needs for operational continuity and to protect core contributors.\n\nCause\nSushi, and Head Chef Jared Grey, were recently served with an SEC Subpoena. We\u2019re cooperating with the SEC. We do not intend to comment publicly on ongoing investigations or other legal matters.\n\nCoverage\nThe Sushi DAO Legal Defense Fund will provide coverage for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for the following parties:\n\nCore contributors and multisig participants active since the ratification of Sushi 2.0 (Sushi 2.0: A Restructure For The Road Ahead) to present.\n\nClauses\nDisbursements will occur until legal expenses meet the following requirements:\n\nThe Legal Defense Fund will make ongoing payments until legal proceedings conclude.\n\nIf a contributor resigns or is terminated:\n\nThe Legal Defense Fund will make ongoing payments until legal proceedings conclude.\n\nFinancials\nWe recommend that Sushi DAO makes the following funds available:\n\nTotal: $3,000,000 USDT\n\nAccounting\n\nThe 3M will reside in a new multisig, making funds available for legal representation as needed.\n\nBreakdown\nFunds will come from a combination of the following:\n\nKanpai fees (lump sum): 50%\nGrants (BD revenue): 35%\nSushi (TWAP market sells): 15%\n\nWe believe this breakdown limits the financial burden while providing needed funds for legal expenses, protecting Sushi DAO\u2019s financial solvency, and addressing the immediate need for representation.\n\nContingency\nIf funds deplete, the DAO will make 1M USDT available, as needed, until legal proceedings conclude. The DAO will receive financial disclosures per the Governance Dashboard (coming Q2 23).\nBased on community feedback, two edits are proposed:\n1. The contingency will cap at 2, 1M payouts, bringing the total available funds to 5M, requiring review from the community for extra funds.\n2. Legal coverage will extend to multisig participants with eligibility extended per Coverage terms.\n\nPrecedent\nRecently, MakerDAO provided a similar legal defense fund here: MIP55c3-SP14: Defense Fund - Archive - The Maker Forum. DAOs must execute similar proposals to help manage liability for core contributors.\n\nYes - Establish Legal Defense Fund\nNo - Do Not Establish Legal Defense Fund\n\n0\nvoters\n\n1 Like\n\ndoge\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:07pm\n              \n\n2\n\nReplying to be part of history\n\n3 Likes\n\nTest1\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:08pm\n              \n\n3\n\nHow does \u201csushi\u201d even get subpoenad? The human I get, but sushi is a dao, without centralized entity isn\u2019t it.\nI understand if they go for Jared, but how are they trying to get the dao? By pressuring us with going after Jared?\nI got no letter in my mail and I am the Dao just like all the other members. (Wouldn\u2019t be my jurisdiction anyway, who decides to dedicate their life to crypto and chooses to live in US lol)\nOn the question of funding: Depends on which school we follow. Should we move onto the territory of the old power to fight our fight? Generally probably not. Will we do it anyway for saving our pioneers asses (and their lackin opsec) as a thank you for creating this beautiful neutral space? Probably yes.\n\nmiohtama\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:30pm\n              \n\n4\n\nI understand if they go for Jared, but how are they trying to get the dao? By pressuring us with going after Jared?\n\nYes. The SEC will go for easy victories and the easiest is to grab anyone on the US soil.\nThe simplest solution would be to make sure that Sushi DAO does not have anyone from the US involved from now on. This puts the US contributors and Sushi itself at unnecessary risk.\n\njemus\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:33pm\n              \n\n5\n\nMight want to open a lobbying fund as well to get regulatory clarity on DAO\u2019s. Re domiciling in a different jurisdiction won\u2019t help. The US gov will still come for DAO\u2019s if they decide to.\n\nmiohtama\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:36pm\n              \n\n6\n\nRe domiciling in a different jurisdiction won\u2019t help. The US gov will still come for DAO\u2019s if they decide to.\n\nThe SEC is not all-powerful. They need to pick their battles as well. Going after offshore public figures, especially in crypto-friendly jurisdictions, is much harder than grabbing a local person.\n\n2 Likes\n\nmiohtama\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:47pm\n              \n\n8\n\nJust curious, what is the plan to enforce this?\n\nEveryone who works for Sushi could voluntarily step down from their roles. Then new replacing staff would be elected.\nGary and Mr Burns from Simpsons have some  similarities in their character. I don\u2019t believe anyone wants to deal with him voluntarily.\n\nmartyvb\n\n                March 21, 2023,  5:59pm\n              \n\n9\n\nThere are worse ways to spend the DAO\u2019s Arb airdrop. \n\n1 Like\n\nDefiDebauchery\n\n                March 21, 2023,  6:01pm\n              \n\n10\n\n jaredgrey:\n\nWe do not intend to comment publicly on ongoing investigations or other legal matters.\n\nWhile I fully understand and respect your position, please consider posting their subpoena and claims to help expose the SEC\u2019s lawlessness.

Strange why this step wasn\u2019t taken to inform the DAO previously for things like this. IIRC the old invoicing spreadsheet had 250k retainer payments to law firms regularly without communication to the DAO.\n\nnickjrishwain\n\n                March 21, 2023,  6:57pm\n              \n\n15\n\nA couple of things.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m not actually a Multisig signer yet (only voted on, not actually on multisig), I think a Legal Defense Fund should also apply to those on the multisig.\n\nWe do not have Director & Officers liability insurance and cannot offer it without having a legal structure. I suspect multi-signers can also be targeted by regulators.\n\nWe should make any documentation from regulators visible and available to the community. The SEC is a civil enforcement regulator, not a criminal investigative arm. Transparency is key. If they are coming after our head chef or core contributors for some alleged \u201cwrongdoing\u201d the community needs to see what those allegations are.\n\nFor those reading this comment. Let me be clear that I am NOT accusing head chef or core contributors of wrongdoing. I\u2019m using this as one example.\nIn the real world, a Legal Defense Fund would likely have some limitations for gross negligence or illegal  activities. I would expect Sushi to set some limitations for our Legal Defense Fund. We don\u2019t want to be responsible for defending 25-35 individuals for any and all actions they take.\n\n4 Likes\n\nmountain_goat\n\n                March 21, 2023,  6:58pm\n              \n\n16\n\nWho was treasurer processing the retainer?

As a community, the DAO can decide if a cap should exist or if an open-ended \u201ctop-up\u201d is best. The proposal is a suggested framework based on the precedent set by MakerDAO, with considerations unique to Sushi DAO.\n\n1 Like\n\nChronoFury\n\n                March 22, 2023,  1:38am\n              \n\n22\n\nPost the subpoena, the community deserves to know. Plus, it\u2019ll help to generate further press for Sushi and wider support from the Defi community depending on what is stated in it.\nOtherwise, how do are we supposed to fund something we know nothing about?\n\n5 Likes\n\njaredgrey\n\n                March 22, 2023,  4:48am\n              \n\n23\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot speak publicly more than what was disclosed in the post, which is standard.

Providing such a passcode to a child would be forbidden, except when done by a parent.Specifically, the bills say, the phone filters must prevent children from downloading sexually explicit content via mobile data networks, applications owned and controlled by the manufacturer, and wired or wireless internet networks.Many device manufacturers already have adult content filters available for use, though it is not the norm to have them turned on by default. Many phone makers, for instance, allow parents to easily enable filters on web browsers that prevent children from navigating to websites known to host pornography.In recent years, some phone makers have added sophisticated filters that use artificial intelligence to censor individual images on certain applications.One of these anti-pornography bills was passed into law in 2021 in Utah but cannot go into effect unless five additional states pass similar laws \u2014 a provision included to prevent Big Tech companies from isolating the state after passing the law. This year, Florida, South Carolina, Maryland, Tennessee, Iowa, Idaho, Texas and Montana lawmakers are all considering versions of the bill, with Montana and Idaho\u2019s versions being furthest along in the process.\u00a0In interviews with NBC News, the authors of the original blueprint legislation \u200b\u200b \u2014 representatives from the National Center on Sexual Exploitation and Protect Young Eyes, both advocacy organizations focused on child safety \u2014 said that the original intention of the model bill was to compel device manufacturers to automatically turn on adult filters for web browsers and not other applications. Those filters were already on phones, but not on by default, in 2019 when the draft legislation was first created.\u00a0But Chris McKenna, founder and CEO of Protect Young Eyes, acknowledged that the legislation could also end up applying to other device-level filters created in recent years that some might consider more invasive.In 2021, Apple introduced filters to devices that can scan messages for nudity, blurring any suspected nude images for people who had the filters turned on. The filter, which can be enabled for children by an adult administrator, also offers to connect users to parents or help resources.Most of the state bills under consideration would make device manufacturers liable for criminal and civil penalties if they don\u2019t have filters automatically enabled that meet \u201cindustry standards.\u201d The bills do not define what that standard is or if messaging filters are included.McKenna said that \u201cthe intention is meant to point toward the browsers and the [search] engines that have the filters already in place.\u201d But, he noted, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t find me upset if they chose to turn that on for iMessage.\u201dBenjamin Bull, the general counsel for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said that when he crafted the language of the original model bill, it was designed to narrowly address the issue of child access to internet pornography in a way that avoided potential court challenges.\u00a0After it was drafted, Bull says that NCOSE provided it to various interested parties across the country, and that it eventually found a home in Utah.\u00a0\u201cWe gave it to some constituents in Utah who took it to their legislators, and legislators liked it,\u201d Bull said.\u00a0Since the bill\u2019s passage in Utah, Bull and McKenna said, various interested parties have reached out to them in an effort to bring the bill to their own states.\u201cI mean, almost on a daily basis, from constituents, from legislators. \u2018What can we do? We\u2019re desperate. Do you have a model bill? Can you help us?\u2019 And we said, \u2018as a matter of fact, we do,\u2019\u201d Bull said.Erin Walker, public policy director of Montana child safety organization Project STAND, said that she learned about the bill through a presentation McKenna gave to a child safety coalition. She said she reached out to McKenna, who helped her get it introduced to Montana lawmakers.\u00a0The bill, she noted, was part of a series of legislation in Montana aimed at pornography.\u00a0\u201cIn 2017, we passed HB 247, which established that showing sexually explicit material to a child constitutes sexual abuse. And then in 2019, we passed a resolution declaring pornography to be a public health hazard in the state of Montana,\u201d she said.\u00a0The bill is also part of a wave of legislation across the country aimed at regulating Big Tech.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s just that Big Tech doesn\u2019t want to be regulated,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe have to convince legislators that there is an appropriate amount of regulation in every industry.\u201dProponents of the bills say that signing them into law would be an incremental step for tech companies to take, claiming that new filters wouldn\u2019t be required and that other onerous procedures like age verification wouldn\u2019t be necessary because of how most of the bills are written.\u00a0But differences in languages state by state have created questions for watchdogs about what hoops manufacturers might have to jump through to meet each state\u2019s requirements.Montana\u2019s bill\u2019s language, for instance, appears to suggest that age verification would be required for manufacturers to avoid potential lawsuits or prosecution. According to the draft of the bill, a manufacturer is liable if \u201cthe manufacturer knowingly or in reckless disregard provides the passcode to a minor.\u201dSamir Jain, VP of policy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said the inclusion of such language poses concerns around user privacy and data protection. In theory, manufacturers could be forced to collect age data from customers, via government ID and other forms of identification.\u201cThere are no restrictions as such on how providers can then use this data for other purposes. So even the sort of age verification aspect of this, I think, both creates burdens and gives rise to privacy concerns,\u201d Jain said.Jain also noted that the filter bills create concerns around free expression.\u00a0\u201cI think we have to recognize that filters like these certainly with current technology are far from perfect. They can\u2019t distinguish, you know, for example, nudity that\u2019s prurient or of a sexual nature versus nudity that\u2019s for artistic or other purposes, which the bills at least purport to exempt from regulation,\u201d Jain said. \u201cSo any requirements put in filters, necessarily will mean that those filters will catch lots of images and other material that even the authors of the bill would say shouldn\u2019t be restricted.\u201dJain said that he believes that, given the nuances of what is acceptable viewing material for differently aged children, filters should be deliberately tuned and applied by parents themselves.\u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s appropriate or useful for a teenager versus a 6year-old are quite different,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the provision of different kinds of tools and capabilities that can then be tailored, depending on the circumstances makes a lot more sense than sort of a crude mandatory filtering.\u201dBen GogginBen Goggin is the deputy editor for technology at NBC News Digital.AboutContactHelpCareersAd ChoicesPrivacy PolicyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCA NoticeTerms of ServiceNBC News SitemapAdvertiseSelect ShoppingSelect Personal Finance\u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSALNBC News LogoMSNBC LogoToday Logo\n\nHacker News\n\n Hacker News\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\nreload\n\n",

This enables you to take advantage of modern and performant computing while fine tuning cost optimization. \u00a0 \u00a0 With Suspend/Resume, Generally Available today, you have even more control over your Google Cloud resource consumption. Similar to closing the lid of your laptop, Suspending a Google Compute Engine VM will save the state of your instance to disk allowing you to pick up where you left off when you Resume it later. While your instance is in the SUSPENDED state, you no longer pay for cores or RAM, instead you only pay for the storage costs of your instance memory. Other VM running costs such as OS licensing may also be reduced.\u00a0 How it worksSuspending an instance sends an ACPI S3 signal to the instance\u2019s operating system. This results in 2 significant advantages compared to similar functionalities from other cloud providers.\u00a0First, this allows for broad compatibility with a wide selection of OS images without requiring you to use a cloud specific OS image or installing daemons.\u00a0Undocumented\u00a0and custom OS images that respond to the ACPI S3 signal may also work with Suspend. Feel free to try it out!\u00a0Secondly, storage is dynamically provisioned when Suspend is requested and is separate from the instance\u2019s boot disk. This is in contrast to implementations in other clouds that require you to ensure that you have sufficient empty space in your boot disk to save the instance state which may increase the running costs of your VM. This also ensures that your suspended instance only consumes as much storage as it needs.Use casesMany Google Cloud users have already realized huge savings from Suspending their virtual desktops or developer environments when they are not in use. For example:\u00a0\u201cUtilizing Compute Engine's suspend and resume functionality has allowed BigCommerce to reduce operation costs of our Compute Engine-driven development environment. BigCommerce allows each engineer to customize their environment's \"working hours,\" which triggers suspension at the end of each work day and resumption at the beginning of the next day. This has reduced our Virtual Machine Instance usage times from 168 hours a week to 60 hours a week per environment on average, enabling us to save thousands of dollars each month. We expect these cost-efficiency savings to only increase as our Engineering organization grows.\u201d\u2014Aaron Humerickhouse, Manager, Engineering at BigCommerce\u00a0Another use case is to accelerate horizontal scaling by Resuming suspended instances. While Compute Engine instances have very quick creation times, booting the operating system and loading applications may take longer than you would like when urgently trying to meet a demand spike. One way to address this issue is to initialize instances with the critical applications and Suspend them.

    "content": "\n\nSurprising Scalability of Multitenancy - Marc's Blog\n\nMarc's Blog\n\nAbout Me\n    My name is Marc Brooker. I've been writing code, reading code, and living vicariously through computers for as long as I can remember. I like to build things that work. I also dabble in machining, welding, cooking and skiing.\n\n    I'm currently an engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Seattle, where I work on databases, serverless, and serverless databases. Before that, I worked on EC2 and EBS.\n\nAll opinions are my own.\n    Links\nMy Publications and Videos\n@marcbrooker on Mastodon\n@MarcJBrooker on Twitter\n\nSurprising Scalability of Multitenancy\n\nWhen most folks talk about the economics of cloud systems, their focus is on automatically scaling for long-term seasonality: changes on the order of days (fewer people buy things at night), weeks (fewer people visit the resort on weekdays), seasons, and holidays. Scaling for this kind of seasonality is useful and important, but there's another factor that can be even more important and is often overlooked: short-term peak-to-average. Roughly speaking, the cost of a system scales with its (short-term1) peak traffic, but for most applications the value the system generates scales with the (long-term) average traffic.\nThe gap between \"paying for peak\" and \"earning on average\" is critical to understand how the economics of large-scale cloud systems differ from traditional single-tenant systems.\nWhy is it important?\nIt's important because multi-tenancy (i.e. running a lot of different workloads on the same system) very effectively reduces the peak-to-average ratio that the overall system sees. This is highly beneficial for two reasons. The first-order reason is that it improves the economics of the underlying system, by bringing costs (proportional to peak) closer to value (proportional to average). The second-order benefit, and the one that is most directly beneficial to cloud customers, is that it allows individual workloads to have higher peaks without breaking the economics of the system.\nMost people would call that scalability.\nExample 1: S3\nEarlier this month, Andy Warfield from the S3 team did a really fun talk at OSDI'23 about his experiences working on S3. There's a lot of gold in his talk, but there's one point he made that I think is super important, and worth diving deeper into: heat management and multi-tenancy. Here's the start of the relevant bit on heat2 management:\n\nAndy makes a lot of interesting point here, but the key one has got to do with the difference between the per object heat distribution, the per aggregate heat distribution, and the system-wide heat distribution.\nScale allows us to deliver performance for customers that would otherwise be prohibitive to build.\nHere, Andy is talking about that second-order benefit. By spreading customers workloads over large numbers of storage devices, S3 is able to support individual workloads with peak-to-average ratios that would be prohibitively expensive in any other architecture. Importantly, this happens without increasing the peak-to-average of the overall system, and so comes without additional cost to customers or the operator.\nExample 2: Lambda\nMuch like S3, Lambda's scalability is directly linked to multi-tenancy. In our Firecracker paper, we explain why:\nEach slot can exist in one of three states: initializing, busy,\nand idle... Slots use different amounts\nof resources in each state. When they are idle they consume\nmemory, keeping the function state available. When they are\ninitializing and busy, they use memory but also resources like\nCPU time, caches, network and memory bandwidth and any\nother resources in the system. Memory makes up roughly\n40% of the capital cost of typical modern server designs, so\nidle slots should cost 40% of the cost of busy slots. Achieving\nthis requires that resources (like CPU) are both soft-allocated\nand oversubscribed, so can be sold to other slots while one is\nidle.\nThis last point is the key one: we can't dynamically scale how much memory or CPU an EC2 metal instance has, but we can plan to sell memory or CPU that is currently not being used by one customer to another customer. This is, fundamentally, a statistical bet. There is always some non-zero probability that demand will exceed supply on any given instance, and so we manage it very carefully.\nWe set some compliance goal X (e.g., 99.99%), so that functions\nare able to get all the resources they need with no contention\nX% of the time. Efficiency is then directly proportional to the\nratio between the Xth percentile of resource use, and mean\nresource use. Intuitively, the mean represents revenue, and the\nXth percentile represents cost. Multi-tenancy is a powerful\ntool for reducing this ratio, which naturally drops approximately with $\\sqrt{N}$ when running $N$ uncorrelated workloads on\na worker.\nAnd, of course, for this to work we need to be sure that the different workloads don't all spike up at the same time, which requires that workloads are not correlated. Again, this is not only an economic effect, but also a scalability one. By working this way, Lambda can absorb both long and short spikes in load for any single workload very economically, allowing it to offer scalability that is difficult to match with traditional infrastructure.\nKeeping these workloads uncorrelated requires that\nthey are unrelated: multiple workloads from the same application, and to an extent from the same customer or industry,\nbehave as a single workload for these purposes.\nThis last point is very important, because it illustrates the difference between our real-world setting and idealized models.\nPoisson Processes and the Real World\nWhat I said above is true for Poisson processes, but not nearly as powerful as what we see in the real world, which is interesting because Poisson processes are widely used to model the economics and scalability of systems. To understand why, we need to think a little bit about the sum of two Poisson processes. Say we have two customers of the system, one being a Poisson process with a mean arrival rate of 1 tps ($\\lambda_1 = 1$), and one with a mean arrival rate of 4 tps ($\\lambda_2 = 4$). The sum of the two is a Poisson process with an arrival rate of 5 tps ($\\lambda_t = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 1 + 4$)3. This keeps going: no matter how many Poisson customers you add, you keep having a Poisson arrival process.\nThat's still good, because as you scale the system to handle the higher-rate process, the $c$ in the M/M/c system goes up, and utilization increases.\nBut many real-world processes, like the ones that Andy talks about, are not Poisson. They behave much worse, with much higher spikes and much more autocorrelation than Poisson processes would exhibit. This isn't some kind of numerical anomaly, but rather a simple observation about the world: traffic changes with time and use. I don't use my computer's hard drive once every $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ seconds, exponentially distributed. I use it a lot, then not really at all. I don't use my car that way, or my toaster. And humans don't use the cloud that way either. One use leads to another, and one user and another being on are not independent.\nBut, if you can mix a lot of different workloads, with different needs and patterns, you can hide the patterns of each. That's the fundamental economic effect of multi-tenancy, and the thing that a lot of people overlook when thinking about the economics of the cloud)4.\nFootnotes\n\n Where the definition of short-term depends on how quickly the system can scale up and down without incurring costs. Running on Lambda, short-term may be seconds. If you're building datacenters, it may be months or years.\n To be clear, Andy's talking about logical workload heat here (a hot workload is one doing a lot of IO at a given moment), not physical temperature.\n This StackOverflow question covers it well, and there's a more formal treatment in Stochastic Models in Operations Research.\n One way to think about this is that by summing over multiple non-stationary, autocorrelated, seasonal, and otherwise poorly behaved workloads we're restoring the poisson-ness of the overall workload. That's not too far from the truth, because the Poisson process is the result of summing a large number of independent arrival processes. It's not quite true, but directionally OK in my mind. On the other hand, some sensible people don't support doing math based on vibes, and might object.\n\nOther Posts\n  \u00ab Back to the blog index\n\n07 Mar 2023 \u00bb False Sharing versus Perfect Placement\n07 Feb 2023 \u00bb Hot Keys, Scalability, and the Zipf Distribution\n30 Jan 2023 \u00bb NoSQL: The Baby and the Bathwater\n\n        Marc Brooker\n        The opinions on this site are my own.

The second submission received resulted in a ban over the use of machine-generated content. This wasn\u2019t a surprise.\nOur goals are:\n\nAcquire more legitimate submissions in hopes of building up our inventory.\nTest some simple deterrents in hopes of reducing the quantity of spam submissions. This buys time for the first goal.\nCollect data and identify patterns in spam submissions.\n\nAs of a few minutes ago, we had received 576 submissions and processed 474 of them. 93 have resulted in bans and 7 have been marked as suspicious (a new category meaning they might have used those tools). The overall percentage of spam is down, but the effectiveness of our changes is slightly masked by the natural boom in submissions that follows being closed. There\u2019s also an element of \u201csubmit while you can\u201d in there as it is entirely likely we\u2019ll have to close if prior trends are still in effect. (It\u2019s too early to say.) We have data to show that we are cutting off at least 10% of the attempts before they reach the submission page. It\u2019s a trick we don\u2019t expect to last, but at least provides us with some amusement and more time.\nDo we have a solution?\nNo, but we do have an idea that will take some time to implement and we\u2019re happy enough being able to see at least one step on the path ahead. That first step is resembles a spam filter, but it\u2019s not exactly the same. That should help us prioritize incoming submissions and avoid having to adopt some of the solutions that would have disproportionately impacted new and international writers. This will create extra work that none of us want, but it beats some of the more draconian alternatives. Hopefully this can hold until we can see the next step. Continued growth could overwhelm this model too.\nAnd because, inevitably, there is someone in the crowd who is blinded by the tech and screaming \u201cjudge it for the quality\u201d \u2026 No, that would be a waste of time. For starters, those stories are absolutely terrible right now. Sure, it might get better, but maybe you should go read this excellent article by Ted Chiang before you romanticize it too much. There\u2019s also the matter of rights, specifically a lack of clear ownership of these works. I simply can\u2019t sign a contract without those. Or perhaps I\u2019m just angry and lashing out over these companies gleefully using the copyrighted works of others as part of their training. (Before you even start the \u201cbut that\u2019s how humans learn\u201d argument, I suggest you find out how humans really learn first.)\nThe fact of the matter is that we have rules. Every publication has rules. Our rules say we don\u2019t want generated content. They also say that we don\u2019t want horror. If someone submits horror, you wouldn\u2019t have a problem with me completely ignoring them, so what\u2019s the problem here? I\u2019m sure you have house rules too. Like\u2026 don\u2019t throw the silverware in the garbage. How would you feel if someone did it anyway? What if half of your visitors did it? Wouldn\u2019t you complain? Take action to keep it from happening?\nUse these tools if you like. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t. Just don\u2019t do it in my house.\n\nPrevious\nAmazon Subscriptions\n\nSearch\n\nConnect\n\nFacebook (Clarkesworld)\nFacebook (Neil)\nInstagram\nMailing List\nMastodon\nPost\nTwitter\n\nSupport\n\nClarkesworld Citizens\nPatreon\nSubscribe to Clarkesworld\n\nPowered by WordPress & Theme by Anders Nor\u00e9n\n\nHacker News\n\n Hacker News\n\n          Sorry, we're not able to serve your requests this quickly.\n        \n\nreload\n\n",

Can you trust yourself?\n\n        I've recently noticed a trend among some agile thought leaders. They talk about trust and gatekeeping. It goes something like this:\n    \n\n            Why put up barriers to prevent people from committing code? Don't you trust your colleagues?\n        \n\n            Gated check-ins, pull requests, reviews are a sign of a dysfunctional organisation.\n        \n\n        I'm deliberately paraphrasing. While I could cite multiple examples, I wish to engage with the idea rather than the people who propose it. Thus, I apologise for the seeming use of weasel words in the above paragraph, but my agenda is the opposite of appealing to anonymous authority.\n    \n\n        If someone asks me: \"Don't you trust your colleagues?\", my answer is:\n    \n\n        No, I don't trust my colleagues, as I don't trust myself.\n    \n\n        Framing #\n\n        I don't trust myself to write defect-free code. I don't trust that I've always correctly understood the requirements. I don't trust that I've written the code in the best possible way. Why should I trust my colleagues to be superhumanly perfect?\n    \n\n        The trust framing is powerful because few people like to be labeled as mistrusting. When asked \"don't you trust your colleagues?\" you don't want to answer in the affirmative. You don't want to come across as suspicious or paranoid. You want to belong.\n    \n\nThe need to belong is fundamental to human nature. When asked if you trust your colleagues, saying \"no\" implicitly disassociates you from the group.\n    \n\n        Sometimes the trust framing goes one step further and labels processes such as code reviews or pull requests as gatekeeping. This is still the same framing, but now turns the group dynamics around. Now the question isn't whether you belong, but whether you're excluding others from the group. Most people (me included) want to be nice people, and excluding other people is bullying. Since you don't want to be a bully, you don't want to be a gatekeeper.\n    \n\n        Framing a discussion about software engineering as one of trust and belonging is powerful and seductive. You're inclined to accept arguments made from that position, and you may not discover the sleight of hand. It's subliminal.\n    \n\n        Most likely, it's such a fundamental and subconscious part of human psychology that the thought leaders who make the argument don't realise what they are doing. Many of them are professionals that I highly respect; people with more merit, experience, and education than I have. I don't think they're deliberately trying to put one over you.\n    \n\n        I do think, on the other hand, that this is an argument to be challenged.\n    \n\n        Two kinds of trust #\n\n        On the surface, the trust framing seems to be about belonging, or its opposite, exclusion. It implies that if you don't trust your co-workers, you suspect them of malign intent. Organisational dysfunction, it follows, is a Hobbesian state of nature where everyone is out for themselves: Expect your colleague to be a back-stabbing liar out to get you.\n    \n\n        Indeed, the word trust implies that, too, but that's usually not the reason to introduce guardrails and checks to a software engineering process.\n    \n\n        Rather, another fundamental human characteristic is fallibility. We make mistakes in all sorts of way, and we don't make them from malign intent. We make them because we're human.\n    \n\n        Do we trust our colleagues to make no mistakes? Do we trust that our colleagues have perfect knowledge of requirement, goals, architecture, coding standards, and so on? I don't, just as I don't trust myself to have those qualities.\n    \n\n        This interpretation of trust is, I believe, better aligned with software engineering. If we institute formal sign-offs, code reviews, and other guardrails, it's not that we suspect co-workers of ill intent. Rather, we're trying to prevent mistakes.\n    \n\n        Two wrongs... #\n\n        That's not to say that all guardrails are necessary all of the time. The thought leaders I so vaguely refer to will often present alternatives: Pair programming instead of pull requests. Indeed, that can be an efficient and confidence-inducing way to work, in certain contexts. I describe advantages as well as disadvantages in my book Code That Fits in Your Head.\n    \n\n        I've warned about the trust framing, but that doesn't mean that pull requests, code reviews, gated check-ins, or feature branches are always a good idea. Just because one argument is flawed it does't mean that the message is wrong. It could be correct for other reasons.\n    \n\n        I agree with the likes of Martin Fowler and Dave Farley that feature branching is a bad idea, and that you should adopt Continuous Delivery. Accelerate strongly suggests that.\n    \n\n        I also agree that pull requests and formal reviews with sign-offs, as they're usually practised, is at odds with even Continuous Integration. Again, be aware of common pitfalls in logic. Just because one way to do reviews is counter-productive, it doesn't follow that all reviews are bad.\n    \n\n        As I have outlined in another article, under the right circumstances, agile pull requests are possible. I've had good result with pull requests like that. Reviewing was everyone's job, and we integrated multiple times a day.\n    \n\n        Is that way to work always possible? Is it always the best way to work? No, of course not. Context matters. I've worked with another team where it was evident that that process had little chance of working. On the other hand, that team wasn't keen on pair programming either. Then what do you do?\n    \n\n        Mistakes were made #\n\n        I rarely have reason to believe that co-workers have malign intent. When we are working together towards a common goal, I trust that they have as much interest in reaching that goal as I have.\n    \n\n        Does that trust mean that everyone is free to do whatever they want? Of course not. Even with the best of intentions, we make mistakes, there are misunderstandings, or we have incomplete information.\n    \n\n        This is one among several reasons I practice test-driven development (TDD). Writing a test before implementation code catches many mistakes early in the process. In this context, the point is that I don't trust myself to be perfect.\n    \n\n        Even with TDD and the best of intentions, there are other reasons to look at other people's work.\n    \n\n        Last year, I did some freelance programming for a customer, and sometimes I would receive feedback that a function I'd included in a pull request already existed in the code base. I didn't have that knowledge, but the review caught it.\n    \n\n        Could we have caught that with pair or ensemble programming? Yes, that would work too. There's more than one way to make things work, and they tend to be context-dependent.\n    \n\n        If everyone on a team have the luxury of being able to work together, then pair or ensemble programming is an efficient way to coordinate work. Little extra process may be required, because everyone is already on the same page.\n    \n\n        If team members are less fortunate, or have different preferences, they may need to rely on the flexibility offered by asynchrony. This doesn't mean that you can't do Continuous Delivery, even with pull requests and code reviews, but the trade-offs are different.\n    \n\n        Conclusion #\n\n        There are many good reasons to be critical of code reviews, pull requests, and other processes that seem to slow things down. The lack of trust in co-workers is, however, not one of them.\n    \n\n        You can easily be swayed by that argument because it touches something deep in our psyche. We want to be trusted, and we want to trust our colleagues. We want to belong.\n    \n\n        The argument is visceral, but it misrepresents the motivation for process. We don't review code because we believe that all co-workers are really North Korean agents looking to sneak in security breaches if we look away.\n    \n\n        We look at each other's work because it's human to make mistakes. If we can't all be in the same office at the same time, fast but asynchronous reviews also work.\n    \n\n\t\tComments\n\t\n\nTyson Williams\n\n\t\t\t\tThis reminds me of Hanlon's razor.\n            \n\n                Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\n            \n\n2023-03-23 23:29 UTC\n\n\u2190 Previous\nArchive\nNext \u2192\n\nWish to comment?\nYou can add a comment to this post by sending me a pull request.
